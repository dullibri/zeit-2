SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 22; THE WELFARE BILL

LENGTH: 825 words

HEADLINE: Points of Agreement, and Disagreement, on the Wefare Bill

BYLINE: By MONICA BORKOWSKI

 BODY:
After vetoing two Republic versions of welfare overhaul legislation, President Clinton said yesterday that he would sign a compromise bill that would end the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the poor. The bill was completed this week by House and Senate conference committees; here are provisions on which legislators did not try to accommodate the Clinton Administration, and those on which they did.

PROVISIONS THAT WERE RETAINED DESPITE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OBJECTIONS...
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
FOOD STAMP SPENDING
Cuts projected spending on food stamps by roughly $24 billion over six years, with at least $3 billion more saved by denying food stamps to legal immigrants. Limits food stamps for unemployed workers not raising children.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
Had wanted the cuts scaled back and criticized the restriction on food stamps to the unemployed.

VOUCHERS
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
Prohibits states from using Federal block grants to provide vouchers or other noncash benefits to families who reach the five-year limit on cash assistance. However, states could finance them under a separate law that authorizes social services for poor.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
Had sought approval for block-grant spending, to help families buy diapers, clothing, medicine and school supplies for children.

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
IMMIGRANTS
Future legal immigrants who have not become citizens would be ineligible for most Federal welfare benefits and social services during their first five years in the U.S. Supplemental Security income and food stamps would end for non-citizens now receiving benefits.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
Wanted these cuts scaled back.

...AND PROVISIONS THAT WERE CHANGED

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
FOOD STAMP ALLOCATION
Dropped a provision that would have allowed state to receive their food stamp money as a lump sum and let them redesign the food stamp program by setting their own eligibility criteria and benefit levels.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
FOOD STAMP ALLOCATION
Managed to preserve the Federal guarantee of food stamps for poor people, with uniform national standards.

CONFERENCE COMMITTE
CHILD CARE
Increased the amount available to provide day care for the children of welfare recipients to $14 billion over six years.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
CHILD CARE
Succeeded in strengthening provisions for child care.

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
MEDICAID
States must provide Medicaid for anyone who qualifies under current law. States must provide Medicaid coverage for one year for families that lose eligibility because of new standards. Allows states to provide Medicaid for legal immigrants already in the U.S.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
MEDICAID
Managed to preserve Federal guarantee of health coverage under Medicaid.

OTHER MAJOR PROVISIONS
* The Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children would end. Each state would receive a lump sum to run its own welfare and work programs.
*The head of every family on welfare would have to work within two years, or the family would lose benefits. After receiving welfare for two months, adults would perform community service unless they had found jobs. States could choose not to have a requirement.
*Lifetime welfare benefits would be limited to five years. (States could set stricter limits.) Hardship exemptions would be availabel for 20 percent of families.
*States could provide payments to unmarried tenn-age parents only if a mother under 18 stays in school and lives with an adult.
*States could shift 30 percent of money in block grants to child care, social services and child protection (with a maximum of 10 percent going to social services).
*States would have to maintain their own spending on welfare at 75 percent of the 1994 level 0 or 80 percent if they failed to put enough welfare recipients to work.
*States could pay additional benefits to cover children born to women already on welfare, as many states now do.
*States that did not meet goals for employment of recipients would lose block grants. Penalty would rise from 5 percent in the first year 21 percent in ninth year.
*Stricter eligibility standards would exclude many disabled children in low-income families seeking Supplemental Security Income.
*States would generally have to deny cash assitance and food stamps to people convicted of drug felonies, unless they explitictly adopted different policies. In any event, pregnant women and adults in drug treatment would not be denied assistance.
*States would not penalize a woman on welfare who did not work because she could not find day care for child under 6 years old. (House and Senate had both protected women with children under 11.)
*A woman on welfare who refused to cooperate in identifying the father of her child would lose at least 25 percent of her benefits.
*Innovative state welfare programs could continue under Federal waivers granted before Oct. 1, 1996, even if they did not comply with all terms of the new welfare bill.

HEADLINE: In Selecting Federal Judges, Clinton Has Not Tried to Reverse Republicans

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton took office, many supporters were hoping he would quickly begin undoing a major legacy from 12 years of Republican control of the White House: the remarkably successful effort of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush to remake the nation's Federal courts by selecting judges known for their conservative views.
At the time of Mr. Clinton's inauguration, 15 percent of the nation's judicial slots were open, and fellow Democrats were in control of the Senate, which confirms or rejects nominees to the bench. It was a politically enviable situation if the President wanted to move the ideological pendulum in a new direction. 
 But it quickly became clear that Mr. Clinton had little interest in trying to do so.
He has appointed a record proportion of women and members of minorities to the Federal bench, and one of his two choices for the Supreme Court -- the first High Court appointments by a Democratic President in 26 years -- was a woman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
But what may be most notable about Mr. Clinton's judicial appointments may be reluctance to fill the courts with liberal judges.
"Our mission is not to counteract the conservative appointments of the Reagan and Bush years," said John Quinn, the White House counsel.
"The fact is that this President is a moderate, who brings mainstream, Main Street values to the job of selecting judges," Mr. Quinn said.
A recent statistical analysis by three scholars confirms the notion that the ideology of Mr. Clinton's appointees falls somewhere between the conservatives selected by Presidents Bush and Reagan and the liberals chosen by President Jimmy Carter.
Prof. Donald R. Songer of the University of South Carolina, an author of the study, said Mr. Clinton's judges were "decidedly less liberal than other modern Democratic Presidents'."
The ideological fingerprints of the Clinton judges, Professor Songer said, most resemble those of judges selected by President Gerald R. Ford.
Eleanor D. Acheson, an Associate Attorney General who has been involved in judicial selections throughout the Clinton Administration, said the President's priority had generally been to promote diversity while nominating highly qualified nominees. His achievement of those goals is generally borne out by statistics.
More than half of Mr. Clinton's 196 appointments so far have been women or members of minorities or both, almost twice the proportion among those chosen by President Bush. About 30 percent of the Clinton appointees have been women and 33 percent have been minorities.
Sixty-two percent of the Clinton nominees were rated by the American Bar Association as "well qualified," the highest grade available, while the figure was 52 percent for Mr. Bush's choices.
Still, Ms. Acheson acknowledges, "we know that many people expected us to do the mirror-image of what the Republicans had done, that is fill the courts with young liberal and progressive candidates in order to bring the courts back from their lunge to the right."
Nan Aron, the head of the Alliance for Justice, a coalition of liberal groups that monitors court appointments, said in an interview, "While the Administration deserves much credit for both the excellence and diversity of its judicial appointments, it is clearly disappointing that the President failed to address the issue of correcting the imbalance of the courts from the previous Republican Presidents."
In their study, Professor Songer and his colleagues categorized thousands of decisions by judges named not only by Mr. Clinton but also by his five predecessors, Presidents Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford and Richard M. Nixon.
The study, published in March, ranked decisions by judges appointed by all six Presidents in the categories of criminal justice, civil liberties and economic regulation. Professor Songer and his colleagues, Robert A. Carp of the University of Houston and Ronald Stidham of Appalachian State University, then tabulated the decisions and concluded that among district court judges, President Carter's appointees rendered liberal decisions in 53 percent of their cases. Mr. Clinton's judges were rated at 46 percent, followed by Mr. Ford's at 44 percent, Mr. Nixon's at 39 percent, Mr. Bush's at 37 percent and Mr. Reagan's at 36 percent.
In studying the appeals courts, the level below the Supreme Court, the study found that Carter judges rendered liberal rulings in 43.6 percent of all cases and Clinton appointees in 36.5 percent. Judges selected by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush were all rated at about 30 percent.
In their 12 years in the Presidency, the Republicans raided the nation's law schools so they could fill many of those appeals court slots with aggressively conservative scholars. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, has selected few judges from academia.
Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush frequently put forward nominees who were so aggressively conservative that confirmation fights resulted, some of which they lost (Robert H. Bork) and some of which they won (Clarence Thomas, though narrowly).
Mr. Clinton, in contrast, has been quick to drop judicial candidates if there is even a hint of controversy. Indeed, his two choices for the Supreme Court -- Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, both moderate liberals -- were chosen in part because they were unlikely to arouse Republican opposition.
"The issue of confirmability is an important one and certainly a legitimate one," Mr. Quinn said.
In the first two years of the Clinton Administration, the judicial selection process was run by a group of officials from the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office. But after the Republicans gained control of Congress, the process was taken over by Mr. Clinton's top political aides, including Harold M. Ickes, a deputy chief of staff, and George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser.
In the several months after that switch, the Administration's aversion to any kind of controversy reached new levels. The new White House team speedily dropped the proposed nominations of Judith McConnell and Samuel Paz to Federal District Court seats in California. Ms. McConnell, a veteran state court judge, had awarded custody of a 16-year-old boy to his father's male partner after his father's death because the mother had been declared unfit. Police organizations said they would oppose the nomination of Mr. Paz because he was a lawyer who specialized in bringing abuse suits against the police.
The most stunning change in course involved Peter Edelman, who with his wife, Marian Wright Edelman, is a longtime friend of the Clintons. Mr. Clinton first signaled that he would nominate Mr. Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown University, to an appeals court seat and then to a lesser seat on the district court. But after conservatives showed their opposition, Mr. Clinton abandoned the intention altogether.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, said that whoever was elected President this November would have an awesome opportunity to name new Federal judges. Many appeals and trial court judges are due to retire, and court watchers believe the next President may also have the opportunity to name two or three Supreme Court Justices.

HEADLINE: Design Breakup, Design Breakout

BYLINE: By PHOEBE HOBAN 

 BODY:
WHEN William Sofield and Thomas O'Brien, the team behind Aero Studios in SoHo, broke up their partnership this spring, everyone in the design industry wondered what would happen to downtown's hottest young firm. The answer is beginning to emerge. From SoHo to 57th Street, the former partners are giving new meaning to the dictum "Divide and conquer."
On Sunday, the SoHo Grand Hotel on West Broadway will welcome its first guests. The amber mirrors and velvet drapes had yet to materialize last week, but Mr. Sofield seemed relaxed touring the $6 million interior, his biggest post-Aero project. 
 "I wanted to celebrate two great periods of SoHo, the 1870's and the 1970's," he said, wending his way up a two-story staircase rising from the "mudroom" to the lobby, with its mercury-mirrored ceiling. This is not an entrance for the agoraphobic. Suspended by cables, its iron vertebrae flanked by a bronze-work balustrade, the staircase looks like a grand fire escape: the intersection of "Sunset Boulevard" and "Hester Street."
Four blocks north, in the conference room of Aero Studios on Spring Street, Mr. O'Brien is juggling three big projects: the new Emporio Armani flagship store on Madison Avenue -- "more like the old Hermes in Paris, kind of a fantasy thing" -- plus a glamorous new restaurant on East 46th Street and the DKNY Men's Store at Bloomingdale's, all to open in September. As Aero's sole proprietor, he is too busy to linger over a meal prepared by the pastry chef poached from Chanterelle.
For four years, Aero was the design world's best-kept secret. The team tweaked modernism, putting a knowing spin on classic design and offering a welcome alternative to the reigning frugality. Working out of their gallerylike downtown loft, the partners were equally deft at whipping up the perfect fete for Tina Brown, a funky artist's residence or a luxe penthouse for corporate entrepreneurs.
Now, with a half-dozen commercial projects under way, Mr. Sofield and Mr. O'Brien, both 35, will soon be familiar to a wider public. "It's too bad they split up, but I'm happy for their success," the hotelier Ian Schrager said. "They are both doing equally high-profile jobs. I think they are the two most exciting designers to come out of New York in a while."
The two former partners have not really spoken with each other since Mr. O'Brien bought out Mr. Sofield's shares of Aero in May. Mr. Sofield and his new company, Studio Sofield, are now ensconced in a beautifully appointed loft on East Fourth Street, above his new home.
"It was like two parties going on in one house, but they weren't kind of flowing together," Mr. O'Brien said. And Aero's exponentially increasing projects could no longer be efficiently -- or pleasantly -- handled under a single umbrella.
Mr. Sofield and Mr. O'Brien met in the 1980's while working on Ralph Lauren/Polo's Home Collections. They founded Aero Studios in 1992, at the height of the recession. Despite their inauspicious timing, they won a fistful of high-profile projects, designing Peter Morton's Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and realizing David Barton's fantasy of a sexy attic within a Madison Avenue gym and Ken Aretsky's dream for a cozy bistro, Butterfield 81.
Urbane and dapper, the team became poster boys for a burgeoning atelier movement. Their design studio combined showroom and antique shop, where clients could find Aero furnishings or mix and match to create the retro-modernist Aero look.
"Their design was fresh and modern and clean, zeroing right into the future," said Marian McEvoy, the editor in chief of Elle Decor. "They had such an aura of confidence that people couldn't resist them."
But Aero was not just a studio, said Alfredo Paredes, who worked with the pair as the vice president of creative services at Polo. "It was a destination, a happening," he said.
Mayer Rus, the editor of Interior Design, recalled: "It was a fun, fabulous, sexy idea, having this luxe studio cum salon, especially flying in the face of the recession, when things were so dour in the industry. But in the end it was just too hard to maintain that kind of esprit, especially when the personalities don't jive."
Their sharply different sensibilities were apparent. "Their offices said it all," observed James Danziger, the photography dealer whose gallery; Bellport, L.I., country home, and family apartment in Manhattan were decorated by Mr. O'Brien. "Thomas's office was retro-elegant -- he likes to give new life to old objects. And Bill's office was like a 60's play den."
Mr. Sofield, a tall man with stylishly cropped hair and bright blue eyes, studied architecture at Princeton University, then honed his yeoman Craftsman style while apprenticing at a woodworking shop in Manhattan. He said he "ate sawdust for five years" before working on Mr. Lauren's Polo Country Store in East Hampton, L.I., and the Laurens' homes and building the Home Collections' seasonal displays.
The slight, Byronesque Mr. O'Brien studied painting and photography at Cooper Union. He collaborated on the design and furnishing of Mr. Lauren's country homes in Montauk, L.I., and Bedford, N.Y., absorbing a great deal of the Lauren signature style. "Thomas takes things and recontextualizes them in time," said Howard Read, the director of the photography department at the Robert Miller Gallery.
Mr. Schrager compared the two designers' relationship to his 1980's partnership with Steve Rubell, counseling them: "Do everything together and always fight."
It was Mr. O'Brien who came up with the idea for the quilted leather lobby of Mr. Barton's gym on the Upper East Side, and Mr. Sofield who found subtle ways to incorporate musical references into his design for rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel (a chandelier in the shape of cymbals; guitar-patterned upholstery). A year ago, Aero opened a ground-floor retail shop that stocks an ever-changing array of offbeat items, from candles to 1950's chairs to a silver-plated garbage pail. Mr. O'Brien, a true Lauren disciple, was eager to diversify, even spinning off a fleet of satellite stores.
Mr. Sofield had other interests, including continuing teaching at Parsons School of Design. "I didn't want to be sort of Harry Winston, an Aero in New York, Paris, and Beverly Hills, just developing an anonymous product line," he said. "And I do have a different sense of priorities. I don't need another country home. Thomas is much more of a businessman than I am. I wanted to concentrate on creating a body of work."
The two partners competed head to head for at least one plum project, the consultancy for new Gucci stores in New York, Paris and Beverly Hills, Calif. (Mr. Sofield got it). But dividing Aero's turf proved relatively simple, since each partner was already working individually with specific clients.
Mr. Sofield says that this fall he plans to sell products used in the SoHo Grand Hotel: tiger oak chairs with pewter studs; a tiger oak desk with wire-glass top, inspired by an 1800's drafting table; brass gooseneck lamps with paper shades.
The furnishings are a Clairol version of American Arts and Crafts. "I wanted to refer to industrial lighting at the turn of the century," Mr. Sofield said. "I like the simplicity of the bare bulb, as opposed to a lamp dripping with crystals."
The reception desk with its tooled-leather surface, marooned in the lobby, looks like the last stop for lonely Brobdingnagians; in some ways the space resembles a vast humidor. It is easy to imagine guests lounging in the salon's chenille club chairs or checking each other out in the Grand Bar's recessed amber mirrors.
"I wanted the hotel to be 'The Age of Innocence' meets modern SoHo," its developer, Emanuel Stern, said. "Bill got it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS -- Advertising;
Chrysler wants Jeep owners to take to the hills so badly, the company is setting up a camp for them.

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
FOR those of you not spending enough time driving during your summer vacation, the Chrysler Corporation has the perfect solution: take your car to camp.
Well, not a car actually; it must be a Jeep. This month Chrysler expects to attract as many as 5,000 drivers -- and rock climbers and hikers -- to a two-day event in Colorado called Camp Jeep. 
 Camp Jeep is meant to be more than a couple of days in the dirt. And Chrysler hopes to do more than sell Jeeps. It is an attempt by the auto maker to become closer with its customers, using the technique known as relationship marketing.
"Within the whole industry there is a movement -- a strong trend -- to hands-on programs and one-to-one type programs," said Louis M. Bitonti, Jeep merchandising manager for Chrysler. Those programs try to link drivers and their vehicles with other activities they enjoy.
The goal is for a company to "become a sponsor of that life style without being obtrusive," he added.
Camp Jeep is an addition to the Jeep Jamborees that Chrysler holds around the country for hard-core off-roaders. In sponsoring such events, Chrysler is doing for the outdoors set what General Motors has done for a more mainstream group of car owners -- buyers of its Saturn cars. Two years ago Saturn held a reunion for its car owners at the company's plant in Tennessee.
Another company seeking the outdoors set is Volkswagen, which is selling a special edition of its Jetta sedan complete with a Trek mountain bike.
Neither Chrysler executives nor automotive analysts can quite prove that this strategy sells more cars, trucks or Jeeps. They say that it is too soon to tell how much customer loyalty is forged in events and other relationship marketing tactics and how it translates into sales.
But Thad H. Malesh, a senior automotive consultant at J. D. Power & Associates, said that manufacturers shouldn't worry too much about pushing ahead in relationship marketing because the strategy is likely to prove successful.
For auto makers, relationship marketing is as much an act of anxiety as an act of love. Competition has intensified for consumers as buyers face a bewildering choice of nameplates. "In the past, they just sold the vehicle and hoped you came back," Mr. Malesh said, adding that now the auto makers must work hard to insure they have repeat buyers.
Mr. Bitonti said the Camp Jeep approach was especially important now for Chrysler when so many of the company's competitors are coming up with their own versions of sport utility vehicles that might take a bite out of Jeep sales. "We've got a loyal owner base and we've got to keep them in the family," Mr. Bitonti said.
So Chrysler is betting that it will build loyalty to the vehicles at Camp Jeep, to be held Aug. 9 and 10 in the Rockies, 25 miles southeast of Vail, though no Jeeps will actually be sold there. Jeep owners will be able to take off-road driving lessons and go mountain biking, horseback riding or fishing, all while meeting other Jeep owners. Sheryl Crow will sing at an outdoor concert. Chrysler is also sending about 40 engineers, designers and product planners to help answer owners' questions. Participants will pay $195 a Jeep -- which Chrysler says will not begin to cover the event's costs.
The company is urging owners to "send your Jeep to camp" in magazine advertisements by Bozell Worldwide, a unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt in Southfield, Mich., that is Jeep's agency. The ads, which ran in life style magazines such as Men's Health, Mountain Bike, Bicycling, and Runner's World, show a red Jeep tackling a rocky mountain road with a backdrop of pine trees and a mountain lake.
Camp Jeep has won the admiration of Saturn, the car industry's relationship marketing king. Thomas J. Else, Saturn account director at Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, called the Camp Jeep's promotional materials "pretty darn good."
Saturn is perhaps best known for quickly creating a strong following for its cars. In 1994, it held a "Saturn homecoming" at its factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., and about 44,000 Saturn owners showed up for two days of festivities, including tours of the plant. Last fall, Saturn formed "The Car Club," a national group that helps new Saturn drivers hook up with local Saturn owner clubs, which sponsor various events. Next year, Saturn plans to offer daily factory tours.
Chrysler, for its part, is sending cultural anthropologists -- actual scientists, not just marketing consultants -- to camp. "They go to Camp Jeep and they just talk to people about how they feel about the company and how they feel about their vehicles," said Bruce E. Clayton, a partner at Bozell.
Chrysler tested the Camp Jeep concept last year, and the anthropologists learned that the event helped drivers bond with their vehicles. "People were experiencing these peak emotions just by driving their Jeeps," Mr. Clayton said.
Saturn and the other auto makers are trying to tap the genuine emotions of their drivers. "We're not trying to be gimmicky," Mr. Else said. "In a world of jaded things, it is a kind of back-to-basics approach to treating one another well" that so appeals to customers.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Have a Rally For a 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday for the second consecutive session, bolstered by a report that pointed to unexpected weakness in manufacturing.
The report, from the Chicago Purchasing Management Association, is a closely watched precursor to the National Association of Purchasing Management's survey, which is due out today. 
 The Chicago purchasing managers' index of activity for July fell to 51.2 from 53.3 in June. Many economists had been expecting the index to rise to as much as 55.4.
The report also included a weak labor component. That followed the Labor Department's report on Tuesday of a weaker-than-expected quarterly employment-cost index. Taken together, the two reports helped ease concerns that a buildup in wage pressures might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32 , to 8730/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.97 percent, from 7.03 percent on Tuesday -- its lowest level since July 23, when it was also 6.97 percent.
Bond prices were hurt early in the session after the dollar was battered in Asian and European currency trading. A weaker dollar makes American securities less attractive to foreign investors.
Trading was also restrained yesterday as the market awaited the release of a number of important statistics this week.
The Government issues a preliminary report today on the second-quarter gross domestic product and also reports June construction orders. Tomorrow, the Labor Department reports on employment in July.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., compared trading in the bond market this week to walking through a minefield, even though he said he expected the data to show a mixed view of the economy's strength.
"'Even with the mixed statistics," Mr. Guild said, "the fear of inflation remains."
"So far we've seen disappointing housing numbers; we've seen consumer confidence higher than expected, and today's surprisingly soft" purchasing managers' index, he said.
Mr. Guild said a number of economists were beginning to forecast slower economic expansion, putting their estimates of the growth rate at something less than 4 percent. But even that reduced level would still be a sharp rise from the first quarter.
Tomorrow's employment number will also be closely watched by the market. If the figures show an addition of 200,000 or more jobs to the nation's payrolls, the Federal Reserve might feel compelled to raise rates before the Aug. 20 meeting of the Fed's policy makers.
"I don't think they will," Mr. Guild said, adding, "A tightening, of course, would be very positive for the bond market; it would signal the Fed's steadfast resolve to stop inflation before it starts."
Louis Brien, a financial analyst with Finacor Vendome Inc., a Chicago brokerage firm, said of a rate increase by the Fed: "They will only be dragged, kicking and screaming, into such a decision. In other words, the data must show inflation is more than just a bad rumor. The data must be more, much more, than the average guesses that are being circulated. Barring any big surprises I don't see the Fed making such a move."
Yesterday also brought the Treasury's announcement of the size of next week's quarterly refunding. The Government plans to sell $19 billion of 3-year notes, $10 billion of 10-year notes with 9 years and 11 months left to maturity, and $10 billion of 30-year bonds.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the 3-year issue was offered at a price to yield 6.39 percent, the 10-year at 6.81 percent and the 30-year at 6.94 percent.

Concern Over U.S. Economy Sends Dollar Down Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday, hurt both by growing evidence of economic softness in the United States that would forestall higher interest rates and by fears that the dollar's strength has peaked.
The dollar was also hurt by a surprise cut in interest rates in Australia, bolstering demand for yen, and a statement by Switzerland's central bank that the Swiss franc was overvalued, increasing demand for marks. 
 "People are wondering how far it can go down," said Peter Wadkins, a director of Treasury sales at the New York office of the Standard Chartered Bank of Britain.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4721 marks, down from 1.4766 marks on Tuesday and the lowest level since March 15. The dollar traded at 106.77 yen, down from 107.91 yen and the lowest since May 17. The British pound fell to $1.5554 from $1.5565.
The dollar was initially hurt in overnight trading when the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered short-term rates in a surprise move to stimulate the economy. The move incited a selloff in Australian dollars for yen, which depressed the dollar.
Traders said the statement by Switzerland's national bank about an overpriced Swiss franc initially helped the dollar. But it was ultimately more beneficial to the mark, which has been strengthening since last Thursday, when the German central bank unexpectedly left interest rates unchanged.
Further hurting the dollar was a report of industrial weakness in the Midwest from a group of Chicago regional purchasing managers. The report is considered a harbinger to results of a closely followed national survey of purchasing managers to be released today.
The data suggested to currency traders that the Federal Reserve might refrain from raising interest rates at its Aug. 20 policy-making meeting. A rise in rates would tend to make dollar-denominated assets more valuable, and expectations of an increase had been built into the market.
"We have been assuming U.S. rates are going up and German rates are going down, but both sides have held steady," said Roger Chapin, foreign exchange manager at Bank One in Columbus Ohio. "So we've built in a lot of expectations that haven't been met. People are now rethinking that."

Doing Something About AIDS
Hernando Cortez had not been much involved in social action when he started Dancers Responding to AIDS, a fund-raising group, in 1991. But Mr. Cortez was impatient. "I was seeing a lot of the arts organizing," he said in a recent interview, "but nothing was going on in dance."
Denise Roberts, who helped Mr. Cortez shape Dancers Responding to AIDS, was similarly inexperienced. Close friends since college, the two danced with Paul Taylor and were out on the road for a good part of the year. Their lives were consumed with rehearsing, taking classes and performing. They knew very few dancers outside the company. But they forged ahead, learning as they went, and now they are about to embark on "Dances From the Heart," a series of fund-raising events so ambitious it might daunt a professional activist. 
 Solo performers and dancers from ballet, ballroom and modern-dance companies in Canada and the United States are to perform on Saturday at a private home on Fire Island, on Aug. 24 and 25 at a theater on Martha's Vineyard and on Oct. 5 at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y.
"Bequeathed," the culminating event, is to take place on Oct. 12 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Works by ballet and modern-dance choreographers who died of AIDS will be performed, in conjunction with an exhibition of the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt in Washington, by dancers from American Ballet Theater, Dance Theater of Harlem, the Joffrey Ballet, the New York City Ballet, the Taylor company and the Washington Ballet.
The earliest meetings were held in Mr. Cortez's apartment in Chelsea and in the Taylor studios. Sheldon Soffer, the dance manager, donated the use of his postal meter. Today the group is an adjunct of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, with headquarters in the theater district and an administrative head, Matthew Bruffee, provided by the parent organization. Money is raised through events, audience appeals and the sale of such merchandise as posters, T-shirts and cards with art by leading American choreographers. One of the giddiest events was the selling of pirouettes, performed by ballerinas and a hulking male Feld dancer, for a dollar a turn at a recent Broadway flea market.
The proceeds go to replenishing a pool of money raised by Broadway Cares and distributed by the Actors Fund to dancers with AIDS. Services, arranged within a week of the initial application, include everything from help filling out forms to covering one unemployed dancer's living expenses in the final year. Social workers are also available to cut through institutional red tape. And there has been another, unexpected benefit.
Dancers in companies ranging from the most established ballet troupes to the wildest downtown experimental groups have gotten to know each other for the first time doing volunteer work together for Dancers Respond. Ms. Roberts laughed, recalling how star-struck she had been at first, stuffing envelopes at the same table with ballerinas like Judith Fugate and Virginia Johnson. "This was a personal thing for Hernando and me, because we've lost so many friends," Ms. Roberts said. "But this is also about the dance community coming together."

 
 
A Director for the Danes
 One of the most pleasurable sources of dance gossip over the last year has been speculation about whether Peter Martins would jump ship at the New York City Ballet and head to Copenhagen and the Royal Danish Ballet, where he first danced.
The venerable Danish company has been without a long-term leader since Frank Andersen moved to the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1994. Peter Schaufuss lasted a year, and Johnny Eliasen, a company dancer, took over as acting director.
Speculation ended last week with the appointment of Maina Gielgud, director of the Australian Ballet for 14 years. Ms. Gielgud becomes the Danish director on March 1, after seven months of consultation with Mr. Eliasen. Her contract runs for three years.
Ms. Gielgud, who is 51 and the niece of Sir John Gielgud, is English and was a principal dancer with Maurice Bejart and a variety of French, English and German ballet companies before her Australian post. She is the first woman to direct the Danish troupe and the first foreigner in 180 years. Ms. Gielgud has not danced or staged the ballets of August Bournonville, the 19th-century choreographer whose work helped shape the Danish style. She will have two deputy directors from the company, however, one of them Mr. Eliasen and the other Benedikte Paaske, and Dinna Bjorn, a beloved Bournonville dancer who now directs the Norwegian National Ballet, will serve as a consultant.

 
 
A City Ballet Shuffle
 At City Ballet, Mr. Martins has announced the creation of two posts as part of an administrative restructuring. Christopher Ramsey, who joined the company last year as senior marketing director after a 14-year career with MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, has been appointed director of external affairs. Effective immediately, the appointment makes Mr. Ramsey responsible for development, marketing and communications, as well as education programs.
Mr. Martins also announced the appointment of Patricia Avedon Turk, general manager of City Ballet since 1989, as director of internal affairs in charge of production, finance and labor relations.

 
 
Nina Watt Takes a New Path
 Nina Watt, a leading member of the Jose Limon company and one of the most eloquent performers of her time, embarks on a new venture with performances today and tomorrow at the Limon Dance Studio on Broadway. In a first shared program with Alfredo Pino of the Coreoarte Dance Company of Caracas, Venezuela, Ms. Watt will perform "pieces that I've loved performing" and "works that I've loved watching."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Company to Run 2 New York Nuclear Plants

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The New York State Power Authority, seeking major improvements at the nuclear plants it operates in Westchester County and on the shore of Lake Ontario, said yesterday that it planned to hire a New Orleans company to manage the plants.
Under a preliminary agreement, power authority officials said the Entergy Corporation, which has won the nuclear industry's praise for its management of five plants in the South, would take over the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba under a five-year contract. 
 Officials said details of the management contract, including how much Entergy would be paid and how many of the power authority's workers would be cut, remained to be determined, pending an analysis by Entergy of the operations at the two plants. The plan requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
At a news conference, senior executives of the power authority said the private management proposal, untested anywhere else, was necessary because of both the poor performance at Fitzpatrick and Indian Point 3, and the heightened demands expected with deregulation of the electrical utility industry.
"This alliance will help to create and save jobs in New York State by lowering the cost of electricity," said C. D. Rappleyea, the power authority's chairman.
But analysts responded to the plan yesterday with mixed reviews, saying it was a step toward resuscitating two nuclear plants that rank among the country's worst, as measured by safety and efficiency, but a step that may not be go far enough.
The most troubled of the plants is Indian Point 3, which was included in June by Federal regulators on a "watch list" of the nation's worst nuclear plants. That came less than three months after the plant reopened after a 29-month overhaul, and prompted calls by citizen groups that it be closed.
Although Fitzpatrick has performed better during the last two years, it too was included on the Federal Government's list of problem plants and taken out of service in 1992 and 1993.
On Wall Street, Michael Worms, a utility industry analyst for CS First Boston, said the management agreement with Entergy "looks like a good fit all around." Citing the company's strong track record at nuclear plants in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, he said, "There is no reason to assume that they are not up to the job" of turning around the New York State plants.
But others said the New York power agency may simply be postponing the inevitable closing of plants that cannot compete with less costly, non-nuclear electrical power production.
"Even if major improvements are made at these two plants, they probably can't compete," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the National Resources Defense Council.
The plan provoked protests from some who have been advocating for years that the Indian Point 3 plant, 35 miles north of New York City, be closed.
"How many times do you have to see that a plant is a failure before you stop pumping in public subsidies?" asked Richard Brodsky, a Democratic State Assemblyman from Westchester County and chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Environmental Conservation.
Although New York State legislators hold no direct oversight over the power authority, he said he would call for a legislative hearing to try to find ways of blocking the contract with Entergy.
Senior executives of the power authority acknowledged yesterday that Entergy will face challenges in making improvements at the two plants, particularly because of moves toward deregulation within the electrical utility industry that have already begun to realign customers and their power suppliers.
In New York State, which has been a leader in utility industry deregulation, the state's public service commission ruled in May that electrical customers must be given complete choice over whom they buy their power from by early 1998.
That means customers can select from utilities across the state or elsewhere in the country. Although the state power authority's two nuclear plants have contracts to sell all their power to New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and other government entities, as well as businesses receiving state power subsidies, they could soon be underbid by other utilities and lose business as industry deregulation takes hold.
"Being average won't be good enough in the new world of competition," said Robert G. Shoenberger, president of the New York Power Authority.

Letting Social Security dabble in the stock market.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LOOKING for a painless way to cut the gap between what the baby boomers have been promised from Social Security and current revenue projections? Shift a big chunk of the system's trust fund to common stocks, which have enjoyed four times the return of Treasury bonds since the 1920's.
This proposal, championed by Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security commissioner, is being offered as an alternative to the supposedly more radical departures, namely privatization. And when the Social Security advisory panel delivers it -- probably after the Presidential election -- Mr. Ball's idea is likely to get a cordial reception from politicians loath to raise payroll taxes or make the deep cuts in benefits. 
 But investing in stocks is a radical idea, too, suggests Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and consultant to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association for the investment industry. At best, it constitutes socially redeeming sleight of hand that shifts risk to future taxpayers and pensioners. At worst, it is an invitation to meddle in the world's most efficient capital market. "This would push Social Security deep into unexplored territory of public finance," Mr. White said.
Social Security revenue not needed to cover current pension checks goes into a trust fund credited with interest at Treasury bond rates. But as every sophisticated investor knows, equities have proved to be a much better deal than bonds over the long haul. The real return to common stocks over the last 70 years has exceeded 7 percent, while Treasury bonds have averaged less than 2 percent.
So why should baby boomers be deprived of the gain? Why, indeed: Mr. Ball, along with four other members of the 13-member advisory panel proposes to shovel $800 billion of the roughly $2 trillion trust fund surplus projected between 2000 and 2015 into stocks. Quadrupling the estimated return on this portion of the surplus would relieve the pressure to cut benefits or raise taxes to keep Social Security going.
But Joseph Quinn, an economist at Boston College, wonders whether changes in economic behavior would mirror the accounting shuffle. The point of reform, he suggests, is either to increase national savings to pay for the boomers' retirement or to cut their claims on future national income. And forcing the Treasury to find other buyers for $800 billion in bonds to finance Government deficits would be self-defeating since no one would be induced to save more or consume less.
On the other hand, if Congress cut the deficit when trust fund surpluses were unavailable to paper it over, national savings probably would rise. Were Congress so moved, though, it would not need Mr. Ball to pull up its fiscal socks.
Not so fast. If an extra $800 billion went into private investments with four times the return of Treasuries, wouldn't the economy grow more rapidly and add to the nation's capacity to cover the cost of the boomers' retirement?
No one is quite sure where the historical "equity premium" -- the extra return on common stock that apparently reflects much more than the amount needed to compensate investors for added risk -- comes from, suggests Stephen Zeldes, an economist at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. "If we could be sure that the premium would be sustained -- a big if -- there would be no need to use Social Security's funding problems to justify the switch," he said. It would pay simply to sell more Government bonds and invest the proceeds in the stock market.
Mr. White raises a different issue. Presumably the Government would be a passive investor, buying stocks the way index mutual funds do. But would Uncle Sam limit purchases to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index when thousands of other stocks beckoned? Would it stop at traded stocks, when millions of small businesses need capital? And what about social considerations? Would Washington invest in tobacco, or in companies that run sweatshops in Guatemala? "Passive investing is tougher than its sounds," Mr. White said.
One need not look far to understand the origins of the Ball plan. Like many Americans -- probably a majority -- Mr. Ball wants to keep a 60-year-old system on its tried-and-true path, using collective resources to provide funds for generous public pensions for all. From this perspective, circuitous means of replenishing the trust fund are justified if the public will not stand for straightforward ones like tax increases.
But simply assuming the higher returns of stocks save the day raises the political ante. If Americans don't save more as a consequence or if economic growth does not exceed soberer expectations, the cuts needed to fix Social Security a decade or two down the road will be far greater than they are today. In short, what Americans choose not to know now could hurt later on.

HEADLINE: Awash in Chic, Embattled Hotel Hopes to Fit In

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
EMANUEL STERN understands perfectly the sociological process that has made possible his dream of building the first hotel in SoHo in a century.
"Artists constantly stake out underutilized real estate on the fringes, and by doing so are a cultural vanguard," he said. "They come in and make it attractive -- and then the blue suits come in." 
 Mr. Stern, 33, is enough the wry post-modern hotelier to acknowledge that, as the developer of the SoHo Grand Hotel, which is to open on Sunday at 310 West Broadway, between Grand and Canal Streets, he himself is a blue suit. In the eyes of many neighbors, he understands, he is a Visigoth from New Jersey, the latest despoiler of an artsy Eden that has become choked with camcorder-wielding tourists.
The construction of the 15-story hotel in a neighborhood of mostly five- and six-story buildings inspired more than the usual community opposition, including lawsuits, the wrath of the local City Councilwoman and a protest march at last year's groundbreaking.
But Mr. Stern, the son of Leonard Stern of Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns The Village Voice and millions of square feet of real estate in the Jersey Meadowlands, insists he is a different kind of blue suit.
Rather than build a cookie-cutter hotel and turn it over to a chain like Ramada, he has worked to create a stylish, affordable hotel in the mold of midtown's Royalton or Paramount, complete with a restaurant that will play techno chill-out music and an interior that reflects the famous cast-iron architecture of the neighborhood.
SoHo's industrial past is evoked at the entrance by a metal staircase embedded with bottle glass of the kind once used to light workshops below street level. In the guest rooms, desks are inspired by drafting tables and night tables resemble sculptors' stands. Even the mini-bar munchies have been chosen to match the sensibilities of a certain anticipated guest: Terra Chips, nonfat popcorn and, for those bleary downtown mornings-after, a vitamin pack.
The hotel interior is the work of William Sofield, a former partner of Aero Studios, whose previous projects included a David Barton gym and a Giorgio Armani store.
Mr. Stern seems to be counting on a chic atmosphere to distract guests from the eyesore of a parking lot across West Broadway and the smog of Canal Street, in one of SoHo's least charming enclaves. The seeds of the present hotel were in an earlier design for a youth hostel, and some might say that it shows. The red-brick building, designed by David Helpern, resembles a New York University dormitory.
Technically, the hotel is just outside the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District, which is why the developer was able to build such a big structure, with 367 rooms.
"This will act as a magnet to extend SoHo down to its natural boundary," Mr. Stern said. "It's just a matter of time before stores start to develop around here."
That is precisely what some area residents fear. SoHo artists, many of whom acquired their lofts years ago for a song, are adamantly opposed to development that makes the streets noisier, more crowded and, heaven forbid, reminiscent of a mall.
The American Fine Arts Company, which is within view of the hotel, has mounted a show called "SoHo So Long," for which the gallery's window is soaped over and adorned with a parody sign announcing the coming of an Old Navy store.
"I see the hotel as another advance down the slippery slope of change in character for the neighborhood," said Kathryn E. Freed, the City Council member for SoHo. She conjures up a vision of a SoHo Apocalypse in which the neighborhood is overrun by shops peddling T-shirts and Elvis on velvet.
But others welcome the hotel. Jeffrey Deitch, an art dealer, bought an old lumberyard facing the hotel in June and plans to open an exhibition space.
"For me the opportunity to have a gallery right opposite this hotel, where I think many people from the art world, fashion world and publishing are going to stay, is a tremendous advantage, and I'm just delighted," Mr. Deitch said. "There is no good hotel downtown that has any style. Basically, the art world goes to the Gramercy Park Hotel, which is quite rundown."
Many of the scourges predicted by hotel opponents seem improbable. A year ago, there was speculation that the hotel would be used by prostitutes from Canal Street and by bus tours booked by Chinatown travel agents.
It seems unlikely that either clientele would feel at home with the "dog bar" in a 17th-century French stone basin at the front door, or in the minimalist Canal House restaurant, whose chef, David Shack, was formerly at the Sign of the Dove.
Mr. Stern said he has already signed contracts for 30,000 room nights with corporate clients from Wall Street, fashion and Hollywood. "I've gone after modeling, fashion and entertainment," he said. "I want to have the right mix."
With such talk, he sounds as much like a club promoter as a developer. Some wonder if his entry into the world of boutique hotels was planned as a way to raise his social profile, to vault into the ranks of celebrity-schmoozing hoteliers like Ian Schrager, owner of the Royalton, and Andre Balazs, who for years has been trying to open a rival SoHo hotel.
Until now, Mr. Stern has kept a low profile compared with his well-known father, whose status as a bon vivant and whose second marriage to a former model earned him a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in 1990.
But the younger Mr. Stern demurs. "I'm not looking to get on a different list of invitations," he said. "I'm not a nightclub operator."
As he sat in an unfinished hotel office on Saturday, dressed in Levis and a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up, it was easy to believe his claim that he is not a "go-go hotelier." He has an all-around good-guy manner that seems more casual Upper West Sider than attitudinous downtowner. Mr. Stern is keeping his office in Secaucus, N.J., at the headquarters of Hartz Mountain Industries, named for its line of pet-care products, where he is executive vice president.
He lives in a townhouse near Riverside Park with his wife, Elizabeth, a former teacher at a Hebrew day school who now runs a private art program for children in the couple's basement. Before joining Hartzfive years ago, Mr. Stern worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, earned a master's degree in public administration and helped a family philanthropy, Houses for the Homeless, to open shelters in the Bronx and Queens.
His father, whom he refers to as "Leonard," had always made it clear that he hoped his children -- Emanuel, Edward and Andrea -- would work in the family business, which was founded by his own father, Max Stern, an immigrant who came to America in 1926 with 2,100 canaries from the Harz Mountains of Germany and opened a pet store.
"I knew it was too much of an opportunity not to try," Emanuel Stern said of the family business. (His brother, once a reporter at the satiric Spy magazine, now helps run the pet-care division, and his sister works on the business side of The Village Voice.)
Hartz bought the SoHo land in 1988 for $7 million with the intention of building a luxury suites-only hotel. But the plan fell victim to the recession, and the property was put up for sale. There were no takers. The company mulled putting a supermarket on the site, a movie complex, even a youth hostel.
Inside, the chic design seduces the eye into believing the guest rooms are more luxurious than they are, obscuring the fact that they are too small for a closet and bureau and that guests must make do with an armoire.
In essence, that is the Grand Hotel's grand strategy -- to sell the aura of a deluxe hotel for a moderate price. With rooms averaging $165 a night, the hotel does not include such amenities as 24-hour room service and business meeting rooms.
The hotel, which was built for a modest $45 million, is opening in one of the healthiest lodging markets in years, and its commercial prospects are good, said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting in New York, which did a feasability study for the project.
Driven by tourists and business travelers, the citywide occupancy rate rose to 86 percent in May, from 81 percent a year earlier, according to PKF. Average room rates for the five months ending in May rose 10 percent from a year earlier, to $162 a night, the highest ever.
Many of Mr. Stern's erstwhile opponents seem resigned to the hotel and much less passionate about their concerns.
Pierre Clerk, a painter and sculptor who is president of the SoHo Community Council, said, "I protested against it, but now that the hotel is there, and Mr. Stern is there, we're reaching out to him because he could be very helpful."
Now that the blue suit has himself become a stakeholder in SoHo, neighbors seem to be counting on his clout to help raise the drawbridge against further interlopers.

HEADLINE: A Sad Day for Poor Children

 BODY:
President Clinton's defense at yesterday's press conference of his decision to sign an atrocious welfare bill exaggerated its tiny virtues and ignored some large faults. His disappointing excuse was that the flawed bill was the last realistic chance to fulfill his campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." Last chance? This conservative Congress longs to send him as many bills as it takes to cut welfare.
The President said the bill would replace welfare checks with paychecks. That is simply wrong. The bill says it would require states to put at least 50 percent of welfare parents to work within two years of going on welfare. But the actual language exempts 43 states, covering about 95 percent of welfare recipients, from the work requirements because they already have federally approved welfare reform plans. Also, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is $12 billion short of what would be needed to hit its welfare-to-work targets. The President, in other words, is signing a bill that does not require work, nor spend enough to create work. 
 This is not reform, it is punishment. The Administration's staff estimates that such provisions will throw a million more children into poverty. The President himself criticized the harsh cut in food stamps for families saddled with excessive energy and housing bills. Even worse, the bill would prevent unemployed workers without minor children from collecting food stamps for more than three months in any three-year period -- even if they work steadily, get laid off and can find no new job.
There are also extreme cuts in benefits for disabled children and impoverished legal immigrants. Mr. Clinton promised to work for reversal of some of these missteps after he signs the bill, but there is little chance that this Congress will raise taxes or cut other popular entitlement programs for the sake of poor immigrants.
The effect on some cities will be devastating, especially those with large immigrant populations. New York estimates that by cutting off parents on welfare for more than five years even if they have no job prospects, by providing too little money for job slots and by cutting off immigrants, the measure will impose hundreds of millions of dollars of costs each year on a city that can barely afford the services it currently provides. Besides, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani points out, the city has already aggressively pruned welfare rolls and put recipients to work under existing law.
As Mr. Clinton noted, the bill has positive features. It would provide more money to support day care for welfare recipients, preserve Medicaid for people who qualify for welfare under current law and better enforce court orders that require absent parents to support their children. There is also nothing inherently wrong with a bill that wants states to take more control over welfare-to-work programs and impose time limits on cash assistance. But most of these features are possible under current law. The Administration has already granted 41 states the right to design their own welfare programs.
This bill provides no useful follow-up. It is not fair to cut parents off welfare unless they are provided an opportunity to work. It is not humane to remove a Federal guarantee of welfare aid and create the leeway for additional punitive cuts at the state level. A bill that creates child poverty is not an acceptable way to end welfare as we know it.

HEADLINE: Turmoil in Indonesia

 BODY:
Indonesia's long-suppressed political life erupted into violence in Jakarta last weekend. After Indonesian police forcibly evicted supporters of an embattled but peaceable opposition leader from her party's headquarters, anti-government rioters surged through downtown streets, clashing with police and soldiers and burning government offices and banks.
This explosive outburst could signal a serious challenge to the 30-year-long rule of Indonesia's leader, Suharto. The country's suppressed opposition forces can mount no more than a modest political challenge to the military-backed regime at this point. But the Government's reflexive response to the rioting -- including a call for the army to shoot rioters on sight -- risks igniting a prolonged period of instability. 
 General Suharto's extended rule has brought order and economic progress at the expense of most political freedoms. But the aging President now puts the more positive elements of that legacy at risk by refusing to prepare the way for a democratically chosen successor. The Clinton Administration, which reasonably argues that prosperity helps smooth the path to political democracy, now has a responsibility to support the efforts of Indonesia's democrats.
Indonesia's remarkable, though unevenly shared, economic advance has swelled its urban population with a vastly expanded middle and working class. These new urbanites have sought to gain greater control over their lives by setting up an extensive network of independent organizations, including magazines, labor unions and human rights and environmental groups.
Indonesians have also become impatient with a closed political system that for years allowed only two tame opposition parties. Both parties traditionally united with the Government party to back General Suharto as the only permitted presidential candidate.
But this arrangement was openly challenged this year by Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding President, Sukarno. Ms. Megawati, leader of one of the legal opposition parties, appeared to be preparing for a possible presidential race in 1998. But earlier this summer the Government engineered her ouster. The eviction of Ms. Megawati's supporters from party headquarters set off last Saturday's violence.
Ms. Megawati has deplored the violence, and called on her supporters to rally peacefully behind her efforts to challenge her ouster in the courts. But the Government now openly talks about bringing her in for questioning and has already arrested the country's most important union leader, Muchtar Pakpahan.
It also blames the rioting on Indonesia's no-longer-significant Communist Party, reviving memories of the regime's earliest days. The Government oversaw the massacre of some 500,000 alleged Communists after crushing what it contended was an attempted Communist coup.
Those days are long over. The Suharto regime must now choose between its own perpetuation in power and an orderly political transition. Only the latter can assure stability and continued economic growth. The United States, which has been quicker to see Indonesia as an emerging market than an emerging democracy, must use its considerable influence to discourage reflexive repression and encourage timely change.

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE BILL: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON TO SIGN WELFARE BILL THAT ENDS U.S. AID GUARANTEE AND GIVES STATES BROAD POWER

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
After hours of suspense and soul-searching, President Clinton said today that he would sign a bill that reverses six decades of social welfare policy and touches the lives of tens of millions of people.
The bill emerging from Congress would affect most of the 12.8 million people on welfare and almost all of the 25.6 million people who receive food stamps. It would alter the benefits paid to more than one-fifth of the families in America with children. And it is expected to save $55 billion over six years as it dismantles a welfare program created by Democrats in the New Deal. 
 After President Clinton endorsed the bill, the House promptly approved it by a vote of 328 to 101.
Democrats had waited anxiously for the President to announce his decision, perhaps the most important he has made on any domestic issue. The President's stance emboldened many Democrats to cross over and vote yes.
Mr. Clinton said the measure was "significantly better" than two similar bills that he vetoed in the last eight months. But at a news conference he conceded that his advisers had been deeply divided over whether he should sign it.
House Democrats were divided as well, with 98 voting for it and 98 opposing it. Despite the President's endorsement of the bill, the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the Democratic whip, David E. Bonior of Michigan, voted against the measure.
With today's action, Mr. Clinton fortifies his credentials as a "new Democrat" and strengthens his political position going into this fall's Presidential election. But he disappointed many Democratic Party loyalists, civil rights advocates, labor union leaders and religious organizations.
Announcing his decision, Mr. Clinton said: "I will sign this bill, first and foremost, because the current system is broken; second, because Congress has made many of the changes I sought, and third, because even though serious problems remain in the nonwelfare-reform provisions of the bill, this is the best chance we will have for a long, long time to complete the work of ending welfare as we know it, by moving people from welfare to work, demanding responsibility, and doing better by children."
The bill would eliminate the 61-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children, abolishing the program known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children. It would give states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money. It would establish a lifetime limit of five years for welfare payments to any family and would require most adults to work within two years of receiving aid.
Mr. Clinton said he would ask Congress later to modify some of the bill's provisions, including its cuts in food stamp benefits and its ban on most forms of public assistance and social services for legal immigrants who have not become citizens.
Mr. Clinton said that the food stamp cuts and the restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants had "nothing to do with welfare reform" and were simply intended to help balance the Federal budget. Republicans said that these provisions accounted for 75 percent of the $55 billion in savings projected under the bill in the next six years.
Mr. Clinton's likely opponent in this year's Presidential race, Bob Dole, commended Mr. Clinton for "finally climbing on board the Dole welfare reform proposal," but said the President had "stymied every attempt to pass meaningful welfare reform" until now. Mr. Dole has repeatedly denounced Mr. Clinton's earlier vetoes, saying they showed that he had abandoned his 1992 campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it."
Welfare has been a major issue in this year's Presidential campaign, and Republicans were ready to pounce on the President if he vetoed the new welfare bill.
Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said today, "Welfare reform would never have happened without the Republican Congress." Mr. Barbour asserted that the President had been forced to sign the bill "rather than risk his re-election."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who has studied welfare policy for decades and led opposition to the bill, said: "The President has made his decision. Let us hope that it is for the best." In an interview just before the President spoke, Mr. Moynihan said: "The Cabinet is against the bill. The pollsters are for it. This is a defining event in his Presidency."
Among the Democrats dismayed by Mr. Clinton's decision was Representative John Lewis of Georgia. Just before the House approved the bill, Mr. Lewis addressed the chamber in anguished tones. "Where is the compassion?" he asked. "Where is the sense of decency? Where is the heart of this Congress? This bill is mean. It is base. It is downright lowdown. What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose its soul?"
But Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, summarized the case for the bill this way: "People are not entitled to anything but opportunity. You can't be on welfare for generations."
Congressional Republicans gave Mr. Clinton several of the changes he had requested. They increased the money available to provide day care for the children of welfare recipients. They preserved the Federal guarantee of food stamps for poor people, with uniform national standards. They dropped a provision of the House bill that would have allowed states to redesign the food stamp program by setting their own eligibility criteria and benefit levels.
Republicans also granted Mr. Clinton's request to guarantee Medicaid coverage for people who are denied welfare because of strict new eligibility standards for cash assistance. People on welfare are now automatically entitled to Medicaid. Under the bill, states could set tougher standards for welfare, but would have to guarantee Medicaid for anyone who now qualifies. Congress also agreed to allow states to provide Medicaid for legal immigrants who are already in the United States and have not become citizens.
But Congressional Republicans rejected many of Mr. Clinton's requests. They retained the cuts in food stamps and in benefits for legal immigrants. They largely disregarded his request to let states use Federal welfare money for vouchers to provide diapers, clothing and other necessities for children whose parents lose welfare. On this point, the President claimed a victory because states could use money from other sources for vouchers, but Administration officials said the bill fell short of what they wanted. In addition, the Republicans rejected the President's request to soften stringent work requirements that could terminate food stamps for large numbers of unemployed workers.
The White House kept lawmakers in suspense as the President wrestled with the question of whether to sign the bill. Mr. Clinton announced his decision at 2:26 P.M. At 12:50 P.M., Mr. Bonior, the Democratic whip, said, "We are all waiting for the President's decision before we can go into action." Voting in the House began about 5 P.M.
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "The President was genuinely torn between his policy advisers and his political advisers." Several Cabinet officers lobbied for a veto; political advisers urged Mr. Clinton to sign the bill, to show he was in step with public opinion.
Mr. Clinton confirmed that "there was significant disagreement among my advisers about whether this bill should be signed or vetoed." One Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said tonight, "This is a sad day for the country, a sad day for poor people and a day that will come back to haunt Bill Clinton throughout history."
But Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group once headed by Mr. Clinton, praised the President's decision, saying he had redeemed the most prominent pledge of his 1992 campaign.
The welfare bill would abolish the program of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, which was created by the Social Security Act, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in August 1935.
In response to a question today, Mr. Clinton said he had no qualms about dismantling this cornerstone of the New Deal. "The nature of the poverty population is so different now that I am convinced we have got to be willing to experiment, to try to work to find ways to break the cycle of dependency," Mr. Clinton said.
Since Mr. Clinton took office, the number of people on welfare has declined by 1.3 million, partly because of improvements in the economy and partly because of efforts by state officials across the country to put welfare recipients to work.
While Republicans said they had forced Mr. Clinton to sign the welfare bill, he said he had forced them to improve it. "Not so very long ago," he said, "at the beginning of this very Congress, some wanted to put poor children in orphanages and take away all help from mothers simply because they were poor, young and unmarried."
The Senate is expected to approve the final bill on Thursday, clearing the measure for the President's signature.

HEADLINE: In Philadelphia, Tea and Empathy

BYLINE: By PAULA DEITZ 

 BODY:
WHAT is more ephemeral than a show house? Like playhouses, they present enticing possibilities to the curious who drift through them, offering the promise of a painless fresh start. After a few months, having inspired some and titillated many, they disappear forever.
But one such temporary structure, the Japanese house with a teahouse and garden that drew record crowds to the Museum of Modern Art in the warm months of 1954 and 1955, has gone on to have a real life of its own as a permanent cultural center in Philadelphia, in Fairmount Park, the swath of green that rambles for miles through the western part of the city. 
 The public goes not just to look: activities this month include a tea ceremony on Aug. 11 at 2 P.M., and a traditional "moonviewing" and Japanese dinner on Aug. 28.
To see the house today full of vitality, it is hard to believe that 42 years ago it arrived in New York from Japan for a "limited engagement," in 636 crates, like so many numbered Lincoln Logs. On a summer Sunday, as about 30 guests gathered to share in green tea and sweets, the stillness of the late afternoon was broken only by water splashing over artfully placed rocks in the Japanese-style pond. On a small island reached by an arched wooden bridge, a gnarled Scotch pine, almost horizontal, looked like a scene from an old scroll. A school of golden carp swarmed, as they do in temple ponds in Kyoto. In this dreamlike setting, Philadelphia seemed far away.
The Japanese house began life as part of a series of exhibition houses that were displayed intermittently in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1959, mainly to show off new technology or to offer novel esthetic experiences. The program was very popular with New Yorkers, and the decision to place the houses outside gave them a sense of reality. Dwarfed by the cityscape, their apparent miniaturization added to their appeal.
Of the four architects represented -- Marcel Breuer, Gregory Ain, Junzo Yoshimura and R. Buckminster Fuller -- it was Mr. Yoshimura's traditional Japanese house that drew the biggest crowds. Almost a thousand people a day walked across the tatamis in rice-paper slippers.
The earlier Breuer and Ain designs had demonstrated housing solutions for American suburban families that combined economy of space with elegance of form. The Ain house in particular featured sliding walls that made it possible to expand and contract its rooms. What became clear to Arthur Drexler, then the curator of architecture and design, was that the principles incorporated in these modern houses -- curtain walls and open interiors -- had been formulated by the Japanese 300 years earlier.
So for the third exhibition house, he selected Mr. Yoshimura, a Japanese architect. In 1941, working under Antonin Raymond, a Czech-American architect who had offices in Tokyo, Mr. Yoshimura was the project manager for a Japanese-style beach house (now owned by Ralph Lauren) in Montauk, L.I. Mr. Yoshimura later designed the Japan Society's building on East 47th Street, completed in 1971.
Mr. Drexler and Mr. Yoshimura traveled together throughout Japan to study traditional houses that had survived World War II, many of them part of temple compounds. Mr. Yoshimura then worked with craftsmen in Nagoya to devise a design that included a garden with a main house and teahouse connected by a wooden walkway. The house was constructed of lightweight cypress columns that supported a massive curved roof covered with layers of cypress bark. The interior spaces were made flexible by sliding panels, and exterior walls were made of either translucent white paper or thin unpainted wood.
The garden included a pond, a waterfall, a symbolic mountain representing the Buddhist image of paradise, and a contemplative sand garden featuring raked wavelike designs symbolizing water. Tansai Sano, who designed the garden, was descended from seven generations of gardeners at Ryoanji, the famous temple in Kyoto. He helped select rocks with sculptural qualities in the mountains surrounding Nagoya. Plantings of weeping cherry, Japanese maple, bamboo, ferns and mosses were selected by a consultant in the United States.
Following the opening of the house in June 1954, The New York Times Magazine commented on its "serenity in proximity to the blaring noises of 54th Street." The Syracuse Herald-Journal hailed the house as the "granddaddy of ranch style."
Concerned about the house's future after its second season, the museum entered negotiations with the Fairmount Park Commission, which oversees the 3,500-acre park along the Schuylkill in Philadelphia. It was reconstructed in the park in 1958.
In a sense, Fairmount Park has become an outdoor museum of historic houses, 11 in all, ranging from a 1740's Quaker farmhouse to an 1802 Georgian mansion, all separated from one another by large expanses of land.
The Japanese house was bestowed with a name -- Shofuso, or Pine Breeze Villa, taken from characters on a scroll that had adorned its main room. Because of the fragility of its materials, the house had to be extensively renewed in 1976, in a renovation paid for by the Japanese Government. In 1982, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society undertook the rejuvenation of the garden. Now, the Friends of the Japanese House and Garden are raising money to repair the cypress-bark roofs.
Over the decades, the house and grounds have become a place to celebrate Japanese culture. One of the guides, Gretchen Sturm, came to Pine Breeze Villa by way of lessons in martial arts. Dressed in pleated black hakama pants, she said, "As part of my training, I wanted to study the different Japanese arts."
The house, teahouse and garden have lost none of their magic. The spareness of the furnishings is offset by the richness of the wooden beams. The earth-floor kitchen displays its old storage chest; in the bathroom, a traditional wooden tub is invitingly placed just below a window, to take advantage of the view. A channel of water running under the house provides coolness in summer.
In the teahouse, a single scroll hangs near a meticulously executed flower arrangement. Its meditative message is contained in a single Japanese character, meaning "nothing." In the Zen tradition, this signifies "everything."
A paradox? No more so than the way a dream house takes on a real life.
 
Where and When
 
 PINE BREEZE VILLA is on the grounds of the Horticultural Center in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. Open in May through August, Tuesday through Sunday, 11 A.M. to 4 P.M., and in September and October, on Saturday and Sunday only, from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Information: (215) 878-5097.

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE BILL: THE RECIPIENTS;
People on Welfare, Too, Find a Lot to Criticize

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 31

 BODY:
The part about having to work after two years on the Federal welfare rolls does not faze Kristin Nichols.
"If I could get a job before the two years, I'd be off A.F.D.C. quicker than you can imagine," the 20-year-old woman said, speaking of the main cash benefits program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. 
 But like many of the people in Congress, Miss Nichols has a quarrel with the whole Federal welfare system -- just a different one.
Pregnant and penniless and back on the streets that have often been her home since she ran away from her parents in Pensacola, Fla., at 14, Miss Nichols said her problem would not be finding work, but finding work that might pay well enough to shield her and her unborn child from the vagaries of a harsh world.
"Nobody wants me, because I don't have a high school education," she said this afternoon, a few hours after President Clinton announced that he would sign a new law ending guarantees of Federal aid to the poor. "I don't know how I'm going to get that. People like me who want to make themselves better -- they're just going to cut us off anyway and send us back out there.
"Bill Clinton hasn't lived in this situation," said Miss Nichols, a soft-spoken woman who seemed too young for motherhood until bitterness began to harden her words. "He's sitting fat, running around the world in a big jet. He's never come down here and talked to us."
The notion of a need for drastic change in the Federal welfare system elicited no surprise today among the men and women slumped in the colored plastic chairs at San Francisco's main welfare office.
They did not use words like "dependency" and "underclass." But one after another, they told the same sort of story about having only one way to go in their lives, and no clear way to get there. They said they had heard nothing in the talk about overhauling welfare to make them think that their odds would now improve.
Jewell Bibbs, a 21-year-old single mother, suspected that the "work" that legislators were promising would end up being one more government myth about how, with enough effort and hope, things turn out for the best. Ms. Bibbs said she was a veteran of California's innovative welfare-to-work program, Greater Avenues for Independence.
"They made it sound so good," she said of her experience in the program. "They help you with child care. They help you with bus fare. But they tell you you can find a good job. And to them, a good job is any job. You can get one of them and you're still going to be poor."
Ms. Bibbs said she was scheduled to enroll at San Francisco State University on Aug. 19 to begin studies to become a nurse's aide. She was back at the Department of Human Services for the City and County of San Francisco for the third time in her young life, she said, because she had lost her latest job and needed some help in the meantime.
How each state will implement the new mandates that Mr. Clinton said he would approve remains to be seen; a central goal of the legislation is to give the states wider latitude in designing their own programs.
Aid recipients in states like California, which ranks fourth in the amount of benefits it provides to needy families after Alaska, Hawaii and Vermont, are expected to feel the pinch of tighter money less than others. But the legislation would not provide any specific money to the states to help people find or train themselves for better-paying jobs.
Inspired in part by the modest success of the California program in getting people off welfare rolls and into the work force, the new law is expected to continue the shift toward a strategy of getting welfare beneficiaries into "jobs first" and away from longer-term education and training programs.
To people waiting their turn in the plastic chairs, doing their best to hold down the children trying to squirm out of them, that would be one of the problems.
"People get stuck because they don't give you the resources," said Raquel Simian, 27, who said she was seeking A.F.D.C. benefits because she had come to the end of her contract as a technical support worker at a bank and was going to have to wait for weeks to begin receiving unemployment insurance.
"There are a lot of resources out there," she said. "But in this office they're never going to lead you to them. Nobody's teaching these people how to do Word Perfect or Power Point or just some basic thing to be a receptionist or a secretary."
Others, like Maria Jauriqui, 25, and her companion, Robert Herrera, 32, seemed to view the threatened aid cuts as merely one more bump in their bumpy road.
Mr. Herrera said that he had been earning about $250 a week as a security guard until last week, when an argument with his his landlord had left the couple and their two children living in their 1963 Dodge. He had stopped going to work, he said, because he was afraid to leave his wife and children alone there. Then, on Tuesday, the car was towed.
"If worse comes to worse, we can always go back to Fresno," Mr. Herrera said, meaning the place where their parents live and the one they had always tried to get away from. "Other people have it worse."
Miss Nichols took a little comfort in a fragile belief that maybe things could not get any worse.
She had once gotten by selling drugs and "other things," but said that had gotten "really old." Then her boyfriend had been jailed for a probation violation, and she had been kicked out of the hotel where they had lived.
She was determined to get her high school-equivalency degree, she said. By the time she turns 25, she was sure she would have a master's degree in something.
She would get what help she could, Miss Nichols said, and she would find a way to survive; she always had. But she wondered why, if politicians spent so much time worrying about welfare, they could not change the way it made people feel.
"I may be young, but politics is dirty -- I know that," she said. "America is set up for the middle-class people. The poor people, everyone looks down on a poor person, like they're on drugs or they have no place on this earth.
"You try to get some help and you're shunned," she said. "Trust me: I would not be in this place if I didn't have to be."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Padres Thirst for Power and Get Vaughn From Brewers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Cecil Fielder, the Yankees' newest high-priced star, was not the most prolific run producer traded last night before the major league trading deadline. The San Diego Padres, seeking a power boost for their pennant run, grabbed Greg Vaughn, one of the American League's primary power hitters this season, from the Milwaukee Brewers.
For Vaughn and a player to be named, the Padres gave the Brewers outfielder Marc Newfield and relief pitchers Ron Villone and Bryce Florie. The Padres acquired Newfield and Villone exactly one year ago from the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Andy Benes. 
 The Mariners, active again on the last day players could be traded without waivers, picked up their second left-hander in two days. Joining Jamie Moyer as new members of the Mariners' starting rotation will be Terry Mulholland, whom Seattle got from Philadelphia for a minor league shortstop, Desi Relaford.
The Texas Rangers, scrambling to stay ahead of the Mariners in the American League West, tried to bolster their relief corps with the addition of Mike Stanton, a left-hander, getting him from Boston for Mark Brandenburg, a rookie reliever, and Kerry Lacy, a minor league reliever.
The Los Angeles Dodgers, seeking someone to replace the cancer-stricken Brett Butler in center field and their leadoff spot, obtained Chad Curtis from Detroit for two pitchers, Joey Eischen and John Cummings. The Tigers also traded a pitcher, Greg Gohr, to California for Damion Easley, whom they will try at shortstop.
The Padres, who entered last night's games in first place in the National League West, wanted Vaughn because they were last in the league in home runs with 91. "I think he's going to add some much-needed punch in the middle of the lineup," Kevin Towers, the Padres' general manager, said from San Diego.
The 31-year-old left fielder hit 31 home runs and drove in 95 runs for the Brewers this season, helping make them a much more competitive team than they had expected to be. As much as they want to remain competitive this season, though, the Brewers decided to trade Vaughn because he can be a free agent after this season and they were not certain they would be able to sign him, given what they view as their financial constraints.
The players they are receiving in return are all younger and better fit the timetable and economics of their development. Newfield, 23, who has capably replaced both Tony Gwynn and Rickey Henderson when they have been injured, batted .251 for the Padres in 84 games.
Villone, a left-hander, and Florie, a right-hander, are both 26. Villone had a 1-1 record and 2.95 earned run average in 21 games for the Padres, Florie a 2-2 record and 4.01 e.r.a. in 39 games.
Vaughn, hampered the previous two seasons by a rotator cuff injury and operation, has returned to complete health this season, the last of a three-year contract worth $13.4 million. Towers said the Padres had spoken with Vaughn and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, and were confident they would be able to sign him beyond this season.
Mulholland, whom the Rangers also tried to acquire, had an 8-7 record and a 4.66 e.r.a. for the Phillies. In his one year in the American League, in 1994 with the Yankees, he had a 6-7 record and a 6.49 e.r.a.
The Cincinnati Reds failed in their effort to get Bobby Bonilla from Baltimore. The Orioles also were unable to complete a deal with Cleveland that would have given the Indians David Wells, a left-handed starting pitcher, for Julian Tavarez, who was an effective reliever last season but faltered this year and was sent back to the minor leagues.

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE BILL: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Clinton Recalls His Promise, Weighs History, and Decides

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
When President Clinton and a dozen of his top advisers sat down in the Cabinet Room to discuss the welfare bill this morning, everyone knew he faced the biggest domestic decision of his Presidency. Though they were prepared to close ranks behind him, the President's advisers knew this was their last chance to be heard on an issue on which there was no middle ground left.
By turns they spoke and their leader listened. But as he often does, Mr. Clinton ended the two-and-a-half-hour meeting without tipping his hand. Instead, he repaired to the Oval Office with Vice President Al Gore, who aides said encourged the President to sign the bill, and his chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, who urged a veto. 
 About 15 minutes later, Mr. Panetta emerged to order speechwriters to finish the draft announcing a "yes."
The bustle of those few moments capped years of work on the issue by Mr. Clinton, months of legislative back-and-forth with the Republican-controlled Congress and thousands of hours of wrenching policy debate within the Administration itself. And as Mr. Clinton stepped to the lectern to make his announcement, he did so not only with an air of pride in having helped shape the debate, but of clear trepidation about its result.
"I think we all have to admit here, we all need a certain level of humility today," Mr. Clinton said. "If this were an easy question, we wouldn't have had the two-and-a-half-hour discussion with my advisers today and we'd all have a lot more answers than we do. But I'm convinced that we're moving in the right direction. I'm convinced it's an opportunity we should seize."
That was the official line at the White House today, and no sooner had Mr. Clinton finished talking than the most forceful opponent of the bill in the meeting, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala, and its most articulate defender, the domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, joined together to repeat it to reporters.
But Ms. Shalala was uncustomarily flustered. At one point she rebutted criticism from a fellow Democrat, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, by referring to him as "my good friend Charlie Brown."
Unofficially, emotions ran high, and were complex.
"Oh, I don't know," one Presidential aide mused a bit wistfully when asked about the White House mood. "You know, there are a lot of liberals around here."
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former board chairman of the Children's Defense Fund, which has bitterly opposed the bill, was at the Olympics in Atlanta, and her chief of staff, Maggie Williams, who usually represents her at such gatherings, did not even attend the final meeting.
The debate arrayed advisers like Mr. Panetta, George Stephanopoulos and Harold M. Ickes, who favored branding the bill extreme, against Dick Morris, the President's political adviser, Mr. Reed and Rahm Emmanuel, a political aide who led the charge to sign it as a way of delivering on Mr. Clinton's 1992 promise to "end welfare as we know it."
In the end, aides insisted, it was not politics that was uppermost on the President's mind today, but history. "It's a big deal," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "I think everybody was leavened by the sense of historical moment. Everybody knew how big this was."
Another White House aide said that seven-eighths of the final discussion involved policy, and that when talk turned to politics at the end, Mr. Clinton said he was confident that he could win either way. Indeed, several other aides said that while Mr. Clinton would have doubtless suffered a 5- or 6-point drop in the polls because the public so favors welfare reform, he could have made a strong case that he vetoed the Republican bill for the same reasons that he vetoed earlier plans to cut growth in Medicare spending: it was too extreme.
How Mr. Clinton went from proposing a welfare plan that would have added about $10 billion more in spending on the poor to embracing one that would cut about $55 billion during the next six years is a tale of missed opportunies and electoral realities. More than anything, it reflects the seismic shifts in the political landscape unleashed first by his own pledge to end welfare, and then by the backlash at his attempt to overhaul the health care system two years ago, which helped put the Republicans in charge of Congress, with far harsher proposals than his own.
Having got the welfare ball rolling, aides said, Mr. Clinton simply felt that he could not walk away from the issue, especially after the Republicans softened some of the bill's sharpest provisions in recent days.
"I think he really thinks the stars don't align that often, and we were going to lose the opportunity," said one adviser who opposed the bill.
Mr. Clinton himself acknowledged today that "there was significant disagreement among my advisers about whether this bill should be signed or vetoed.
"But," he added, "100 percent of them recognized the power of the arguments on the other side.
"It was a very moving thing," Mr. Clinton said. "And today the conversation was almost 100 percent about the merits of the bill and not the political implications of it, because I think those things are very hard to calculate anyway. I think they're virtually impossible."
Still, political arguments on the issue divided a White House not marked for its unity in the first place. In recent days, as it became clearer which way Mr. Clinton was leaning, the ranks of those arguing for a veto dwindled, but both sides arrayed their arguments for one last seminar this morning as Mr. Clinton asked detailed questions about the bill, and particularly whether the bill's work incentives would work.
Aides said the President's main insistence was that the parts of the bill he opposes -- its curbs on nutrition programs and its sharp restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants -- be described as cruel additions outside the basic mission of the bill that could be reversed later. But such measures account for much of the budget savings in the Republicans' bill, and Mr. Reed acknowledged that there was little chance that such provisions could be overturned this year.
In the meeting, Mr. Gore and Mr. Panetta, as de facto leaders of the opposing groups, each refrained from comment, while others sitting around the big oblong table in the Cabinet Room spoke in turn. The group included Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and the head of the National Economic Council, Laura D'Andrea Tyson.
"He had questions for everybody," one aide said of the President. "This is a guy who knows the system."
Asked if she was happy with the outcome, Ms. Shalala was succinct: "We're going to be happy with it when it works."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about President Clinton's decision to sign the welfare bill omitted the reason for the absence of Maggie Williams, chief of staff to Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the final White House meeting to review the decision. Ms. Williams was in Chicago helping prepare for the Democratic National Convention and unaware of the meeting in Washington, which was arranged at the last minute on Wednesday morning.

While we laud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to adopt a free-market economy in Israel ("Netanyahu Infuriates Unions by Assault on Welfare State," July 31), it is clear that the country's current economic boom is a result of its edge in high-technology innovation. 
 More than half the country's exports are generated by its 1,800 high-tech companies. Intel, Motorola, Microsoft and I.B.M. are just a few of the American companies attracted to Israel. Of the more than 60 Israeli companies listed on American stock exchanges, the vast majority are high-tech. In fact, Canada is the only foreign country with more companies on the American stock exchanges.
Israel already has the most scientists and engineers per capita in the world engaged in research and development (135 per 10,000 compared with 35 per 10,000 for the second-place United States). But even that is not enough. While Israeli high-tech industry has been growing nearly 20 percent annually, Israel's universities are graduating just enough engineers to replace those who retire each year.
This gap may turn more acute as the influx of scientists and engineers from the former Soviet Union slows and as Israel's young people are attracted to more "glamorous" professions like law and business.
For the first time in the history of Israel, economic self-sufficiency is within grasp. Insuring a new generation of outstanding, innovative engineers and scientists is key to that future.

Dollar Ends 3 Days of Losses, Rising With Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By the Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar snapped a three-day decline yesterday, following stocks and bonds higher after reports on the economy temporarily reassured investors that inflation would remain benign.
Traders said the dollar also derived strength from a selloff in yen after the director general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Shusei Tanaka, suggested that the United States currency's gradual gain would remain a long-term trend. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.4762 marks, up from 1.4721 marks on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 107.13 yen, up from 106.77. The British pound fell to $1.5527 from $1.5554.
The dollar's advance was muted by the mixed signals from the latest batch of economic data in the United States, which showed the strongest growth in two years this spring and softness in manufacturing in July.
Traders were also reluctant to buy the dollar aggressively pending the results of the July jobless data -- to be issued today by the Labor Department. If it shows a surge in jobs, which could push up inflation, that could hurt the markets and the dollar.
"The data that came out this morning were certainly good for the bond market and stock market, but the dollar didn't move up that much because we still have those unemployment numbers," said Cynthia Johnson, managing director of foreign exchange at the New York office of CIBC Wood Gundy.
The dollar initially weakened when the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might have failed to contain inflation. But a closer reading of the report showed that inflationary pressures had receded in the second quarter. Further reassuring the markets about inflation were reports of falling prices for raw materials.
"The news essentially reassured people that it's O.K. to hold U.S. financial assets," said William Dudley, director of United States economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. "That's helping the dollar a bit in the short run."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Soars as Report Says Group In Iran May Have Crash Role

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday after a report by a Congressional group suggested that terrorists in Iran might have been behind the bombing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. This raised speculation among oil traders that sanctions could be broadened against one of the world's largest producers.
On other markets, natural gas and corn prices rose. 
 While Federal investigators have not yet determined what brought down T.W.A. Flight 800, the report, released yesterday by Representative H. James Saxton, Republican of New Jersey, prompted speculation that suspicion would focus on Iran. The report warned that a new group based in Iran had been formed with a goal of driving United States forces out of the Persian Gulf. An official at Iran's Mission to the United Nations in New York said he had not heard of the group.
The report ignited concern that the United States would persuade other countries to join its oil embargo on Iran, which pumps 3.66 million barrels a day, about 5 percent of the world's oil.
"The threat is that the U.S. would try to bring the rest of the world into sanctions on Iran," said Mike Hiley, broker at Merrill Lynch & Company. "That's why the market took off."
Crude oil for September delivery soared 62 cents, to $21.04 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Natural gas jumped after an industry report showed that gas stored in the United States posted a smaller-than-expected rise last week.
Natural gas for September delivery rose 11.3 cents, to $2.276 for a thousand cubic feet, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Corn rose on indications that export sales picked up in response to a 16 percent price drop over the last three weeks.
Exporters sold 48.6 million bushels of corn in the week ended July 25 for delivery in the next crop year, the Agriculture Department said yesterday, up 33 percent from a week ago and the highest in seven weeks.
December corn rose 9 cents, to $3.2875 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: Robert Vesco, the Fugitive Financier, Goes on Trial in Cuba on Fraud Charges

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 1

 BODY:
More than 25 years after he fled the United States to avoid Federal charges of fraud and began enjoying the life of a well-heeled and well-connected fugitive, the financier Robert L. Vesco went on trial in a Havana courtroom today, charged with similar offenses against the Cuban Government.
In the first day of what is expected to be a brief proceeding, prosecutors said Mr. Vesco, 60, had organized a complex scheme to bilk Cuba's Health Ministry and other investors in a miracle drug that could supposedly cure ailments ranging from cancer to arthritis. 
 They said Mr. Vesco wrongly represented himself as acting on behalf of the Cuban Government, pocketed investment funds and sought to market the drug abroad before clinical tests of its efficacy were finished. He is pleading not guilty.
Also charged in the fraud case is Mr. Vesco's Cuban wife, Lidia Alfonso, with whom he was living in a villa in Atabey, an upscale, beachfront Havana neighborhood, when both were arrested on May 31, 1995.
If convicted, Mr. Vesco faces a 20-year sentence in a Cuban prison and Ms. Alfonso, who diplomats said was a former employee of a state tourism agency, 12 years.
At the time Mr. Vesco was arrested, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said he had been taken into custody "under suspicion of being a provocateur and an agent of foreign special services," or intelligence agencies. That raised the possibility that he might be tried on charges of espionage and sabotage, for which the maximum penalty is death.
But Mr. Vesco has instead been formally charged with "fraud and illicit economic activity" and "acts prejudicial to the economic plans and contracts of the state."
The Cuban Government, chronically short of foreign exchange and eager to attract foreign investment, has provided no explanation for the change of direction in its case against Mr. Vesco, who is said by American officials to have long enjoyed the personal protection of President Fidel Castro.
One of the partners Mr. Vesco is accused of having deceived in the effort to develop the miracle drug, called Trixolane or TX, was a Cuban medical laboratory known as Labiofam, diplomats in Havana said. The director of that state-owned drug research company, they said, is Jose Antonio Fraga Castro, the son of Mr. Castro's sister Angela.
Initially, Mr. Vesco's American business associate and longtime friend and house guest, Donald Nixon Jr., a nephew of former President Richard M. Nixon, was also taken into custody.
Mr. Nixon was released last July, and later said Cuban investigators questioning him had expressed the belief that the drug project was actually a front for a Central Intelligence Agency operation and had also involved money laundering and drug trafficking.
Mr. Vesco fled the United States in the early 1970's to avoid charges that he had cheated investors in a Swiss-based mutual fund of $224 million in what was then the largest financial fraud in history.
He spent the next decade on the run in Costa Rica and the Bahamas before being granted "humanitarian refuge" in 1982 in Cuba, where, American officials said, he put his financial acumen to work helping the Cuban Government evade the American economic embargo.
"If he wants to live here, let him live here," Mr. Castro said at a news conference in Havana in 1985. "We don't care what he did in the United States."
But as Cuba started opening its economy to the outside world, Mr. Vesco become less useful and apparently fell out of favor.
In 1989, a Federal indictment in Jacksonville, Fla., accused Mr. Vesco of cooperating with Carlos Lehder Rivas, leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, to persuade the Cuban Government to allow planes loaded with drugs to fly over the island. Mr. Vesco denied the charges. He still faces charges of making an illegal $200,000 contribution to President Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.
In contrast to its usual practice when dissidents are on trial, the Cuban Government allowed some public access to today's proceedings, with news agency representatives permitted to attend but other foreign reporters barred. Two consular officials from the American Interests Section in Havana also sat in on the trial, witnesses said.
Since late last year, Mr. Vesco has been a patient at a military hospital in the Havana area, suffering from what diplomats describe as a serious stomach ailment. Appearing in court, he was described as bearded, looking haggard and wearing a gray shirt and pants that appeared to be a prison uniform. American officials say that they had sought Mr. Vesco's extradition to the United States, but that the Cuban Government, after encouraging discussions about that possibility, decided not to hand him over.

HEADLINE: Escapades on Fire Island

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
IT'S a barefoot society, car-free and carefree, but as long as anyone can remember, Fire Island, the skinny sandspit stretched along the underside of Long Island, has had its distinctive hierarchy. At the top are the natives, flinty souls who live year round on the 32-mile-long barrier island between the end of Robert Moses State Park and Moriches Inlet, where the Hamptons begin. The natives, it is said, look down on the homeowners and other summer folk who seasonally throng the roughly two dozen communities. The homeowners turn up their noses at the renters. The renters disdain the groupers who chip in for housing shares. And all feel superior to the day-trippers who sail in on the morning ferries and sail out again in the evening.
Which left us somewhere near the bottom -- hotel guests on Fire Island. Yes, there are hotels on Fire Island. No, you wouldn't generally pick them over a house. But between a hotel and nothing, the choice was clear. For five days, my wife and I and our two girls sampled the many delights of New York's quasi Key West with its own rich social and cultural history. We breathed the same fresh salt air and patronized the same restaurants and shops as any third-generation islander. We splashed in the same roiling surf, hunted for the same horseshoe crabs and shells on long stretches of deserted beach, strolled and bicycled the same few blocks between the bay and beach and took the same water taxis to the same outlying communities. And we felt entirely welcome. Indeed, there is probably only one restrictive community, Point O'Woods, where outsiders, whether natives or off-islanders, may get the cold shoulder; but even here we carried out a beach-based incursion without incident. 
 Yet a word of caution. To book a hotel on Fire Island on a summer weekend is to cast one's fate not to the winds but the singles. A commune of wildly celebrating youth in a Fire Island group house can be noisy, but when the party is compressed into a thin-walled hotel room, the disruption can be truly hellish, as we found out on our last night in Ocean Bay Park. Still, some hotel managements are laxer than others. And Friday and Saturday nights are definitely wilder; weekdays can be positively idyllic.
The first thing many new visitors want to know is where the name Fire Island comes from. The truth is, nobody knows. Some have linked it to the signal fires of whalers or wreckers who tried to lure ships ashore for plunder, or to the onetime fiery stands of poison ivy. Others say it grew out of a misreading on early Dutch maps of vier, or four, islands. Either way, the name, accurately enough, evokes blissful summer vistas of burning sands and blazing sun as well as the constant peril of fire.
Resort development began in the 1890's with the establishment of a Chautauqua Assembly, a movement for Christian betterment through learning and the arts, in what became Point O'Woods. In the early 1900's, just to the west, developers bought up tracts and began selling vacation lots to Brooklynites and other confined city folk for what became the village of Ocean Beach, Fire Island's de facto capital. Served by growing ferry links across Great South Bay, birds of a feather flocked to like-minded communities: boat owners to Saltaire, fishery workers to Seaview, casino-lovers to Ocean Bay Park, families to Kismet. Homosexuals driven from other communities found a welcome in Cherry Grove, creating one of the earliest centers of gay life in the nation.
(A thumbnail history is provided in the paperback "Fire Island: 1650's-1980's" by Madeleine C. Johnson, published by Shoreland Press of Mountainside, N.J., and available for $13.95 at the Ocean Beach Historical Society on Bayview Walk.)
Stars and Salons
Stars of the Broadway stage, stalwarts of the Algonquin Round Table, artists, bohemians and assorted hangers-on soon found their way to the quirky seasonal salons of Fire Island, where the politics were often decidedly leftist, and a Marxist group house might well blackball an applicant rumored to be a Trotskyite. Irving Berlin, Fanny Brice, Clifford Odets, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Jimmy Durante, Woody Allen, Lee Strasberg and Marilyn Monroe all made their way there, as did Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner, who honed their "2,000-Year-Old Man" routine on dinner audiences. And everyone mobilized in the early 1960's to thwart Robert Moses's plan to build an access road through Fire Island.
For the 1976 Bicentennial edition of the Ocean Beach handbook and directory, Arnold Horwatt, a theater and television writer, recalled a typical game of charades in this supercharged atmosphere. The team member acting out the riddle pointed to a table. One of his partners immediately seized on the required phrase, from T. S. Eliot's poem "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock":
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table.
When a spectator voiced amazement, the wizard shrugged. "It was obvious," he said.
My own memories of Fire Island go back to the 1940's when, as a child, I stayed with friends in an Ocean Beach cottage lighted by kerosene lamps. The icebox was indeed cooled by a block of ice, hauled from the market in a red wagon. And the ferry passed a house still sunk in the water from the devastating 1938 hurricane.
Amazingly, as I found again on our most recent trip, Fire Island has changed little from those days except perhaps for the now-ubiquitous deer that calmly feast on bushes and overturned trash bins as you pass. The concrete walks (rustically wooden in some communities) are still lined with old, whimsically named cedar-shingled cottages hemmed in by pines and bayberry. The shops and restaurants prettily arrayed around Ocean Beach's mini-green may have changed names but little else. Feet, wagon, bicycle and boat (golf carts and trucks for contractors and provisioners) are still the only means of transportation.
By Van and Boat
Reaching Fire Island from Manhattan is a kind of three- or four-corner shot requiring connections to and from the Long Island Rail Road or a jitney to the ferries at Bay Shore, Sayville or Patchogue. You can also drive your own car, at the cost of daily charges in a parking field at the ferry dock. We reserved four seats at $15 each on a Tommy's Taxi van that left from 53d Street and Second Avenue and delivered us an hour later to the Bay Shore ferry terminal, where $38 purchased round-trip ferry tickets (half price for our 5-year-old) to and from Ocean Beach.
I had reserved two kitchenette units at $218 each for two weekday nights at a randomly selected hotel called Clegg's, which turned out to be directly across from the ferry dock (not that anything in Ocean Beach is more than a few steps from anything else). As we lugged our bags up a narrow staircase past peeling walls, I thought the place resembled an old sailor's rooming house. Indeed, we learned, it was built in the 1920's by the grandfather of the current proprietor.
Our units each came with two beds, private bathroom with shower, and a stove, sink and refrigerator. The furnishings of table, captain chairs, chest of drawers and makeshift closet were more Salvation Army than the Ritz, but clean if not immaculate. Apartment C faced the bay and overlooked tennis and basketball courts. A cool sea breeze from two exposures sent the blinds slapping, rendering the air conditioner superfluous. One of the bed blankets bore a cigarette burn hole. Apartment A, which our daughters shared, was even larger but with one exposure. There were four other apartments with baths, and 13 smaller rooms that shared four skylit bath and shower rooms.
Our youngish hosts, Tyler Clegg Sterck and his wife, Jeanne, threw in use of beach chairs and a sun umbrella and even two balloon-tire bicycles that could be ridden only outside Ocean Beach. (Bike-riding within the village is banned in the summer season, one of many prohibitions that have earned the community a reputation as "The Land of No.") What the hotel did not provide, however, was daily room cleaning.
Still, comparing our quarters later with other accommodations in Ocean Beach, we did not do badly. The Houser Hotel, another 1920's fixture on the bay, over a popular bar and Chinese restaurant, has a dozen small rooms with sinks and toilets but shared shower rooms in the hall. The Ocean Beach Inn on Bay Walk, its name notwithstanding, has 20 motel-style rooms with private baths, also over a busy bar and restaurant.
We were taken with one little gem: the Four Seasons Bed and Breakfast on Dehnhoff Walk, a health-food-oriented lodge of eight rooms with gleaming polyurethaned wood floors, bright curtains and plump inviting quilts on the beds. Here, too, however, the rooms are without private baths, and there are no provisions for children. Otherwise, hospitality reigned: rooms come with breakfast and a sumptuous afternoon tea, cold juice drinks for the taking, a patio stocked with magazines, and use of bicycles, fishing tackle and a backyard gas barbecue.
Another darling guest house, Place in the Sun, on Surfview Walk halfway between bay and beach, also caught our eye. Open to nonsmokers only, it has a large skylit living room paneled in knotty pine and five rooms with two shared baths plus an outdoor shower and sauna.
Otherwise, it seemed, the pickings in Ocean Beach were slim: isolated rooms or the occasional rooming house with barrackslike accommodations and little privacy or little sanitation or neither.
When it comes to dining, Ocean Beach offers the widest selection on Fire Island. We had a pleasant alfresco lunch at Maguires on the bay, where the time waiting for your food can be whiled away with your children at the adjacent community playground and sand pit. Our 5-year-old, Sophie, made the swings and climbing apparatus her favorite Fire Island destination.
Dinner on the Bay
We had another fine waterside seafood dinner at Matthew's on the bay, and a pleasant dinner celebrating the 17th birthday of our elder daughter, Anna, at the Island Mermaid by the ferry dock, where the setting sun reflecting blindingly in the restaurant mirrors kept us rearranging our seats like musical chairs.
We also enjoyed the Albatross, with its patio tables affording a lovely view of the passing scene in the village center, and the funky Sun and Moon Cafe across the mall. For breakfast, we favored Rachel's a few steps away, a clean, well-lighted place of knotty pine hung with photographs of Fire Island in the snow. One morning, Sophie stared toward the back and proudly read aloud, "Birthday room, parties only." I did a double take. What the sign said was: "Bathroom. Patrons Only."
What you don't want to do in Ocean Beach is eat takeout with a knife and fork on the walks, another no-no, along with drinking anything at all on the walks. Because of the strict ban on consuming alcoholic beverages outside homes, bars and restaurants, drinking from open containers, even a soda can or pop bottle, is suspect, a ticketable offense likely to land you in village court in front of a decidedly unsympathetic judge.
A sign of the times hangs at the bay bathing beach adjoining the playground: "No facilities provided."
"No swimming beyond floats."
"No food or drinks."
"No dogs allowed."
"No disrobing."
"No radios without earphones."
"No ball playing or Frisbees."
Actually, veterans like Ildiko Trien, executive editor of The Fire Island News, the scrappy local paper, say that things have relaxed significantly from the days when Ocean Beach was notorious for ticketing visitors so bold as to eat a chocolate chip cookie in public.
For a change of scene one afternoon, we left the girls behind and telephoned South Bay Water Taxi for a 20-minute wave-tossed ride (at $8 each) east to Fire Island Pines, a chic community where straight and gay society intersect and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Hedy Lamarr, Barbra Streisand, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich and Rock Hudson have been among the many celebrity visitors. A sign by the dock advised: "Group Therapy 5 P.M. Everyone Must Attend."
The blue and turquoise balconied Botel overlooks the Italianate harbor, but except for top-floor suites that sleep four, rooms share bathrooms and offer little in the way of amenities. We meandered the wooden walkways, ogling some extraordinary mansions, and sipped banana daiquiris on the terrace of the Botel's Blue Whale, where the menu lists a "Hedda Cheddar Burger," a "Le Fifi Burger" and a "Midnight Blue Burger." Next door, the Pines Pantry is amazingly well provisioned, stocking necessities from margarita salt to live or fresh-cooked lobsters at $10.95 a pound.
We had hoped to stop at another Fire Island landmark on the way back, the Belvedere in Cherry Grove, but the water taxi was overbooked and it became too late. As it turned out, we probably would have been denied entry anyway. The "clothing optional" resort for gay men says it does not admit sightseers. I had to content myself with a description from The Fire Island News: a cross between "a Venetian villa overlooking the Grand Canal and the faux decoration of a Disneyland castle." Inspired by the Miami mansion Viscaya, the Belvedere is owned by John Eberhardt of the pencil dynasty, and is far and away the most luxurious hostelry on Fire Island. Clearly, though, it is not for everyone.
After several days in Ocean Beach, we were ready for the five-minute water taxi trip two communities east to Ocean Bay Park. We had booked two rooms for $265 each for two nights at the Fire Island Hotel and Resort, which includes time-sharing units and boasts an island rarity, a good-size pool.
Unfortunately, our room faced it, along with loudspeakers blaring oldies. The place was also a little run-down. After a refreshing swim (and to get away from the music), we walked a block to the bay to lunch at the cavernous Flynn's, another Fire Island fixture, which becomes a raucous singles rendezvous at night. We found a place to rent bicycles for $10 each a day at the nearby Schooner Inn, another bayfront restaurant and bar next to a small pizza parlor. Debbie, my wife, settled on a three-wheeler with a rear basket that served as rumble seat for Sophie, and we rode off to explore adjacent Seaview to the west, a community of handsome homes, playground, grocery and liquor shop.
Later, on foot we headed the other way toward Point O'Woods. A fence restricts access, but we circumvented the ban by entering on foot from the beach. Despite the vaunted exclusivity, it didn't look much different from other communities, perhaps just a little more overgrown and defiantly natural. No one challenged us, and we strolled back to the beach. We walked most of the two miles or so east along the surf to the Sunken Forest, a national park of wind-pruned 200-year-old holly and sassafras trees, but before we could make it to the raised, wooden walkway into the canopied forest, Sophie's legs wore out and we turned back.
A Fracas for a Finale
Back in Ocean Bay Park, we had some good meals at the Inn Between, an informal restaurant on the bay walk between Flynn's and the Schooner Inn. And for future reference, we scouted the nearby Sea Shore Motel with 20 simple rooms, including six efficiency units, that might appeal, if not to the luxury-minded, then to singles, young couples or families bent on a few economical days on Fire Island.
Our first night in the Fire Island Hotel and Resort passed quietly, at least after we prevailed on the management to turn off the loudspeakers, but on the second night the weekend brought an end to our idyll. At 2 A.M. that Saturday, we were jolted awake by a fearful shrieking from across the hall. Our neighbors, four young women, were evidently home from Flynn's with some male company. Slamming doors, hysterical laughter and curses filled the night. Sure that the row would wake our daughters, I rapped on the opposite door and appealed for quiet, to no avail. Finally two other roused guests and I went to find the manager.
The office was locked. A handwritten sign on the door read: "For after hours help, come to second house on right (bright bulb on top of entrance steps). Knock loudly or enter and call for help." We sleepless caucused. There was no clear second house on the right with or without a bright bulb. At 3 A.M., I went to the phone booth outside the hotel and dialed 911.
Twenty minutes later, two Suffolk County foot patrolmen and a jeep unit arrived. I led the officers to the din and went back to our room. From behind the closed door, we could hear arguing, a girl shouting for an officer to get his foot out of the door and someone screaming that the police had no warrant. I put the pillow over my head. Slowly the fracas subsided.
Sophie and Anna, of course, slept through it. In the morning, Sophie's enthusiasm was undimmed. "After eight more grades," she asked, "can we move to Fire Island?"

Bond Prices Soar on Signs Of Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Amid fresh signs of an economic slowdown, bond prices surged yesterday. Investors hope to see confirmation of a slowdown in the July jobs report due today.
The 30-year Treasury bond climbed 115/32 yesterday to a price of 8915/32 , dropping the yield 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.83 percent, from 6.97 percent on Wednesday. 
 The market has been up all week because it has seen the economic signs it wants -- that inflationary pressures may be in check and the economy may be beginning to slow. But none of this week's data will count for much unless they are confirmed by the employment report.
Traders say that unless the monthly jobs report shows the economy slowing from the pace in the second quarter, stocks and bonds are likely to fall sharply, as they have repeatedly done this year when the employment data have been strong.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the market consensus was for a gain of 210,000 jobs. "We're estimating a 190,000 gain," he said.
Investors rallied as expected to the weak report for July by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The index fell to 50.2 from 54.2 in June, well below expectations. The purchasing report's release at 10 A.M. dropped the long bond's yield to 6.91 percent, from 6.97 percent, in a matter of seconds and momentum picked up from there.
Prices of Government securities teetered in neutral territory early in the session, after a stronger-than-expected 4.2 percent rise in second-quarter gross domestic product. But then came tame inflation components, and a much larger decrease than expected in the report of initial unemployment claims, which fell 29,000 for the week ended Saturday.
"Clearly the economic reports indicate that the economy is unfolding before us," Mr. Sohn said. "If you look at the N.A.P.M. data, all the components, including new orders, production, supply or delivery times, prices and employment indicate that manufacturing is slowing after increased production to replenish inventories."
Mr. Sohn said the composition of the second-quarter G.D.P. indicated that strong economic growth was not likely to last into the second half. He said inventory accumulation was stronger than expected, indicating businesses would not add to stocks.
"The bottom line is that economic activity is slowing and is doing precisely what the Fed chairman wanted," Mr. Sohn said. "This diminishes the probability of a Fed tightening at the Aug. 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
The employment report today could change all that," Mr. Sohn said. "If the number is strong, like another 300,000 in new jobs, it may force Mr. Greenspan's hand in raising interest rates," he said. That could send the yield on the long bond back toward 7.25 percent, while a market-friendly number could begin a move down toward 6.75 percent.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said the markets were happy to see that the forecast of slower growth by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, "might come to fruition and in the end insure that any Fed tightening could be quite moderate." A tightening could be delayed "if Friday's employment report also supports this moderate pace of growth," he added.
In when-issued trading, the yield on the new three-year note being auctioned next week as part of the quarterly refunding was at 6.25 percent, while the 10-year note was at 6.64 percent. The 30-year bond was at 6.79 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge, With the Dow Rising 65.84

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks surged for a third consecutive session yesterday, rallying broadly as an improving inflation outlook sent long-term interest rates to the lowest level since May.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 65.84 points, to 5,594.75, giving it a three-day gain of more than 160 points. Earlier in the session, the Dow broke above 5,600 for the first time since last month's steep downturn sent the blue-chip average tumbling below 5,200. 
 But more notable than the Dow's latest exploit was that yesterday's gains were spread across the market, demonstrating some renewed confidence among investors, analysts said. There were nearly four advancing issues for every one that fell on the Big Board.
Of the market's recent gains, yesterday was " the most healthy up-day we've had," said Bob Dickey, managing director at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. "More stocks have participated than we've seen over the last week,"
Broader indexes were also higher yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.07 points, to 650.02, and the the Nasdaq composite index rose 18.26, to 1,098.85,
Stocks rallied with bonds after a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found weaker-than-expected growth in the manufacturing sector in July. The association also said that prices for raw materials and factory employment fell at a steeper rate in July.
The data reinforced hopes that the economy was not growing fast enough to accelerate inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise its lending rates to slow the nation's consumer and corporate business activity. After the report, bond prices shot higher, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 6.83 percent, from 6.97 percent on Wednesday.
The long bond yield -- an important benchmark determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- was last at that level in late May, before inflation worries sent it rising. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Despite the enthusiasm over the purchasing managers report, however, investors were nervously awaiting today's release of the July employment report.
Many economists expect the data will suggest slowing growth, but four of the last five monthly employment reports have spurred steep selloffs with disclosures of surprisingly strong growth in new jobs and hourly wages. "Tomorrow's a new day with a new round of numbers," Mr. Dickey of Dain Bosworth said. " We're still at risk, depending on how those employment numbers fall."
Volume on the Big Board totaled 439.1 million shares.
The Dow's biggest gains were spread across a broad spectrum. Aluminum Company of America rose 1 3/4, to 59 3/4; Disney rose 1 3/4, to 57 3/8; Merck rose 1 5/8, to 65 7/8, and General Motors rose 1 1/2, to 50 1/4.
Predictably, the prospect for steady or lower interest rates helped bank and utility stocks. Lower borrowing costs for banks and other financial institutions mean a bigger profit margin on the money they lend, while fixed-income investors could start turning to utility shares, which typically pay higher dividends, if bond yields continue lower.
BankAmerica rose 2 3/8, to 82; Chase Manhattan rose 1 5/8, to 71 1/8, and Citicorp rose 1 3/8, to 83 1/4.
GTE rose 7/8, to 42, after the company said it planned to buy back as many as 25 million shares of its stock.
Ethan Allen Interiors jumped 5 1/8, to 27. The company reported stronger-than-expected fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings.
America Online Inc. surged 2 7/8, to 33 3/8. The company has filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Clinton Loses Composure on Travel Office

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
His eyes narrowed in anger, President Clinton today punctured what was supposed to be a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating good economic news by heatedly renouncing a White House promise to pay the legal bills of travel office employees who had been dismissed.
"Are we going to pay the legal expenses of every person in America who is ever acquitted of an offense?" Mr. Clinton said, his voice even and steely as he plunged his hands into his pockets, rejecting a suggestion that he urge the Senate to proceed on stalled legislation that would reimburse the employees. 
 When a reporter reminded him that his own press secretary had previously pledged Mr. Clinton's support to the Senate legislation, Mr. Clinton shook him off:
"Well, he didn't talk to me before he said that," Mr. Clinton said. "I didn't say that. I said, 'I don't know what's going to be in it.' "
At that, Mr. Clinton turned to his questioner, a Washington Times reporter, and said: "I don't believe that we should give special preference to one group of people over others. Do you? Do you?"
Mr. Clinton is renowned among staff members for his fast and frequent outbursts of anger, and, typically, equally fast cooling downs and apologies.
In this case, Mr. Clinton later called aside one of his targets, Bill Plante, a CBS White House correspondent who asked the initial question that The Washington Times reporter followed up, and apologized. Mr. Plante said the President attributed his fit of temper to fatigue and the stress he was feeling because of the destruction of T.W.A. Flight 800.
Still, the exchange came over an issue that has caused Mr. Clinton much difficulty in the past two years, the dismissal of seven employees of the White House travel office by Mr. Clinton's Administration shortly after he took office. The Washington Times has closely followed the situation involving Billy R. Dale, the director of the White House travel office, who was dismissed and then acquitted of embezzlement charges brought against him by Mr. Clinton's Justice Department. The reporter who asked the question today, Paul Bedard, said this afternoon that Mr. Clinton had not offered him an apology.
Within hours of the televised news conference, aides to Mr. Clinton's likely opponent this fall, Bob Dole, who have customarily had to deal with questions about Mr. Dole's temperament, pounced on this incident to raise questions about the temper of the man in the White House.
"We have to assume that in anticipation of Dole's pro-growth economic plan coming out next week, Clinton is coming unglued," said John Buckley, Mr. Dole's communications director, referring to Mr. Dole's pending release of an economic plan that has caught White House attention over the past few days.
"But there is the larger issue of the President's ability to control his temper in public. And they're going to have to monitor that very carefully at the White House."
Mr. Dole's aides asserted that Mr. Clinton's exchange in the Rose Garden was the public relations equivalent of Mr. Dole's televised confrontation with Katie Couric, the host of the NBC News "Today" program, over Mr. Dole's ties to the tobacco industry.
"On the Katie Couric interview, Dole was asked several questions on the same subject and he showed a glint of testiness," Mr. Buckley said. "But there's a far cry between that and the leader of the free world having a meltdown at a news conference."
George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said in response to Mr. Buckley: "Valiant spin. What else do you expect him to say in the face of historic economic growth?"

HEADLINE: Fear of Fare Cards

 BODY:
The blue and yellow plastic Metrocard that will eventually replace bus and subway tokens in New York City made its debut two and a half years ago, but only 8 percent of transit riders use it. The millions who cling to tokens are not stupid or hostile to technology. They have simply concluded that the benefits conferred by the card do not yet justify switching. Erratic system design and poor marketing have combined to delay the moment when the card will begin to inspire confidence in users and make economic sense for the city.
That moment should arrive next July, when all the city's 469 stations will have sturdy new turnstiles with the computer software to accept the card. The customer can then be sure that the card is usable anywhere, including round trips to work. That is also when the Transit Authority will provide free transfers between buses and subways, a big plus for those now forced to pay two fares. 
 For now, the card is a symbol of unrealized potential -- even though many New Yorkers already find the thin plastic simpler to carry than tokens and all 3,600 city buses accept the card. Are there ways to build card loyalty between now and next July? Free intermodal transfers immediately, discounts and weekly or monthly passes would certainly inspire more interest, more patronage and savings in reduced toll-collecting staff. But until next year's budget kicks in the city says it cannot afford to lose the more than $160 million such privileges would now cost.
Meanwhile, transit officials are trying to boost usage by raising commissions for merchants who sell the cards and lowering them for merchants who sell tokens. But they have botched delivery of the half-fare discount card for the elderly, forcing senior citizens to wait months for that benefit.
Eventually the card swipe will be the exclusive ticket to city transit. Officials have wisely decided to ease the transition next summer, allowing riders to continue using tokens for several months before phasing them out entirely. Old habits die hard and the Transit Authority's record so far has not inspired confidence in its customers.
The authority apparently believed that the card would sell itself. It not only ignored obvious marketing techniques, like discounting, but failed to install the machines that receive the card quickly enough. Officials now promise a fully functioning network in a year's time. Meanwhile, travelers with electronic turnstiles at both ends of their journey should give the card a try.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars.
Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler. 
 Sales fell sharply for Honda, Nissan, Isuzu and Mitsubishi while rising for Volvo and Toyota and staying roughly flat at Suzuki.
While the Ford Motor Company will not announce its July sales until Monday, the results so far suggest that overall industry sales will be as much as 3 percent below the levels of July, 1995, said David M. Garrity, analyst at Smith Barney.
Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Brothers, cautioned that it would have been easy for G.M. and particularly Chrysler to show strong gains because neither did well a year ago. "This is against a very weak comparison for a year ago," he said. G.M.'s car sales fell by 4.9 percent while light-truck sales climbed by 1.6 percent. At Chrysler, generous rebates produced a 10.7 percent increase in car sales while light-truck sales soared 23.3 percent.
Economists and analysts had been skeptical that auto sales would continue to grow at the same brisk pace that they maintained during the first half of the year, and played down Chrysler's success in July.
"What we see at Chrysler is a temporary aberration, not a long-term trend," said Sung W. Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis. Even Chrysler officials had warned a month ago that sales would likely cool at some point after a brisk first half of the year. They welcomed today's sales.
"The July numbers show that Chrysler is maintaining the momentum that pushed us to sales records in the year's first and second quarters," said James P. Holden, the company's executive vice president for sales and marketing.
A combination of strong consumer confidence and brisk increases in the disposable income of many households has left more Americans with the money to buy new vehicles, said David L. Littmann, a senior economist at Detroit-based Comerica Bank. The rising disposable income is mainly the result of strong increases in the number of Americans working, rather than higher wages, Mr. Littmann added.
Foreign auto makers showed a wide range of results in July, with Toyota's sales soaring 18 percent while Nissan's sales dropped nearly 22 percent, a plunge that the company attributed to its strong sales in July, 1995.
Honda's sales plunged nearly 12 percent last month, partly because the company virtually ran out of its popular Civic sedan. Honda said this week that it would begin importing four-door Civic sedans because its factory in East Liberty, Ohio, could not produce them fast enough.
Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 26 selling days last month and only 25 in July, 1995.
Alan B. Helfman, a Chrysler and Plymouth dealer in Houston's wealthy River Oaks neighborhood, said that the redesigned Jeep Wrangler and the new Sebring convertible were particularly popular. The dealership sold close to 20 Wranglers last month, and could have sold twice as many if the factory were able to produce them faster, Mr. Helfman said.
The new Sebring convertible is also much more popular than the Chrysler LeBaron convertible which it replaced. The dealership sold 20 Sebring convertibles last month, Mr. Helfman said, adding, "The LeBaron got down to where we weren't selling any, or one or two a month."
John P. Peterson, a Pontiac and GMC dealer in Bloomington, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb, said that the Pontiac Grand Prix was selling well, regardless of national trends in G.M.'s car sales. The Grand Prix was introduced on June 26, the first of G.M.'s four new midsized sedans to reach the market.
"We've received eight and we've delivered every one of them" to customers, Mr. Peterson said. "They come off the truck and they're not here two or three days before they're gone."
Chrysler announced its sales figures before the close of trading while G.M. did so after the close. In a rising stock market, Chrysler's shares rose 87.5 cents, to $29.25; G.M.'s shares climbed $1.50 to $50.25, and Ford's shares increased $1.375, to $33.75.

HEADLINE: Forging An Olympic Legacy;
Atlanta Sees Games As a Great Sales Tool

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 31

 BODY:
In Montreal, they're still paying off Olympic i.o.u.'s that shot past $1 billion. While Barcelona pulled off one of Europe's grandest waterfront restorations and made a small operating profit, it also wound up with debts of $1.4 billion. Los Angeles made a profit, too, but gained little in jobs or other economic benefits.
Atlanta politicians and business executives are determined to do better. They are parlaying the Games into this self-promoting city's greatest corporate recruiting tool ever. Their immodest goal: grab enough new offices, factories and corporate headquarters to complete Atlanta's transformation from regional outpost to global business nexus. 
 For the Olympics, Atlanta has reupholstered its hard sell with cushy treatment, including prime Olympic tickets, tables in the best restaurants, rooms in the nicest hotels and constant cossetting from business and political leaders. Georgia's government and corporate officials have endowed hundreds of visiting executives and their spouses with privileges usually reserved for heads of state. For the triumph of the American women's gymnastics team last week, "We had better seats than President Clinton," said Susan Mills, who arranges high-tech alliances and other deals at Technology Marketing Partners in Berkeley, Calif.
Just where the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games ends and the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce begins is impossible to say: Andrew Young, the former mayor, United Nations delegate, civil rights leader and minister, is both co-chairman of the committee and chairman of the chamber.
"I'm not just interested in how much economic growth we add right now," he said Tuesday night at a reception for local and visiting executives and friends. "I'm interested in sustained 5 percent growth. It's what's required to sustain good race relations. If Yugoslavia had 5, 6, 7 percent economic growth, there would be no war in Bosnia."
For Atlanta's leaders, snatching up companies and jobs from other states and nations is all but a moral crusade. Hours before the opening ceremonies, Bernard Marcus, the chief executive of Home Depot Inc., an Olympic sponsor that is based here, joined Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia in addressing the top executives of 40 of Home Depot's largest suppliers. Over brunch in the Governor's colonnaded mansion, Mr. Marcus drove home a point that Governor Miller had only begun to make. "The Governor's message is subtle," he said. "Mine is not. If any of you need to consider a new location, this is where you should be."
Judging the results will take years, but early returns show some promise. Among the more formal efforts, Operation Legacy, organized by the state government and the Georgia Power Company, entertained 300 executives, most with their spouses, on pre-Olympic tours, with 200 more visiting during the Games. Executives from 15 companies who came before, including Komatsu, Conagra Inc., the Fisher-Price unit of Mattel Inc. and the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, have already decided to bring Georgia another 2,000 jobs. Other business and government campaigns have won pledges from investors including Prince Charles of Britain, who will give $800,000 toward a monument to international athletics.
Local business leaders concede that many of the new jobs would have come without their efforts. Atlanta has, by some counts, led the nation in employment growth for each of the last three years, partly due to the Games but also because of its enduring attractions for business.
"It's a perennial favorite," said Charles Galloway, an executive vice president of the Moran, Stahl & Boyer relocation agency. His firm reports that in Atlanta prime office space costs less than $20 a square foot and the corporate income tax is 6 percent; in New York the lease rate is $35 a square foot and the corporate tax 17.85 percent. In recent years, Atlanta has raided the New York area for the headquarters of companies and organizations like United Parcel Service and Care, the international charity group.
Few executives visiting the Olympics fault their hosts for packed subways, inflated costs and lost bus drivers. Their handlers, however, do their best to insulate them. And while the Centennial Park bombing chilled them, the visitors say it could have happened anywhere.
Thomas J. Cunningham, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, sees an economic slowdown after the Games lasting only a few months as hospitality and retailing cut back and hamburger flippers no longer command $10 an hour. Then, he predicts, the area will resume growing at least 1 percent faster than the nation.
Almost every Olympics host city has gained civic improvements. But Atlanta has gained so much that even some members of the International Olympic Committee have bristled. Los Angeles, charging corporate sponsors of the 1984 Olympics $4 million each, made do mostly with existing stadiums and arenas. Atlanta, charging sponsors $40 million each, got corporations, ticket buyers and broadcasters to pay nearly $700 million for new stadiums, parks and an Olympic village that will become college dormitories.
Let other cities wrestle with rebellious taxpayers to build new stadiums for sports teams that threaten to leave. To replace its own aging ball park, Atlanta will simply convert the Olympic stadium into a new home for the Atlanta Braves.
But the best measure of a host city's success might be long-term development and new jobs. By this standard, others have faltered. In Los Angeles, Peter V. Ueberroth finished the Olympics with a surplus of more than $200 million that financed new amateur athletic programs. But the region's economy collapsed a few years later following big cuts in military spending. And when the city exploded in riots in 1992, even Mr. Ueberroth, assigned the task of rallying corporations to the inner city, was unable to lure many jobs.
As much fun as the 1984 Games were for residents and visitors, said Larry J. Kimbell, director of the University of California at Los Angeles's business forecasting project, in economic terms "it was about the biggest nothing that's ever been."
Barcelona took the opportunity to rebuild and fortify tourism, courting tour operators long before the 1992 Games. But there, taxpayers rebelled as lingering debts raised taxes and deepened a recession.
Montreal's Olympic committee finished with a healthy operating surplus but huge cost overruns contributed to debts of about $1.5 billion including $400 million still outstanding. "What a nightmare," said John Derepentigny, controller for the agency that manages Montreal's Olympic facilities.
Atlanta's Olympic Committee still says it will break even on a $1.7 billion budget. About $1.1 billion in security costs and local improvements will leave public debts of $150 million.
Well worth it, Atlantans say.
"We are using the Olympics as a marketing tool to attract businesses to our state," Randy Cardoza, chief of the state's Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, said. The Olympic tours his department helps organize add a day in Savannah, the North Georgia mountains or other business sites to the Altanta circuit.
Atlanta's appeals to wealthy and influential out-of-towners date back to before Gen. William T. Sherman accepted an invitation to return on more friendly terms in 1879 to the city his troops burnt 15 years before. In his book, "Atlanta Rising" (Longstreet Press) Frederick Allen writes that in 1926, Atlanta became the region's first airmail hub by inviting down an assistant postmaster general for potentate treatment, complete with a motorcade up Peachtree Street, a banquet with the mayor, governor and business leaders and a sumptuous hotel suite.
To understand how Atlanta and Georgia have played the game during the Olympics, meet Gil Ziegler, owner of Alken-Ziegler Inc., a growing automotive-parts maker in Kalkaska, Mich. He was given a pre-Olympic tour late in 1994 that allowed politicians and business leaders the chance to persuade him that taxes were reasonable, schools improving and environmental regulators as friendly to business as to birds and trees.
"You may think I'm bragging a lot about Atlanta and Georgia," he said one of his tour guides drawled. "But my daddy says it's a sorry dog that won't wag its own tail."
Mr. Ziegler went home and decided to build a new plant in Jasper, Ga., about an hour north of Atlanta, his first outside Michigan. His aides argued for a site farther north, in Kentucky or Tennessee, that would be closer to clients, but Mr. Ziegler's logic carried the day. "My name's on the building," he said, "so I usually get what I want."
Mr. Ziegler credited the Georgians for singling him out and flying him in. "You can put all you want in a brochure," he said, "but unless you see it yourself it doesn't mean anything."
With 35 employees already, his Georgia plant will grow to 100 jobs by the year's end, he said, with further expansion in Georgia a strong possibility. Mr. Ziegler has come to like the area so much that he has purchased a second house for himself on a golf course.
To thank him and encourage further expansion, he and his wife were invited back for the Games, where they stayed on the 57th floor of the Westin Peachtree Plaza and saw the Dream Team dominate the men's basketball competition. As Mr. Ziegler chatted last week at the swimming competition at the Olympic Aquatic Center, the announcer said that an American who was leading a qualifying heat in the men's 200 meter backstroke was on an Olympic record pace. "Go! Go! Go!," Mr. Ziegler said, punching into the air.
The heat ended with no record, but Mr. Ziegler's spirits remained buoyant. "For most decisions in life, you can say they're analytical," he said, "but they're really emotional."

Chart: "Putting On A Show"
When cities vie to host the Olympics, the economic benefits are often cited. But while the organizing committees usually do well, the cities' long-term gains are less certain. In some cases, the city can be left with a lot of debt. Here is how each of the cities that hosted the summer Olympics since 1976 has fared; the Moscow Games of 1980 are excluded, because of the difficulties in measuring the economic impact on a Communist state.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Mariners' Maneuver: Stock Up on Left-Handers

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
If this is the way the Seattle Mariners want to play, they just better look at what happened to the Baltimore Orioles.
The Orioles kept pace with the Yankees step for step, move for move last winter in putting together what they were certain would be a strong contender for the division championship. But look at them now. While the Yankees have flourished, the Orioles have been unmasked as a contending fraud, a team full of name players but no spirit and less talent. 
 What does the Orioles' stunning failure have to do with the Mariners? On successive days this week, the Mariners traded for left-handed starting pitchers, adding Jamie Moyer on Tuesday and Terry Mulholland on Wednesday. Presumably, they wanted to bolster their rotation for possible post-season games against the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians, the two teams they played last October and two teams that have been vulnerable to left-handed starters.
In games started by right-handers this season, entering last night's games, the Yankees had a 48-26 record (.649) and the Indians 50-27 (.649). In games left-handers started against them, the Yankees have a 15-16 record (.484) and the Indians 15-15 (.500).
But Lou Piniella said those teams should not take the Mariners' moves personally.
"We didn't do it with the post-season in mind," the Seattle manager said by telephone from Milwaukee before he watched Moyer win in his first Mariners start. "We just did it to solidify our chances to get into the post-season."
But Piniella added that most of the teams the Mariners play in the final two months of the season do not have winning records in games started by left-handers. Two of those teams happen to be the Yankees, whom the Mariners play seven times, and the Indians, whom they play six times.
But just as they countered the Orioles' moves last winter, the Yankees, in one large swoop, blunted the Mariners' moves. Cecil Fielder can do that.
His presence in the middle of the lineup should make a large difference in the Yankees' success against left-handers. It also should increase the team's output of home runs, which has been among the league's lowest. "He'll help them," Piniella said. "We played Detroit over the weekend in Seattle and he hit three or four home runs. He hit our lefties and our righties."
Whatever the Mariners' motive for stocking up on left-handers, if they were to play the Yankees in October (they would in the first round of the playoffs if they won the A.L. West championship and the Texas Rangers were the wild-card team), they could start Randy Johnson (assuming he's back and healthy), Sterling Hitchcock, Mulholland and Moyer.
Then Fielder would have the opportunity to show how potent he can be. By acquiring him, the Yankees have shown how potent their economic resources continue to be. Not only did the Yankees raise their payroll (now at $55 million) because Fielder's salary is higher than the departed Ruben Sierra's, but they also gave the Tigers $1 million, the maximum amount of cash allowed in a deal.
On the same night the Yankees added Fielder, the Milwaukee Brewers traded away their No. 1 run producer, Greg Vaughn, because they didn't feel they could give him the $19.5 million or so for three years he wanted to remain with them instead of becoming a free agent after the season.
In discussing the Fielder acquisition, an official of another club talked yesterday about the advantage the Yankees have over most teams. He spoke not critically but matter of factly, with what sounded like a touch of envy attached.
"I feel the Yankees can make more mistakes than most people," the official said. "Look at their payroll and how much they spend sending guys up and down and replacing guys who are on the disabled list. They signed Tim Raines to a two-year contract and he's been out for so long. So what? They go out and get somebody else."
Offering the Brewers as a contrast, the official recalled several players they signed in years past: Ted Higuera, Ron Robinson and Franklin Stubbs. Higuera and Robinson collected most of their money on the disabled list; Stubbs was a bust. "They couldn't spend more money," he said. "They had to wait until their contracts expired before they made other moves. There's no bottom line the Yankees have to look at. Melido Perez, a $4 million pitcher, is hurt, they go out and sign Kenny Rogers for $5 million. They need to fortify their lineup against left-handers, they get Fielder."
On the other hand, the Orioles spent millions, too, in acquiring Roberto Alomar, Randy Myers, B. J. Surhoff, David Wells, Kent Mercker, Roger McDowell and Mike Devereaux, not to mention a new general manager, Pat Gillick, and a new manager, Davey Johnson. Their owner, Peter Angelos, is learning how it feels to squander millions, a feeling George Steinbrenner has experienced more often than not.
This year, finally, the Yankee spending promises to produce dividends. Consider Fielder an insurance policy that enhances the chances for those dividends.

HEADLINE: 3 Major Steel Companies Raising Prices by 3% to 5%

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Trying to move up toward the price levels that prevailed in 1994, three major steel companies announced yesterday that they would raise prices by 3 to 5 percent for steel used for such things as cars, trucks, appliances and home construction. But steel is now so small a part of the economy that the price increases, if they stick, are not expected to be inflationary.
The pricing announcements came from the USX-U.S. SteelGroup, the nation's largest steel maker; the LTV Corporation, the third largest, and the smaller AK Steel Holding Company. The increases ranged from $15 to $25 a ton, effective in most cases in late September, but for USX, partly in September and partly in January. 
 Other major steel companies, including the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the second largest, are expected to join the third attempt this year by the industry to raise steel prices. The first two, in April and July, "stuck in part," said Thomas Ferrall, a USX spokesman.
The new increases are likely to follow a similar pattern, said Walter Carter, a steel expert at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company near Boston. "Demand for steel is strong, but no longer rising," he said, "and the pressure from imports is likely to keep pricing soft."
The increases would affect mostly spot purchases of steel. Auto makers and appliance companies, in contrast, buy steel under long-term contracts, and the contracts are already in place for the steel that will go into 1997 model cars and into appliances, including air-conditioners, which are piling up in warehouses because of an unusually cool summer.
"The percentage of air-conditioners that have been shipped and actually sold is only about 70 percent," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting and forecasting company in St. Louis. "Normally it is 85 percent to 90 percent."
Still, the increases would play a role in the next negotiations with appliance makers and in talks with the auto industry next March for contracts to buy steel for 1998 model cars.
But even if the latest price increases are entirely successful, sheet steel prices will still be 10 percent or more below their levels in the fall of 1994, when they reached a peak for the 1990's after several major increases, and then began a decline that did not bottom out until the first quarter of this year.
Despite the price runup in 1993 and 1994, the inflation rate for the economy as a whole was only 2.7 percent in each of those years, a bit less than the annual rate today.
One major reason is that domestic steel today, selling at an average price of under $500 a ton, represents less than 1 percent of the nation's nearly $7 trillion economy, down five percentage points or so over the last 30 years.
"Cars used to sell for $3,000 and the steel in one was $300 or 10 percent of the price," said Bernard Lashinsky, director of steel consulting for AUS Consultants in Moorestown, N.J. "Now a car costs $20,000 and the steel is around $500 so you are talking 2.5 percent and the same sort of shrinkage is happening in construction and in many other products, where the added cost comes from plastic or electronic components or other nonsteel items."
The American steel industry produces about 110 million tons of steel a year, down from 118 million at the peak in 1974-1975, when the national economy was roughly 55 percent of its present size.
The price increases announced yesterday, which varied somewhat from company to company, were for hot-rolled steel, up $15 a ton to about $340; for cold-rolled steel, up $20 a ton to about $478, and coated steel, up $25 to $557 a ton.
In January, hot-rolled steel was at a low of $300 a ton, cold-rolled steel, $430, and coated-steel, $480.

HEADLINE: Growth Rose In the Spring; Easing Is Seen

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The economy boomed in the spring but it may now be easing to a more sustainable pace, according to new figures issued today. They gave a sharp lift to financial markets and touched off a daylong spate of campaign-related argument in Washington.
The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product, the most widely cited indicator of the nation's economic pulse, rose at a 4.2 percent annual pace during the April-June quarter, the fastest in two years. This compared with a 2 percent growth rate during the first three months of the year. There was little sign of accelerating inflation. 
 Then, at least temporarily alleviating fears that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates soon to try to rein in the economy, the managers who make buying decisions for American industry reported a broad weakening in July.
Wall Street fixed on that evidence of slackening activity, which is more recent than the report on gross domestic product, and the bond and stock markets rallied smartly. Interest rates fell across the board, while the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 65.84 points, to 5,594.75.
Another report today showing a sizable drop in the number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week was mostly ignored. And despite the enthusiasm in the markets over the soft purchasing managers report, sentiment could shift quickly if the July employment survey, to be issued on Friday, indicates unexpectedly rapid growth. Four of the last five monthly employment reports have spurred steep selloffs in the markets after they came in much stronger than expected.
Politicians of both parties seized on the growth figures for a back-and-forth that appeared to be a warm-up for election-season debates to come.
The White House, in an unusually energetic effort to take credit for economic success, assembled eight Cabinet and other ranking officials to stand beside President Clinton in the Rose Garden. The President proclaimed that the new figures were confirmation of what he called "the strongest economy in a generation" and cautioned against "dramatic" policy changes that could undermine budget discipline.
"This economic news shows that our strategy is working, the economy is growing, our nation is moving in the right direction," Mr. Clinton said.
Responding to a question, Mr. Clinton said a broad tax cut, like Bob Dole is expected to propose next week, would have a "very adverse" economic impact if it led to a swelling of the budget deficit.
Mr. Dole, set to become the Republican Presidential nominee, charged that the President first broke his promise of a tax cut for the middle class and now "steps forward to crow about reigning over the first recovery since World War II to leave the American worker behind."
And Senate Republicans, led by Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Connie Mack of Florida, took an hour out from the debate over welfare to join in attacking the economy's performance during the Clinton Administration. They contended that the current business expansion, which began in 1991, was the weakest in more than a century. They pointed to stagnating wages and family incomes, a slump in savings they attributed partly to the 1993 tax increase and a trade deficit they calculated as three times as large as under President George Bush.
But while the G.D.P. report, which slightly exceeded recent expectations, brought about today's debate, it was regarded by private economists as more about the past than the future. Much more important for deliberations at the Federal Reserve, whose main policy arm is scheduled to meet Aug. 20, will be the employment survey on Friday and today's purchasing managers report, which strongly suggested that manufacturing activity had started to slow.
The index from the National Association of Purchasing Management fell to 50.2 from 54.3 in June, with all the major components, especially new orders, moving down sharply. Employment fell as well. And the rate at which suppliers fill orders -- a gauge closely watched at the Federal Reserve to see if bottlenecks are emerging that could lead to inflation -- also speeded up significantly.
The Commerce Department's tally of the national output showed the second-quarter surge reflecting gains in all major components except trade and spending on nonresidential structures.
"The economy was certainly on the move," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company of Chicago.
Consumers were particularly vigorous, lifting personal consumption to a 3.7 percent pace after an already brisk 3.5 percent for the first quarter, the report showed. Spending on cars and other long-lived goods climbed at a 14.1 percent pace, though much of this unsustainable strength reflected recovery from the first-quarter strike at the General Motors Corporation.
Indeed, one department official was said to have calculated that had there been no strike, overall G.D.P. would have grown at a 3.2 percent pace in the first quarter and 3.1 percent in the second.
Inflation, gauged by the price index for gross domestic purchases, ran at a 2 percent rate in the latest quarter compared with 2.3 percent in the first part of the year when the Northeast blizzard magnified the result because Government employees were being paid when they could not work.
In current dollar terms, G.D.P. grew at a 6.1 percent pace in the spring after a rise of 4.2 percent in the winter.
Today's report included a "limited" annual revision of national income and products accounts back through the first quarter of 1993 but the changes were small. Real growth was one-tenth of a point higher in 1993 than previously calculated and no quarterly change was larger than two-tenths of a point, the amount by which the first quarter of 1996 has now been reduced.
Today's labor-market data found 292,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, down from 321,000 for the week ended July 20. But analysts said this erratic series was particularly suspect these days because of seasonal shutdowns in the automotive industry.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1996 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Immigration Overhaul Moves Toward Vote

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
House and Senate Republicans cleared the way today for a vote on overhauling immigration law, resolving a sharpdispute over how to educate children who are illegal immigrants.
If passed, the legislation would tighten the nation's borders and clamp down on millions of illegal immigrants living and working here. 
 But critics contend that the compromise on the education provision could throw thousands of children onto the streets.
"Our goals are to do all we can to discourage the unchecked flow of illegal immigration and to encourage those illegal immigrants already here to go home," said Representative Elton Gallegly, a California Republican who championed the education provision.
The bill's best chances for passage before lawmakers take a monthlong recess are in the House, where the leaders are expected to put the legislation on a fast track for a floor vote by Friday or Saturday. But Democrats opposed to the education provision could block Senate approval.
Earlier this year, both House and Senate gave overwhelming approval to similar bills, which would nearly double -- to almost 10,000 -- the number of Border Patrol officers, stiffen penalties against document fraud and provide ways to verify that employers hire only legal workers. About 300,000 foreigners a year enter the country illegally or overstay their visas, many vanishing into the underground economy.
Reconciling the two bills hit a snag beginning in May, mainly over a provision that the House included but the Senate did not, that would allow states to deny public education to children who are illegal immigrants.
The ban is particularly popular in California, where the Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, has been a fervent supporter. The state spends $1.8 billion a year to educate more than 350,000 children who are illegal immigrants.
But school administrators and law-enforcement officers have condemned the measure, saying that by putting children out of school and onto the streets, it would jeopardize public health and safety. President Clinton has promised to veto any bill that includes the education measure. Several prominent Republicans including former President George Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell oppose the measure.
The education compromise hammered out over the past several days by Senate and House Republicans, without Democrats' participation, would allow illegal immigrants now enrolled in elementary school to stay without penalty so long as they did not change school districts.
But once these children advanced to the seventh grade, local school districts could require that they pay annual tuition costs of more than $5,000 a student through the 12th grade. Opponents of this measure say that parents unable or unwilling to pay the tuition would pull these children out of class, a step that would almost certainly identify the family as deportable by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Illegal immigrant children now in grades 7 through 12 would not be affected.
The provision would take effect in the 1997-98 academic year, permitting states to deny public education to any illegal immigrant who arrived from then on.
Republican negotiators struck a final deal today after Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, insisted that the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, assess the measure's impact on children two and a half years and five years after the provision takes effect.
Senior Administration officials criticized the compromise as still leaving children out on the street. "We don't want to create a farm system for gang leaders and drug dealers to recruit from," said Rahm I. Emanuel, an aide to Mr. Clinton who follows immigration issues.
House and Senate Republican negotiators, working without bipartisan participation, as is customary in conference committees, resolved several other differences in the bill before presenting it to Democrats as a done deal.
The House had sought to make gaining asylum status more difficult for immigrants who lack valid travel documents and who say they are fleeing persecution. The House would have had a lone immigration officer determine the foreigner's fate, without a judicial review. The compromise allows immigrants a hearing before an immigration judge and a reasonable time to prepare for it.
The House wanted to require that an immigrant's sponsor earn at least 200 percent of the Federal poverty level for a household that included the sponsor's family and the immigrant, a level that would preclude nearly half of all Americans from sponsoring a foreigner. The Senate proposed 125 percent. The compromise was 140 percent if the immigrant was the sponsor's spouse or child, and 200 percent for anyone else. The current level is 100 percent.
The Senate had proposed directing the immigration service to test several mandatory pilot programs in states with many immigrants to find one that best allows employers to verify the legal status of people whom they want to hire. The House wanted to make the programs voluntary, fearing that using a national data base to verify a worker's status could lead to a national identification card. The compromise was to conduct three voluntary pilot programs.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Chief to Resign From Justice Department

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Anne K. Bingaman said today that she would resign as the Justice Department's antitrust chief, leaving behind a record of aggressive enforcement efforts and mixed results.
Mrs. Bingaman, a law professor and antitrust litigator before being appointed to her post in 1993 by President Clinton, said she was leaving for "purely personal reasons" and would return to the private sector, although she did not disclose specific plans. Mrs. Bingaman, who is 53 and married to Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a Democrat, said she would leave her job as the Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division by Nov. 15. 
 "I want to see my 16-year-old son before he goes to college," Mrs. Bingaman said. "I'm going to go back to work to replenish the family finances."
Clinton Administration officials gave no indication of who might replace her, although the most likely candidate, some officials said, was her principal deputy, Joel Klein.
Mrs. Bingaman "made real strides in promoting competition for the benefits of American consumers and maintaining a level playing field for American businesses," Attorney General Janet Reno said.
After 12 years of Republican administrations that brought a free-market, deregulatory approach to antitrust law, Mrs. Bingaman, who represented antitrust plaintiffs while in private practice, took a much more activist role in reviewing mergers, price-fixing allegations and other competition issues.
She cast a wide net, filing cases in far greater numbers than had her predecessors in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
"There came a time in the mid-1980's when the strong consensus for antitrust enforcement that shaped our economy from the early part of the century got lost for a while," Mrs. Bingaman said. "I felt we needed to do important cases, to do strong work, to do it in a non-political way. I think we've done that."
Under Mrs. Bingaman, the Justice Department took an active role in the debate over the continuing deregulation of the telecommunications industry and did extensive work on the competitive implications of the changes sweeping the health care industry. She also gave the antitrust department a more international focus. For example, she developed a program to work with Canada on joint investigations.
Last month, after a two-year investigation, Mrs. Bingaman settled a civil suit with 24 securities firms that had been charged with colluding to inflate their profits from trading shares on the Nasdaq stock market.
Among the other high-profile cases she led was an investigation of the Microsoft Corporation's dominance of the software industry. The Microsoft case ended in a settlement that was widely criticized by Microsoft's competitors as too lenient.
Perhaps her biggest defeat was a criminal case she pursued against the General Electric Company for price-fixing in the industrial diamond industry. The case was quickly thrown out of court by a judge who ruled that the evidence presented by prosecutors was too weak.
Mrs. Bingaman challenged many mergers within industries, often forcing partial divestitures to insure that competition in narrow fields would not be inhibited. In June she gave conditional approval to a major consolidation of the legal publishing industry, giving the go-ahead to the Thomson Corporation's $3.4 billion acquisition of the West Publishing Company only after Thomson agreed to sell 58 of its legal publications and license some services to competitors.
Antitrust experts said that Mrs. Bingaman's activism ran headlong into sweeping changes in the national and global economies that have spurred greater competition, sometimes even as industries consolidated.
"She tried to swing the pendulum back, but I'm not sure how successful she was," said Robert Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
"She tried to be very aggressive, but found it difficult because of the mounting case law that's developed in a world of intensifying competition."
William F. Baxter, who was the Reagan Administration's antitrust chief for three years and who taught antitrust law to Mrs. Bingaman when she was a student at Stanford Law School, said Mrs. Bingaman had done a "very credible job" for the last three years, although "she had a fair amount to learn about antitrust and that resulted in less than optimal case selection" when she first took the post.
In the end, Mr. Baxter said, Mrs. Bingaman did not fundamentally change antitrust policy from where it was when President Bush left office.
"She rattled more cages and sounded gruffer," Mr. Baxter said. "But the cases came out about the same."

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE BILL: A DEMOCRAT;
His Battle Now Lost, Moynihan Still Cries Out

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
After more than three decades of scholarly examination of American poverty and dependency, at a moment when the United States is fundamentally altering the approach to those problems that it has followed since the heady New Deal days of 1935, the gloriously garrulous Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan managed just two sentences on Wednesday.
"The President has made his decision," the New York Democrat said rather sourly about Bill Clinton. "Let us hope it is for the best." 
 These are grim times for the 67-year-old Senator, who sees his country utterly perplexed by the collapse of the family and the failure of the welfare system -- "as baffled," he said, "as England in 1880, trying to figure out why there were people standing in the streets of Manchester, jobless, and what in the world to do about it."
In Mr. Moynihan's eyes, the country is taking a wrong turn, driving off into a trackless wasteland just because the highway is full of potholes.
Not that he holds any brief for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which Congress and the President have now agreed to replace with a system of block grants to states, in the hope that they will find answers the Federal Government seemingly cannot. Far from it. But he doubts local government will do significantly better than national government, certainly not with less money (about $55 billion less over six years) rather than more.
"If you think things can't be worse," he said in an extended talk about the situation on Tuesday, "just you wait until there are a third of a million children in the streets. That's what you're talking about -- children on grates, because there is no money in the states and cities to care for them.
"It is a social risk that no sane person would take, and I mean that."
But lots of people have decided that it is worth taking, not least Mr. Clinton, and the Senator puts much of the blame on liberals, not conservatives.
"For years," Mr. Moynihan said, "whenever the critics said, correctly, that the welfare system was doing more harm than good, and suggested that it be rethought, its defenders screamed 'racism' and 'slavefare.' They did that until there was no public support left at all. Now they are stunned at what they're getting."
Mr. Moynihan has never been one to observe the partisan or ideological niceties. He worked in the Nixon Administration. He called for a period of "benign neglect" for racial issues at a time when oratory was hot. He questioned Mr. Clinton on health care. And today, on the Senate floor, he said things that few other Democrats and few other liberals would dare say.
Conservative social scientists argue against nostrums for changing society, he said, on the ground that no one knows enough. He cited James Q. Wilson of U.C.L.A., John DiIulio of Princeton and William Bennett, the Republican politician, among others, as having warned against the unforeseeable consequences of the new welfare plan. Some effects, he said, "will surely be loathsome."
"Typically liberals think otherwise, to the extent that liberals can be said to think at all," Mr. Moynihan told his colleagues. "The current batch in the White House, now busily assuring us that they were against this all along, are simply lying, albeit they probably don't know when they are lying. They have only the flimsiest grasp of social reality."
A Roman Catholic, Mr. Moynihan praised the nation's Catholic bishops for opposing the measure.
"They admittedly have an easier task with matters of this sort," he said. "When principles are at issue, they simply look them up. Too many liberals, alas, simply make them up."
He was not much less scalding in talking privately earlier in the week, especially about the other Democratic senators. He observed sarcastically that the only one up for re-election this fall, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, voted against the bill. Liberals like John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia and Tom Harkin of Iowa, he said, "hear the public-opinion polls."
"I don't want to sound apocalyptic," Mr. Moynihan said, "but the effect of this on New York could be something approaching an Apocalypse. The Mayor has been curiously passive, but he has sent me a letter estimating the new costs to New York City at about $900 million a year. The New York State Financial Control Board estimated in March that the city's revenues will grow by eight-tenths of 1 percent a year and its spending will grow by 2 percent -- without new welfare spending. Now this. It will be ruinous for us."
One of the first to warn of the consequences of illegitimacy, the Senator shares with many conservatives a sense of alarm at its increase.
"It has reached 50 percent -- half! -- of all births in New York City." he said. "In the Bronx, it is 66.5 percent, in Manhattan 54 percent. No society has ever dealt with this kind of thing. It has hit us like a cyclone, and in our confusion we are doing mad things. The premise of this legislation is that the behavior of certain adults can be changed by making the lives of their children as wretched as possible. This is a fearsome assumption.
"Almost certainly the country will not respond to the get-hold-of-yourself approach we are trying."
So is there no way out of the mess? Are his critics right in suggesting that Mr. Moynihan has given up?
"There are ways to try," he answered. "Wisconsin's plan is worth trying, and some others, but they cost more money, not less. Attending to this kind of social issue is the challenge to America in the next half-century.
"I came to this town in 1961 with the first group that thought it could solve unemployment. Nobody else thought we could do it. Well, it's happened, more or less; we have had full employment for the last five years. We can solve the welfare crisis, but it may take decades. In the meantime, our only hope is to save the children."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Welfare Shift Ends Tortuous Journey

SERIES: THE CLINTON RECORD -- Sixth of seven articles: Welfare

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN and SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

 BODY:
Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton issued a ringing promise to "end welfare as we know it," to "empower people with the education, training and child care they need" to escape the trap of dependency. As President, he proposed to increase welfare spending by $10 billion to accomplish those goals.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton stood at a lectern in the White House and said somberly that he would sign Republican welfare legislation that would cut nearly $55 billion in spending and give states vast new powers to remove people from welfare rolls. 
 The bill, he said, "has serious flaws." But, he added, "This is the best chance we will have for a long time to complete the work of ending welfare as we know it."
In endorsing the Republicans' bill, Mr. Clinton was acquiescing in the most sweeping reversal of domestic social policy since the New Deal -- and in a remarkable retreat from the vision of welfare that he had outlined in 1992. This decision marked the end of a tortuous four-year journey that, in many ways, is emblematic of the way the President has often defied the orthodoxies of his party.
Mr. Clinton had cast himself as a New Democrat with his own welfare plan, but its failure epitomized the missteps of his first two years. He decided to push his overhaul of health care above all, found himself derided as a big-spending old Democrat and wound up being unable to get either proposal passed, even in a Democratic Congress.
Then, after the Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1994 elections and began pressing their conservative social agenda, Mr. Clinton found himself increasingly tangled in a political paradox: He was seeking to take credit for a welfare revolution that he was simultaneously -- and not altogether successfully -- trying to rein in.
In Washington, Republicans and many Democrats were trying to take credit for welfare reform yesterday. But welfare reform did not really start in Washington: out in the states, it has been unfolding on Mr. Clinton's watch and with his sometimes reluctant approval, pushing the national welfare debate in directions that are tougher and arguably meaner than what he talked about in the 1992 campaign.
Long an absolute guarantee of cash benefits for the poor, welfare is already assuming a new shape, in which "recipients" are now "participants" or "clients." They visit "transitional assistance" agencies, where they sign "personal responsibility agreements" and are told to get jobs, or else.
From Boston to Austin, Tex., and Madison, Wis., to Sacramento, Calif., much of this charge is clearly being led by the states themselves, often by Republican governors, and many of those leaders insist that the White House has been too slow and insufficiently bold in confronting welfare reform. And in state after state, the idea of extensive job and skills training has been replaced by a blunter policy that can best be summed up this way: get a job, any job.
Moreover, many states have sought the authority to cut people off of welfare after two years even if they have not been able to find or keep a job, an approach that Mr. Clinton once resisted but is now encapsulated in the Republicans' bill.
The deep divisions in his Administration over how to reform welfare -- indeed, the shifts in Mr. Clinton's own mind -- have been evident in the tortuous negotiations with Congress over the welfare overhaul as well as in the waivers his Administration has granted to more than three dozen states to try new work-focused approaches to welfare.
Some of his allies on his original welfare proposal argue that President Clinton made a fundamental mistake in deciding to push for his health-care plan first. Had Mr. Clinton done welfare reform first, they say, he might have cemented his credentials as a New Democrat and even gained a foothold that might have brought him success on health care.
Perhaps he had that in mind on Wednesday when he spoke of the "duty to seize the opportunity" on welfare. Two years ago, Mr. Clinton's hopes on health care reform were dashed, in part, because he resisted negotiation on a compromise bill when an alternative measure might still have been possible.
But despite that failure, and despite his vetoes of the first two Republican bills, even some of his critics give him credit for establishing a national dialogue on welfare that put the issue on the political agenda and eventually resulted in an overhaul that was all but unimaginable during 12 years of Republican control of the White House.
"It's Nixon in China," said Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington. "If Clinton had been a Republican, the Democrats in Congress would have stopped these waivers in their tracks."
Measured statistically, the changes in the welfare system to date are small. From 1980 to 1993, when President Clinton took office, the welfare population had grown from 10.6 million to 14.1 million. It has since dipped to 12.8 million.
Federal and state spending for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the principal welfare program, has stabilized at about $25 billion, which is equivalent to about 14 percent of Medicare spending or 9 percent of the Pentagon's budget. The Department of Health and Human Services says an average of 650,000 of 4.5 million welfare parents worked each month last year, 140,000 more than in 1992. Nonetheless, the face of welfare has changed markedly, and pressure on recipients to get a job is sweeping the system.
"The main focus here is jobs, jobs, jobs," said Mary L. Pike, a senior counselor in the Pensacola office of Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, where half of the area's welfare clients are routed into a state-mandated work program.
In view of Mr. Clinton's changing positions and of his letting the states take the initiative, many Republicans say it is absurd for him to assert that he has led the charge on welfare reform, especially after his vetoes of the two Republican bills.
"An element of political skill is to recognize a wave when you see it," said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a state in the forefront of imposing work requirements on welfare recipients. "I don't think Bill Clinton created this wave. I think he rode it."
But, said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who was clearly half-hearted at best about the Republican legislation: "It's this partnership. They couldn't do it without us. We couldn't do it without them. So we are married by necessity to this transition."
In these negotiations, and in talks over the Congressional bills, Mr. Clinton also drew lines in the sand against some Republican proposals, then erased them. He had resisted pressure to give up some Federal prerogatives over basic welfare rules. Yet the new bill gives vast authority to the states to set their own rules after receiving lump grants from Washington.
At the same time, both in granting waivers and now in signing the overarching welfare overhaul, the President has begun to condone stricter criteria for letting people stay on welfare, and that means leaving more of the poor without aid.
"The critical thing is, there are really a fair number of people who are going to be cut off," said David T. Ellwood, academic dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who was the official in charge of devising the Clinton plan until resigning a year ago.
"There's some unwillingness on both sides to confront the question of what to do about people who are generally willing to work and can't find a job."
 
The Timing
Election Politics Stall Proposal
The bell-ringing theme that Bill Clinton struck four years ago -- in urging that welfare be a means to a job -- captured a rising public indignation over the open-ended entitlement program and clearly helped to cast him as a New Democrat.
But rather than capitalize on that theme and make it one of the earliest priorities of his Administration, President Clinton instead chose to emphasize health-care reform. He suggested that pushing two sweeping proposals at the same time was too much, and that insuring affordable health care for all was a prerequisite to a meaningful change in the welfare system, anyway.
A number of experts now argue that the decision was a critical political mistake. They say Mr. Clinton should have shown his New Democrat stripes by ending the concept of welfare as an automatic, permanent entitlement before trying to tackle a health-care proposal that famously went nowhere as conservative critics painted it as a classic Old Democrat, big Government program.
By the time Mr. Clinton formally presented a proposal to Congress, in the summer of 1994, the issue had become bogged down in election-year politics and it did not even make it out of the Democratic-controlled Congress. And even Mr. Ellwood, the primary adviser on welfare reform, conceded recently in The American Prospect magazine, "We got hit by a freight train, in part, of course, because our own train moved too sluggishly."
And once the Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1994 elections, their welfare-reform bills would have cleared the way toward stricter time limits and so-called family caps that simply prevented women from collecting more benefits if they had more children, and would have included little of the money that Mr. Clinton had wanted to free up for education and training.
The Republicans sought tougher changes like cutting spending and shifting all welfare policy to the states by giving them block grants to spend as needed. To salvage some piece of his promise, Mr. Clinton hinted last fall that he might accept a compromise, but he was instantly savaged by the left.
Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said at the time, "It is not plausible that Americans will stand by and watch hungry children starve because their mothers did not meet a two-year deadline."
So Mr. Clinton wound up twice vetoing welfare-reform bills, arguing that they were too extreme and and then getting savaged from the right.
"Bill Clinton has been a non-combatant on welfare reform," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is the chairman of the House Republican Conference. "He has preserved welfare as we know it."
Even as they acknowledge the 11th-hour nature of welfare reform at the national level, Clinton Administration officials insist that the President has moved ahead on several elements of his plan to raise more people out of poverty: raising the minimum wage, expanding a tax-credit for low-income workers, and stepping up ways to force parents, mostly fathers, to pay child support.
And while there have changes in the welfare system, neither Mr. Clinton nor any Congressional Republican seems to be enjoying much of an election-year bounce from the welfare issue, although that could of course change with the new national bill. A New York Times poll last month found that 19 percent of Americans agree that there has been "much welfare reform" and that 74 percent disagree.
Of people who have seen a change, only 25 percent give primary credit to the President, and 8 percent credit the Republican-controlled Congress, while 57 percent credit state governments.
 
The States
Rules Are Waived To Press Reform
With the continuing stalemate in Congress, it was behind the scenes, in negotiating with the states over waivers of Federal regulations, that President Clinton first joined the task of changing the system.
In agreements his Administration works out with the states, the President has shown more clearly than in any other way how far he is willing to go. And for the most part, Mr. Clinton was reluctant to agree to rules as tough as the states wanted to impose.
Karan Maxson, an administrator in the Illinois Public Aid Department who negotiates waivers with Washington, said, for example, that Illinois wanted to cut off a mother's welfare payment if after six months she still refused to help find her children's father so the state can pursue him for child support. Instead, Ms. Maxson said, Washington had asked that the checks be continued if the mother cooperated by offering some clues to the father's whereabouts, like a Social Security number.
Another issue is income that recipients do not divulge to case workers. "We're negotiating for a waiver to immediately eliminate assistance for not reporting earnings," Ms. Maxson said. "But the Feds have a concern. They're asking, 'What if the person is still not working?' "
An even bigger battleground is in Massachusetts, where Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, is running for the Senate against the incumbent, John F. Kerry, a Democrat.
Last year, the Democrat-controlled Legislature passed a law reshaping the welfare system in Massachusetts. Its provisions include one restricting a family's welfare cash assistance to two years, even if the parent has not found work.
In cases of unusual hardship, said Joseph Galland, the Director of the Department of Transitional Assistance, the state would help. But Mr. Galland said the state wanted the right to decide to extend benefits, not let Washington pre-empt it, and he suggested that the state's criteria would be tougher.
"Only with a strict two-year time-limit," Mr. Galland said, "can welfare recipients break the pattern of moving on and off welfare. At some point, you have to intervene in that process and develop the sense that work is the only answer. We're saying you have to take responsibility for your life."
Negotiating the provisions of the state law consumed eight months last year and, according to Mr. Galland's log, 81 telephone conferences with Ms. Shalala's staff at Health and Human Services, 19 with the Agriculture Department, which issues Food Stamps, and 11 with the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
The Administration approved all provisions but one -- the cut-off after two years. Gerald Whitburn, the Secretary for Health and Human Services in Massachusetts until June, when he resigned for a job in the private sector, said: "Shalala just jammed us. She just pre-empted the whole thing."
But Ms. Shalala explained her decision this way: "I think it was a pretty fundamental disagreement. And that is whether someone who played by the rules and tried desperately to find a job, whether he and his kids, or she and her kids, would be thrown out. Or whether there had to be protection."
Now, with the start of his re-election campaign, the issue of the two-year cutoff has popped up again, and the President has clearly yielded some ground. With that and his support of other stringent features of state plans, advocates of the poor have concluded that Mr. Clinton, while wanting to retain some Federal prerogatives over welfare, favors a tougher policy. That is all the more clear with his announcement on Wednesday.
"Before the Clinton Administration began granting states waivers," said Mark H. Greenberg, senior staff attorney for the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington, "there was a recognition that efforts to expand the participation of parents in work activities had to be balanced with the need to assure a basic level of support for poor families. This principle has been abandoned in some recent waivers."
As she once understood Mr. Clinton on the issue, Heidi Hartmann, the director of the Institute of Women's Policy Research in Washington, said, "As long as a woman was poor and had minor children, the Government would create an opportunity for you to work." Now, Ms. Hartmann said, "there is a question of how much of the safety net he's willing to keep."
Yet some analysts who are more conservative read the President in much the same way. "Clinton is trying to be one half of a degree to the left of where Bob Dole is," said Mr. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute. "He is going as far right as he has to deny Dole the issue. There's probably some line he can't cross with liberals, but they're giving him a lot of running room."
The real tests of political wills and the durability of welfare's new look are yet to come. No one knows for sure how the public will respond when time limits, now mostly a future threat, actually take effect and recipients are cut off. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, predicts that the legislation will prove to be "the most brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction." And no one knows what will happen in the economy's next recession, when tens of thousands of former welfare recipients lose their jobs.
 
The New Welfare
Jobs Get Priority Over Training
In Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign manifesto, Putting People First, he pledged to "empower people with the education, training and child care they need for up to two years so they can break the cycle of dependency." The goal, he said then, was to "make work pay" by preparing people for well-paid, high-skill jobs that would help them attain self-sufficiency.
The Clinton antidote to lifetime welfare seems to be taking hold in the machine shop of Pensacola Junior College. There, under a sign reading "L.T.A.," for lose that attitude, seven women operated engine lathes, milling machines and tool grinders. After completing a seven-month course, they will receive machinists' certificates -- tickets to factory jobs in the area that start at $12 an hour.
Of the 12 women who have enrolled in the course since it started last year, 3 finished and found good jobs and 2 dropped out.
Al Simmons, the instructor, summed up the job market for them by saying, "If you're a machinist and you're out of work, there's something wrong with you."
Sherry Huckaby, 32, working at a grinding wheel, has a daughter and receives a welfare check of $241 a month plus tuition, food stamps and Medicaid and other assistance.
"They don't give you an excuse for not making it," Ms. Huckaby said. "There's a bus pass and money for child care. There's really no excuse anymore."
Yet more and more, states are turning away from experiments like Florida's, born of Federal legislation six years ago to encourage welfare-to-work training. The prescription of training and education has collided with tight Federal and state budgets, resentment among taxpaying workers who try to get ahead without special aid, and a sense that any job, however menial, is a surer first step toward a lifetime of work.
So some welfare recipients are being pushed into short, sometimes one-day, classes in job hunting or up to two-month courses in refreshing basic skills, like reading and math. The states then send them to the job-placement case workers or the state employment service.
They make exceptions primarily for recipients who have not finished high school and whom they steer into courses leading to the equivalent of a high school diploma. Others recipients can get help with courses like those at Pensacola Junior College but only if they are also holding down a job.
LaDonna A. Pavetti, a researcher at the Urban Institute, has studied recent changes that many states have made in their welfare programs.
"Welfare is very different today," Ms Pavetti said. "Work mandates are much stronger than they ever have been. And there's been a huge shift from job training and education to direct job placement."
The shift is particularly apparent in Indiana, which leads the nation with a 30 percent decline of welfare cases since Mr. Clinton became President. "We have shifted from education and training to work first," said Cheryl Sullivan, the Secretary for Family and Social Services in Indiana.
Like most states, Indiana is pouring money that might have paid for training into child care so parents can go to work. The Clinton Administration now urges getting a job soon, too.
"We are scared of keeping people out of the work force too long," Secretary Shalala said in an interview. "The important thing is to get people into work as quickly as possible and then sustain them in the job."
To encourage working, the states, with President Clinton's support, also punish recipients who do not show up for the crash courses and job-hunting help. In Indiana, which is typical of many states, a recipient loses her share of a welfare check for two months for the first infraction, for a year for the second and for three years for the third.
Jeannette Barlow of Indianapolis, who has a 12-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, said she had always worked until three or four years ago, when she began caring for her ailing mother.
Ms. Barlow, 35, said she had been collecting a welfare check of $288 a month. She has lost about $90 because her daughter moved in with her father, and then for May and June, she lost $90 and her Medicaid coverage as well, so only her son was covered.
"I guess it was about me not coming to classes," Ms. Barlow said of the second cut. Of the first, she said she felt that the state had been unfair because she still helps support her daughter, who visits on weekends.
"But the President established that they want to get people off welfare," she said. "They just want you to get a job. They don't even ask who's going to take care of your children."
By contrast, Jennifer Iverson of Salt Lake City came up against Utah's redoubled emphasis on work two years ago when her son, Chandler, was 5 months old.
"I got this caseworker," Ms. Iverson said, "and she wanted to know, like right away, 'What are your plans? What are your goals?' Her goals were to get me to go to work right away, go to school, all this stuff. I didn't want to leave the baby so early."
Today Ms. Iverson, 25, works nine hours a day four days a week as a receptionist and hygienist's assistant at a dental center and is at Salt Lake Community College two hours a day studying for a hygienist certificate while still receiving welfare benefits.
"I really felt pressured," Ms. Iverson said. But she added: "It's much better now. People need to be pushed."
 
The Jobs
Low Pay Prevents Self-Sufficiency
At a welfare office near the vast Robert Taylor Homes housing project on the South Side of Chicago, a waiting-room television monitor repeatedly plays a tape about the program that Illinois calls Work Pays. Fake dollar bills cover the walls, all with an inscription: "Earn money for your family."
Or else.
Bendetta Finley, 43, the mother of three and the grandmother of four who has been on and off welfare since 1991, gripped the paperwork that a caseworker handed her.
"I've got a sheet with 20 empty spaces on it," Miss Finley said. Each is a line to be signed by employers whom she asks for a job. Refuse to look for work, and the state will slash her welfare check.
As she waited on a hard plastic chair in the Illinois Department of Public Aid's Oakland office in Chicago, Miss Finley said she truly wanted a job.
"I have a high school diploma," she said. "I love to work. I'm not a lazy person."
Miss Finley has been a file clerk, a high-school recreation aide, a housekeeper, a food service worker and an assembly line worker in a sugar-packing plant. Most left her on welfare.
"I'm hoping for a guaranteed job," she said. "I hope it would be a good paying job from $6 to $8 an hour."
Miss Finley can look for more help than ever before. States offer many other carrots to drive people into jobs, like a year or two of free child care and even bus fare, work tools and uniforms. They let recipients keep more of their wages than they could a few years ago, when a dollar was clipped from each they earned.
Illinois, probably the most generous state in this respect, now cuts the check by $1 for every $3 three they earn until their earnings have lifted them to the point where they are earning enough to live on.
Still, Miss Finley could be disappointed. The jobs available to most welfare recipients leave them short of the goal of self-sufficiency that President Clinton set four years ago. Jobs in the inner city are scarce even when the economy thrives, and most are low-wage or part-time or both. So even people who do find jobs are still poor, often remaining eligible for public assistance.
Kathryn F. Worthen, the Oakland welfare office administrator, reports some real gains in recent months. By June this year, her case load had dropped to 6,754 households, from 7,836 households in June last year. And almost 13 percent of her cases, or 857 people, had paying jobs in June, compared with 512 and 6.5 percent a year earlier.
But all these new workers remain on welfare because of low earnings. Just 28 others found jobs with high enough wages to leave the welfare rolls in June. In addition, many new jobs evaporate as fast as they open. In June, Ms. Worthen said, 204 people started paid jobs.
"And," she said, "72 others reported that their earnings stopped." May was worse; 168 people took jobs and 80 lost them.
In a survey to which 24 of the 80 responded, Ms. Worthen said 9 reported that they were let go because the jobs were temporary or seasonal. Four quit because of child care problems, two were dismissed, and most others quit because of changes in their hours or the job left town.
Four years ago, Mr. Clinton proposed wider use of community service employment as a better-than-nothing, get-out-of-the-house alternative for work-ready people who could not find real jobs. But because the jobs pay nothing and the workers keep collecting their welfare benefits in lieu of pay, community service does nothing to reduce the Government's cost of welfare.
Nor do the jobs raise the spirits of the people who are steered into to them to meet government demands that they work.
"You're dealing with a client who's been in the system for years and years," said Geneva Seerattan, a job counselor in a branch of the Massachusetts employment service that has opened to expedite job placement.
"To begin with, they have no skills. They need paid training programs, but there are not enough training programs for them. The employers are getting you for nothing. They say they don't have the money to hire them."
The clients "are frustrated," Ms. Seerattan said, adding: "We feel it. I leave here frustrated. You hurt."
Still, one occupation is flourishing in the new world of welfare. So more mothers can go to work, the Federal Government and the states are paying the fast-growing cost for day care and baby-sitting. The result is a growing corps of mothers who go to work caring for the children of other mothers who go to work.
In the Somerville welfare office, Alta Dejesos, 33, on and off welfare for more than a decade, waited to pick up a child care voucher to give the woman who cares for her 3-year-old daughter, Jesica.
The voucher has freed Ms. Dejesos to start a $9-an-hour job in March as an aide at a day care center. To qualify, she said, she took a course for five hours a day in child care and worked as a community service volunteer three to four hours a day at the day care center. "I'm really happy," she said. "It's good to be on my own."
 
The Future
Some Issues Remain, But There Is Accord
Even though the President and the Congress have at last reached agreement on a welfare overhaul, many contentious issues remain unresolved. For one thing, Mr. Clinton flatly stated on Wednesday that he believed that parts of the new bill were deeply flawed, and he promised to fight for revisions to those sections.
He said that the roughly $24 billion in cuts in food stamps projected by Congress over the next six years were too deep and that the limits on food stamps for unemployed workers not raising children were also too harsh.
He also said the provisions blocking legal immigrants in the country from receiving an array of social services were unfair. He said the new rules "hurt legal immigrants in America, people who work hard for their families, pay taxes, serve in our military." He described the approach as "simply a budget-saving measure, and it is not right."
And despite the new authority that would be granted the states to make their own welfare rules, such powers are far from absolute. Over the next several months and, if he is re-elected, for much longer than that, the President and his top officials will still find themselves enmeshed in negotiations with the states over welfare rules. These talks will have echoes of those over the welfare waivers.
Still, for all the disagreements on these issues, there remains an interesting area of agreement, one that vividly shows just how much the national dialogue over welfare has moved in the past few years: the language they use.
Evoking Clintonian language, for instance, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who is a Republican, said last fall in hailing his state's welfare overhaul, "This landmark day marks the end of welfare as we know it and the beginning of a new, empowered life for aid recipients."
Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, another Republican, talking about his own plan, said, "We are marking the end of welfare as we have known it and replacing it with an approach that emphasizes self-sufficiency."
And Beverly Hardy, a supervisor in a welfare office in Utah, said the President's statements on the issue were probably an important factor in her state's approval of a new work-based welfare program.
"I think he made it easier for politicians to buy off on welfare reform," Ms. Hardy said. "Given what politicians like Bill Clinton were saying nationally, everyone knew it was something that was coming."

HEADLINE: THE WELFARE BILL: A REPUBLICAN;
Kasich Tells Governors to Stop 'Bellyaching' About Measure

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Representative John R. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, today admonished governors who have complained about parts of the Republican-sponsored welfare plan "to stop bellyaching."
Mr. Kasich, an Ohio Republican, said states like New York, whose Constitution requires the government to care for the needy, should consider changing their laws. 
 In the debate leading up to the approval of the welfare bill, which ends the Federal guarantee of cash assistance to the poorest children and gives the states sweeping new powers, some state and local officials have stepped up their criticism of certain provisions in the bill. Republicans like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Pete Wilson of California were at the forefront of the criticism.
Both New York and California have large numbers of legal immigrants, and, among other things, the measure would bar benefits to non-citizens. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Wilson have complained that the provision denying welfare services to many legal immigrants was a last-minute addition by House Republicans that was prompted primarily by a desire to cut the budget.
But in a breakfast meeting with reporters today, Mr. Kasich noted that the New York Constitution's provision mandating "aid, care and support of the needy" was about as old as the Federal welfare guarantee that Republicans were now dismantling.
"That was about 60 years ago, too," he said. "It's time for folks to move. When my grandmother and grandfather came to America, they didn't come over here figuring out if they could get food stamps or not; they didn't come here to try to figure out how to get on the dole. That's just silly.
"It is not unexpected that Governors will say, 'Oh, woe is me, look how tough this is going to be.' But this bill was put together with the full knowledge and the full support of the Republican governors. I think the governors ought to just stop bellyaching because we gave them the great opportunity to participate in this and, frankly, I'm interested in them running their program and doing their job.
"Get on with it."
While President Clinton's decision to sign the welfare bill angered many liberals, it denied a major political weapon to his likely Republican opponent this fall, Bob Dole.
"It seems like no matter what happens, Clinton wins," Mr. Kasich said. "No matter what we do -- if we get something done, he wins; if we don't get something done, he wins."
But Mr. Kasich said that while the bill did not help Republicans so much among their own party members, "it scores a direct hit with the hearts and souls of Reagan Democrats, who we have been not relating to since the days of Ronald Reagan."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls After Jobs Report Suggests No Rise in U.S. Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower yesterday after a July employment report bolstered expectations that United States interest rates would remain steady.
The dollar surged briefly in early New York trading, following the stock and bond markets higher after the Labor Department reported that 193,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in July, fewer than what most economists had expected. The report also showed that hourly earnings declined by 2 cents. 
 But the positive impact from stocks and bonds was soon offset by an outlook on interest rates that was viewed as a negative for the dollar. Data that point to healthy growth with tame inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve would have little need to raise interest rates when its policy makers meet on Aug. 20.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4750 German marks, down from 1.4762 marks on Thursday. The dollar also fell to 106.89 Japanese yen from 107.13 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5520 from $1.5527.
"Between yesterday's numbers and today's, the market is fairly well convinced we are not going to see a rate hike in August," said Rich Marra, a dealer with the HSBC Midland Bank.
Higher interest rates tend to make a country's assets relatively more attractive, which bolsters the currency.
"The dollar is perhaps not being able to benefit from the bond and equity rallies because people have questions about expected rates of return," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst with Smith Barney.
The dollar was weaker against the yen in Asian trading amid persistent talk of an imminent increase in Japanese interest rates.
German rates may also have bottomed out as the market waits anxiously to see whether the Bundesbank will further cut its chief money market rate, the securities repurchase rate.
"People are wary of buying the dollar because of interest rate differentials," Mr. Marra of HSBC Midland said.
In other currency trading, dealers said heavy sales of British pounds for yen in Asia sent the Japanese currency broadly higher against the dollar, the mark and other European currencies.
The pound was sold after the British Government said experiments had shown that cows could pass on mad cow disease to their calves, which could delay the lifting of the European Union's ban on British beef.

HEADLINE: New Nassau County Legislature Draws Crowds and Critics

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 30

 BODY:
Measured by public attendance, the fledgling band of lawmakers that took office here Jan. 1 as the newly created Nassau County Legislature is a hit.
Unlike the Board of Supervisors it replaced, the Legislature regularly draws overflow crowds to its wood-paneled chamber. With a fire code limiting the audience to 175, even county officials have had to talk their way past security guards. 
 Civic advocates had hoped that the Legislature, with more varied and responsive members than the old board, would shepherd this affluent suburban county of 1.3 million people into the next century with a vision of "the new Nassau."
But after seven months, there is a growing debate over the Legislature. Defenders say it is making a difference, but critics see it as a reincarnation of the old Nassau and its vaunted Republican Party.
The Nassau G.O.P. -- best known as United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's home base -- has long had state and national clout. Presidential candidates have paid homage to its voter turnouts and fund-raising powers.
The Board of Supervisors, where Senator D'Amato got his start, was a central feature of Nassau politics. Through three decades of constitutional challenges, Republicans fought to preserve the six-member board and its complex system of weighted votes, fearing Democratic victories in a new legislative map.
But when the courts finally abolished the board for violating the one-person-one-vote principle, the Republicans turned the 19 new districts to their advantage, winning 13 seats.
The new system also created a powerful position -- second only to the County Executive -- in the legislature's Presiding Officer. The Republicans filled it with Bruce A. Blakeman, 40, a novice Hempstead Town Councilman and a lawyer with movie-star looks who was being groomed for a promising future.
Mr. Blakeman gives the Legislature a grade of A. "I'm told that we've handled as much if not more legislation in the first six months than the Board of Supervisors did in any similar period in years," he said.
But the new body has quickly acquired a chorus of critics. They say that its procedures at meetings are squelching public access, that legislators are exerting little oversight on county agencies and that they are failing to tackle Nassau's overriding problems, like high taxes and electric rates, Balkanized government and the struggle for economic revival after cuts in military contracts.
"I'm disappointed, very disappointed," said Phoebe Goodman, director of the nonprofit Nassau Citizens Budget Commission.
Bruce Nyman, the Legislature's Democratic minority leader and the only carryover from the old board, gives the Legislature a C, so far.
Perhaps the ultimate criticism came in a recent legislative session when Frank B. Abrami, a retiree from Seaford, barked: "You guys are worse than the Board of Supervisors." After waiting hours to speak at the public forum following the session, Mr. Abrami, fuming, contended that few legislators had remained to listen because they were attending committee meetings scheduled at the same time.
Mr. Abrami is one of hundreds drawn to each meeting, where the audience sometimes steals the show. At one meeting, angry pesticide sprayers turned out in force to protest pending legislation. A crowd arguing for changes on a minority affairs panel included a man in a leather Indian costume with a feathered headdress. Amid the turmoil, a heckler who demanded Indian representation called Mr. Blakeman "General Custer."
Last month, Mr. Blakeman gaveled an abrupt end to a nasty exchange between Legislator Roger Corbin, a Democrat who is black, and Michael A. Fiechter, a Conservative who is white. When Mr. Corbin called Mr. Fiechter "a right-winger," Mr. Fiechter accused Mr. Corbin of "race baiting" and of being "an Al Sharpton."
Mostly, however, legislators have been collegial. Mr. Corbin opened one meeting by singing the national anthem, to bipartisan applause.
"The Legislature has certainly stimulated interest -- now it seems every meeting is jammed," said the county historian, Edward J. Smits. "Why, I'm not sure. It has no more power than the supervisors did."
Novelty may be a drawing card. Another may be the Legislature's makeup.
In its 96 years of existence, the six-member Board of Supervisors was dominated by older, white, male Republican lawyers. It never had a black member, and no more than one woman at a time.
By contrast, the 19 legislators include two blacks, four women, six Democrats and a Conservative. The average age is 42. Lawyers still predominate, but there are an accountant, an insurance executive, a real estate manager and a betting parlor manager.
So far, the Legislature has handled issues ranging from the trivial, like jockeying with county administrators over the Legislature's reserved parking spots, to the fundamental, like threatening to overrule county regulatory agencies after the health board tightened smoking restrictions.
Striking an innovative note, the Legislature's first law required that neighbors be notified before homeowners allowed commercial pesticide sprayers on their land. Although a judge promptly overturned the law, Mr. Blakeman credits it with fostering a similar state proposal and the adoption of a state law creating a pesticide sales registry and breast-cancer research fund.
The pesticide law fueled fear among some that the Nassau County Legislature would replay the record of the neighboring Suffolk Legislature, which years ago drew national attention with aggressive moves like banning phosphate detergents and trying to outlaw plastic foam containers and regulate computer terminals.
Most critics, in fact, contend that the Nassau Legislature has been passive.
"The Legislature raised expectations of 'the new Nassau,' but it's been more the old Nassau plus 13 members," said Richard Kessel, a Democrat who held appointed state posts in the Cuomo administration and unsuccessfully sought the party's nomination for Nassau County Executive in 1993. "At some point they have to become more pro-active and grapple with the big issues. The honeymoon period is about up."
Mr. Blakeman predicted that the Legislature would become more assertive. "As we develop more expertise," he said, "I think you'll see a lot more of that."
Critics also call for more open procedures. They want a bigger meeting room, more meetings at night and in sites around the county, more advance notice of committee meetings, informative agendas, more rights for the public to speak and more legislators on hand to listen.
"It's got the trappings and form of democracy, but it isn't really," Ms. Goodman of the citizens budget committee said. "The rules they have established seem to be designed to keep people out."
When the charter commission created the Legislature, "there were much higher hopes for the deliberative process," said Neal M. Lewis, an environmental advocate who served on the panel. "Now, too often we get people jammed in with lots of screaming in a circuslike atmosphere. At a committee meeting they were discussing a mission statement that we couldn't see and were not allowed to comment on. Why all this secrecy?"
This fall's budget season promises to be a $2 billion wrangle to round out the Legislature's baptism.
"Their biggest test is yet to come," said Supervisor Gregory P. Peterson of Hempstead, a Republican. "The budget will test whether they are a real benefit or just another layer of government."
In preparation, the Legislature hired as its chief budget adviser Timothy Sullivan, a Democrat who is a top aide to the New York City Council. Even critics praised the choice.
Mr. Blakeman and the Legislature got off to a bumpy start. Although he has settled into his role with displays of wit and poise, at first he ruffled political feathers in both parties, drawing complaints of inexperience and highhandedness.
Fellow Republican legislators grumbled privately about Mr. Blakeman. Publicly, they balked at his plan to let displaced flea-market vendors from the old Roosevelt Raceway rent the Nassau Coliseum site on weekends.
Joseph N. Mondello, the party chairman, acknowledged he had refereed a few of the party disputes, but went on to praise Mr. Blakeman. "He's certainly a prize race horse in the stable," he said. "He's a quick study, bright as a penny, quite handsome. Bruce has demonstrated leadership ability. He's young, and there's a learning process."
Strife between Mr. Blakeman and the minority Democrats was more blatant. They walked out when they felt Mr. Blakeman had cut them off. He hastily patched up that feud.
The arrival of Mr. Blakeman and the Legislature is also changing the county's political landscape.
County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, presided over the Board of Supervisors. He has no legal role in the new Legislature and does not even appear at its meetings. Likewise, the town and city supervisors who served on the county board have retreated to running their local governments.
"There's no question our role is diminished," said Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, a Democrat and a possible candidate for county executive.
"Truthfully, there are times that I miss it," he added.
Although some politicians say relations between Mr. Gulotta and the Legislature are distant, Mr. Blakeman called them cordial and said communications were improving. Mr. Gulotta has called the Legislature a needed reform and said that despite the inevitable growing pains and maneuvering, it remains a beneficial change.
John V. N. Klein, who as Suffolk County Executive dealt with its legislature in its early years, also sees the Nassau body as a work in progress. "So far, it's not all bad," he said, "but then they've only been in office for six months."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
World Bank Fund to Help Poor Countries

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Taking the first step toward a new strategy to stimulate the flow of billions of dollars in private capital to the developing world, the World Bank has effectively set aside $250 million that could be used to guarantee new investment in poor countries against expropriation and other political risks.
James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's new president, asked the bank's executive directors, who represent its member governments and shareholders, to "reserve" $250 million from last year's earnings as seed money for a new fund. The directors, particularly the Americans, appear very sympathetic to the idea, officials say. 
 Still, the officials said, the board, meeting on Thursday, stopped short of committing the money. Instead, they decided to put it in escrow until Mr. Wolfensohn has given them a detailed blueprint of the fund for approval.
"A majority of the board has expressed clear interest in this idea, but the board wants a sound proposal before it will finance the scheme," Mark Mallock-Brown, the World Bank's vice president for communications, said yesterday.
This campaign reflects the fact that while World Bank lending, coupled with other forms of development aid, totaled $64 billion in 1995, it was dwarfed by the flow of private investment into developing countries, which amounted to $167 billion. But 80 percent of this sum was concentrated in 12 better-off countries, including China, Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil, while next to nothing went to the poorest nations.
By insuring private money against unfriendly government action, Mr. Wolfensohn and the directors reason, the institution could encourage far greater investment in developing areas of the world and spread the money around more evenly.
"We are convinced there is a great deal of private money ready to flow into even the poorest developing countries if investors are sure contracts will be honored, and the bank could have a critical catalytic role in promoting these investments," Richard H. Frank, the managing director in charge of the World Bank's private sector operations, said in a recent interview.
Currently, the World Bank estimates there are total infrastructure financing needs of $200 billion to $300 billion a year in the developing world and in former Communist countries making the transition to capitalism.
It estimates foreign private investors would be willing to finance about a quarter of this, or $50 billion to $70 billion, thus substantially reducing poverty in these countries, if they had guarantees against non-commercial risks.
The $250 million the World Bank is putting aside as a possible beginning of the new guarantee fund is minuscule in comparison with the need. But World Bank officials argue that it is intended only as a token of official interest in the project while they draw up detailed plans for it.
They also calculate that the fund could extend guarantees worth 10 times its capital -- just as insurance companies' reserves are calculated on the assumption that only a certain percentage of insured people -- not all -- will file claims each year.
This means that if the World Bank put $2 billion from its profits into the fund over the next few years, it would be able to guarantee $20 billion in new private investment.
This would probably unleash a far greater capital flow into poor countries. In May, for example, the World Bank enticed private investors into backing Pakistan's $630 million Uch power project by offering $75 million worth of guarantees.
But such guarantees, which are extended on a limited basis, both directly and through the bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, cannot be extended to the poorest countries. They are ineligible to borrow from the bank because if a guarantee were called, it would be converted into a World Bank loan that they could not afford to repay.
In addition, the guarantee agency, known as MIGA, is underfunded, with only $100 million of paid-up capital but more than $2 billion worth of insured risk on its books and applications for an additional $1.5 billion next year.
At this year's annual World Bank ministerial meeting in October, Mr. Frank said, management will press member governments to increase MIGA's capital so that it can safely insure a greater volume of private third world investment. As part of its effort to encourage private investment in developing countries, the World Bank will also announce new procedures to speed up and simplify the processing of guarantee applications.
In addition, the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank agency that encourages foreign companies to invest in the developing world by taking a stake in their projects, is looking for private partners to join it in 16 developing countries where it is not yet operating.
But these arrangements have two principal shortcomings for guaranteeing private investors against political risk, and World Bank officials hope that by the time of the annual meetings they will be able to address them through plans for the new guarantee fund.
The first shortcoming is that under its statutes the World Bank can extend a loan to a country or guarantee a private investment there only if it has a reciprocal guarantee from the country's government that the loans will be repaid as a first call on its resources.
Increasingly, however, in the developing world projects like power plants, water treatment facilities, ports and roads are being built by municipalities and other local authorities, rather than the central government, rendering them ineligible for World Bank assistance.
The second difficulty is that the least developed countries are so poor they are ineligible for World Bank loans or guarantees and receive little foreign private investment.
These countries currently receive assistance from the International Development Association, the World Bank's soft-loan window, which lends them 50-year money at notional rates of interest.
Last year the World Bank suggested that the I.D.A. might also guarantee private investments in these countries. But several donor countries objected, arguing that scarce I.D.A. resources should be confined to development projects directly alleviating poverty and not used to underwrite private industrial ventures, even though such ventures contribute to economic growth.

HEADLINE: Agency Proposes Cut in Lilco Rates

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Aug. 2

 BODY:
Citing "poor economic conditions on Long Island" linked to high electric costs, the staff of the State Public Service Commission proposed a 5.2 percent reduction today in rates of the Long Island Lighting Company.
Lilco immediately objected, saying the reduction would jeopardize service and reliability for its more than one million customers by cutting its operating and maintenance budget by $55.7 million a year. 
 The commission is to meet on Sept. 11 to decide whether the company's rates should be reduced. Lilco rates are the highest in the continental United States.
Hearings are scheduled in the commission's New York City offices on Wednesday and Thursday. Suffolk County has called for an 11 percent rate reduction. The commission's rulings often vary from the recommendations of its staff.
The staff proposed that Lilco refund to its customers, in the form of lower rates, $76 million it received from Suffolk County for an overly high assessment of the Shoreham nuclear power plant. It said that any future payments from the county in related cases should also be refunded to customers.
The staff also called for a refund in rates of $5 million from lower-than-expected costs for operating the Nine Mile 2 nuclear plant, upstate in Scriba. Lilco owns 18 percent of the plant.
The staff said the 5.2 percent reduction should take effect on Oct. 1. It would include a $66.1 million cut in base rates and $24.1 million in fuel cost reductions.
A Lilco spokeswoman, Stefanie Gossin, said the cut could hamper the company's ability to restore power promptly after major storms.

HEADLINE: Bonds Continue Strong Rally On a Modest Growth in Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday after employment data for July showed economic growth slowing with little inflation. The rally pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- to a four-month low.
Bond prices rallied for a fourth consecutive day after the Labor Department reported that 193,000 jobs were created in July, fewer than expected. After a series of employment reports blind-sided investors with unexpected strength earlier this year, yesterday's data confirmed recent signs that economic growth was cooling from a robust pace in the second quarter. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 111/32 , to 9027/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.73 percent, from 6.83 percent on Thursday, and was the lowest since April 4, when it was 6.67 percent.
The jobs report, combined with a report on consumer spending and recent data on gross domestic product and employment costs, suggest that the Federal Reserve will have little need to raise short-term interest rates to moderate growth when its policy makers meet on Aug. 20.
"Basically what the economic numbers have told us this week is that economic growth should slow to a moderate pace in the second half of the year, after special factors boosted it in the first half," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York,
Mr. Palash also cited the Commerce Department's July report on consumer spending, which showed a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent.
"This suggests the Fed will keep policy steady at least through August and probably through the elections," he said. "And with more evidence of a slowdown in growth and low inflation, the bond market should continue to do well once it is past the Government's quarterly refunding auctions next week. This could put the yield on the long bond at around 6.5 percent in the months ahead."
The risk for the market now, Mr. Palash said, is that if the rally is too strong in the coming months, lower interest rates will cause growth to pick up again in late 1996 and early 1997. And given that the economy is operating at close to full capacity, the risks of inflation will reappear, he said.
Other data yesterday included the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for July, which was consistent with other confidence surveys, traders said, and factory orders for June, which were weaker than expected.
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., said that bond market speculators, who had been trying to guess the direction of interest rates, were overlooking the stability of prices.
"The Fed's goal is price stability, as long was we have that there is no reason to tinker with the economic fundamentals that they have control over," he said. Bonds, he said, have "made up virtually all that was lost during July, reversing the Fed tightening outlook."
"This is the summer rally," he added. "If you blink you'll miss it."
Traders said the prospect of next week's $39 billion quarterly refunding might have raised concerns about the market's ability to absorb new supply.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the new three-year note, which will be auctioned on Tuesday, was being offered at a price to yield 6.08 percent. The 10-year note, which will be sold on Wednesday, was being offered at a price to yield 6.51 percent, while the 30-year bond, which will be sold on Thursday, was being offered at a price to yield 6.69 percent.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say Dole's Economic Forecasts Are Far Too Rosy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
During last year's budget battle, Bob Dole and his fellow Republicans accused the Clinton Administration of using unrealistically rosy assumptions of economic growth to make its deficit-cutting plan add up, and insisted that the White House use more conservative numbers.
Now, as Democrats wait for Mr. Dole to finish the tax-cutting package he is expected to announce on Monday as the centerpiece of his Presidential campaign, they point out with some glee that the Dole plan contains arguably rosy numbers of its own. Among them is an assumption that the Dole program will increase growth to more than 3 percent in coming years, far higher than current Republican budget proposals assume. 
 Just how much additional growth a sweeping tax cut might generate is a matter of fevered debate among economists, and the Dole camp argues that any plan it adopts will be built on far more credible projections than those used by the Clinton Administration in its economic planning. But in Mr. Dole's metamorphosis to tax cutter from deficit fighter, political strategists at the White House and in the Democratic Party see a lode of material they can use in their counterattacks, from overly optimistic economic assumptions to Mr. Dole's oft-stated disdain for the theory that tax cuts spur growth and therefore more than help pay for themselves to doubts about Mr. Dole's commitment to deficit reduction.
If the emerging Democratic response is predictable, it nonetheless highlights the political risks for Mr. Dole in pursuing a bold tax plan, and it suggests how intense a fight the two Presidential campaigns are likely to wage over the issue. Indeed, Democratic strategists see the issue as an opportunity to counter Republican attacks on Mr. Clinton's character by portraying Mr. Dole's support for tax cuts as a sign of inconsistency or pandering to the electorate.
"This whole episode raises questions about Dole's leadership," said Ann Lewis, deputy manager of the Clinton campaign. "Dole was best known in Washington for an economic philosophy that emphasized reducing the deficit. Now apparently he is going to come out in favor of a philosophy that he derided."
At the same time, Ms. Lewis said, the Clinton campaign believes that the Dole tax plan will shift the campaign's focus to the economy. And with unemployment and inflation low and new jobs being created at a healthy pace, the economy is a subject the Clinton team is happy to have at center stage, she said.
Democrats said that depending on the Dole's plan structure, its features could also allow them to argue that Republicans were favoring the wealthy over the middle class.
Mr. Dole's campaign aides said their economic plan would be a powerful platform from which to attack Mr. Clinton for raising taxes in 1993 and to expose the economy's performance under Mr. Clinton as anemic. And they said it was Mr. Dole's very reputation as a responsible deficit cutter that would give him credibility in proposing a sweeping tax reduction without sacrificing the Republican pledge to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
Mr. Dole has been deciding between two options. One is built around an across-the-board reduction of up to 15 percent in income tax rates; the other is based on repealing the tax increases passed by Congress in 1990 and 1993. Because the 1990 and 1993 tax increases primarily affected the wealthy, the second option would likely be accompanied by proposals to help the middle class, probably by making payroll taxes deductible.
Seeking to undermine the Dole team's probable reliance on the idea that tax cuts spur growth, or supply-side theory, Administration officials have been circulating public statements made by Mr. Dole and other prominent Republicans over the past year or two deriding that very theory.
In an interview in GQ magazine last year, Mr. Dole was quoted as saying: "What I could never understand is why, if you just cut taxes, you'd have this big, big revenue increase. You know, more jobs, more opportunity. And you didn't have to make hard choices about spending."
Although Mr. Dole has disclosed no details of his plan, his aides said last week that he was looking at tax cuts of up to $600 billion over six years, a huge increase from the $122 billion reserved for tax cuts over the same period in the most recent Republican budget proposal.
Mr. Dole has already proposed numerous other tax and spending initiatives, including a charity tax credit, an exemption from estate taxes for owners of small businesses and the development of a missile defense system that White House advisers, using the Dole campaign's own numbers or independent estimates, calculated would cost $149 billion over six years.
Assuming that the big tax cut to be proposed by Mr. Dole totals $540 billion over six years, and factoring in other proposals he has supported, Mr. Clinton's advisers calculated that Mr. Dole would have to find nearly $750 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases over six years to avoid missing the 2002 target for balancing the budget.
Mr. Dole's team is looking at ways to close the gap, including eliminating Cabinet departments, closing tax loopholes and using favorable assumptions about other tax revenues. His aides said their overall plan would make realistic assumptions about the amount of revenue generated by the additional growth that their program would spur. They have looked at models suggesting that up to 40 percent of a tax cut could be paid for by additional growth, although aides said Mr. Dole was likely to use a lower number.
By the Democratic analysis, even if more than half of the Dole campaign's possible $750 billion in tax cuts and spending increases could be made up through the faster economic growth that tax cuts would bring -- an assumption that Clinton Administration economists say is fantasy -- Mr. Dole would still need to enact all the spending cuts proposed in the Republican budget plan last year. Mr. Clinton successfully portrayed those cuts as extreme, and it is unclear whether Mr. Dole would be willing to run on them.
White House advisers said the best judgment on the credibility of the Dole plan might come not from politicians or even economists, but from the collective judgment of the bond market, where the prospects for deficit reduction and inflation are ruthlessly analyzed by global investors who send long-term interest rates up and down. Administration officials said that their 1993 deficit reduction package, which included a tax increase, and the President's commitment to balancing the budget by 2002 have been major factors in bringing down interest rates and improving the health of the economy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. and Japan Renew a Chip Accord, but With Changes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 2

 BODY:
After marathon negotiating sessions that were laden with election politics on both sides of the Pacific, the United States and Japan agreed today to a new and unusual trade accord governing the computer chip industry, one that reflects the revival of the American electronics industry since the first accord was signed a decade ago.
The agreement will allow President Clinton when he visits Silicon Valley next week to assert that he has pressed Japan into an agreement that keeps up the pressure for continued American expansion in the market that strikes at the heart of Japan's greatest technological strength. 
 But the Japanese Government, which wanted to kill off the chip agreement, signed the new, three-year agreement only after the United States acceded to Tokyo's demand that the two Governments get out of the business of measuring the share of Japan's market that foreign companies have secured.
That statistic, which was a central feature of two past agreements, has long been despised by the powerful Japanese bureaucracy because it has been used to set targets for further inroads into the Japanese market, and was the basis for sanctions imposed against Japan in 1987.
The Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Shunpei Tsukahara, said that Japan had won what it wanted in the negotiations. "We have been able to put an end to a system of managing trade by reviewing market share, taking into account numerical targets," he told reporters.
Both sides will now periodically examine statistics collected by private industry -- though Japan and the United States have measured the market in very different terms.
"Japan and the U.S. have made good on the pledge of President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto to put in place a new agreement," Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said today, before departing for Washington, where Mr. Clinton is soon expected to formally nominate her to the post. "The challenge for us was to put in place a new agreement that recognizes that the Japanese market can no longer be characterized as closed, but that continues our vigilance." Foreign companies now command nearly a third of the Japanese market; American companies have about 20 percent.
But Ms. Barshefsky failed to get the Japanese to move on another important area that Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had agreed in June to settle by July 31: the deregulation of Japan's insurance market. With Japan's big insurance companies reeling from huge real estate and stock market setbacks, the Japanese Government has backpedaled from previous agreements to open the largest part of that market.
The new semiconductor agreement differs from past accords between the United States and Japan in several respects. Unlike the 1986 accord, signed when American companies had 9 percent of the market and there was enormous political pressure on the Reagan Administration to save endangered American companies, this accord will be carried out chiefly by industry associations in the two countries.
The two Governments will only oversee it with what Ms. Barshefsky calls "a light hand" of government supervision. That was one of Japan's key demands after it became clear that in a Presidential election year the Clinton Administration was not ready to let an agreement lapse altogether.
Retaining that light hand was a crucial goal for the American negotiators, who feared that without government involvement, Japanese companies might begin to backslide, buying Japanese-made chips instead of the foreign competition. That pressure could be particularly intense in the next year, because there is an oversupply of many types of computer chips that has depressed prices -- and sharply cut the profitability of chip-making. Those are conditions that would ordinarily lead Japanese executives to press for less competition in their home market.
"We needed some kind of agreement to keep the pressure on in different ways for open markets," said Ira S. Shapiro, who heads negotiations with Japan for the trade representative's office.
The American semiconductor industry applauded the accord. "We are very appreciative of the support from Congress and the Clinton Administration," said William P. Weber, chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and vice chairman of Texas Instruments.
For the first time in the history of trade agreements between the two countries, other nations will be invited to join the semiconductor accord. That is a recognition of the fact that many more countries have begun producing a wide variety of chips -- not only for computers, but also for automobiles, fax machines and every kind of household and industrial equipment. Europe, South Korea, Taiwan and China are all now major semiconductor producers, and the nationality of chips has been further blurred as Japanese and American companies enter joint ventures with each other and build new factories around the world.
But to join the accord, other countries must reduce to zero the protective tariffs they have erected against imports, a market barrier both Japan and the United States have complained about. They are likely to be reluctant to do so, for fear that their own fledgling industries could be overwhelmed by Japanese and American competitors.
The new agreement also sets up a global forum to discuss issues in semiconductor trade, and American officials said today that a number of countries would be invited to enter that group without preconditions. The idea originated with the Japanese, who are eager to get out of one-on-one negotiations with the United States -- in which the United States can bring to bear enormous political pressure on Tokyo, particularly because it is Japan's military protector -- and to place talks in a far more global context.
On the issue of insurance, it was clear that the negotiators here were simply too exhausted to even take up the subject. During the days and nights of continuous talks on semiconductors, Mr. Tsukahara, the Japanese minister, fell asleep several times in the middle of talks with the perpetually active Ms. Barshefsky, who is something of a legend in the world of economic foreign policy for her ability to operate for days on end with no sleep. Her relentlessness has surprised the Japanese negotiators, whose war stories about scores of trade negotiations usually center on their ability to stay awake longer than their American opponents.
"You know, life was easier dealing with Kantor," one Japanese negotiator mumbled to another in an elevator during a break in the talks in this Pacific port, chosen because it is roughly halfway between Tokyo and Washington. He was referring to Mickey Kantor, the former trade representative and now the Commerce Secretary.
Despite the Japanese complaints, however, American negotiators were hard pressed to come up with the specifics of what they had won in the talks.
Indeed, Japanese officials declared that the vague language in the accord today was a victory, in large part because it ended what they consider was one their biggest political blunders in decades: setting a "target" for foreign penetration of their markets.
By eliminating that provision, Prime Minister Hashimoto, a former trade and finance minister who is likely to face an election himself in the next six to eight months, can say that he has once again blunted American demands. And for Japanese prime ministers, the traditional winning political formula is to show that you can stand up to Washington in economic disputes, without threatening the broader alliance between the United States and Japan.
"Hashimoto and Clinton can both go and declare victory," one senior Japanese official here said today. "And that is what made the deal work."

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON RECORD: THE ECONOMY;
Excerpts From an Interview With Clinton on the Economy

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President Clinton conducted July 8 with reporters and editors of The New York Times:
 
ON HIS ECONOMIC RECORD
I think that what we have done as Americans, not just the President and not just the President and the Federal Reserve Chairman, but the whole -- or the President and the Congress or the economic planners -- but as Americans, what we have done in the last four years is to put our economic house in order, restore growth and create opportunity. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit, expanding trade, targeting investment in critical areas, and we have over 10 million new jobs.
 
ON WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
Now, what's missing in this picture? I think you have to ask yourself what's missing in this picture in the second term. What's missing in this picture is that not every American has the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities. Of these 10 million new jobs, I should point out, it is no longer true that most of them are part-time, lower-wage jobs. Two thirds of these jobs almost are in higher-wage job categories. But there is still a lot of stagnation and insecurity in the picture. So what's missing in this picture? How are we going to give all Americans who are responsible the opportunity to succeed?
And I would argue that, therefore, this naturally leads us to the next set of initiatives. And I think that in my second term, I would focus much, much more on education.
 
ON HELPING FAMILIES
Then I think the next big issue here on the economy is to focus on how hard it is still for people with children in the work force, whether they're single parents or if they're in two-parent, two-worker households, to succeed at home and at work. It sounds so simple, but our country could really have no more important social goal than to make it possible for everyone to succeed at home and at work because it's obvious that with most parents in the work force now, if they have to choose between one or the other, their choice is society's loss; we either weaken the ecconomy or we weaken the family and the fabric of child-rearing, which is even worse over the long run.
 
ON THE ODDS OF A TAX INCREASE
I can pledge to you that there won't be if Congress will adopt my program. The program has now been presented in the Congress and is fully paid for. In other words, I don't plan -- I don't see why we should have a tax increase to balance the budget. That's the only reason -- even the tax increase from the wealthy, I didn't do it because I thought it would be fun to increase people's taxes. I did it because we had to have $500 billion worth of deficit reduction in five years to get a big drop in interest rates. That was the strategy we followed. And, I might add, it has worked superbly. It has also been very good for the market, so that nearly everyone in America who was in that higher-income group paying higher taxes has made more money out of the economy in the last four years than they paid in higher taxes.

Returnees Ante Up Venture Capital: Their Ideas

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
When several dozen Vietnamese-American residents gathered at a restaurant for a party here recently, four mysterious people took a table nearby and watched.
"They wouldn't give their names," said Thuan Le Elston, who organized the gathering. "Instead they were asking me, like: 'What are you doing here? Who's in charge of this?' " The next day another partygoer was visited by the police, who asked the same questions. 
 For these former refugees -- a growing, high-profile sector of urban life here -- the authorities' scrutiny came as no surprise.
"I knew people here would be paranoid about a bunch of us getting together," said Ms. Elston, 30, who sells golf club memberships for a Vietnamese-American joint venture.
In the last two or three years, hundreds of young Vietnamese-born Americans have returned here to do business and seek their roots. They work as consultants for foreign companies, open restaurants and boutiques, take jobs at local English-language publications and, quite often, work on personal memoirs that they hope will help them sort out their cultural identities.
Some, like Trang Hoang, 25, who trains promotional personnel for Johnny Walker Scotch, discover that despite their years in the United States they are "Vietnamese, totally Vietnamese." Others, like Trinh Ai Lan, a 25-year-old freelance television producer, declare that they are "100 percent American."
But not all have resolved the question.
"I'm not really sure where I belong," said Hoang Mai, 26, a writer. "I think we've all come to the conclusion that you can never figure it out."
The Government seems similarly uncertain what to make of its refugee children with their Vietnamese appearance and their thoroughly American ways. It wants the money and the expertise they bring back with them, but it fears the cultural influence of these Westernized free-thinkers and warns that there may be subversive "hostile forces" among them.
"The motherland can have only one attitude and that is to welcome them home with open arms," Pham Khac Lam, who heads the Government's National Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, said in an interview. But he added, "There are still dark forces who have not given up their schemes" of bringing down the Communist Government.
In a recent address to Government leaders, Mr. Lam tried to reassure them that the returnees, known as Viet kieu, are mostly benign. But he also voiced disappointment that they have not proved to be the economic boon that many officials here had hoped.
The number of overseas Vietnamese visitors -- for brief or extended stays -- has risen each year, from 160,000 in 1993, to 200,000 in 1994, to 265,000 last year, he said. They represent a significant portion of the two million or more Vietnamese living abroad, about half of whom are in the United States.
But for all their numbers, the returnees have registered only 58 investment projects in the country, worth a total of less than $100 million, Mr. Lam said. Also, he said, overseas relatives send home $600 million to $700 million a year. But since this money typically is not funneled through banks and is dispersed in small amounts around the country, its economic effect is diluted.
These numbers are all the more disappointing to the Government because, although in many respects it treats returnees like other foreign citizens, charging them higher rates for hotels and air tickets, it has tried to encourage them to invest with tax breaks and business incentives that free them of many of the regulations that other foreign investors complain about.
"What we have found is that there are not so many rich men among the overseas Vietnamese," Mr. Lam said, contrasting them with the overseas Chinese millionaires who have proved a windfall for their homeland. "So we are thinking, the main contribution of overseas Vietnamese will be gray matter. Vietnamese are head people, not pocket people."
Indeed, the numbers he cited confirm what is evident among the young returnees here: most Vietnamese-Americans return for personal rather than business reasons.
Miss Mai, who has lived in Hanoi for the last year, is one of those who is writing about her experiences, struggling to decide whose fate was happier, her own, growing up in Oakland, Calif., or that of her parents and sisters who remained behind in a Vietnamese village.
"I freaked out when I saw my sisters in pajamas and conical hats," she said, recalling their reunion after a separation of 20 years.
"They were just like everything I had seen on television. They harvested rice. Their skin was dark from the sun. Their mannerisms were totally nha que," she said, mixing California syntax with the Vietnamese slang for country folk.
"But they are happier," she asserted. "I know that for a fact. They sell noodle soup, they raise pigs, their life is hard. But it is a very innocent life. They are all involved with each other. They all eat together. They all look out for their parents."
Growing up in the United States with four older siblings, Miss Mai struggled and succeeded, graduating from the University of California at Davis.
"We lived the American dream," she said. "It means having opportunities. It means the chance to be more than you were before. It means not bending over 12 hours a day in the rice paddies."
"I remember at night, drifting in the boat, with the wind blowing and the rain coming down, everyone felt sure about America," she said, describing her escape in 1975 at the age of 5, as Saigon fell to the Communists. "People started telling stories about where we were going. It was a gift. It was a blessing. And I've always been grateful, because it was such a close call."
Grateful, but still wondering about the life she might have lived.
"They are happy with simple things in life," she said of her family here. "The hand-to-mouth existence makes it simpler to define your life. Choices complicate things. Materially I'm much better off, but I'm so mixed up."

HEADLINE: A Diamond Industry In the Rough;
U.S. Mining Is Making A Comeback, of Sorts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAK 

 BODY:
Diamond mining, an enterprise whose risk and effort have long stymied all but the most faithful prospectors, is making a comeback in the United States after a dry spell of more than 75 years.
In Colorado, the first American diamond operation to go beyond the exploratory stage since 1919 began production in June. And the nation's only previous diamond mine, one near Murfreesboro, Ark., that has been operated as a tourist attraction for the last 25 years, is being retested for possible reopening. Prospectors are also at work in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Alaska. 
 There are easier ways to scratch out a living, but more than economics is at work. "You know, I think there's a lot of people in this world who are not necessarily tied to the security of having a paid job at an oil company or a mining company," said James A. Cappa of the Colorado Geological Survey. "There are other, Indiana Jones types of people in the world who are willing to take greater risks for greater rewards."
The catalyst for all the activity is a soft-spoken Colorado geologist, Howard G. Coopersmith, the North American manager for Redaurum Ltd., a mining company based in London that trades as a penny stock in Britain and Canada.
Mr. Coopersmith spent 12 years prospecting a diamond-bearing area on the Colorado-Wyoming border called the State Line region, traveling by helicopter, four-wheel drive vehicle and his boots. He finally hit pay dirt in 1987, unearthing a diamond-rich deposit amid jagged granite outcrops in a forest of pine and Douglas fir 8,000 feet up in the Rocky Mountains. The mine, named for the nearby Kelsey Lake -- actually, a pond so tiny it appears only on the largest topographical maps -- went into full production in June.
"It's not really a very glamorous story," Mr. Coopersmith, 42, said. "It was another day of prospecting." Mr. Coopersmith, in charge of the new mine, recalled having to persuade bankers -- and ranchers whose land he wanted to take samples from -- that he wasn't crazy. Now, he says, he has to repeatedly explain why he doesn't act more excited at what he found. "My answer is that I'm too busy working at it to examine where we've gone," he said.
Despite his modesty, Mr. Coopersmith's achievement has put the United States on the map as a diamond producer two years ahead of Canada, where large-scale commercial mining is expected to begin by 1998 in the Lac de Gras area north of Great Slave Lake.
To be sure, the world impact of the Kelsey Lake find is negligible, far too small to begin to matter at the retail level. Its projected total of 12,500 carats of mined diamonds in 1996 would be among the smallest of potatoes in the diamond world: about one thirty-fourth of 1 percent of Australia's 1995 production, 43 million carats, and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the estimated world total of 108 million carats. (A carat, the basic unit of measurement for precious stones, is equal to 200 milligrams, or one-140th of an ounce.)
The company has slashed the mine's projected output for the year by half since beginning production in June, an indication of the unpredictability of the business. Indeed, mining veterans caution would-be investors that explorations usually do not pan out, and they point to a frenzy of speculation in Toronto and Vancouver in diamond-hunting penny stocks, some of them dubious, that followed the 1991 strike in Canada's Northwest Territories.
Even so, the Colorado discovery is a boon to Redaurum, which also owns diamond mines in Zimbabwe and South Africa. It estimates that the Kelsey Lake mine has diamonds worth $153 million and a commercial life of at least 12 years. It also said that 65 percent of the stones recovered so far were of gem quality -- a very high percentage of gems to industrial diamonds -- and that 25 percent, by weight, were larger than one carat, including a nearly flawless 14.2-carat gem.
To hard-nosed companies, many of them Canadian and Australian, American exploration is a calculated risk. But to individual mineral hunters, diamonds are the queen of prospecting. They have fascinated people ever since the ancient Dravidians first retrieved them from the earth's interior at the Golconda mines in India about 800 B.C.
Diamonds are formed from pure carbon deep in the earth's upper mantle. They reach the surface in narrow volcanic tubes, called pipes. The gems have been found in at least 15 states, often in stream beds. But many came from somewhere else, possibly as far north as James Bay in Ontario, and were pushed southward under a mile or two of glacial ice. Even so, most pipes of kimberlite and lamproite, the volcanic rocks in which the stones are imbedded, contain no diamonds or too few to be commercially viable.
But if finding diamonds is hard, it is easy compared with making money from them. Diamond-bearing ores are known from the Appalachians to the Pacific coast, and hundreds of thousands of diamonds have actually been dug, but their quality and quantity have been too poor for mining. Geologists have never stopped looking, however, spurred by advancements in surveying and recovery techniques.
The biggest spur was the gigantic Canadian find near the Great Slave Lake, which has attracted billions of dollars in stock investment, land acquisition and construction by Canadian and Australian mining giants.
Modern diamond exploration involves everything from satellite photography and airborne magnetic detection to examining trace elements in the leaves of birch trees. It also involves luck and endurance.
"You don't find a diamond on the surface," said Mr. Coopersmith of Kelsey Lake. "You don't even find a diamond in the ore. You process tons of ore." He estimated he and his co-workers had dug 20,000 holes in finding the Kelsey Lake pipes.
Arkansas bought the long-defunct Murfreesboro mine -- the only previous commercial diamond mine in North America -- in 1971 and turned it into a tourist attraction, Crater of Diamonds State Park. Tens of thousands of amateur prospectors have tried their luck, paying $4 apiece to bake in the sun or slog through a muddy 40-acre field. Some hunt almost daily for years, and some have found bonanzas, including the 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the largest authenticated diamond ever found in the United States.
Lately, several companies have been paying the state to survey and assay the site. The effort has outlined an estimated 78 million tons of lamproite ore. "The difficult thing is, we have no idea what the grade is," said John S. L. Morgan, president of Morgan Worldwide Mining Consultants of Lexington, Ky., the project's general manager. Bulk sampling and grading of ore will begin immediately after Labor Day, he said.
The participating groups are Ashton Mining of Canada Inc., in partnership with the Texas Star Resources Corporation of Dallas, both of which are penny stocks, and the Arkansas Diamond Development Company, a joint venture. The participants will be invited to bid for mining rights if the state decides to reopen the field commercially.
The companies are betting that the Arkansas miners of 80 years ago were using such primitive tools that the site was never properly valued. Tourists' techniques are little different from the old miners': digging holes and pouring dirt into screens and sluices. Another method is to sit in a chair for hours, waiting for the telltale glint of sunlight, focusing on the gem like a bird dog and directing one's spouse to pick it up.
All of which is to say that there are more reliable ways to get rich, even from digging into the earth. "People make a great amount of money developing clay deposits for Kitty Litter," said Mr. Cappa of the Colorado Geological Survey.
Still, he said, he understands the seductive power of diamonds. "There's no question about it," Mr. Cappa said. "They have a sex appeal that Kitty Litter doesn't."

HEADLINE: Anabolic Steroid Use Grows, Legal or Not

BYLINE: By CAITLIN LIU 

 BODY:
Whenever the Olympic Games take the world stage, accusations about the use of performance-enhancing drugs are sure to follow. This time, pointed fingers and knowing nudges have been directed at various athletes, including Eastern European athletes, five of whom tested positive for a stimulant and were disqualified from competing in the Games.
Perhaps the accusations come so easily because the illegitimate use of such controlled substances, banned in competitions, has become so common. Although no one in the Summer Olympics has so far tested positive for anabolic steroids, which are used to enhance muscle-building, they have been the drugs of choice for athletes such as bodybuilders, runners and football players in the last two decades. Indeed, the drugs are big business. 
 In 1991, after mounting evidence of the drugs' ability to stunt adolescents' growth and perhaps touch off psychotic and violent behavior, anabolic steroids, which are synthetic derivatives of male sex hormones, were placed on the Federal list of controlled substances. Illicit sales of the drugs are punishable by as much as five years in prison.
Before 1991, about 50 percent of steroid users obtained the drugs through medical professionals, the Drug Enforcement Administration has said. The drugs are legally used to treat some diseases.
But virtually all current abusers obtain the substance from the black market. And the black market is huge: An estimated 500,000 Americans, mostly young, white and male, spend a total of $400 million a year on the synthetic steroid hormones. Far from seeking a chemical high, they ingest or inject the drug to build up their biceps and puff up their pectorals to improve their prowess in sports -- or just to show off their brawn.
At the same time, a quiet revolution is under way in the much smaller but booming legal market for the drug. IMS America, a company in Totowa, N.J., that compiles information on the health care industry, estimated that $36.7 million worth of anabolic steroids were sold through prescriptions or administered in hospitals last year. In just the first five months of this year, IMS America calculated, sales have swelled by 38.5 percent compared with the corresponding period last year.
But it is the vastly larger black market for the drug that is creating such a brouhaha in the sports world.
Law enforcement authorities say most of the illegal supply is smuggled into the United States from Europe and Mexico, where the drugs can be purchased over the counter. They are sold on the street in this country for anywhere from $1 to $10 a pill and $10 to $15 for one cubic centimeter of injectable liquid. Bodybuilders often "stack" the drug -- that is, take enormous and frequent doses that can cost them $1,000 a month and more.
But it is their use by athletes out to cheat their competitors that makes the headlines. Last year, two 14-year-old girls, Liza de Villiers, a sprinter from South Africa, and Jessica Foschi, a swimmer from the United States, tested positive for anabolic steroids at separate competitions and were banned from competition temporarily.
While steroids are usually associated with professional athletes or ordinary guys afflicted with an excess of bicep-envy, they do have legitimate applications, doctors say.
The principal legal use is the treatment of testosterone deficiencies that result from accidents, diseases or aging, Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a professor of medicine at New York University and a fellow at the American College of Sport Medicine, said.
Anabolic steroids are also sometimes used to treat patients in late stages of breast cancer, said Dr. Don H. Catlin, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at the University of California at Los Angeles and the director of the U.C.L.A. Olympic Analytical Laboratory, which conducts steroid testing for Olympic athletes.
Legal sales have gotten a lift from the introduction of skin patches that unlike either injections or pills deliver a steady flow of the chemical into the body. In 1994, the Alza Corporation introduced its Testoderm patch and within a year had grabbed nearly 20 percent of the new market. Androderm, a rival product introduced by SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. last November, almost immediately catapulted the company to the front of the pack, with almost 26 percent of the market for the first five months of this year, dropping Alza back to just under 17 percent.
Other major producers of anabolic steroids in the United States are ICN Pharmaceuticals and Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., with about 23 percent and 18 percent of the market, respectively, IMS America said. Depending on the treatment, a month's supply of prescription steroids can cost anywhere from $30 to $170.
The medical community is currently debating other uses for the substance, which some specialists say might work as a male contraceptive and others believe has a therapeutic effect on AIDS patients.
Paradoxically, the drugs that can transform an average male into a latter-day Hercules can also diminish his virility. When men take anabolic steroids, they stop producing sperm, Dr. Catlin said. Their testicles shrink, and breasts become enlarged.

HEADLINE: New Jobs Data Brighten Mood On Wall Street

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The negative mood of the nation's financial markets evaporated yesterday after the July employment report signaled that the economy -- which grew briskly during this year's second quarter -- might be slowing down a little.
As the threat of an overheated economy subsided, so did the fear of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. And this double-barreled relief sent long-term interest rates plunging and stock prices soaring. 
 The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 6.73 percent from 6.83 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 85.08 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,679.83. The market's broader indexes, which had fallen further in the sharp July skid, rallied even more, with the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock index up 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite up 2.4 percent.
The Dow has now climbed back to just under 100 points below its all-time closing high set in May. It plunged more than 350 points following the surprisingly strong June employment report, which sparked fears of inflation and a Federal Reserve move to push up short-term interest rates.
By the end of the day yesterday some analysts, who until this week were worried that stocks were headed still lower, were predicting a summer rally. "I thought we were going to retest the lows; now we may retest the May highs," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. "The Goldilocks economy is back. Not too cold, not too hot. Just right."
But some other analysts found the sudden mood change worrisome, in part because the rally is running counter to their forecasts.
"I wonder whether I am being stubborn or not," said Bryon R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company who has predicted a 1,000-point decline in the Dow this year. "This piece of news is good, but the reaction to it was extreme," he added, because "the public is yearning for good news."
Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, agreed. Speaking of the stock and bond markets, he said, "They were depressive two weeks ago, and now they are manic." But, he added: "The real world has not changed that much. It's just perceptions that have changed, and that's unnerving."
Yesterday's rally capped a week in which a string of economic reports -- including those on retail sales, home sales and manufacturing -- all hinted that the economy might be slowing in July, the first month of the third quarter. The other key news was the Labor Department's report that showed wage increases, including benefits, were still in check, rising just under 3 percent in the year through June. But it took yesterday's employment report to confirm those beliefs and change the prevailing market mood.
Since Monday, the Dow has jumped 4.5 percent, while the yield on the 30-year bond has fallen to a four-month low from 7.09 percent. Whether this rally will continue depends on whether economic reports for the rest of July and August continue to fill out the economic picture that the financial markets have been hoping to see for months -- a portrait of an economy that is shifting from brisk to moderate growth while inflation remains in check.
Mr. Shulman said that flows of investors' money into stock mutual funds have not been strong recently, so that this rally is not yet a case of "the public throwing money at the market." He suggested that it would take a resurgence in this money to confirm the rally. He also warned that the soft retail sales data that had helped calm market fears of strong growth could turn around after the Olympics, if it was true that many people were putting off shopping and eating out during the Games.
"If we get a spurt again in August, we could be back in the soup in September," he said.
Other analysts warned that the jobs data showed only that growth in July might be at a slower pace than in the second quarter. It does not show that the economy is weak in any significant way. This means that the Federal Reserve policy makers could still raise interest rates later in the year if the slowdown does not continue.
"One should definitely allow for a future Fed tightening," warned Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "There is still enough strength in the economy." The new data, he said, would just put off any Fed action at the policy meeting on Aug. 20.
Lewis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said that he thought the economic data were still strong enough to warrant an increase in short-term interest rates by the Fed. But he said he did not expect one at the Aug. 20 meeting because "the market now has minimal tightening expectations built in, and that will stop the Fed from shocking the market with an unexpected tightening."
The main good news in the jobs report was that 193,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs were created last month, just below the expected increase of 200,000. While that is still strong growth, it is below the revised 220,000 new jobs created in June and below the 230,000 average for the year. But probably most importantly, the total of new jobs was not surprisingly high, as it was for June and early months. The report for June a month ago sent stocks tumbling and interest rates higher.
In the stock market, the rally was led by shares of banks, which benefit from lower interest rates. Beverage, semiconductor and computer software stocks also rose. The Pacific High Technology Index jumped 2 percent. Technology had been one of the hardest-hit sectors recently, with the Pacific index down nearly 22 percent since its high in May.
Among the leading gainers in the S.& P. index were Micron Technology, up 3 5/8 to 22 7/8, and Texas Instruments, up 3 5/8, to 46 3/4.
In the bond market, some analysts think that much of the near-term gain in long-term interest rates has already been made. Joseph Liro, the chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities, said that he expected the yield on the 30-year bond to stay around 6.75 percent in the near term, especially because of the need for investors to digest the quarterly Treasury auction of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds next week.

HEADLINE: Growth in Jobs Slowed in July, Breaking Trend

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
After several months in overdrive, the economy is showing signs of slowing to a more moderate but still healthy pace that is generating no increases in inflation, Government figures indicated today.
The data showed that the economy created jobs in July at a somewhat slower rate than during the spring and that upward pressure on wages ebbed last month. Consumer spending fell during July for the first time since winter, and orders to factories fell in June for the first time in four months. 
 Today's report, combined with other recent data, confirmed expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates this month, heartening investors. Stocks surged after the release of the report, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 85.08 points, or 1.5 percent. Bond prices also rallied, driving the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer interest rates -- down to 6.73 percent from 6.83 percent. [Page 35.]
The employment report also gave another lift to the Clinton Administration as the Presidential campaign increasingly turns to economic issues.
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter, its fastest in two years, and analysts said growth might still be so strong that it would require a rate increase by the Federal Reserve later in the year to cool it off and keep inflation dormant. But they said that today's numbers, at least, showed the economy moving toward a healthy balance, with enough growth to keep unemployment low and businesses humming, but not so much that wages and prices begin shooting up.
"We're in a very comfortable middle ground where you don't have any inflationary excesses threatening you and nor do you have any recessionary worries," said Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist of the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. "It's a perfect prescription for the economy."
The Labor Department reported that the economy generated 193,000 new jobs in July, fewer than most economists had expected and a sign that the economy's rapid acceleration during the spring was tapering off. The economy had created 220,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said, down from its initial estimate of 239,000.
The slowdown in job creation helped push the unemployment rate for July up slightly, to 5.4 percent of the civilian work force, from 5.3 percent in June.
Despite the rapid economic growth in recent months, there was no evidence in today's report that wages were being pushed up by labor shortages. The Labor Department said average hourly earnings declined by 2 cents in July, to $11.80, after having risen by a surprisingly high 9 cents in June. Investors have been focusing on wages as an important indication of whether inflation is starting to take root. Over the last year, average hourly earnings have risen 2.9 percent.
Providing further evidence that the economy is cooling off, the Commerce Department said today that consumer spending fell two-tenths of 1 percent in July. The willingness of consumers to keep spending despite mounting debt levels has been one of the main forces propelling the economy this year, and most analysts had expected consumption to be up again in July. The drop in consumption came despite a rise of nine-tenths of 1 percent in personal incomes last month, the department said.
Factory orders fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in June, the Commerce Department said, reversing a four-month trend of increases. The department also revised downward its estimate of factory orders in May, to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent.
Today's flurry of statistics came at the end of a week in which other figures had also suggested that the economy was not in immediate danger of overheating but was nonetheless cruising along at a pace that could set off inflationary pressures later in the year.
On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that the overall compensation that employers pay for their workers rose at a relatively modest eight-tenths of 1 percent for the second quarter, although wages and salaries rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, a rate that some analysts took as a warning signal of inflation.
On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Managers said that its index of business activity declined and that the rate at which suppliers filled orders speeded up significantly, indicating that no inflationary bottlenecks were forming.
Most economists had been expecting that if the economy did not show signs of slowing, the Federal Reserve would raise rates no later than its next policy-setting meeting on Aug. 20. Now the consensus is that the Fed will not act at least until its meeting in September, when it will have more evidence of the economy's path, and that the central bank might put off any increase in rates until after the Presidential election.
"Despite some positive economic surprises in the data, key inflation portents were neither alarming nor consistently threatening enough to impel the Fed to act this month," the Salomon Brothers securities firm said in an economic analysis it released today.
"However, eventual tightening still seems to be the most likely scenario for the months ahead," the report said. "The economy retains considerable momentum, despite some signs of slowing, and labor markets continue to pose a threat of overheating."
But with its eye on November, the Clinton Administration said the combination of healthy job creation and low inflation further buttressed its claim to be presiding over the best economy in a generation.
"These data should reassure both Wall Street and Main Street," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. "We're not seeing inflation, even though the economy is growing at a healthy pace. Employers are not raising prices, even though there are spot labor market shortages for skilled workers."
The President's expected Republican opponent, Bob Dole, who has been attacking the economic growth rate under Mr. Clinton as anemic, focused today on the drop in average hourly earnings last week as evidence that American workers are being shortchanged by the Administration's economic policies.
"The economy may look rosy from the White House Rose Garden, but for the average worker the picture just got a little bleaker," Mr. Dole said in a statement.
In its release today, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said unemployment among blacks was 10.5 percent in July. For Hispanic people it was 9 percent. For whites the rate was 4.7 percent.
The biggest gains in employment last month came in retailing, which added 89,000 jobs, about half of them in restaurants. Katherine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said about 10,000 new jobs could be attributed to the Olympics in Atlanta.
Employment in construction was up by 25,000 in July, reflecting the continued strength of the housing sector despite a sharp rise this year in interest rates. Manufacturing employment declined by 20,000.

HEADLINE: Trying to Take The Inner City Onto the Internet;
Power Through Cyberspace

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
The posters, a blend of cyberlingo and hip-hop-speak, beckon from phone booths in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant. They are often ripped down by day's end. But sometimes they last long enough to lure a would-be cybernaut to a new frontier.
"Brothas and Sistas," they blare. "Not tall enough for the N.B.A.? Too 'unique' to get signed to a record deal? Don't worry; there's another way to get outta the ghetto: the Internet." A phone number is given -- (212) 726-1063 -- and the name: Virtual Melanin Inc., "Representin' Bed-Stuy in Cyberspace." 
 McLean Greaves, the company's president, is a pied piper spreading this message, and he is happy if the phone rings.
"We're basically showing people that they have a voice," said Mr. Greaves, 29, who started his business, which creates Web sites for paying customers, in 1994 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. "Some kid from the Fort Greene projects could do the same thing with his friends. And we're going to show them the way to do that, through example."
Some say the information superhighway has been slow in getting to neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, where people are often more consumed with survival than with cyberspace. But despite the barriers that poverty and a lack of computer knowledge can bring, there is a burgeoning movement, from Harlem to the South Bronx, to carry the Internet to poorer neighborhoods.
From a library computer lab in Flatbush to an Internet cafe in East Harlem to projects giving free public access to the World Wide Web, organizations, educators and entrepreneurs have a new message for the poor: there is power in cyberspace.
"It's crucial, because the Internet is a window to the world," said Georgina Falu, who is opening an Internet cafe in her East Harlem computer school and dreams of her neighborhood becoming what she calls "the Silicon Barrio." "We want to be in the mainstream. Above all, we're saying this is a revolution like the gold rush, and the Latino people have been behind in almost every aspect in terms of job opportunities and economic development. And my purpose is to give them a head start."
Sometimes, the new technology must be demystified and misperceptions erased. There are those who assume that computers are prohibitively expensive and not relevant to day-to-day living. Many of those seeking to share their knowledge of the Internet try to emphasize that with a few keystrokes, a bodega owner can tap into a marketing seminar without leaving his store; an elderly person can get medical advice without picking up a phone; an unemployed person can hunt for a job.
But the largest hurdle is access. Though many people may be eager to learn about the Internet, a significant number of homes in New York City's poorer communities do not have telephones, let alone computers. A study by the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications found that in 1990, more than 1 in 5 homes in 8 of the city's 32 community districts had no telephone.
In East Harlem, more than 16 percent of the homes were without a telephone; in the community district that includes Bedford-Stuyvesant and Tompkins Park North, nearly 19 percent had none.
"One of our biggest concerns is, the world is passing a lot of poor communities by as far as computers and information," said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, which plans to set up computers in each of its borough offices by October, giving the public free access to the World Wide Web and other services.
"The point is," Mr. Walcott said, "we have a responsibility as a society to make sure all of us are competing on equal footing. Whether it's education or jobs, it's important for all communities to know how to use computers in everyday life."
A group of nonprofit organizations calling itself the Linct Coalition, for Learning and Information Networks for Community Telecomputing, is working with the New York Urban League to develop a program in which computers will be given to low-income Harlem residents who complete training.
The Urban League and other organizations are trying to make access to the Internet available at community institutions, often without charge.
The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture provides free access to the Internet on four computers, and plans to hold information sessions for community groups. The Brooklyn Public Library's Flatbush branch, with a grant from the Microsoft Corporation, opened a computer lab in April that has attracted nearly 7,000 people who can explore the Internet and various software programs at no cost.
In October, the Harlem Partnership Center will begin free instruction on creating a Web page and on adding to its existing site, Harlem on the Web. And the Universal Business and Media School in East Harlem is opening its Internet cafe this month.
Unlike some of the cafes in downtown Manhattan, the East Harlem cyber-haunt will start small, with five computers. Customers can buy coffee, sandwiches and, for $5, an hour on the Internet. The goal is to ease neophytes into the new world by making the language of cyberspace relevant. Users will be immediately guided, for example, to a home page from which they can connect to information about everything from jobs to neighborhood events.
"They're going to see events in their community, special services in the community," said Dennis Vaque, the cafe's technical adviser. "Everything's going to be relevant to them."
Public access is necessary for now, said Ms. Falu, the computer school operator, but she said she believes that people will gradually become so intrigued they will find a way to go on line at home.
"What we need is for them to get comfortable with the computers," said Ms. Falu, who is host of a five-minute spot, "Today With Computers," every Friday on the Spanish-language radio station WADO-AM (1280).
"It's like the public telephone," she said. "If they need to make a call, they go outside and make it. And the same will happen with a computer. Everyone feels they need a car, right? So they get one, even if it's old. The time will come when they realize that the computer is so important they'll get the money together to get a little computer."
Mr. Greaves of Virtual Melanin agrees that familiarity nurtures curiosity. In addition to creating Web sites for clients, the company offers its own, Cafe los Negroes, a mixture of musings, poetry and pop culture from New York's ethnic underground. This summer, it is also covering the Entertainers Basketball Classic at Holcombe Rucker Memorial Park (155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard) in Harlem, cybercasting the fast breaks and celebrity sightings.
Frederick Marshall, 21, is one of those who became intrigued watching the Virtual Melanin crew tap out stories on their laptops on the sidelines. One Wednesday evening, after darting around the court with a digital camera, Mr. Marshall watched images he had photographed download into a portable computer, then flash onto a small screen.
"A lot of people don't own computers," said Mr. Marshall, a graduate of Graphic Arts High School who works for a small record company. "I don't own a computer. But when I do, I'll be on line. Because you can do anything on line."
During the Rucker tournament, the game's announcer took a few seconds away from his comic commentary to give a shout, telling the folks in the stands the company's Internet address, http:// www.losnegroes.com, and giving them a gentle nudge to check out the net. Though the games are a hotbed of posturing, with rap music blaring and "disses" flying as fast as the three-on-one breaks, seldom does a game go by without a couple of young people wandering by to check out Virtual Melanin's equipment and ask a question or two.
The Internet, Mr. Greaves said simply, is becoming hip.
"I'm hoping we can make the whole Poindexter thing cool," he said, using a slang word for nerd. "We're bringing it right to the street."

Grate Sparks Subway Fire
A rusted Depression-era metal grate suspended above an East Side subway tunnel gave way and tumbled to the tracks, leading to electrical explosions and a fire that hampered service to much of Queens and Manhattan for nine hours and trapped dozens of riders in blinding smoke. Transit officials said the failure might point to a widespread problem with grates. The incident came less than 48 hours after a downpour flooded several stations and tunnels in Brooklyn and Queens, crippling service. [Page 21.]
 
Internet in the Inner City
There is a burgeoning movement, from Harlem to the South Bronx, to carry the Internet to poorer neighborhoods in New York City. From a library computer lab in Flatbush to an Internet cafe in East Harlem to projects giving free public access to the World Wide Web, organizations, educators and entrepreneurs have a new message for the poor: there is power in cyberspace. [21.]
 
Extra Money for Schools
After three years of steady budget cuts, more than half of the city's 32 community school districts will have slightly more money to spend this year than they did last year, according to preliminary budget figures issued by the Board of Education. The extra money for the districts, which operate the city's 848 elementary and junior high schools, comes largely as a result of personnel cutbacks at the central headquarters of the Board of Education, which Mayor Giuliani and others have long complained was filled with bureaucratic fat. [21.]
 
Ex-Head of Agency Admits Lying
To escape prosecution on a perjury charge, the former president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation has admitted to lying about the improper purchase of $30,000 worth of office furniture, according to sources close to an investigation of the former head of the nonprofit agency. [23.]
 
Should Adelphi President Stay?
With Adelphi University's enrollment dropping sharply, its funds limited and its campus in turmoil, the head of a state review panel asked Adelphi's embattled president whether he can effectively continue in office. In response, the president, Peter Diamandopoulos, agreed that the controversies surrounding him must be resolved for Adelphi to move forward. But Dr. Diamandopoulos, who is 67, said he does not intend to quit. [22.]
 
Accused of Business as Usual
Seven months after its creation, the Nassau County Legislature is the focus of much debate. While its defenders say the Legislature is making a difference, its critics see it as a reincarnation of the old Nassau and its vaunted Republican Party. Some say its procedures at meetings are squelching public access, that legislators are exerting little oversight on county agencies and that they are failing to tackle Nassau's overriding problems, like high taxes and electric rates. [22.]
 
Lilco Rate Reduction Proposed
Citing "poor economic conditions on Long Island" linked to high electric costs, the staff of the State Public Service Commission proposed a 5.2 percent reduction in rates of the Long Island Lighting Company. Lilco immediately objected, saying the reduction would jeopardize service and reliability for its more than one million customers. [22.]
 
REGION
 
Piece of Cockpit Is Found
The seas calmed, the fog lifted and investigators searching the watery crash site of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 discovered a tantalizing piece of wreckage -- a section of the cockpit that they hope will lead them to other significant debris, as well as to an explanation for why the jumbo jet exploded in mid-air last month. The piece of the cockpit, described as the front window section, comes from the front third of the aircraft where the explosion is believed to have occurred and might help investigators explain what caused it. [21.]
 
At Lab, Pressure From All Sides
In laboratories at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, the scientific examination of wreckage from Flight 800 inches forward in a tense atmosphere. But the pressure from a world waiting for an explanation is not the only cause of anxiety at the lab. The lab's legendary reputation for scientific sleuthing has itself been under investigation. And some law enforcement officials say the pressure from the inquiry is contributing to an atmosphere of caution about declaring the T.W.A. crash a criminal act. [24.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Crude Weapons Seized at Jail
Hours after an inmate brawl during an outdoor basketball game, a cell-by-cell search of the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton found a substantial number of makeshift weapons. The search in the prison followed strip searches on Thursday night of 200 to 250 inmates involved in the fighting in the prison's recreation yard. In both searches, guards seized crude weapons that included spoons, pens and toothbrushes with sharpened tips. [24.]

HEADLINE: With a Stable Economy, Clinton Hopes for Credit

SERIES: THE CLINTON RECORD -- Last of seven articles: The Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
More than any other issue, the economy was Bill Clinton's ticket to the Presidency four years ago.
With the country struggling to climb out of a recession and many Americans of modest means convinced that George Bush was insensitive to their strains, Mr. Clinton campaigned as the champion of the "forgotten middle class." 
 Now the President is basing his re-election campaign on a substantially improved economy. And as the election draws close, he is trying to convince middle-class voters that he has not forgotten them.
In running for the Presidency against Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton mapped out a detailed scheme that included reducing the record budget deficit, cutting the taxes of middle-income families and, in keeping with the activist theme of his campaign, spending heavily on measures like job training, education and research that would help workers cope with the wrenching shifts of the information age. Only a month before his inauguration, at a televised conference in Little Rock, Ark., he called for "a national economic strategy" that would not only create jobs but also raise incomes, reduce inequality and restore hope.
Once in office, however, Mr. Clinton found that such contradictory promises and ambitious plans were impossible to fulfill. Time and again, he was forced into hard choices about economic policy. In almost every instance, he took the route favored by Wall Street, business executives and conventional economists, not the ones that ordinary people might have favored and that almost certainly would have been easier to defend politically.
To avoid a widening budget gap that he believed would increase interest rates and frighten the inflation-wary bondholders on Wall Street, President Clinton opted for painful deficit reduction that included higher taxes, mostly on the rich, and significant spending cuts. He scrapped plans for middle-class tax cuts and spending on "human capital," which had been advocated by his political advisers.
Working to open international markets, he allied himself with Republicans to win Congressional approval of two major free-trade pacts. This meant turning his back on the trade restrictions advocated by organized labor, one of the Democrats' strongest constituencies.
In the 1994 elections, though, many of the middle-income workers who had responded to Mr. Clinton's message in 1992 turned against the Democrats, giving the Republicans control of Congress. Mr. Clinton stopped trying to mold the economy and sought to regain his political footing by acting like a hockey goalie, deflecting Republican slapshots that would have upset Government programs popular with the middle class.
Repeatedly, even in the face of two Government shutdowns, Mr. Clinton vetoed Republican measures to cut taxes, limit social programs and emphasize business profits over environmental protection and consumer health and safety.
This hunkering down and insistence on preserving New Deal and Great Society programs like Social Security and Medicare proved to be far more popular than the more ambitious economic program of his first two years. He further enhanced his political standing by forcing the Republicans in Congress to accept an increase in the minimum wage.
But the President did not fundamentally veer from his traditional economic approach. Indeed, he adopted, at least on paper, the Republican philosophy of balancing the budget by early in the next century. So as he goes into the election, Mr. Clinton is in position to run both as a protector of the middle class and as a defender of fiscal responsibility.
Now, the critical early decisions on the Federal budget finally appear to be paying some dividends. The deficit is down sharply and the economy, by most measures, is generally healthy. But typical American workers are in no better shape than they were four years ago. Adjusted for inflation, wages are almost exactly the same as in 1992 and about 6 percent below average wages of the late 1980's.
Mr. Clinton touts his record on the economy as a strong reason why he should be re-elected. "What we have done," the President said in an interview, "is to put our economic house in order, restore growth and create opportunity."
Asked what he hoped to do in a second term, Mr. Clinton painted a glowing picture of today's economy, with its low inflation, low unemployment rate and many new jobs. But he acknowledged that many of those who "pay the taxes, raise the kids and play by the rules" had not necessarily shared in the upswing.
"There is still a lot of stagnation and insecurity in the picture," he said. "So what's missing in this picture? How are we going to give all Americans who are responsible the opportunity to succeed?"
 
The Gains
The Clinton Team Makes Its Case
"My absolute belief," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an interview, "is that we would not have had a sustained recovery without the President's deficit-reduction program."
That is the heart of the Clinton Administration's case for its handling of the economy. But voters who hold the incumbent accountable when the economy is bad do not necessarily give the President credit when times are better.
For instance, things are going well for Jeff Siegfried, a 37-year-old manager of a Chevrolet dealership in Minneapolis. Sales of cars and sport utility vehicles are brisk. His income has climbed to roughly $80,000 in the last couple of years. "I'm comfortable now, and the economy is strong," he said. "But I don't think Clinton or his policies are the reason for that."
Even among people like Mr. Siegfried who said in a New York Times poll in June that the economy was healthy, only 36 percent said Mr. Clinton deserved credit for it.
Mr. Clinton's Republican opponents say the President has simply been lucky to hold office during a favorable stage of the business cycle. In contrast with the past, when the American economy was relatively isolated and United States policy was less subject to the hairtrigger reactions of market gunslingers, the immediate ups and downs of today's economy, most experts agree, are largely beyond the control of this or any other Administration.
Still, no one doubts that White House policy continues to play a role in determining the underlying health of the economy. Mr. Clinton's economic advisers hold that the deficit-reduction package the President tortuously pushed through Congress in 1993, a plan that included some spending cuts and one of the largest tax increases in history, convinced Wall Street that the Administration was serious about coming to grips with a deeply flawed budget he had inherited. That, the advisers maintain, helped pave the way for the easing of interest rates, rising stock prices and increasing business investment that followed.
Moreover, the White House worked hard to smooth relations with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who wields enormous influence over the day-to-day economy. When the economic pulse quickened in 1994 and 1995, the Fed raised interest rates by several notches. But the President and his advisers held their tongues, in sharp contrast with the repeated complaints about the Fed voiced by officials in the Reagan and Bush Administrations and by Democrats in Congress. This year, Mr. Clinton appointed Mr. Greenspan to a third four-year term as Fed chairman.
"The most important thing they did," said William A. Niskanen, an economist who is president of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group, and who is a frequent critic of the Clinton Administration, "is that they didn't nag Greenspan."
The hands-off approach toward the Fed was a conscious one. "We decided early on that the financial markets could misinterpret criticism of the Fed," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a top Clinton economic policy adviser. "And the Fed itself might react in unpredictable ways."
Republicans have seized on stagnant wages and the relatively slow economic growth during much of Mr. Clinton's tenure to argue that the tax increases in the President's first budget stifled the economy.
"Clinton's high-tax, big-Government policies have sucked life out of the economy, eaten up American workers' pay and given money to the Government instead," said Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman. "Clinton's policies have created the middle-class squeeze."
Bob Dole and the economists working for him have adopted that tack and are poised to offer a broad income-tax cut as the centerpiece of the Republican candidate's economic program. But many experts, even those who often disagree with Mr. Clinton, give him fairly good marks on the economy. Wage stagnation and the widening gap in incomes, they note, began more than two decades ago and have persisted through Republican and Democratic Administrations alike.
"If you're looking for dramatic initiatives that turned America around, you're not going to find them," said Paul R. Krugman, a prominent professor at Stanford University. "But on the whole, has the policy been pretty sensible? The answer is yes."
 
Economic Pulse
Inflation Is Modest, But So Is Growth
"Our economy," Mr. Clinton declared at the outset of his State of the Union Message this year, "is the healthiest it has been in three decades."
By most measurements, the economy has indeed thrived since he entered the White House. Inflation has not been so consistently low for so long since the 1960's. More than 10 million additional jobs have been created. Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in July had been 5.4 percent, down from 7.1 percent when Mr. Clinton took office. There has been no recession, and none is on the horizon. The Federal budget deficit has been cut in half. The stock market, despite some recent jitters, has broken through one ceiling after another.
The low interest rates not only generated a boom in business investment but put more money in the pockets of ordinary Americans.
In 1993 alone, six million homeowners, most of them solidly middle class, refinanced their mortgages because of the lower rates. Most of these families locked in rates two percentage points or so lower than their previous mortgages. On a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000, for example, the monthly saving was $139 a month, or $1,668 a year.
"It's been a remarkable period of steady growth, low inflation and low unemployment," said Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who is now a Wall Street investment banker.
For all those who have benefited from the advance of the economy, though, millions of Americans have not been able to take advantage of its strengths.
The pace of economic growth has been quite slow. While there are some signs of recent improvements, wages and family incomes have generally been flat. Some of the largest and most prominent companies have laid off workers by the thousands. The gap between the rich and poor has widened. And 26 million Americans, approximately 1 in 10, continue to receive food stamps, the same as when Mr. Clinton took office.
Moreover, times are changing fast, with corporate downsizing, the demise of some basic manufacturing industries, advances in communications, competition from abroad, the gyrating stock market and many other elements of a complex economy that could hardly have been imagined even a few years ago. Many people are feeling insecure, if not frightened, by what lies ahead for them and their children.
Late last year, a New York Times poll found that 49 percent of all Americans thought it was unlikely that today's youth would have a better life than their parents. In the Republican Presidential race earlier this year, Patrick J. Buchanan seized on that anxiety, and similar fears over wave after wave of corporate layoffs, to win the New Hampshire primary, briefly throwing the Dole campaign into turmoil.
Still, few blame Mr. Clinton for these anxious times, and, in more recent surveys, most of those polled say the overall economy looks healthy to them. In the recent New York Times poll, 60 percent said the economy was in good shape. By contrast, only 23 percent thought so in October 1992, an important factor in George Bush's loss of the Presidency.
 
Incomes
Many on the Sidelines In a Surging Economy
By far, the biggest winners in the last four years have been the richest Americans. A recent report by the Census Bureau, tracking the first two years of the Clinton Administration, found that the gap between the affluent and everyone else continued to widen -- even accelerating somewhat -- from 1992 through 1994.
Conventional wisdom dictates that a Democratic President who imposed higher tax rates on the wealthy would be anathema to Wall Street. But the bankers and traders in the securities industry have thrived in the Clinton years.
The stock market, measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, is up almost 75 percent since Mr. Clinton's inauguration. Employment in the securities industry has increased sharply.
The markets have been so strong since the budget law was enacted, Mr. Clinton said in the interview last month, "that nearly everyone in America who was in that higher-income group paying higher taxes has made more money out of the economy in the last four years than they paid in higher taxes."
David M. Jones, the chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a bond trading firm, is a Republican and no admirer of Mr. Clinton. But, like many others on Wall Street, he acknowledges that deficit reduction is partly responsible for strong markets.
As Wall Street has surged, the bankers and traders are spending some of their gains. Michael Hobbs, a builder in New Canaan, Conn., has certainly seen the effect. His company builds houses that typically cost $1 million to $5 million. He is doing about twice as much business as last year.
"When Wall Street does well," Mr. Hobbs said, "so do we."
But the runup in the stock market has not benefited just the rich. Forty percent of American families now own shares, often through mutual funds and retirement accounts. Since the end of 1992, the value of household stock holdings has increased by $1.6 trillion.
The other winners in today's job market are people like Shad Todd. He left Vassar College in 1993 to become a computer programmer. In September 1994, he was hired by Time Inc. to help build Internet software. Today, at 25, Mr. Todd heads a team of five programmers, and he earns more than $70,000 a year.
But for Michael Gandy, 44, an ex-Marine, a father of three and a registered Democrat in Monahans, Tex., things are much worse than they were four years ago. In 1992, after 12 years working as an oil-field equipment operator for Mobil Oil, he was laid off in one of the company's many rounds of cost-cutting.
At Mobil, Mr. Gandy made $40,000 to $60,000 annually. Today, he holds two jobs, one as a youth supervisor at a juvenile penitentiary, and the other as a security guard at department stores. He works 80 hours a week to earn $15,000 a year.
 
Taxes
Increases for Affluent And Help for the Poor
Within weeks of taking office, Mr. Clinton made the critical economic decision of his Administration, jettisoning campaign promises about tax cuts and new spending programs to concentrate on deficit reduction, including a tax increase.
Mr. Clinton's political advisers warned repeatedly of a political backlash. But the members of the President's economic team were persistent.
The President invariably sided with the economic team. In the end, the budget blueprint the President presented in 1993 included about $250 billion worth of tax increases over five years and approximately the same amount of spending cuts.
Every Republican in Congress voted against it. The final tallies were so close that if just one Democratic representative or senator who voted for the bill had switched sides, the bill would have been defeated. Never before had important legislation been adopted by such a narrow margin and without a single vote from the minority party.
Following the vote in the House, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia declared: "I believe this will lead to a recession next year. This is the Democrat machine's recession, and each one of them will be held personally accountable."
Mr. Gingrich was wrong about the recession, but right about accountability. Accused by their opponents of raising taxes, many Democrats who voted with the President lost their seats in 1994. That allowed Republicans to win control of Congress and allowed Mr. Gingrich to become Speaker of the House.
Republicans called it the biggest tax increase in history, an assertion that can be proved true or false, depending on the approach. The bulk of the new revenue came from increasing the income tax rates on the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. The maximum Federal income tax rate was raised to nearly 40 percent from 31 percent.
Low-income workers got a tax cut because of a more generous earned-income tax credit. Middle-income taxpayers had their taxes raised slightly through an increase of 4.3 cents a gallon in the gasoline tax and higher taxes on the Social Security benefits of retirees with incomes above $25,000.
 
Trade
Testing the Ties Binding Labor Allies
The North American Free Trade Agreement, the accord with Mexico and Canada that had been largely negotiated by the Bush Administration, also produced a monumental fight.
Labor leaders feared that Nafta would result in factory jobs migrating south of the border. Many vowed to abandon Mr. Clinton when he ran for re-election and to work against Democrats who backed the accord.
The overall effects of Nafta so far are hard to judge. By the end of June, the Labor Department reports, 78,000 workers had qualified for a Government program to help find new work for those who lost jobs because of the trade accord. At the same time, a deep recession in Mexico, which had nothing to do with the trade agreement, has meant that fewer jobs than the Administration anticipated have been created in industries here that do business with Mexico.
But Administration economists calculate that as many as 300,000 American jobs in export industries were saved that would otherwise have been lost because Mexico did not impose higher tariffs and other restrictions on American products, as Mexico did in 1982, the last time it had a financial crisis.
And three years after the vote on Nafta, the rift between the President and organized labor has largely dissipated. The unions were among the earliest and most generous supporters of his re-election. They are spending millions of dollars to support Democratic candidates in an advertising campaign that dovetails with the President's.
There is no mystery about why the unions warmed up to the President. After the Republicans won Congress, the unions had nowhere else to turn. "After 1994, his standing in terms of American workers became clearer because he literally became their last hope," said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees.
Mr. Clinton burnished his standing with labor with his all-out support this year for a minimum-wage increase. In his first two years as President, Mr. Clinton did not publicly mention the minimum wage a single time.
But this year, as if he had been holding the matter in reserve for the election year, he made it his highest legislative priority. With polls showing that the public, by a margin of more than 4 to 1, supports an increase, the Republicans were forced to relent.
The House approved the legislation yesterday. The first stage of the minimum-wage increase will almost certainly go into effect on Oct. 1, five weeks before Election Day.
The Clinton Administration also worked with the Republican Congress to pass legislation that scrapped 60 years of telecommunications policy, abolished most Federal laws restricting telephone and cable television companies, and granted the states most regulatory power over the industry.
Like many of Mr. Clinton's other forays into economic policy, that generally reflected a deferral to the powerful business groups with a stake in the legislation. The focus of intense lobbying, the new telecommunications law will eventually affect the daily lives of almost every American and could prove to be a powerful job-creator in the future. But it never became a partisan political issue.
 
Second Term?
President Sticks To Limited Goals
Except for the minimum wage and the telecommunications bill, Mr. Clinton has basically played defense on economic matters in the last two years.
His veto of the Republicans' budget in 1995 -- and his refusal to blink in the face of Republican threats to force the Government to default on its debt -- led to two Government shutdowns, in late 1995 and early 1996. In the end, Mr. Clinton was forced to accept reduced spending in some areas but few permanent changes in Federal programs.
But the Republican onslaught did force Mr. Clinton to change his oratory, if not really his positions. He began 1995 with a budget that showed annual deficits of $200 billion or more through the turn of the century. By the end of 1995, he had produced a framework that he said would lead to a balanced budget by 2002.
In many ways, his outline for a balanced budget is similar to the Republicans'. Whether these budgets are realistic is another question. Their premise is that the basic expenses of running Government departments and agencies can be squeezed dry around the turn of the century. Many experts say neither the public nor future lawmakers will accept such severe austerity.
In his interview with The Times, Mr. Clinton promised that he would not ask for a tax increase in a second term if Congress adopted his balanced-budget approach. A tax increase in 1993 was an essential part of lowering the deficit then, he said, but now, "I don't see why we should have a tax increase."
But in contrast with his ambitious agenda four years ago, the President offers no comprehensive solutions this time. His "next set of initiatives," Mr. Clinton said, without making specific proposals, would pay more attention to education and measures to help families cope with the strains of working and rearing children at the same time.
Furthermore, Mr. Clinton has avoided confronting what many authorities believe is the most serious long-term fiscal problem facing the country: Soon after the baby-boomers begin to retire, in about 15 years, there will not be nearly enough money to pay for their Social Security and health care without fundamental changes in current policies or onerous taxes on younger workers.
So far, Mr. Clinton has not only resisted basic changes in Medicare, an enormously popular program, but has used his defense of the existing system to attack Republicans and bolster his own political position.
Mr. Clinton does not deny the problem. He just wants to put off dealing with the heart of it. The way to tackle it, he said, is to make small changes to keep the Medicare program solvent for another decade. That would provide time for a bipartisan commission to find solutions.
What is important, he added, stating one of the main themes meant to distinguish him from Republicans, is "to make sure that when it does, it's as fair to seniors as it is to others, and it's as fair to people on modest incomes as it is to people who aren't."
Like many other experts, Peter G. Peterson, the investment banker who was Commerce Secretary in the Nixon Administration and who has become something of a public scold on matters of fiscal responsibility, says Mr. Clinton is refusing to deal with a fundamental reality he will have to face head-on if he is re-elected to a second term that would take the nation into the 21st century.
Trying to balance the budget and maintain long-term economic stability without dealing with Medicare and Social Security, Mr. Peterson said, "is like trying to clean out your garage without removing the Winnebago."

Law Would Strengthen Beach Pollution Checks

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Thousands of times every year, stretches of American beach are closed to protect the public from disease-carrying organisms. But there are many coastal states that do not regularly monitor surf pollution, and millions of tourists may be unaware of whether it is safe to swim at any given time or place.
Now, Federal legislation has been proposed to improve the standards for checking water quality and warning people about possible dangers. Currently, the Federal Government does not monitor beach water or require the states to do so. 
 According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an influential environmental group based in New York that does extensive research, lobbying and litigation, there were 3,522 beach closings and advisories last year at ocean, bay and Great Lakes beaches, up 50 percent from 1994.
The increase was mainly in Florida and California, states with long coastlines that had heavier rains than usual last year and thus more spills of untreated waste from storm-water drains and sewers. These overflows are the most common source of beach pollution.
Legislation introduced last month by Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat of New Jersey, would require all states to meet rigorous nationwide standards that would have to be set by the Environmental Protection Agency for monitoring coastal waters and notifying the public when the water is unhealthy. For example, the standards might set limits on the frequency, duration, or concentration of pathogens in the water.
At present, states including California and Florida do much less than New Jersey, which because of its tough standards closes beaches so often that annual losses to the tourist economy approach $1 billion.
According to Mr. Lautenberg, for decades studies have shown "a definite relationship" between bacteria found in the water and illnesses among swimmers. Viruses, including intestinal infections and hepatitis, are believed to be the major cause of diseases associated with swimming, he said. And people who contract these illnesses at the beach can bring them home and spread them among family members.
In May, the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, a partnership of industry and state and local governments, found that people who swam near storm-water drains in the California bay were almost 50 percent more likely to experience fever, diarrhea and other ailments than those who swam farther from the pollution outlets.
"We found significant increases in risk for a broad range of health effects for people who swam in front of storm drains," said Dr. Robert W. Haile, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern California who directed the study. "These results have broad implications with regard to the health effects of swimming in waters contaminated by storm-water runoff, and underscore the need to clean up the sources of beach water pollution."
But there are great disputes over how best to control sources of the kind of runoff that eventually can pollute beaches. A House bill to revise and extend the Clean Water Act would have weakened parts of the existing law and would have done little to strengthen regulations affecting runoff, but the Senate never acted on it.
Some states already have comprehensive monitoring programs, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. But the current recommendations from the E.P.A. are not strict enough, the group said, allowing 19 out of 1,000 people to get sick from swimming in "safe" water.
The environmental group praised New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, and Illinois for having taken steps on their own. But others monitor infrequently or only in certain locations: California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York (for inadequate monitoring of its Great Lakes beaches), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, the Virgin Islands, Virginia and Wisconsin.
New Jersey has the most aggressive program, the council said. It includes a bacteria standard, a monitoring program and mandatory beach-closing requirements whenever the standard is violated, no matter what the source of the pollution.
But the environmental group said that such heavily visited beaches as Key West and Miami Beach in Florida, Myrtle Beach and the Outer Banks of the Carolinas, and Santa Barbara, Calif., are inadequately protected. Either there are no monitoring programs at all, the group said, or there are not adequate rules to close beaches or notify swimmers when monitoring turns up problems.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Prince Edward Island Idyll

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
IN early June, I sat in a field of daisies on the north side of Prince Edward Island, looking way below to the village of French River, cupped in rounded hills and almost perfectly reflected in a glistening finger of New London Bay. Nothing moved or marred the lovely picture, which deserved the legend "All's right with the world."
 With just a few exceptions (around the towns of Summerside, Cavendish and Charlottetown), every vista on the island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence could be captioned the same way. Fields, barns and homesteads -- quaint without artifice and fastidiously kept -- blanket the island from tip to tip, giving it the sobriquet "the million-acre farm." Its seacoasts are spliced by still tidal rivers, walled by red cliffs carpeted in grass to the very edge, or lined by deserts of dunes yielding to beaches scattered with shells and seaweed bouquets.
 Prince Edward Island has tourist attractions, to be sure -- small-scale fun parks for kids, craft shops, drive-in movies and a handful of sites connected with the beloved children's novel "Anne of Green Gables," by Lucy Maud Montgomery, which is set on the island. But the wisest visitors come for the countryside, on display at the shoulders of three major scenic routes (Lady Slipper Drive in the west, Kings Byway in the east, and Blue Heron Drive in between); a tracery of narrow, patched country lanes with long pleasurable curves; and even smaller, well-graded red dirt roads that strike out freely through the woods and over the fields. Driving these means noodling aimlessly, getting lost repeatedly, and finding your way home hours later than you planned, no less happy for the delay.
 Back at my desk in New York, I'd plotted a driving tour of the island on an excellent, free map sent to me by Prince Edward Island Visitor Services. It took me over the Northumberland Strait from Cape Tormentine on the coast of New Brunswick aboard a Marine Atlantic ferry ($21 for a car and one passenger), and then about 15 miles northwest to an inn in the leafy town of Summerside called the Silver Fox (where a single cost $54, including breakfast). From there I would roam in an easterly direction to Kings County and Lady Catherine's B & B (with a single for $30, including breakfast), about three miles outside Murray Harbour North, a favored basking place for seals. Then I'd meander toward Prince Edward Island National Park, stretching along the gulf side of the island for some 25 miles, where I reserved a cottage for two nights (at $43 each). And on my last night I'd bed down at another B & B, called the Doctor's Inn (with a single for $34, including breakfast), in the village of Tyne Valley, not far from Mal peque Bay, which has given its name to a variety of oyster I adore.
 Of course, I had to get to the eastern seaboard of Canada somehow. This proved to be no mean feat, partly because I wanted to stop in Quebec City first. Air Canada suggested a New York-Montreal-Quebec City, Quebec City-Montreal-Halifax-P.E.I. routing on the way out, and a P.E.I.-Halifax-Montreal-New York return for $540. Fatigued and impoverished by the very thought of it, I declined. Instead, I bought a round-trip ticket from Newark to Quebec City on a subsidiary of Air Canada called Air Alliance for $208, and booked an economy class rental car from Tilden Interrent at the Quebec City airport for $205 a week with unlimited miles.
 I was glad for those unlimited miles, because it's a 575-mile trip from Quebec City to Prince Edward Island, across New Brunswick's long tracts of dark forest bordered by "Attention Moose" signs. Along the way I stayed overnight in Dalhousie (where Lucy Maud Montgomery once taught school), in a Best Western motel right above a huge paper mill on Chaleur Bay; and then I got lost on the Acadian Coast of New Brunswick, among rivers with names like Bouctouche, Restigouche and Miramichi.
 Still, I reached Cape Tormentine in time to catch a 5 P.M. ferry, which made the crossing in 45 minutes. For me there is something thrilling about going to an island on a car ferry. But this trip was tinged with poignancy, too, because way to the west I could see the controversial Northumberland Strait Bridge under construction, with sections of road perched over the water, petering out to pylons, like an unfinished sentence trailed by an ellipsis. When completed next spring, this 17-mile link to the mainland will make the ferries obsolete. Some claim that it will also change the island's rural face and scare away the strait's lobsters. On the other hand, an islander I spoke with (who'd greeted me with a "Top of the morning to you") said that the crustaceans would soon come to cleave to the bridge's pilings.
 With the bridge almost half finished, I felt as if I'd arrived on the island at a special time. It was early in the tourist season -- the popular "Anne of Green Gables" musical (which runs all summer long at the Confederation Center of the Arts in Charlottetown) hadn't opened yet, there were no ranger-led activities scheduled in P.E.I. National Park, it was still too nippy to swim, and few cars were parked at the mom-and-pop motels lining the eastern approach to Summerside, on Route 11. But as I drove along, I quickly learned that spring has its own charms here -- above all, lupines in several shades of purple, sown in profusion by the breeze.
 A wild thunderstorm awaited me in Summerside, which I watched from the screened-in upstairs porch at the Silver Fox Inn, a pale gray house with twin gables. My small room in the rear had a white iron double bed, private bath, handsome Victorian bureau, and a window overlooking a picket fence. The house was built by a lawyer in 1892, but a silver fox breeder named Wilfred Leckey owned it in the early part of this century, when fox ranching became extremely lucrative on the island, with single pelts selling for as much as $20,000 and rich breeders erecting showplace houses in the pretty residential section of Summerside, back from the port.
 I dined that night in a booth at the Tearoom of the International Fox Museum and Hall of Fame, where a plate of chicken and shrimp satay, a glass of white wine and strawberry shortcake for dessert cost about $15. Afterward I explored the museum, full of cages, soft fox pelts and photos of the big-eyed creatures.
 A run the next morning through Summerside's slightly weary-looking downtown and unatmospheric waterfront persuaded me to make an early start -- in spite of the American woman at breakfast in the Silver Fox Inn who told me that she and her husband had discovered a new concept in vacationing during their weeklong stay on the island. "It's called relaxing," she said. "We sit in one place for long periods of time, just looking at the beautiful scenery."
 For the next four days I, too, sat in one spot -- behind the wheel of my rented car, watching one beautiful scene morph into the next. On my way to Murray Harbour North, I touched down in the provincial capital of Charlottetown, built by the British, who won the island from the French in the 1700's, just long enough to take the air in Victoria Park. But then it was on to Orwell Corner Historic Village (admission $2.25), a restored rural hamlet settled by Scottish and Irish families about 20 miles east of Charlottetown; the stalwart 60-foot lighthouse at lonely Point Prim; the beach at Panmure Island Provincial Park on the island's west coast, where I spotted a live starfish; and Terrace Heights, a waterside restaurant in Murray River for a fried clam dinner that cost $8.
 THAT night I fell asleep beneath a pink quilt in a small room at Lady Catherine's B & B, with a shared bathroom across the hall, slanted ceilings and a rocker. The pale yellow Victorian farmhouse with plenty of gingerbread and a porch swing is set so high on a hill that on a clear day you can see all the way across the strait to Nova Scotia.
 I did more shunpiking the next day, stopping at the Cardigan Craft Shop in the village of Cardigan just north of Montague to buy a hand-knit beret for $7.60; lunching on a juicy fried scallop sandwich at the Blue Fin Restaurant in Souris (for $4.20); sliding down the dunes that guard Greenwich Beach on the north side of St. Peters Bay; touring luxurious rooms in Dalvay-by-the-Sea, a grand hotel at the east edge of P.E.I. National Park built as a summer house in 1896. And still I pulled alongside unit No. 2 at Gulf View Cottages about a mile west of North Rustico well before sunset.
 There, 16 identical white cottages line the top of a hill overlooking the Gulf of St. Lawrence like a military regiment, with a barn and pastures behind them. If Marilla Cuthbert, the no-nonsense farm woman who adopts a freckle-faced orphan in "Anne of Green Gables," had decided to get into the lodging business, this is precisely the sort of cottage enclave she'd have built. My extremely serviceable unit had a deck with a picnic table and grill, sound pine-paneled walls, two simply furnished bedrooms (sleeping a total of six), a sparkling clean bath, a comfortable living room with a television set and the best-equipped kitchen I've ever seen in a rental cottage. The only concession to esthetics, however, was the view out the picture window -- of Rustico Beach and the village of North Rustico Harbor, with its own lobster fleet.
 I'd had lobsters on my mind ever since I arrived on the island, and finally ordered one at the Fisherman's Wharf Restaurant in North Rustico, which occupies a huge barn of a building with seating for 500 and a 60-foot salad bar serving (among many other things) all the boiled Island Blue mussels you can eat; the $18 supper also included clam chowder, dessert and a beverage, but I still had room for the bright red main event -- weighing in at a pound and deliciously fresh.
 The next day I toured one "Green Gables" site after another, starting with the prim Victorian post office in Cavendish where Lucy Maud Montgomery presided as postmistress. In the Green Gables House (also in Cavendish, admission $1.90) I saw the author's antique Empire typewriter; and in her New London birthplace (admission $1.50), her ivory silk wedding dress -- not to mention phalanxes of Anne Shirley dolls sold in gift shops nearby. None of this turned me into an Anne fan, I fear, but I came to respect the writer's kind heart and abiding love of nature.
 On my way to Tyne Valley the next day, I slurped down a dozen Malpeque oysters at Cabot's Reach Restaurant near the village of Malpeque (for about 75 cents each), and breezed through three idiosyncratic little museums, stopping first in Miscouche at the Acadian Museum (admission $2), which had instructive exhibits on the island's French heritage. French Acadian settlers began arriving on the island from the Bay of Fundy area around 1720, only to be deported when the French Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island fell to the British in 1758; 2,000 of them were shipped to France, though some slowly trickled back. I saw boat models, rusty anchors and seamen's knots at the Green Park Shipbuilding Museum (admission $1.90), and learned, at the Potato Museum in O'Leary, that a plain baked spud has just 100 calories.
 At the end of the day, I pulled in wearily at the Doctor's Inn, built in the 1860's on a shady street in little Tyne Valley. My room, on the second floor, had a soft double bed and a lilac bush outside the window. There was a Victorian style tub in the shared bathroom down the hall and a yellow school bus parked by the large kitchen garden out back. Most of my dinner (which cost $19) -- cooked on a wood-burning stove and served by candlelight in the homey dining room -- came from there. It started with a spinach salad, followed by broiled scallops in a bed of asparagus, carrots and beet greens, and ended with coffee and rhubarb cream pie. By this time I'd been in Canada for about 10 days, and this was the best meal I'd had; in fact it was the best meal I've had in ages.
 Afterward, I collapsed into an armchair on the upstairs landing, with a glass of white wine left over from dinner. Happily, I'd already finished "Anne of Green Gables," and could at last crack open a murder mystery.
 
The bottom line
 
Getting There
 I spent an average of $80 a day while on Prince Edward Island, with $43 of that going toward accommodations. In five days on the island, I drove a total of about 500 miles. It's a 575-mile trip to Prince Edward Island from Quebec City. In all, I spent about $86 on gas.
 I bought a round-trip ticket on Air Alliance, a subsidiary of Air Canada, (800) 776-3000, from Newark to Quebec City for $159, and then drove to the Cape Tormentine Ferry in New Brunswick in an economy class car from Tilden Interrent, (800) 227-7368. This not only got me to Prince Edward Island but saved me from having to rent a car once there. However, those who prefer not to stop in Quebec City should call Air Canada, (800) 776-3000, which has flights from Newark to Halifax, where you can make a connection to Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island. When I contacted the airline in early June, the lowest round-trip fare from Newark to Charlottetown was $344, nonrefundable, with a Saturday night stayover.
 For information about Marine Atlantic Ferries, call (800) 341-7981; the company also runs ferry service from Maine to Nova Scotia, as does Scotia Prince, (800) 341-7540. N.F.L. Ferries, (902) 566-3838, operates ferry service from Caribou, Nova Scotia, to Wood Island on the southeast coast of Prince Edward Island. And for information about the Northumberland Strait Bridge, scheduled to open in May 1997, call (902) 437-7273. To reach Prince Edward Island Visitor Services, call (800) 463-4734.
 Prices are calculated at $1.31 Canadian to the U.S. dollar.
Where to Stay
 Silver Fox Inn, 61 Granville Street, Summerside, (902) 436-4033 or (800) 565-4033, has six rooms with private baths priced at $50 to $60 (including a Continental breakfast).
 Lady Catherine's B & B on the Kings Byway Scenic Drive (Highway 17) in Murray Harbor North, (902) 962-3426 or (800) 661-3426, has four comfortable bedrooms sharing two baths, ranging in price from $34 to $38, double occupancy (including breakfast) in the summertime.
 Gulf View Cottages, North Rustico, (902) 963-2052, has a children's playground, laundry, and 16 cottages with two bedrooms each, kitchens, grills, and private baths, priced at $70, double occupancy, from June 22 to Labor Day.
 The Doctor's Inn, Tyne Valley, (902) 831-3057, has two guest rooms with shared bath, for $42, double occupancy (including breakfast); dinner, by reservation only, costs $19 a person, including wine.
Where to Eat
 The Fox Tea Room at the Fox Museum and Hall of Fame, (902) 436-6707, is at 286 Fitzroy Street in Summerside; Terrace Heights, (902) 962-2465, is in Murray River, in Kings County; the Blue Fin Restaurant, (902) 687-3271, is at 10 Federal Avenue in Souris; Fisherman's Wharf Lobster Suppers, (902) 963-2669, can be found at the crossroads in North Rustico; Cabot's Reach Restaurant, (902) 836-5597, is west of Malpeque on Route 135. And I can recommend yet another lobster supper -- at St. Ann's Church, (902) 621-0635, just west of Stanley Bridge on the north side of the island.

HEADLINE: The View From: Village Creek, South Norwalk;
Keeping a Postwar Dream Alive

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
NO gatehouse or stone pillars mark the entrance, just a plain wooden sign announcing Village Creek. Three roads wind through the residential community in South Norwalk, shady streets with views of salt marshes and Long Island Sound, leading to houses all but hidden by ancient trees. A visitor notes the way the homes nestle into the land, the spare but elegant architecture recalling the 1950's, the added wings and porches that speak of growing families and changing needs.
It was indeed during the early 50's that Village Creek took shape, the dream of a small group of young couples -- the men all veterans of World War II and all of them ardent sailors -- seeking a peaceful place to raise a family. 
 Discouraged by the high price of shorefront houses, they decided, in the fall of 1948, to pool their resources, purchase a large parcel of land and subdivide it. They looked at sites from New York to New Haven and settled on 71 acres surrounded on three sides by water and salt meadows, a wooded, uninhabited peninsula belonging to the former Nash Engineering Company, which was eager to sell. They they rounded up friends, and friends of friends: a total of 30 families at first, each willing to put down cash, which was matched by the father of one of the young men -- a total of $75,000.
They were artists and architects, doctors, lawyers, educators. By November 1949, when the first meeting of the Village Creek Homeowners Association was held, 46 lots averaging one-third of an acre had been sold. Records show that the first road was almost completed and ready to be turned over to the City of Norwalk and that $3,000 was appropriated for improving the beach. The waterfront was, and remains, one of the community's major attractions, with every homeowner guaranteed the right to moor a boat.
"Those of us who started Village Creek had a special kind of a community in mind," reads the prospectus published in 1951. "We were looking for a good place in which to live and bring up our children, a community which would be in itself a model of democracy. We wanted a healthful place to live, waterfront, view . . . but above all else we wanted a community with a completely democratic character -- no discrimination because of race, color, creed or politics."
What they developed, explained Roger Willcox, one of the community's principal organizers, was a cooperative, integrated community that offended many at that time.
For 10 years, no real estate broker would show a Village Creek house to a white family, but the residents organized a committee that saw to it that homes were sold by word of mouth.
"Now, the integration factor is no longer unusual," said Mr. Willcox on a recent day, as he sat on his porch overlooking boats at their moorings and the Norwalk islands in the distance, "it's the harbor that is unusual. Now we are attracting families with boats and most of them are white. We make a constant effort to maintain the racial integrity of the community."
Such efforts sometimes lead to unusual situations, like the time during the 1960's when the Village Creek Homeowners Association tried to dissuade a prominent black couple from buying a house in a corner of the community where numerous black families already lived.
"We didn't want a ghetto within an integrated community," Mr. Willcox related. "The prospective buyers were offered several other properties that were available, but they insisted on that very one and brought charges against the association."
The ensuing legal maneuvers -- with the local N.A.A.C.P. weighing in on the side of Village Creek -- made the headlines as a rare case of reverse discrimination and consumed more than a year. During that time, several other homes changed hands, making the racial balance more equitable in the disputed area. The homeowners association eased its stance, the family bought the home they loved and they still live there.
A half-century after its founding, the racial balance remains much as it was in the beginning, with one-third of the community composed of nonwhite families, Asian as well as black and interracial.
Other controversies, unrelated to race, have dogged Village Creek over the years, including a six-year fight -- joined by residents of neighboring communities -- against Connecticut Light and Power over the plant they planned to build on Manresa Island. The power plant was eventually built -- its two blue buildings can be seen from many sites in Village Creek -- but the opposition was able to get pollution controls that were unheard-of in the 1960's.
In recent months, the combat has concerned a rock-crushing operation that a contractor wanted to install on Wilson Avenue, within sight and hearing of Village Creek Homes.
During a leisurely stroll through the community, the president of the homeowners association, Hu Lindsay, pointed across a scenic wetland to the site of a gravel operation, where the controversial machine was to be moved to crush used concrete and asphalt for later sale and re-use.
Opponents feared that dust, loud noise and additional truck traffic would degrade the quality of life for everyone, risking pollution of the surrounding salt marshes and marine life.
The fight was joined by neighbors from an extended area, Mr. Lindsay explained. Both sides had employed lawyers as well as experts in acoustics, traffic, pollution control and environmental matters and dozens of residents had spoken out at meetings of the Norwalk Planning and Zoning Commission.
"Village Creek has had a number of big battles," Mr. Willcox commented at the time. "And it did not come out second-best."
Last week, the Planning and Zoning Commission voted 4 to 2 to deny the application for the crushing machine and the community was able to return to its routine.
For all the controversies, present and past, Village Creek has remained a remarkably peaceful, stable community. The covenants that were established at the start are still in force. The three-person Architectural Control Committee remains the arbiter of all exterior changes, and any tree that stands four feet above ground cannot be cut down without permission. Residents volunteer to do common chores like painting the lifeguard stand and picnic tables every spring, and parties at Christmastime and the Fourth of July bring forth the best talents of neighborhood cooks.
Half the houses are still owned by the original 64 families or by their descendants, and in many cases the sons and daughters of founders have bought homes for themselves in the community.
"During the 1980's we thought we might be turning into an old folks' home," said Mr. Lindsay, "but suddenly, younger people started to move in. Now the age of our population runs from 4 months to 96 years."
A compelling picture of life in Village Creek is evoked by a group of letters from people who grew up there -- recollections published in 1985 on the occasion of the community's 35th anniversary.
Sailing is mentioned many times, as are swimming, caroling and "calling everyone by their first name." "The kindness of so many neighbors" is recalled, the feeling of "an extended family," the fact that "the adults were doing such interesting things, were such special people."
"I never had time to develop racial, cultural or economic prejudices," concludes one former resident. "I was too busy smiling and enjoying other people."

Why Cities Set Their Sights So High

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger 

 BODY:
THE WORLD'S TALLEST building is nearing completion in -- Kuala Lumpur? What kind of place is that for the highest skyscraper? Not that it will much matter, since an even taller tower is already under construction in Shanghai. And after that, who knows? Bangkok? Singapore? Taipei?
It's a long way from New York and Chicago, where most of the world's tallest buildings have been for almost all of the 20th century. Now these American cities lie quiet, not entirely devoid of new construction but almost so, and emphatically uninterested in building tall just for the sake of building tall. The mantle of Tall, Taller, Tallest has passed to the other side of the world. And if I can stake one claim for certain, it is that it will never return to this continent.
The reason for this is simple and tells a lot about the symbolic power the skyscraper continues to possess, even as it moves toward its second century. Buildings that are very tall -- buildings that are not merely high but awesomely high, buildings that grab statistics like "world's tallest" or "world's second tallest" -- are the product, by and large, of cultures that are in the first flush of excitement at moving onto the world stage. Such buildings are assertions of power, demands to be noticed, and there is a particular moment in the life cycle of a rising culture when those impulses are irresistible.
The moment comes after beginnings and before maturity. When a nation is relatively young and limited in its resources, it's obvious that the notion of putting up any kind of skyscraper, let alone of aspiring to build something that will knock a rival off its pedestal, is unthinkable. It's no accident that there were few tall building in Asia until recently, for while the cultures of Asia were ancient in one sense, they were relatively young so far as their position in the world economy was concerned, and they had other priorities than building to make themselves noticed.
But now, as the global economy shifts more and more toward the Pacific Rim, these countries hold a commanding position. They not only have money; they want to spend it in a way that will demonstrate their economic vigor.
How like New York and Chicago around the turn of the last century this is! The muscle-flexing represented by the Woolworth Building in New York, which at 792 feet was the world's tallest from 1913 to 1930, is not so different from what the people shaping Kuala Lumpur or Shanghai are after today. (Official rankings are kept by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat at Lehigh University, by whose accounting the Woolworth has now fallen to No. 65 on the list of the tallest 100 in the world.)
When the Woolworth was new, there was a fresh, tough, bravado to it all. Make it bigger, bolder. Make it show the world that we are in charge, that we have arrived. Never mind that Benjamin Harrison was President in 1890, when Joseph Pulitzer built the World Building in Lower Manhattan, which at that time was the world's tallest; the spirit of the American skyscraper was the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt. (Not to mention of Pulitzer himself, who was determined to use great height as a means of showing off the might of his newspaper, The New York World.)
And on it went, from the Metropolitan Life Tower of 1909 (700 feet) to Woolworth -- a monument to the might of American business if ever there was one -- to the Chrysler Building (1,046 feet) and the Empire State Building (1,250 feet) in the early 1930's. And then on further, all the way to the twin towers of the World Trade Center (1,368 and 1,362 feet, respectively) in New York and the slightly taller Sears Tower in Chicago, which at 1,450 feet wrote the final chapter in the saga of American supremacy of height in the early 1970's.
NOW, SUCH BRAVADO belongs to the East, and I am not sure it is an entirely bad thing. No one in New York has talked about putting up the world's tallest building in more than a generation, except for Donald Trump, and in an odd way, his preoccupation with it during the 1980's merely proves the point that striving for great height is a sign of an arriviste culture, not of a mature one.
New York and Chicago had more or less lost interest by the 1980's, learning to be comfortable with their urban fabric as a totality and coming to think of this "world's tallest" business as little more than macho strutting. It took an anachronism like Mr. Trump, whose near obsession with the idea of putting up the tallest structure in the world made him resemble the swashbuckling builders of a much younger New York, to put the world's tallest building back on the agenda.
It's no accident, I think, that the skyscraper never became the obsession in Europe that it was in this country once, and has now become in Asia. True, Europe has plenty of tall buildings, and as we move toward a more global economy it will undoubtedly have more. But it has never had the world's tallest (forgetting, for the moment, the Eiffel Tower, really a spectacular work of engineering more than a building) and its urban inhabitants have never seemed to miss it.
Europe was a mature culture by the time the skyscraper became technologically possible in the late 19th century, its cities largely built up in solid patterns resistant to the large-scale intrusions that skyscrapers represented. And while Europe encouraged and celebrated engineering advances (long before the Eiffel Tower, there was the Crystal Palace and all of those extraordinary railroad bridges) its architects and builders did not seem to feel the need to express their supremacy by erecting buildings of great height. They were, by and large, confident that the urban fabric they had was sufficient.
Perhaps this was because Europe had already asserted itself in terms of building tall. The European equivalent to what the United States experienced in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries and what Asia is experiencing now, had already come in the Middle Ages, when Europe's cultures were new and strong and powerfully assertive as builders of cathedrals.
What was Beauvais Cathedral, after all, but a brazen attempt by height-obsessed French builders to erect the world's tallest tower (157 feet)? It fell down, twice, but the engineering hand was more sure elsewhere. And as a group the towers of the great cathedrals of Europe must surely be the most concerted attempt to express a powerful, unified societal vision through building tall that has ever occurred in human history.
What light does that shed on the current wave of skyscraper building in Asia? The makers of the world's tallest buildings of today are not motivated by the visions that drove the cathedral builders, of course, any more than the builders of American skyscrapers were. Yet there remains a sense of cultural pride behind their determination: each super-tall tower stands as a reminder that Asia's national economies are growing faster than any place else in the world and that Asia now holds the place in the world economy that the United States did for the last century.
Since height itself is the point, design is often secondary. It is American architects who are doing most of these new towers: Cesar Pelli in Kuala Lumpur, Kohn Pedersen Fox in Shanghai and many other American firms filling Asian cities with also-rans that are nearly as tall.
This being an age of internationalization, it's hard to see much that distinguishes these buildings, even the best of them, from what their architects might have done for a client in Dallas, Frankfurt or Johannesburg. The shapes are striking, and most of these megabuildings are not bad as works of design; continuing an obsession begun in the 1980's, there is an emphasis on giving each and every building its own, readily identifiable form. Make it a logo, not to be confused with anyone else's building.
But do Cesar Pelli's twin, rounded towers in Kuala Lumpur (1,483 feet) have anything to do with Malaysia, or with Asian cities at all? Will Kohn Pedersen Fox's even taller tower (by 26 feet), a twisted slab with a hole punched through the top, tell us anything about Shanghai?
For now, no. These buildings emerge more out of an international design language than out of anything specific to their place. But wait a bit: the same could once have been said of the Eiffel Tower, or of the Sears Tower, or even of that greatest of all symbols, the Empire State Building, which was really just a kind of generic stepped-back tower but eventually become a virtual trademark of New York. These newest skyscrapers may well do the same for their places, in time. We may not be seeing great architecture, but we are surely watching icons in the making.

HEADLINE: Ticket Agents Now Helping Riders Use Machines

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
IRA S. LONDON of Northport walked up to the ticket machine at the Greenlawn railroad station and tried to insert a $10 bill. The machine would not take it.
"First you have to select the station," a ticket agent off to the side said. 
 "I know how to do it," Mr. London snapped as he searched for the right button.
Moments later, the machine spit out his ticket and change.
"I'm wondering, why are you here?" Mr. London asked the agent.
Commuters at six other Long Island Rail Road stations have also been asking the agents that question for more than two months.
The agents do not issue tickets and they no longer sell subway tokens, the way they once did.
Their sole job now is to help commuters figure out how to use the machines that the railroad wants to use to replace them.
A spokesman for the L.I.R.R., Sam Zambuto, said the line intended to install machines at 32 lightly used stations. Fourteen already have the machines.
Machines have replaced agents at 36 of the 134 stations.
The agents at the 32 stations were supposed to show commuters how to use the machines, before being eliminated in April in an economy move.
That plan ran awry when Nassau County and then three organizations for the disabled sued the line. The organizations contend that blind and visually impaired riders incur "irreparable harm" because of the absence of ticket clerks.
The lawyer for the groups, Dolores Fredrich, said in court papers that the Americans With Disabilities Act permits changing services only if such moves do not "affect the usability" of all or part of an existing service.
Lawyers from the L.I.R.R. said the change in staffing did not constitute an alteration in service, as the disabilities act defines such changes. In addition, the lawyers pointed out that the machines could be used in Braille and were "accessible to the visually impaired to the maximum extent feasible, which is all that is required by the A.D.A."
The L.I.R.R. said those passengers could buy tickets on the train without having to pay the $2 surcharge.
After a hearing, Judge Leonard D. Wexler of Federal District Court in Hauppauge issued a preliminary injunction on May 30. He directed the railroad to keep agents at an initial group of seven stations where the L.I.R.R. had closed ticket windows.
Judge Wexler ordered the railroad to reopen windows at a second group of seven stations.
A trial is scheduled to begin on Friday.
Mr. Zambuto said the judge gave the railroad a choice for the initial seven stations, to reopen their ticket windows from 6 A.M. until 1:30 P.M. or to assign agents to the platforms from 6 A.M. to 9 A.M.
The railroad took the second choice, and the agents at East Hampton Greenlawn, Lawrence, Locust Valley, Oakdale, St. James and Sea Cliff have been posted near the machines or have been sitting in the waiting room sipping coffee and reading.
The chairman of the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council, Larry H. Silverman, said his council opposed most of the closings. The closings, Mr. Silverman added, could be averted if the Transportation Communications Union, which represents the 230 agents and their supervisors, agreed to permit a limited number of part-time workers during the rush hour.
Mr. Silverman said the union had resisted the proposal for part timers.
The general chairman of the union, Kenneth A. Lipton, said he had not ruled out part timers. The problem, Mr. Lipton added, is that after first suggesting 16 part-time workers, the railroad increased the number, to 46.
"There was no way I could agree to that," he said. "We are looking at the 16. And I'm also going to let them do away with 16 of my highest-paying positions. They include 9 cleaning foremen and 7 others."
Mr. Zambuto said using part timers was critical and that "at this time the unions have not agreed to use part-time employees."
At Greenlawn on a recent morning rush hour, Malcolm B. Sonsire of Greenlawn wondered aloud why the agent was coaxing him from behind as he went through the motions of pushing the buttons and inserting a $10 bill.
"What do you do here, work on your good looks?" he asked. "You stand here telling me how to work a man-made machine. Why are you here?"
Minutes later, Judith W. Wingate of Huntington asked for help as she tried to buy a ticket to Hunters Point.
"I asked him to help me," she said after the transaction. "Why not? He's here. My head is too old to deal with a machine. I'm technophobic."
As she glanced down at the change Ms. Wingate asked: "You ever seen a Susan B. Anthony? People are afraid it's a foreign coin and are reluctant to take it." The machine uses the Susan B. Anthony coin for dollars rather than bills.
Michael S. Brenner of Greenlawn said he, too, refused to use the machine because it did not work if he did not have the exact change.
"Our monthly ticket to Penn Station costs $181," Mr. Brenner said. "But you can't put in 10 20's, because the machine will return no more than $9.75 in change. And if you want to buy a one-way ticket, you can't use a 20, because a one-way to New York is $8.50. Also, I can't get tokens the way I used to from the ticket agent."
Mr. Brenner, who said he had been rider for nearly 20 years, said he would be willing to pay a little more if the ticket window remained open.
Daniel R. Dwydir of Greenlawn said he had been commuting for 30 years and had changed from buying his monthly tickets at Greenlawn to buying them at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. "I won't use the machine," he said. "I'm not going to put $181 into the machine and hope it works. I'm going to give my money to a human being."
As Joseph C. Morenly of Centerport inserted his money he said: "The one thing I hate is that it just takes bank debit cards and not credit cards like Visa. I think they would have a lot less problems if they had those machines."
A few minutes later Barbara D. Pickell of Greenlawn walked in, poured a cup of coffee and joined the conversation.
"It's terrible what they've done to this station by eliminating a person here," she said. "Now there is vandalism and no oversight. Not only is there vandalism to the station -- there used to be a nice library in here with books on the wall -- but to the cars in the parking lot. At least when a clerk was here there was someone to call the police."
As she sipped the coffee, Ms. Pickell said the vending machine was difficult to deal with and unpredictable.
"I'm not going to stick my debit card in there," she said. "There was a letter to the editor in the local newspaper recently from someone who said his card was charged but that he didn't get a ticket. I'm not going to go through the rigamarole of trying to get my money back because of a broken machine."
She said that on at least seven mornings in the last eight weeks "people have said the machine was broken."
Joseph M. Foresto of Greenlawn said that he had tried to use the machine but that "it wasn't cooperative."
"It wouldn't take a certain year's quarter," Mr. Foresto said. "I ended up having to buy a ticket on the train and paying a $2 penalty. I told the conductor that the machine didn't work, but it's not his fault. I understood he was just doing his job."
A train pulled in, and Jack Alkon, a driver for Greenlawn Taxi, pulled up.
"Last Saturday," Mr. Alkon said, "people were standing out here with that big heavy rain and getting soaked as they waited in line at the machine. And it's ridiculous to have a man here telling people how to work the machine."
Mr. Zambuto said that 15 of the 80 machines accepted credit cards for monthly or weekly purchases. He said the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the railroad's parent body, was reluctant to increase that number because of the service fees involved with using credit cards.
Mr. Zambuto added that the machines' reliability had been better than expected. On average, he added, machines break down after 12,000 transactions.
Mr. Zambuto acknowledged that conductors charged passengers $2 penalties if they did not have tickets.
Passengers who have complained that machines would not print tickets because of a lack of change have received $2 refunds, he said.
Budget deficits led the railroad to eliminate agents at 32 stations, Mr. Zambuto said. "These budget reductions were largely achieved through administrative reductions," he said. "In the prior five years there was an employee reduction of about 12 percent. So we need to look at other areas to achieve reductions."
He said eliminating the agents at the 32 stations would save $2.8 million a year.
Mr. Lipton of the union said that when the agents ended their three hours at the seven stations they travel to busy stations to help there. It is comical, he agreed, that the agents do nothing more than help customers use machines.
"They'll stand on their heads to get a day's pay," he added.
Mr. Lipton said figures compiled by union members showed steep declines in revenues at the seven stations with closed ticket windows. A comparison between April and May in 1995 and this year showed that sales dropped, from $490,283 to $134,149.
Mr. Zambuto said the railroad expected that and that the figures merely reflected a shift of sales to other stations or by mail.

HEADLINE: ENCOUNTERS;
A Link to Pre-War Japan Builds Bridges in the Arts

BYLINE: By ERIKA DUNCAN; Erika Duncan is a novelist and essayist who lives in Sag Harbor.

 BODY:
THERE is something intrinsically delightful about the sort of person who will say "This happened to me," instead of "I did this." It is as if the world in its bounty came and offered them whatever it was they had accomplished, instead of the other way about.
So it was with Beate Gordon, who at the age of 22 found herself one woman among 25 men, precipitously assigned by MacArthur to write the Japanese constitution still in use today. Single-handedly she wrote the women's rights clause, her face lighting up even now as she relates the story. 
 For 20 years the director of performing arts, films and lectures for the Asia Society in New York, Beate was one of the first people to bring Asian music, drama and dance to the United States, traveling to remote mountain shrines and tropical islands looking for traditional art.
She was the force behind bringing the Vietnamese Thang Long Water Puppet Theater first to Lincoln Center and now to Southampton College, where it is presenting its last three performances today.
Until a few years ago, around her 70th birthday, she thought nothing of going alone to remote hamlets in Borneo, watching dances of people who once were headhunters, riding over rapids in speed boats to get there or climbing stone steps in the mountains to witness performances in temples in bitter cold.
She watched fakirs climbing long poles on ladders of knives. She found in Australia Aborigine sand painters, and then, bringing them to this country, combed the beaches of Long Island for the proper color sand.
"I can't take pride in having discovered a lot of things really. I sort of had them thrust on me," she said in the same tone of voice as "It happened to me."
She grew up in Japan, from the formative ages of 5 to 15. By a series of coincidences her father, a Viennese concert pianist, had been lured to Japan by a composer who admired his work and given a post in the Imperial Academy at a time when few Westerners lived permanently in Japan.
Right before the war Beate was sent to school in the United States, where because so many Japanese-Americans were in detention camps, she found herself in demand as a translator and interpreter. She worked for the Office of War Information, even having her own radio show, a nostalgia program to try to convince the Japanese people to surrender, that was supposed to be the counterpart of Tokyo Rose.
She had wanted to return to see her parents, who as Jews in 1943 were sent to the resort town of Karuizawa, but she couldn't go back to Japan as a civilian, so she went as a researcher attached to the Army.
Now at 72, her face expands into a wideness in which you can feel that even her eyes are smiling, as she tells how "a month after I arrived, our general gathered us together and said, 'You are now a constitutional assembly, and under orders from General MacArthur, you will write a constitution for the Japanese Nation.'
"It was a project that was supposed to be top secret. Every draft that the Japanese government had come up with was almost like the Meiji Constitution, conservative and feudal and keeping the Emperor's power in place.
"When we received our assignments, there were only two men on our committee and me. They said, 'You're a woman, so why don't you write the women's rights.'
"I got into a jeep and asked the driver to take me to the nearest library to gather samples. This was top secret. Because we could not tell anybody about this and we didn't want anybody to become suspicious, I went to as many libraries as I could, getting one or two constitutions from each.
"I gathered up 10 or 12 constitutions from all over the world and became very popular because everybody wanted to look at my constitutions. I studied the women's rights very carefully, remembering what my mother had told me when I was a young girl in Japan and the speeches about women she had given in Vienna.
"I remembered from my childhood how when I would visit my friends, that while the mother was the mistress of her own house, controlling everything inside it, in the streets she would be expected to walk behind her husband. In the outside world she had no rights at all.
"I remembered friends being prepared for marriage. I knew that they would not be able to choose a husband and often wouldn't even know the husband beforehand. I had heard Japanese women who had traveled in Europe speaking about how difficult it was to be a woman in Japan."
As I watch her, I can see as if in double exposure the determination of the Beate of 50 years before. A little detail comes back to my mind, how she told me that her mother's first marriage had been arranged.
In addition to the fundamental rights to divorce, property, inheritance, domicile and choice of a spouse, she had found in the European constitutions many social welfare items, like help for nursing and expectant mothers and illegitimate children, and she had carefully included them.
When the men on the steering committee shaved her contribution down to only the fundamental rights, eliminating the social welfare clauses, because, they said, the United States constitution had no such thing, Beate started to cry. They told her not to worry, that the occupation was going to last for a long time, and they would see to it that these were implemented in the civil code. But Beate didn't believe them.
"Then when the constitution was finished, I thought this was to be the end of our work. It had taken one week. But when it was presented to General MacArthur and the Japanese government, I was asked to participate, not as a writer, but as an interpreter. The head of the interpreters was Lieutenant Gordon, whom I later married. It was again to be top secret and we were not allowed to leave the room.
"It started at 10 A.M. and I thought it would be over in a few hours. But the Japanese government put up a tremendous fight, starting with the Emperor's rights that had been curtained. I offered to help the Japanese with their language, to speed things up, and our colonel must have sensed that the Japanese side was becoming favorably inclined towards me, because at 2 A.M. when they finally got to the women's rights, he said: "Miss Sirota has her heart set on women's rights.Why don't we just pass them?' They were struck that the colonel would say such a thing, and they did pass them. Of course, no one knew that I had written them."
Beate stayed in Japan for another year before returning to the United States, working first in the political purge, similar to the German de-Nazification, and then in the economic purges. She joined the others involved in writing the constitution in refusing interviews, in the interest of not having their constitution thought of as imposed. And gradually the history was forgotten.
It wasn't until relatively recently, when the Japanese were asked to send troops to Bosnia and refused on constitutional grounds, that interest in the writing of the constitution began to be revived. Beate had become a bit of a heroine suddenly, and she was asked to write her autobiography.
Beate is talking on the telephone when I arrive. She has just lost a relative in Israel and she is talking first in French and then German, moving freely back and forth among the six languages she knows, so I am told to try out the hammock on the porch of this overly simple rented house, where the pine trees and the nearness to the sea remind her of vacations spent growing up in Japan.
When she ushers me in, her 4-year old grandson hides behind her, and she tells me that in Japan children are not considered to reach the age of reason until 7; therefore, she has nothing in this family retreat that any one of her three grandchildren might not be able to touch.
"In the Japan that I knew, even the most elegant house is not very different from other people's houses, only the richer people might have a border of brocade along their tatami mats, while a poor fisherman or farmer would have only a border of black."
And these sentences, as first introductions, seem to say a great deal about how she thinks and feels.
It would be one of those leisurely visits where food and drinks were served with a grace not quite familiar, where the various levels of interchange would move not chronologically but rather back and forth, from descriptions of the Vietnamese water puppets she was bringing to Southampton College this week to the tales of how, leaving the life of translation and interpretation behind, she "happened" to start the performance programs first for the Japan Society and then later for the Asia Society.
There are some people who speak in image, and Beate is one of those. She told me how in her programs at the Asia Society she instituted pre-performance demonstrations in which people sit on the floor very close to the performers.
She made a point of having elaborate program notes prepared by scholars -- this was a big part of her work. Before every performance she would give two or three minutes of light, telling the audience to please read their notes.
"You must forget what you have been taught about your own Western classics and open up your heart to the penetration of the music and the colors," she said. "Then you will see how close to you it is.
"But only the best performers can communicate to an audience that doesn't know their art. That is why I have traveled so extensively and been so careful to bring only what is very close to the well. It is like drinking from the well, getting the very pure things. Although I did bring over such 'modern' amalgamations as Butoh, I am mainly interested in bringing the originals.
"I realized a lot were museum pieces. But we do go to museums to see art that is very old and to learn from it. We don't know what Egyptian dance was like, but in Japan we do know what was present 1,000 years ago in the Imperial courts and the shrines. What a glorious thing to present to American composers and dancers, to see what has held for generations."
Then we spoke for a while of the difference between true assimilation and what she calls a fusion, what happens, for example, when whole cultures are inundated by rock and roll.
Her parents had been part of the Viennese intellectual and musical world, which persisted even in Japan when people like Heifetz and Rubenstein, Ruth Page and Chaliapin would come to their house, so that very early also, she said, she was exposed to the pure thing.
She was also taken to many Japanese performances and learned in the homes of her friends the purity of Origami paper folding -- how a single piece of paper could be used over and over -- and the philosophy of flower arrangements, why they had to be so different in summer and winter to convey opposing sensations of warm and cool.
These two arts, now thought of as characteristically Japanese, originally came from China, a country much richer in natural resources, she explained. But Japan, such a small island country, had to make do with very little:, three flowers to represent heaven earth and man; a single piece of paper that could be either a boat or a helmet or a Samurai warrior or a crane.
"All of these things were daily occurrences in the houses of my friends,"
She herself had wanted to be a dancer, and she took lessons in both Asian and Western dance. But when she was about 15 her mother told her that although she had beautiful hand movements, her technique in her legs and feet was not sufficient for her to become a first-rate dancer. Then her mother told her in graphic detail she will always remember about the life of a second-rate dancer, the sleezy hotels and the suffering.
So Beate went to America to college instead, becoming eventually a facilitator of the arts, which, in a way, was following her mother's footsteps.
"My American friends think my mother did a terrible thing to me, but I don't think so," Beata said as she told a story about a pupil of her father's who said, "I am going to play in the countryside, so therefore I don't have to practice, for the people will not know the difference."
"No," her father had said. "If you go to the country, you will have to play better to convince people who may not know the beauty of Western music."
"In our house," Beate said, "nothing second rate was allowed."
This idea, of needing to be the best possible in order to open the heart of the stranger, must have stayed in Beate's mind when, out of her first incarnation of working in radio and translation, she gradually began to work in the arts, the new work being both a coming together and a return.
In an hour or so Beate and I watched a videotape of the Vietnamese water puppets, but right now I want to pull together a few missing threads of her chronology.
Returning to the United States and marrying Lieut. Joseph Gordon, she had taken "a few boring jobs" before becoming the interpreter for Fusaye Ichikawa, "Japan's leading suffragette," who had come to the observe the Eisenhower elections and together they went all over the country talking to women's groups.
Then, after her daughter was born, she began to work with exchange students for the Japan Society, and noticed that the neediest among them were always in music and drama and dance. She could hardly bear to see the red hands of the violinists, who were forced to wash dishes every night, so she had organized a fund raising in which those students played.
Just by chance, Mrs. John Dewey happened to be in the audience, and the rest is history: the first $3,000 grant from the Japanese consulate; programs at first with Japanese performers who already happened to be traveling in the United States (therefore transportation didn't have to paid); later her own trips to Asia, the first Asian programs at Lincoln Center, the educational programs in the schools.
As the light fades, we sit in the livingroom of this unimposing rented house with its touchable objects. The little boy comes out and stands with us shyly, watching for the angels with whom he will dance, as the scene of the Vietnamese water puppets flashes on the video screen.
Beate's face glows as she describes how the puppeteers must stand chest deep in water in this art deriving from third century China and then disappearing, coming mysteriously to Vietnam, a water culture, where it has remained, as she describes the elaborate system of poles and strings of an astounding mechanical and esthetic sophistication.
I watch as the water and the colors reflected beneath and above it seem also to be caught in a symmetrical dance of shimmering ultramarines, bright magentas and violets, while dragons and fish, men and boats dive and dance. The little boy quickens at the sight of men herding water buffalo, stoical and whimsical at once, with pink perplexed faces and bodies both static and flexible on strings -- so serious in their play.
Slowly talking to her grandchild and me all at once, Beate's hands rise, quite beautiful in their gesture, as I think of the fact that her mother said even though she has beautiful hand movements she shouldn't try to be a dancer, even as the musicians are singing the words of a story I feel but I can't understand.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Threepenny' Gala, One-Woman Shows

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
SUMMER after summer, Lucille Lortel, the mistress of the White Barn and the queen of Off Broadway, insists: "I can't do it anymore." And then she does it one more time.
Why then should this summer be different? 
 The 48th season of the White Barn Theater and Museum in Westport, which began last night, was to have lasted one night only: Aug. 25.
And in the works is a gala honoring Kurt Weill, Lotte Lenya and Bertolt Brecht, with cast members of Ms. Lortel's 1955 revival of "The Threepenny Opera."
But other entertainers and other events "just came up," as Ms. Lortel put it. Now that single concert is to be the capstone of a month of seven lit-up nights, with cabaret shows of two performances each over three weekends.
Tonight at 8 the singer Juliette Koka offers a double bill: Jean Cocteau's "Sound of Silence" and excerpts from her new staged concert, "Juliette" in which she sings songs ranging from works by Edith Piaf and Noel Coward to those of Neil Sedaka and Richard Maltby Jr.
"Mostly Women II," a sampler of one-woman shows, is next up, Saturday and next Sunday.
"Willie's Ladies Sing the Blues," Carmen de Lavallade's meditation on the problems of Shakespearean heroines set to choreography by Geoffrey Holder, is to be followed by June Havoc, a memoirist of legend who spans the vaudeville days of Baby June, the marathon dances of the Depression and a grown-up life of considerable accomplishment as playwright and musical and dramatic actress.
Liliane Montevecchi is to effervesce as the third woman in a bountiful evening that is somehow expected to make room for Max Showalter, a one-man show unto himself.
Mr. Showalter will recall a 10-year film career (1950 to 1960) that did not allow him to appear as Max Showalter. "Darryl Zanuck told me, 'We just finished fighting the Germans. You can't use that name.' " the actor said.
And so Mr. Showalter made 34 films under the name Casey Adams. Clips from two of them -- "Niagara" (one of two he played in with Marilyn Monroe; "Bus Stop" was the other) and "Elmer Gantry" will be shown during Mr. Showalter's part of the program, which, be assured, will not run short of stories about screen stars, stage stars, composers -- and about how Mr. Showalter got his rightful name back.
The lyrics of Ira Gershwin will propel two performances on Aug. 17 and 18 in a program devised by Rex Reed. Such estimable cabaret performers as Mary Cleere Haran and Billy Stritch will interpret songs with music by Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, Vernon Duke and Burton Lane. Not just George. And by Weill too.
Although "Threepenny Opera" is the centerpiece of the season's finale, the show on Aug. 25 is to include appearances by Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson in passages from "Brecht on Brecht," and by Melissa Errico, the singular sensation of New York's musical theater season just passed when she was Venus -- truly by critical acclamation, was Venus -- in the City Center/Encores concert staging of "One Touch of Venus," with music by Weill and lyrics by Ogden Nash.
Among the original cast members of the "Threepenny" production, in the Marc Blitzstein adaptation, that ran for more than six years at the Theater de Lys, now Ms. Lortel's namesake theater in Greenwich Village, Beatrice Arthur (as Lucy Brown) and Jo Sullivan Loesser (as Polly Peachum) will figure in the Weill/Lenya/Brecht occasion.
From her home in Brentwood, Calif., Ms. Arthur said: "Even after all these years, doing 'Threepenny' has to be the high spot of my professional life. It was the first time I got any recognition. I was unsure of myself and scared to death."
Ms. Arthur's stage roles in the original casts include Yente the Matchmaker ("Fiddler on the Roof") and Vera Charles ("Mame") before she became a television star.
Lenya, who played Pirate Jenny, "was my strongest influence," Ms. Arthur said. "She was mesmerizing. I learned economy from her -- and I felt omnipotence."
Ms. Arthur left the "Threepenny" cast to stand by for Tallulah Bankhead in a Philadelphia tryout of a recycled "Ziegfeld Follies" that never made it to Broadway.
"I've spent the major part of my adult life in that little box -- no more sit-coms for me," Ms. Arthur continued. "Now ply me with a stage offer. Coming back to this event is a way of celebrating Lenya -- and my own beginnings."
Since the debate over the exclusion of Off Broadway from Tony Awards consideration goes on, it is instructive to point out that Ms. Lortel's production of "Threepenny Opera" won a Tony. So did Lenya as featured musical actress. Scott Merrill, who played Mack the Knife, was a nominee in the musical featured-actor category. All for a production Off Broadway.
Ms. Lortel, a famously innovative producer who gave chances to Beckett and Albee, to Genet and Fugard early on, has even set a Tony Award precedent without knowing it.
About the current White Barn season, she said: "I'm tired, darling, but I can't resist the theater," hastening to name two productions -- "The Boys in the Band" and "The Tooth of Crime" -- coming up at the Lucille Lortel Theater, and a limited engagement of Ms. Montevecchi's new revue, in memory of Martin Kaufman, at the Kaufman Theater. All Off-Broadway.
All the season's shows are under the artistic supervision of Donald Saddler, the choreographer who credits Ms. Lortel with giving him his first directorial job: "Berlin to Broadway With Kurt Weill."
White Barn Theater, Newtown Turnpike, Westport. 227-3768. Tickets to most shows are $30 each but the Weill/Lenya/Brecht event costs $100 and includes the museum exhibition as well as a reception. The Weill/ Lenya/Brecht exhibition, curated by Mary Henderson, can be seen by appointment through October.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Federal Dollars at Work

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
TWO and a half years ago, when the Federal Government announced that 100 cities would receive $3 million Enterprise Community grants with which to create jobs in poor neighborhoods, Bridgeport and New Haven were among the recipients.
In New Haven, the grant appeared to draw the community together and strengthened neighborhood activism. 
 But in Bridgeport, there was factional bickering and a complete breakdown in the process, which resulted in the municipal government taking control away from neighborhood organizers.
Federal grants are often awarded with considerable publicity but seldom attract much follow-up attention unless questions of corruption arise, or disputes ensue over the grants' extension in Congress. How New Haven and Bridgeport dealt with the Enterprise Community money provides a glimpse into what happens -- or does not -- after such a grant.
People close to the decision-making processes in the two cities suggested that the seeds of New Haven's harmony and of Bridgeport's discord were present well before the grants were announced.
Bridgeport started off with power issues raised by neighborhood activists, who argued that authority over the grant was controlled by a few politicians and business leaders, instead of the neighborhoods. Although this dispute was quickly resolved, bitterness over it lingered. Bickering between factions competing for control eventually erupted into open war as they publicly attacked each other's motives.
New Haven, on the other hand, had already resolved these issues. The committee that was formed to set neighborhood priorities and allocate funds for them grew out of an established structure of neighborhood organizations created two years before to work with the police to address social problems that were hampering crime-fighting efforts. Neighborhood representatives to those organizations had gradually acquired the ability to work together and trust each other, qualities that were absent in Bridgeport.
The Enterprise Community grant originated in the Urban Marshall Plan, drafted by a Congressional caucus led by Representatives Christopher Shays of Stamford and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, who later resigned from Congress to become president of the N.A.A.C.P. The legislation provided for 10 grants of $100 million each and 100 grants of $3 million.
"We wanted to prove that a real effort to attract busineses to a community would pay off tremendously," Mr. Shays said.
Bridgeport vigorously entered the competition for the grant set aside for cities of its size. Mr. Shays said its application was the first submitted to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, and was supported by a coalition of the city's government, business community, social service institutions and neighborhood groups.
When it was eliminated from consideration for $100 million, and received $3 million instead, Bridgeport was forced to downsize its efforts. New Haven, which had applied for the smaller grant, had no such disappointment to face, and went straight to work.
The plans of the two cities were similar from the start, having been devised under the same Federal guidelines. They create programs for neighborhood improvements, education and job training, family-oriented and youth-oriented services, and economic development, including loans and technical assistance for entrepreneurs. The major difference was in implementation. In New Haven, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said, planning and implementation of the grant was in the hands of the Enterprise Community Council, a 30-member board. Twenty of its members were selected from among representatives on neighborhood police district management teams, and the rest from the city government and several major businesses and institutions in the city.
Ten police district management teams were formed four years ago to help the police address issues like housing blight, dysfunctional families and substance abuse, which affect neighborhood crime rates. Already familiar with their neighborhoods' particular needs, the management team members were viewed as a valuable resource for connecting the Enterprise Community Council with the six neighborhoods targeted as beneficiaries of the grant.
"If you weren't active on a management team, you couldn't end up as a citywide representative," said Howard Gilreath, a member of the grant committee from the Newhallville neighborhood.
Mr. DeStefano said that in addition to managing the grant programs, the Enterprise Community Council has become "a platform for community-based planning and consensus."
"That's better than money, in many respects," he said. "I think money without a sense of ownership and participation by the community often doesn't work because it seeks to impose a paradigm on the community in a direction it doesn't want to go."
In contrast, the process in Bridgeport apparently began poorly and got steadily worse. The initial committee, formed to apply for the larger Empowerment Community grant, consisted of representatives from the city government, the business community and major institutions. When grass roots community organizations complained, they were included, but an atmosphere of resentment and suspicion remained.
"It started off with control issues from the very beginning," said Alma Maya, who wound up as one of three co-chairmen of the Community Collaborative of Bridgeport, which was to act in the same role as New Haven's Enterprise Community Council. With 50 members representing various interest groups, the ungainly group quickly broke into factions.
The group tried to retain a provision from the city's original $100 million grant application. Known as the Office of Neighborhoods, it proposed to spend nearly $1 million to hire a staff of community advocates and clerical help.
While this provision would have been a relatively small portion of the larger grant, it was a third of the smaller grant. H.U.D., which had to approve Bridgeport's downsized application, ruled that it was too much to spend on administration.
Three major factions formed. One, allied with Mayor Joseph P. Ganim and the business community, wanted to revise the application to eliminate the Office of Neighborhoods. Those wanting to retain the office divided into one faction, including Ms. Maya, which advocated legal action, and another faction opposed going to court.
The group's meetings became preoccupied with questions over who was a member, who had a right to vote, whether H.U.D. had a right to disapprove the Office of Neighborhoods, and whether the group was just an advisory body, subject to the authority of the Bridgeport Common Council.
Many of the Community Collaborative of Bridgeport's members felt their time was poorly spent arguing over procedural points and they stopped attending meetings.
"It became very frustrating because you'd sit at those meetings and argue," said Paul Timpanelli, executive director of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council.
When Mr. Ganim moved to reorganize the group, Ms. Maya's faction sued the city government. In June, a Superior Court judge dismissed their suit, and the Common Council authorized formation of a new committee, its 20 members to be appointed by the Mayor and to be known as the Bridgeport Enterprise Community Partnership.
Ms. Maya says the city government's action was illegal and that her group may sue in Federal Court to overturn it.
"The real issue is they don't want a threat to their power," she said.
For Mr. Ganim, however, the issue is $3 million in Federal funds, which H.U.D. threatened to give to another city if the Office of Neighborhoods remains in the application.
"This isn't some sort of power play," said Chris Duby, the Mayor's spokesman. The city is the fiduciary agent for the grant, and so the Mayor must look out for the interests of its taxpayers, he said.
Several theories have been proposed as to why Bridgeport's experience with this grant was so different from New Haven's.
"I believe it's all political," said Ms. Maya. She blamed Bridgeport's Democratic Party leadership, and Mr. Ganim in particular, for not wanting to share power.
Bridgeport's Assistant Chief Administrative Officer, Brian Williams, blamed Ms. Maya and her allies, some of whom have been dissident voices on other issues in the past, for stirring up trouble for its own sake. "I really believe that this group's mission is to embarrass the administration," he said.
Mr. Shays says he thinks there are people in Bridgeport who fear domination by the city's business establishment. "There are elements within Bridgeport, within community groups, that look at the business community as the enemy," he said. "I wish people would understand that you can't be pro-jobs and anti-business."
Mr. Timpanelli says that Bridgeport's problem is that it doesn't have a dominant industry or institution, such as the insurance industry in Hartford or Yale University in New Haven, to provide leadership. Another problem, he said, is that Bridgeport's neighborhoods are isolated from one another, which tends to blind them to their common interests.
Mr. DeStefano downplayed the role of Yale in his city's success. The university was a resource, but not a deciding factor, he said.
The real key to New Haven's success, in Mr. DeStefano's opinion, was "a lot of time spent up front getting people together working on the project."
Mr. Gilreath added: "The first thing we had to do on the committee was to establish trust between ourselves. We realized that we were all on the same page and it would benefit us more to work together than each on its own thing."

WHAT WOMEN WANT
By Patricia Ireland.
Illustrated. 308 pp. New York:
Dutton. $23.95.
Before reading "What Women Want," I knew virtually nothing about Patricia Ireland, the ninth president of the 250,000-member National Organization for Women. She has been a mainstay of the women's movement ever since she began doing pro bono legal work for the Dade County, Fla., chapter of NOW in 1978. But despite making vast legal contributions, suffering arrest, experiencing terror and despair during killings at abortion clinics and undergoing a painful evolution to a position of leadership, she has not been the magnet for media coverage that earlier NOW presidents were. 
 Well, I know her now, and although I have never belonged to her organization, if I did, I would vote for her -- or, more important, get out the vote for her -- any day. But this was not an easy decision to reach. Her political autobiography starts out with so many acknowledgments that I wondered if she had written any of the book herself.
One pines for a newspaper editor to order Ms. Ireland and her advisers to put the news on top. Late in her book we find what would have made a good starting place: her discussion of the dilemma that faces all who organize women -- whether to enfold or ignore the women whose politics, personal lives or long-term goals would not pass Pat Buchanan's God, mother and apple pie test.
"Looking back on the history of the modern feminist movement," she writes, "I'm confident that the industries that profit from discrimination against women and the politicians who are indebted to those industries would not have suddenly embraced the E.R.A. even if every lesbian had been purged from the ranks of the movement and shoved back into the closet nationwide. Somehow, too, I doubt that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the National Manufacturers Association would have encouraged George Bush to sign the Family and Medical Leave Act if we'd only been willing to turn our backs on young women's and poor women's right to abortion. But in my early years of activism, none of this was so clear to me."
How many times have friends and supporters been alienated while young activists grind their way through to this understanding? For Ms. Ireland, who has always been sensitive about discussing her sexuality (she acknowledges having both a husband and a female companion), it must have been excruciating to reach this point.
Ms. Ireland started, as most activists do, after an encounter with economic injustice of the kind that jolts a woman out of delusions about a job. In the late 1960's, having previously endured a flesh-market job screening, Ms. Ireland was working as a flight attendant for Pan American World Airways. Her husband, a student, needed expensive dental work. Pan Am told Ms. Ireland that her medical coverage did not provide for him, although male employees' wives were covered.
Ms. Ireland called the Dade County NOW branch, and she was urged to call the United States Labor Department. She did, and suddenly Pan Am saw it her way after it was called to the company's attention that President Lyndon Johnson's executive order requiring Federal contractors, Pan Am included, to have affirmative action programs had been extended to cover women employees in 1967. Still, Pan Am wiggled, saying dependents were covered only when the employee was the head of the household. These days even such grudging concessions seem like basic justice. But winning such changes was not simple, and they were won, as were the battles in the black civil rights movement, with huge sacrifices as well as wits.
"What Women Want" is the perfect gift for the young woman fresh out of, say, Princeton, who does not yet realize what Patricia Ireland, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jane Roe won for her, and at what peril, because these gains may be lost.

THE TRUE STORY OF THE NOVEL
By Margaret Anne Doody.
Illustrated. 580 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.:
Rutgers University Press. $44.95.
Margaret Anne Doody is not a critic who minces words. "One of the most successful literary lies," she has declared, "is the English claim to have invented the novel." Rarely have a writer's initials been more appropriate: Margaret Anne Doody is mad as hell about the lying English and their literary land grab, and she's not going to take it anymore. 
 The untruth that so vexes Ms. Doody will be familiar to anyone under 60 years of age who has taken a college course in the English novel. It began with Marxist critics who saw in the "realism" of the post-Renaissance novel a bourgeois resistance to aristocratic romance. The English bourgeoisie, as Marx notes in "The Communist Manifesto," was once a revolutionary class, and the early novel was one of its forms of protest against the old regime. Ian Watt's still hugely influential 1957 volume, "The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding," solidified the "novel as recent English invention" thesis. Mr. Watt's foundation text was "Robinson Crusoe," the fable of modern homo economicus.
According to his theory, the novel rose, like capitalism and the Protestant ethic, in the mercantilist ethos and individualist consciousness of England in the early 18th century. Mr. Watt's sociohistorical argument was modified but not substantially contradicted by another celebrated work of criticism, Michael McKeon's "Origins of the English Novel, 1600-1740," which was published in 1987. Mr. McKeon had specific quarrels with Mr. Watt, but accepted that "the genesis of the novel lies in the great upheavals of secularization and reform that transformed early modern Europe." Similarly, feminists have fiercely contested the novel's paternity but not its place and date of birth -- Britain around the 18th century.
Ms. Doody offers two refutations: one brief, one long. Her brief refutation is the observation that university departments not devoted to English literature have never subscribed to the "lie." (Classicists, for example, have always assumed that there is a classical novel. And comparatists blithely use terms like le roman, der Roman and il romanzo, which do not distinguish between medieval romance and modern novel.) Ms. Doody's long refutation makes up the body of her immensely long book. She begins with a survey of prose fiction from its prehistoric origins to the present day. Delving past any archeological literary record, she speculates that "the novel grew among a motley collection of various peoples living in the Mediterranean basin." Its primeval origins were "probably Egyptian." But why stop there? Perhaps Cro-Magnon man, having slain his mammoth, curled up in a warm cave with a good story and a half-chewed bone.
The first surviving texts are Greek and Roman, by which time the novel is already old. Much space is devoted in "The True Story of the Novel" to summaries of the tiny corpus of extant classical works, from Chariton's "Chaireas and Kallirrhoe" (50 B.C.) to Apuleius' "Golden Ass" (A.D. 155). Ms. Doody's summarizing is vivacious and tailored to the needs of the "well-educated" modern reader who nonetheless has no Greek and little Latin -- let alone Chinese or Japanese. This is not a book for the intellectually timid. At every stage, Ms. Doody is at pains to identify the novel as an anti-civic form of writing: one that is temperamentally at odds with the establishment and drawn to the histories of women, slaves, rebels and the underclass. She is equally at pains to identify "modern" elements in antique texts. Intertextuality, self-reflexivity, hyper-realism, irony and post-colonial multiculturalism are all there from the beginning.
The second section of Ms. Doody's book deals with the circulation and progeny of the "ancient novel" in the period between the European Middle Ages and the 18th century. Her third and most ambitious section is a freewheeling examination of recurrent "tropes" and archetypal elements in novels as separate in time as Heliodorus' "Aethiopica," Jerome K. Jerome's "Three Men in a Boat" and Norman Mailer's "Ancient Evenings."
Having worked his way through Ms. Doody's treatise, the reader is led to ask (as she, oddly, doesn't) why the Anglo-American academic world has bought into the "lie" so enthusiastically. And if the reader accepts, as I largely do, Ms. Doody's refutation, how should teachers reform their syllabuses? They can usefully start by looking at the recent history of their own institutions. It is clear that the "English invented the novel" thesis coincided with two significant educational events. The first was the professionalization of literary criticism in the postwar period and the consequent rise of the English department as a font of critical authority. The second was the lamentable decline of classics (and, to a lesser extent, modern European languages) as school subjects. The English professor under 40 who can read Greek -- or even Latin and French -- with any fluency is now a rarity.
English departments like to see literature as contained within their own territorial and linguistic boundaries. It is very convenient for the instructor to assume that poetry starts with Chaucer, drama with Marlowe and the novel with Defoe. Ms. Doody willfully "rumples such tidiness" and charmingly pictures herself "leaping over a paddock fence and escaping into a larger space." To teach the novel conscientiously, a la Doody, one would begin with, say, Chariton, progress to Heliodorus, thence to Boccaccio and Cervantes, finishing up with Richardson (now in his proper belated place), Goethe, Flaubert, Virginia Woolf and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. In this ideal scheme, the patchwork of departmental turfs would dissolve into the open field of the comparative studies program -- exactly the kind of program, as it happens, that Ms. Doody herself runs at Vanderbilt University.
Anyone who has served on a college curriculum committee will be familiar with the depth-versus-breadth quarrel. Is it better for the student to know a lot about a little or a little about a lot? Over recent years, the pendulum has swung decisively toward specialization. Great-books courses and surveys of world literature have disappeared from undergraduate programs; the formerly broad range of qualifying examinations has been drastically narrowed for the doctoral student. In this vibrant book, Ms. Doody makes a case for the restoration of breadth to the teaching of literary history. She should be heeded.

Up From Conservatism
Why the Right Is Wrong for America.
By Michael Lind.
295 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $23.
THE Republican culture wars transformed the party into a band of inquisitors, labeling homosexuals, feminists, multiculturalists, environmentalists, the urban poor and the pot-smoking 60's in their entirety as enemies of the state. The Gingrich Congress believed its own propaganda and produced an agenda that frightened and angered voters -- particularly women. For Bob Dole -- already cast as the Prince of Darkness -- this additional millstone could easily prove fatal. The party is scrambling for a moderate face, but the damage is already done. 
 In "Up From Conservatism," the political writer Michael Lind describes the culture wars as a succession of "moral panics," like those that brought the Salem witch hunts and the persecution of the Jews in Europe. The analogy is a good one, given that inquisitions are pursued in every era, nation and political philosophy. But Mr. Lind seems intent on a witch hunt of his own. First he conjures up a segregated, self-perpetuating caste -- called the overclass -- which he accuses of scuttling unions, dominating the economy and manipulating immigration to insure a cheap supply of nannies. Then he lays the blame for a host of cultural tensions at the door of mythmongering conservatives who have sold out to racists, eugenicists and right-wing religious "crackpots." The far right's diatribe has indeed been poisonous. But to blame the right wing alone for resurgent racism and hostility toward the poor is to miss powerful forces at work in the culture.
"Up From Conservatism" covers the origins of the modern conservative movement, from William F. Buckley Jr.'s "God and Man at Yale" in the 1950's through the Goldwater 60's and the rise of the Reaganauts in the 80's to the patently racist tracts of Charles Murray and Dinesh D'Souza in the 90's. The title, "Up From Conservatism," is a play on Mr. Buckley's "Up From Liberalism," itself a play on "Up From Slavery," the memoir of Booker T. Washington. The equation of conservatism and slavery conveys Mr. Lind's feelings toward his former colleagues and benefactors on the right. This book is billed as an intellectual history; it could properly be called an indictment.
Mr. Lind witnessed the growth of conservative radicalism from inside the movement. He worked for Mr. Buckley and was a fellow at the Heritage Foundation in the late 1980's, and in the early 90's was made executive editor of The National Interest, the quarterly published by that godfather of conservatism, Irving Kristol. But he grew disenchanted, and announced his defection in caustic articles on Pat Buchanan, the born-again populist, and Pat Robertson, the "energetic retailer of anti-Semitic libels," and in an essay called "The Death of Intellectual Conservatism," published in 1995 in the lefty journal Dissent. He has become a star of the intellectual set, moving from Harper's Magazine to The New Republic and most recently to The New Yorker. He is savaged by the right-wing zealots he deserted, pawed over by the left-wing zealots who covet him as a trophy. He has a pyrotechnic intelligence and a good ear for the moment. But "The Death of Intellectual Conservatism" was unremarkable. The charge that conservatives have become middlebrow, morally corrupt -- and had sacrificed "intellectual standards" -- could be applied to almost any political enterprise. Middlebrow moral corruption is the air in which we swim.
"Up From Conservatism" is a book of harsh predictions, among them: "For the foreseeable future . . . the honorable name of conservatism is likely to remain the property, in the United States, of shifting coalitions of libertarians, racists, medievalists, Protestant fundamentalists, supply-siders, flat-taxers, isolationists, gun fanatics, anti-Semites and eugenics theorists." American conservatism is "dead," he writes, partly because the Young Turks (like himself) have been appalled at the barbarism and fled into exile. My guess is that Republican conservatism is far from dead. It is awaiting the next version of Ronald Reagan -- a charismatic guy or gal who wins the White House by force of personality. When the economy is not in shambles, Presidential contests are decided by personal magnetism, not ideology. But Mr. Lind undervalues this dimension of politics and sees only isms and political labels. He cuts razor-thin distinctions among neoconservatives and neoliberals, center right and center left, left liberals and right liberals, paleoliberals and paleoconservatives, Astroturf conservatives and grass-roots conservatives, and on and on ad infinitum.
Michael Lind is distressed that conservatives have strayed from the gradualist tradition of his patron saint, Edmund Burke. But Burke set an exceedingly high standard. He chose principle over partisanship and is respected by liberals and conservatives alike. In times as rigid as ours, a man of his description would be accused of not making up his mind and be judged too boring for "The McLaughlin Group." The Kristol strain of conservatism owes its allegiance not to Burke but to the German-born political philosopher Leo Strauss, a cult figure who taught at the University of Chicago through the 1950's and 60's. Strauss held Burke in contempt. His own views were disturbingly elitist and antidemocratic. Strauss shocked his students when he told them that the Enlightenment -- by promoting egalitarianism and rationalism over religion -- had led directly to Hitler. There are high souls and low souls, he said, and it is dangerous to assume otherwise. Let the rabble get above themselves, and you ended up with brownshirts sacking the universities.
Irving Kristol is a Strauss fan, as is his son William, the editor of The Weekly Standard and former chief of staff for Dan Quayle. Mr. Lind glances over this connection; the book would have been richer had he lingered on it. He accuses the elder Kristol of selling out to hysteria by arguing "that the true enemy of America all along had been, not Communism, but liberalism." He makes a similar charge against the younger Kristol, for saying that The Standard was "pulling up the drawbridge against the peasants" and that "we conservatives are on the side of the lords and barons." Mr. Lind finds these remarks surprising. But they are pure Strauss -- indeed, Strauss at his most benign.
A chapter called "Three Conservative Hoaxes" is the clearest and most valuable part of this book. It shows how public policy myths germinate and grow unchallenged. The chapter deals with supply-side (voodoo) economics and the education crisis, but its best-argued section focuses on the myth of mass illegitimacy, which, along with the idea that welfare causes out-of-wedlock births, is driving virtually all welfare policy. Mr. Lind recognizes that illegitimacy is less than ideal, but cites Census Bureau data showing that "the rate of babies being born to unwed black teen-agers -- about 80 per 1,000 unmarried teen-agers -- remained virtually the same from 1920 through 1990" -- that is, from before the New Deal. The simple but dramatic fact: Declining birth rates among married couples have caused illegitimate births to account for a higher percentage of the total. In other words, there is no illegitimacy crisis.
He tracks the mythical crisis to a Wall Street Journal essay by Charles Murray and to Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech, which got the nation wringing its hands. Mr. Lind bears down again on Irving Kristol, the publisher of The National Interest and also the co-editor of The Public Interest, arguing that he should have used his influence to expose the lie.
Mr. Kristol is a power broker and tough guy -- but he is not the Antichrist. The illegitimacy data were there for anybody to see but remained largely undiscussed, mainly because pessimism about the poor suits the national mood. We can only guess at the reasons. But the ideas about the importance of social networks in Robert D. Putnam's 1994 essay "Bowling Alone" make good candidates: Americans visit one another's homes and join civic associations less than in any era on record. Alone at the end of the cul-de-sac, we watch murder, mayhem and assorted social pathologies on television. Bereft of community, we have become suspicious of immigrants, of shared social responsibility -- and even of human potential itself. Racist arguments like Charles Murray's conform to this mind-set: they offer "scientific" evidence that the poor are inferior and therefore a hopeless case. The press is culpable too, transmitting the idea with barely a skeptical question. Modern conservatives did not create the national mood; it emanates from well outside the Irving Kristol empire.

Grants That Aim to Use the Past to Help the Present

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE sprawling convention hall and Paramount Theater complex has anchored the boardwalk in Asbury Park since the 20's. But over time its fortunes along with those of the old resort city have changed, pushing it into disuse and disrepair.
Now Asbury Park is restoring the oceanfront complex. In the process, it hopes to spur revitalization of the nearby area and improve the city's economy. 
 What is happening in Asbury Park is happening to historic sites across New Jersey, thanks to state grants. Last month the New Jersey Historic Trust, a quasi-public agency within the state's Department of Environmental Protection, awarded $11 million in matching grants to 27 projects involving buildings owned by government agencies or nonprofit groups.
Some buildings are being returned to their original use or a variation of it, which is the case with the convention hall in Asbury Park and a lighthouse in Atlantic City. Others are being turned to new uses -- such as is the cases in Trenton and Paterson where old factories are becoming museums.
Many local officials view the grants as a tool not only to save a piece of the past but also to build community pride and renewal. They and advocates of historic preservation say restoration also promotes tourism, creates jobs and attracts new investment.
Underscoring such benefits are the preliminary findings of a study being done for the Historic Trust by the Center For Urban Policy Research at Rutgers.
The findings showed that every $1 million invested in preserving historic sites generated 25 jobs and $1.1 million in economic activity, and that when matched equally the impact was greater. Each dollar the trust grants a project attracts $9 from outside sources, said Harriet C. Hawkins, the trust's executive director.
Moreover, said Prof. David Listokin, who with Prof. Michael Lahr is conducting the Rutgers study, from a marketing perspective a historic building restored for re-use could give its owner an edge over a competitor in a nondescript building.
Professor Listokin said the dollars spent on historic preservation were "a pump primer," especially for cities. "But it has to be part of a package that all together gives the critical mass to build upon," he added.
Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, said that New Jersey was among the few states to recognize "historic preservation and economic development are partners in community revitalization."
The recent grants bring to 152 the number of projects funded under the program -- capitalized by $60 million set aside under 1987, 1992 and 1995 bond issues. When completed the projects will represent an investment of $389 million in New Jersey historic resources, said Ms. Hawkins.
THE grants -- $20,000 to $1.25 million -- are used to restore, rehabilitate or improve buildings. The trust holds easements on the land under the buildings that prohibit them from being razed and insures public access for up to 20 years.
Eligible properties are those owned by a government agency or a nonprofit group and listed, or eligible for listing, on the National or State Registers of Historic Places.
Asbury Park's $1.25 million grant will go to the ongoing restoration of the convention hall and theater complex. Tommy Dorsey and Bruce Springsteen, a native of the area who lives in nearby Rumson, have performed at the Classical Revival style complex, designed with nautical details by the architectural firm of Warren & Wetmore, which also designed Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal.
Some $3.6 million in city and state funds have helped to renovate the theater, which is being used this summer for concerts. Alan Feit, Asbury Park's City Manager, calls the complex "the key component in the city's plan to revitalize the area."
Much of the rest of the property lining the boardwalk and two blocks inland is privately owned and mired in litigation. "We need the oceanfront back in our hands," Mr. Feit said, adding that the boardwalk project was one step in the rebuilding process.
In Trenton, a $1.25 million grant will bolster the redevelopment of 45 acres occupied by factories and mills built for the John A. Roebling Sons and American Steel and Wire companies, manufacturers of cables for bridges, elevators and trolleys. The site, near the State Capitol, is to be reborn as a residential, commercial and recreation hub.
The grant will be used to help renovate the former 52,000-square-foot, century-old Roebling machine shop into a museum-science center called the Invention Factory Science Center -- a job that is expected to cost $25 million, said Clifford W. Zink. He is the executive director of the nonprofit development corporation, formed in 1985 to guide the district's rebirth. It is also developing the museum-science center, considered the keystone of the redevelopment site.
The redevelopment district is already home to the Roebling Market, 202,000 square feet of retail space with a supermarket and office and light industrial space that opened in June. Plans are also being advanced to reshape parts of the site into housing for the elderly, an arts center and a hockey arena. "We're taking a resource from the 20th century and making it viable for the 21st century," said Mr. Zink.
City and Mercer County officials see the rebirth of the Roebling complex along with that of the city's riverfront and a neighborhood near its downtown as the "triangle of economic development" to push Trenton's revival.
In Paterson, a $359,000 grant will help restore the Colt Gun Mill, in the 119-acre federally landmarked Great Falls Historic District, not far from the downtown. The derelict building is on a seven-acre site considered the area's largest and most deteriorated. Stabilizing what remains of the Colt Gun Mill "is a first and important step" of a larger plan to restore all seven acres, said Frank Blesso, Paterson's redevelopment director.
THE city has designated a developer to reshape the site into up to 230 housing units as well as some retail and public uses, Mr. Blesso said, adding that discussions were under way to turn the Colt Mill into a museum showcasing the history of the Colt revolver or waterpower.
"This is a crucial parcel in the redevelopment of the district," he added, saying that such redevelopment would, in turn, spur more development in the rest of the city.
In Atlantic City a $1 million grant will be used to help finance the rehabilitation of the 141-year-old Absecon Lighthouse at the core of the struggling South Inlet neighborhood in the shadow of the casinos. The 170-foot structure, with 228 steps leading to an octagonal glass tower, was built in 1855 and served for decades as a sentry and tourist attraction for city.
Plans include making the stairway safe and restoring the interior watchdeck so the lighthouse, closed since the early 80's, can be reopened to the public by next summer. The lightkeeper's house also will be renovated for use as a museum, said Sara R. Cureton, director of the project for the Inlet Public/ Private Association, a nonprofit group that supports the revival of the inlet sections of Atlantic City.
"We adopted the lighthouse, which is an important survivor of the city's past as a key" to that effort, said Ms. Cureton, noting that it was expected to attract over 70,000 visitors a year.
The Historic Trust is the only agency in the state to provide funds for "bricks and mortar" preservation projects. But a survey of 351 publicly owned historic properties conducted by the trust in late 1989 found that $400 million was needed to improve those properties. "We have only begun to scratch the surface," said Ms. Hawkins, noting that the trust was nearing the last round of grants that can be financed from the bond issues.
To that end efforts are advancing to find other ways to finance preservation projects, like piggy-backing on existing state programs, as well as to secure a stable source of funding.
"The hope," Ms. Hawkins said, "is that the Rutgers study will document the importance of history to the economy."

For Love of the Waterside Landscape

BYLINE: By DIANE NOTTLE 

 BODY:
TODAY, high-speed arteries like the Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway dominate transporation in New Jersey, but in times past, people and goods moved through the state on the quieter, gentler capillaries of its rivers and canals. Although waterways lost their economic importance as barges gave way to tractor-trailers, they are reviving and thriving as backdrops for recreation, thanks to projects like the Delaware and Raritan Greenway.
Formed in the mid-1980's, the Greenway seeks to conserve open space in the 400-square-mile watershed of the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park. Its members are not the only New Jerseyans who find peace and beauty on the canal banks. Any Sunday afternoon, visionaries armed with paintbrushes and cameras may be seen in the Greenway, preserving nature in their own way. 
 In "Reflections Along the Canal," the Gallery at Bristol-Myers Squibb in Lawrenceville is currently showing more than 60 works in very different styles by four of these artists: three painters, Dorothy Bissell of Pennigton, Sylvia Cummings Kokatnur and Lucy Graves McVicker of Montgomery Township, and a photographer, Clem Fiori of Montgomery Township. "Before any gallery presentation had been proposed, they were painting and photographing their 'reflections' of their precious canal for their own sensibilities," writes the gallery's curator, Pamela V. Sherin, in the exhibition catalogue. And no doubt they will continue exploring the affinity between art and environment long after the show closes on Sept. 2. DIANE NOTTLE

Suddenly, Main Street Gives Malls a Run for Their Money

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: WESTFIELD

 BODY:
Even before the Gap moved into a pristine brick building here, the shopping district had potential. It was compact, with quaint architecture and a mix of restaurants and stores. The rents were reasonable, especially compared with those in fancy shopping malls. Above all, the residents were affluent and eager to spend.
It made sense, then, for one of the nation's most popular retailers to open a store on East Broad Street in 1992, and for a Gap Kids to spring up a year later. Other national chains have followed, and Westfield is acquiring what most suburban towns only dream of: a business district that is thriving, with enough well-known stores to give New Jersey's ubiquitous malls some competition. 
 Westfield is among a handful of affluent towns that have successfully courted national retailers in recent years, using them to boost their local economies and make a name for their downtowns. The towns -- which also include Englewood, Morristown and Ridgewood -- have aggressively marketed themselves to such stores as the Gap and Ann Taylor, and lately, the chains are responding more frequently.
Retail executives say that downtown locations have become more appealing as mall space has grown more expensive. Meanwhile, they say, customers are tiring of malls and looking for an old-fashioned shopping experience.
"A lot of people don't want to go to the mall anymore," said Arthur Tropp, vice president for real estate at Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware chain based in San Francisco. "The street locations are proving a viable alternative in an awful lot of cases."
Even though sales in streetfront shops tend to be lower than those in their mall counterparts, net profits can be just as high, because they have fewer expenses. In addition to charging up to $65 per square foot in rent, malls charge extra for maintenance, security and other shared services. In a downtown shopping district, businesses might pay an extra tax for such services, but the cost is much lower, said Michael Fabrizio, executive director of the Morristown Partnership.
"It costs far fewer dollars to do business in downtown Morristown than at the Short Hills mall," said Mr. Fabrizio, whose organization has recruited national retailers like Starbucks and Staples. "At the end of the day, the downtown businesses can shut off the lights, lock the doors and that's the end of their expenses."
Towns that do not have giant malls in their backyards stand the best chance of attracting national retailers, Mr. Fabrizio said. Morristown and Westfield were both far enough from malls for the Gap to come in, but Millburn, which has courted national chains for several years, has not been so lucky. The problem is the Mall at Short Hills, which lies within its borders.
"The corporate offices of the Gap already have a thumbtack on their map where Millburn is, because they're in the mall," said Tara Braddish, executive director of the Downtown Millburn Development Alliance.
To speed the arrival of all kinds of businesses, Morristown, Millburn and several other towns have started special-improvement districts, which are run by nonprofit organizations.
The organizations market the towns to various businesses, organize special events and provide maintenance and other services that are paid for by an extra property tax. Westfield has a Main Street program, similar to a special-improvement district, and Michele Picou, the director, has praised the town to national chains and real estate investors for three years.
A year ago, Federal Realty Investment Trust, a Maryland-based real estate trust that buys downtown properties for retail development, bought an 11,000-square-foot property on Central Avenue. It is leasing the space to a brokerage firm and a national restaurant chain, said Anthony Schilling, president of Relocation Realty here.
After the Gap came to town in 1992, Mr. Schilling said, Sam Goody, Kay-Bee Toys, Starbucks and Garden Botanika, a bath shop, followed. Limited Express is opening a store this fall, and Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and Nine West have expressed interest, he said.
But Ms. Picou and several other planners pointed out that a downtown full of national chains is not ideal. The nationals help bring in customers from out of town, they said, but locally owned businesses add a dimension to downtown shopping districts that is lacking in malls.
"If you don't keep the good mom-and-pops, you wind up replicating a mall," said Peter Beronio, director of community services for Englewood, whose sprawling shopping district has national and regional chains and a number of independently owned stores. "We want to offer something the malls can't, like a little ethnic market or a unique craft store."
Local businesses are also valuable because they are more likely than national retailers to get involved in community events, said Lawrence Houstoun Jr., principal of the Atlantic Group, an urban development consulting firm in Cranbury.
"The manager of a national chain store is not always going to be a good participant in the local community," he said.
Mr. Houstoun said that any downtown, no matter how bustling, would have a hard time attracting more than a handful of national chains. For one thing, parking is almost always limited, while malls can keep adding parking decks, he said. And downtown properties tend to be old and small, not the kind most chains want to invest in.
"Most downtown space was built between 1890 and 1920, and you have to combine or expand properties to get the nationals interested," he said "The space in the malls was built for today's retailers, and they can always rebuild if it doesn't fit."
New Jersey's shopping malls are still attracting scores of national retailers -- in fact, many are doubling in size to accommodate larger, showier stores. Some real-estate investors say they have not been entirely successful placing national chains in downtown locations.
Charles Garner, a vice president of Federal Realty Investment Trust, said the company has had more luck bringing national chains to Connecticut's downtowns than New Jersey's.
"There are great markets in New Jersey, but there are also a whole lot of shopping centers," Mr. Garner said. "That limits the nationals who will locate on the streets."
But David Newton, the vice president of Palmer Square, a centrally managed shopping district in downtown Princeton, said he thinks the demand for downtown shopping will keep growing.
"People are coming back downtown because of the tremendous ambience," Mr. Newton said. "They want efficiency, but they also want to feel part of a community."

HEADLINE: A Costly Loo

 BODY:
To the Editor: If you remember the "penny loo" in London, you can forget about it when you shop at Harrods. It now costs one British pound to use the Harrods Luxury Washrooms, as they are called. So make sure that you have a pound ready.
There are exceptions. If you have a Harrods charge account, if you eat in one of their restaurants, if you are disabled, an expectant mother, or a child under 12 accompanied by an adult, then you can use the toilet without charge. But all others must pay. 
 We recently shopped at Harrods and spent the equivalent of about $170, but when my wife wanted to use the restroom she still had to pay a pound.
Harrods' justification was that the charge was introduced after extensive refurbishing of the washrooms and in response to the long lines that were created by the lack of public facilities in Knightsbridge. My answer to that was that Harrods doesn't have enough loos.
Incidentally, the pound is $1.60, which represents quite a bit of inflation from the penny loo.

HEADLINE: The Baby Bulbs;
The End of the Last Great Monopoly

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
JUST as Americans were resigning themselves to the marketing schemes of the telephone companies, another industry is entering the competitive business of dinner-time phone pitches, discount rate packages and rebate checks. Brace yourselves for the electric utilities.
From the days of Edison's first bulb, people have had virtually no choice as to who would supply their power. But at the urging of big customers, mainly manufacturers, many states have begun unfettering electric companies in the hopes that a hearty dose of competition will achieve what government regulators could not -- namely, lower prices and improved service. 
 At least 41 states, including California, New York and Texas, have adopted or are considering plans that would in most cases end utilities' monopolies, encouraging start-up companies and robust competition. Already, the Federal Government has ordered companies to open their wires to competing power suppliers so they can transmit low-cost electricity across state lines.
In some places, electric companies, either on their own or through the prodding of state regulators, have initiated experiments allowing competitors to sell power within their market areas. Such programs are under way in New Hampshire and central Illinois, and another is about to begin in Orange and Rockland counties in New York.
In New York State, the Public Service Commission has issued a plan that would allow consumers to shop among competing electric companies in the next two years. It does not spell out precisely how deregulation will happen, but has ordered five of the state's seven electric companies to submit plans this fall outlining ways to create a wholesale power market by 1998 and to allow retail competition by 1999.
What has prompted all this ferment in one of the last great American monopolies? The century-old industry has always been a natural for monopolization because only a few companies could raise the capital needed to build power plants and transmission lines. Over time, larger companies gobbled up smaller ones, delivering what many economists thought were more efficient services.
But in recent years, lower fuel costs and new technologies have greatly reduced the cost of building and operating power plants, enabling small startup companies to produce power more cheaply than older utilities. And sophisticated buyers, aware of such developments, have begun demanding that they be allowed to purchase power from independent suppliers.

 
 
A Political Issue
 Though many power companies have resisted such demands, the high cost of power has become such a hot political issue in some regions -- particularly the Northeast and California -- that legislators and governors are rushing to deregulate the industry.
"Power will probably be cheaper," said Prof. William W. Hogan at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "But there will also be so much diversity in the way it is marketed that people will forget what it was like to have just one supplier."
As most regulators envision the new system, the existing network of high-voltage transmission lines would remain essentially unchanged, operated by state agencies or regulated companies. Those companies would be required to open their systems to competing suppliers, much the same way that local phone companies allow long distance carriers to use their lines, for a price.
Where deregulation would refashion the industry would be at the two ends of the chain. Now, utilities control the flow of electrons from start to finish, building the generating plants, operating the transmission lines and servicing the meters in every home. Under most states' plans, the process would be divided into three tiers involving three different sets of companies.
At one end would be the generating companies, which would compete to sell power on a spot market, much like a commodities exchange. At the other end, retail providers would buy power wholesale and market it to homeowners and businesses. In between would be the wire companies, which would charge wholesalers and retailers access fees to use their lines. Prices at the wholesale and retail levels would be set by market forces, not government regulators, except perhaps in areas that cannot attract competition. Free-market advocates say competition will force utilities to abandon or modernize inefficient power plants and cut prices for everyone. But critics have raised serious questions for legislators, who in many states will have the final say over how deregulation takes place.
"Unlike your phone, electricity is less optional," said Dan Scotto, a utility analyst for Bear Stearns. "So there are a lot of social issues that will have to be ferreted out. And that means there will be enormous political pitfalls."
Who, for instance, would pay for the costly long-term power contracts or the crushing debt from building nuclear power plants that many utilities are saddled with? Ratepayers now pick up those costs; in a deregulated system, who would pay: shareholders, ratepayers or taxpayers?
Would deregulation encourage the "dirtier" and cheaper power produced by coal-burning plants? Would big users like manufacturers and shopping malls reap all the benefits of competition while homeowners see rising rates? Would companies "redline" low-income neighborhoods?
"In a deregulated environment, many suppliers are going to try to avoid customers they perceive to be riskier," said Nancy Brockway, a utility analyst with the National Consumer Law Center, a Boston-based nonprofit group. "We've seen it in banking and insurance."
One thing seems certain: deregulation is likely to unleash the feverish fight for customers that the telecommunications industry witnessed after the breakup of AT&T.
New Hampshire offers a glimpse of the future. There, two dozen companies are participating in a pilot program to sell power to a small number of businesses and homeowners.

 
 
Have a Tree
 So far, the results could only warm a capitalist's heart. Companies are bombarding potential buyers with advertisements, solicitation calls and gifts. One offered $25 rebate checks to potential customers, only to see a competitor up the ante with a $50 offer. Suppliers have given out free showerheads, spruce trees and almanacs -- even to people who refused their business. Several companies are marketing environmentally "clean" power produced by hydroelectric plants. And one is planning to package electric service with credit card and long-distance telephone services.
Whether this all translates into lower prices remains an open question. "With telephone deregulation, we still are dealing with many issues 10 or 15 year later, and there still is no local competition," said Ashok Gupta, an energy specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The promise of competition can be held out for a long time. We're just starting down the path in electricity and it could be a long time before the promise is kept."

Is Fordham Plaza Space Too Costly, or Politically Incorrect?

BYLINE: By ANDREA K. WALKER 

 BODY:
When 1 Fordham Plaza opened in 1986, it was the first new office complex in the Bronx in more than 25 years. It was supposed to have been at the forefront of economic rebirth in the borough and a catalyst for growth along Fordham Road. And, to demonstrate commitment to the Bronx, the city and state moved in agencies that occupied more than half of the office space.
Last Wednesday, the leases on that office space expired. Arguing that rents were exorbitant, the city and state have chosen to move the agencies out; the city offices will move to available municipal space that will be rent-free. 
 But several Bronx officials, including Borough President Fernando Ferrer, said they suspected political motives. Mr. Ferrer, a Democrat who is considered a potential rival to Mr. Giuliani in next year's election, said he saw the same intentions in the Mayor's cancellation of car-free Sundays on the Grand Concourse.
"In the beginning I rejected that," he said. "I didn't believe anyone could be that small. But with the disallowing of bicycles on the Grand Concourse, and all the other small nuances, I've come to that conclusion -- albeit reluctantly."
Jack Deacy, a spokesman for the Mayor, said Mr. Ferrer's conclusion was "ludicrous." "When you look at the economic issues," he said, "the city is doing the prudent thing by moving the agencies out of a private building where they're charging $30 a square foot into city-owned space where we're not paying anything."
The agencies that are moving out are the Bronx office of the City Planning Commission, the Police Department's crime scene unit and its Bronx internal affairs unit, and the state Department of Housing and Community Renewal. The agencies occupy 130,000 square feet, or close to half the space. The Inspector General's office of the city Health and Hospitals Corporations, which occupies 15,000 square feet, is also moving, to lower Manhattan. In all, more than 400 employees will go.
The state agencies will continue to pay rent in their new quarters. Chase Enterprises, which owns Fordham Plaza, offered to reduce the rent from $30 per square foot to $19.25, but state officials said that was still more than the agencies will pay at their new sites.
Robert Hinckley, a spokesman for the state Office of General Services, which negotiates leases for state agencies, said the Chase offers "have not equaled other proposals we have out there and have not met the need of the tenant agency." He said the state would consolidate four offices at 60 Broad Street in lower Manhattan for rent in the "high teens" and would save millions of dollars through utility reductions and tax abatements.
Some small business owners along Fordham Road fear the relocations will reduce the number of customers. "Most of the people there are my customers," said Steve Katchis, owner of Splendid Deli and Restaurant, a block from Fordham Plaza. "I will lose a lot of people and a lot of business, especially during lunchtime and breakfast."
Ernest Porco, senior vice president for Chase Enterprises, said downsizing trends will make it difficult to find new tenants. Fordham Plaza has only been filled for two years and this is the first year it has made a profit, he said. ANDREA K. WALKER

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Let the Credit Cards Compete

BYLINE: By CHARLES E. SCHUMER; Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic Representative for parts of Brooklyn and Queens, is a senior member of the House Banking and Financial Services and Judiciary Committees.

 BODY:
TODAY, if you call your bank and ask for an American Express or Discover credit card, you'll be told to go elsewhere -- but don't bother trying another bank. Virtually all the 6,500 banks nationwide that issue credit cards belong to the Visa or Mastercard associations, and the handful of big banks that control these groups have collaborated successfully to eliminate unwanted competition.
What is good for these huge banks is manifestly bad for millions of American consumers and for many not-so-big banks because the status quo means a wholly unfair and artificial limit on their choice of products and services. 
 American Express, Discover and other potential credit card companies want the chance to offer their products through banks. The current restrictions in the credit card arena contradict the principles of open markets and price competition that are the hallmarks of a capitalist economy.
Consumers see banks as primary providers of financial services, and banks are delighted to encourage one-stop shopping. However, today's constricted choice of credit cards, which are arguably the average American's most important retail credit tool, is hardly consistent with the image of a "financial supermarket" brimming with a broad selection of competing products.
And as consumers take advantage of the increasing conveniences available through their bank accounts -- from debit cards to home banking on the Internet -- the ultimate reach of this anticompetitive arrangement could be astonishing.
Visa banks, those that belong to the country's largest credit card association, years ago issued a bylaw forbidding members to offer American Express or Discover cards to their customers. Just last month, Mastercard instituted the same prohibition for its United States members. Visa and Mastercard banks are allowed to issue each other's cards, however, and both groups are also allowed to issue Diners Club cards. Apparently, all competitors are not created equal.
Wouldn't it seem strange if all electronics stores agreed to sell only two brands of TV's or if all car dealers carried only G.M. and Chrysler? Shouldn't proprietors be able to sell what they think their customers want? Why should we think differently of banks? Banks shouldn't be required to offer a particular card, of course, but they should be free to choose which cards to offer.
Tellingly, Mastercard took its action fast on the heels of a decision by the European Union in May that rebuffed Visa International's attempt to impose a similar exclusionary policy in Europe. The European Union warned that interference with the freedom of European banks to choose which cards to issue would be "unacceptable," causing Visa to withdraw its proposal.
Why should Americans have fewer choices than the French and British? Have we become less committed to free markets than our European cousins are?
A few big banks dominate the United States credit card market through their control of the Visa and Mastercard associations. Of the 6,500 banks that issue these cards, the 10 largest issuers account for nearly 60 percent of total outstanding card balances. This is clearly why the big banks have such a keen interest in perpetuating the dominance of these two brands. The less competition there is, the less pressure there is to offer better fees, interest rates and features, and the more profitable is the franchise for these controlling banks.
As technology improves the ability to integrate more financial services, the value of this oligopolistic franchise is enhanced, and the ability to unfairly dominate an immense field of services escalates.
For example, consumers who want to use the increasingly popular debit cards may find themselves with few options to Visa or Mastercard products with exclusive access to the big Cirrus and Plus automated teller-machine networks the two associations own.
These anticompetitive conditions clearly violate the principles underpinning our antitrust laws and cry out for corrective action. In a very encouraging development, the Justice Department announced in June an antitrust inquiry into the "competitive issues involving the prohibition of certain joint ventures in the credit card industry." Mastercard's policy decision, occurring two weeks after this announcement, makes such an investigation even more urgent.
If we restore fair and healthy competition to the credit card market, everybody will benefit. American banks will be more competitive with each other and will continue as the best on the globe. American consumers will enjoy the greatest possible freedom of choice at the lowest possible cost, and it is against this standard that market conditions must be judged.

HEADLINE: Columbus Circle Folly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Herbert Muschamp's analysis of the "white elephant" at 2 Columbus Circle (appraisal, July 31) does not mention that the circle has the most repulsive conglomeration of architectural atrocities ever to inhabit a public plaza with the possible exception of Boston's Government Center. 
 What should be done with the site? It is too late for Columbus Circle to aspire to the 19th-century symmetry of a Parisian place or square. But if the Huntington Hartford and Edward Durell Stone folly is to be razed, it would create an opportunity for a vest-pocket park with a waterfall, trees and benches.
Columbus Circle could be made into a park-in-the-round with grass and shade trees replacing the dreadful macadam, and traffic could be diverted with tunnels under it connecting Eighth Avenue with Central Park West and upper and lower Broadway. Such a scenario would permit development of urban sanctuaries for New York's assaulted citizens.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
After July's Shock: Foreign Stocks?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH 

 BODY:
AFTER a scary July in the stock market, many American investors may be looking abroad this summer for more than just a nice vacation.
The greater interest might not be such a bad thing. There are several compelling reasons to go abroad that investors, spellbound by the domestic market's previously stellar performance, may have forgotten. 
 Some reasons are the stuff of many a client lecture by financial planners. Investing in foreign markets -- experts suggest a minimum period of three to five years -- both reduces risk and adds some zip to returns, for example. True, many overseas markets are volatile and any sudden selloff here will hurt other exchanges, too. But despite all the talk about globalization, economies and stock markets throughout the world are typically out of sync. That means when the American market is troubled, others may be thriving.
Moreover, about two-thirds of the world's stock-market value resides abroad; investing only or mostly at home means missing out on some good stocks. And many foreign economies, and thus their stock markets, simply grow faster than ours do.
But there are reasons of the moment to try foreign markets, too. Many of them are cheap, for example, despite some recent run-ups. In Europe, the markets in Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and Poland have attractively low price-earnings ratios, said John Mullin, a researcher with Smith Barney's Global Asset Allocation Group. Some of these countries, like Ireland and Poland, are turning in close to 5 percent annual growth as well.
Europe seems like a good investment in other ways. Spurred by globalization and competition, companies there are just now setting out on the cost cutting that has raised earnings and share prices for American companies.
"I've followed the German market very closely for 10 years and until last year, I never heard the words 'shareholder value,' " said Leah Zell, a co-manager of Acorn International, a small-cap fund. Now, she added, that's all she hears.
The Maastricht treaty on European unification may help investors, too. To comply with the treaty's budget guidelines and for other reasons, Germany, Italy and other countries are selling state companies and partly privatizing public pension plans. To do so, they need better equities markets -- and that means stronger shareholder rights.
The Continent's economic trends are favorable as well, fund managers say. "Europe is very early in the economic cycle and valuations are very low," Edith Thouin, director of European Equities for Zurich Kemper Investments in London, said. "It is overweight in our international funds."
Europe isn't the only place to find cheap stock markets and economic growth. "The emerging markets today are growing at at least twice the rate for the developed economies, or about 6 percent a year," said Josephine Jimenez, senior portfolio manager of Montgomery Emerging Markets. "We expect that to be the long-term growth rate as well."
In this risky area of international investing, Ms. Jimenez prefers countries that are lifting trade barriers, controlling inflation and the like. Such steps, she says, will put more money in consumers' pockets.
What will the consumers be buying? "About half of the 4.5 billion people in the developing countries are under the age of 19," said Ms. Jimenez, whose fund owns stock in about 200 companies in 30 countries. Thus, she said, "certain sectors are bound to grow very quickly, such as housing and consumer goods like home appliances."
Regionally, Ms. Jimenez's fund is heavy in Latin America and Europe. She likes Brazil because of its large population, natural resources, steady progress in revamping its economy and the low price-earnings ratio of its stock market. China and Mexico also have cheaply priced markets and good growth prospects, she said.
Of course, good foreign investments can also be found where the macroeconomic picture is not sparkling. Britain is not high on Ms. Thouin's list of hot venues, but she does like Dixons Group P.L.C., a leading British retailer. One big reason: Dixons' purchase of PC World, the largest seller of PC's in Britain, where only about 10 percent of households own computers compared with about 30 percent in the United States.
For investors shopping overseas, which diversified mutual funds look good? One fund recommended by both Thurman Smith, editor of Equity Fund Outlook in Boston, and Ken Gregory, editor of the No Load Fund Analyst in San Francisco, is Janus Overseas. Started in 1994, the fund has earned 15.02 percent this year through July 31. The fund's manager, Helen Young Hayes, also runs the Janus Worldwide fund, which as of June 30 had produced a five-year average annual return of 21.13 percent.
Both newsletter editors also like Harbor International Growth, another young fund, which has returned 11.79 through July 31.
Thomas Saler, author of "All About Global Investing" (John Wiley & Sons), likes T. Rowe Price International Stock and Vanguard International Growth. Both funds have operating expenses of less than 1.8 percent and have outperformed Morgan Stanley's Europe Australia Far East (or EAFE) index during the last 10 years.
Americans can also internationalize their assets by buying individual foreign stocks traded here as American depository receipts. Mexico's Grupo Radio Centro, for instance, has a 37 percent share of Mexico City's radio market and carries very little debt. Ms. Zell likes the company because insiders own 40 percent of it and the A.D.R.'s, which closed on Friday at $6.875, are far less than their level of about $19 before the Mexican stock market crash 20 months ago.
Some analysts also like Gucci, the Italian luxury-goods producer, which closed Friday at $64.50. Ms. Hayes expects the company to have annual earnings growth of 25 percent for the next three years, both because its new management team has revitalized the brand and overhauled distribution, and because high-end goods tend to be immune to economic cycles. Gerald Moran, who manages the Scudder Global Discovery fund, expects Gucci's aggressive move into Japan to produce results soon.
Another promising A.D.R. is that of Rentokil Group, a British provider of pest control, landscaping, washroom maintenance and other business services. Ms. Hayes expects 20 percent earnings growth from Rentokil, which recently bought BET, another business-services provider. Rentokil, which closed Friday at $62.125, should be able to improve BET's margins, Ms. Hayes said.
As investors consider these possibilities, they should recall that foreign investing has a danger domestic investors never court: currency risk. But here too, the present looks attractive. The dollar is now trading at high values against many currencies, making it a good time to buy foreign assets.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Much Ado About Budgeting

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the scene in "Hamlet" in which Polonius, the old-fogey adviser, gives a windy lecture to his departing son, Laertes? "Neither a borrower nor a lender be," he counsels at one point; it's the sole financial tip in the speech, and it's probably sufficient, given the more pressing problems of the young adults at Elsinore.
Today's 20-somethings may have it easier than Hamlet's crowd; at least most of them aren't up on the roof meeting with ghosts and contemplating regicide. But scary economic limitations have supposedly left them dazed and confused. They see a tough job market or, if they are working, the specters of downsizing and downward mobility. Or so goes the conventional wisdom. 
 Like the prince in Shakespeare's play, Americans in their 20's and early 30's have acquired a reputation for being indecisive, aimless -- whiny, even. And unlike Polonius's son, they don't listen politely to parental bromides. Try telling a Generation X-er who survives on credit cards that "borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
Not everyone in this cohort is brooding, of course. In fact, in some MTV surveys, as we will see a little later on, the Gen-Xers seem to defy the stereotype. But hey, capitalism is tough; it's dog-eat-dog. What's a puppy to do?
Two books aimed at this age group could help. "Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your 20's and 30's" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $11)," by Beth Kobliner, is a highly readable and substantial guide to the grown-up realms of money and business. And for information with an attitude, there's "Now What?! A Guide to Jobs, Money, and the Real World" (MTV Books/Pocket Books, $12) by J. D. Heiman.
Ms. Kobliner, a writer for Money magazine who is as young as her target audience, doesn't strain to establish her generational credentials. Her idea of a slacker's confession is that she didn't start saving for retirement until she was 26. But "Get a Financial Life" knows what youth is wrestling with -- for example, those sumo-sized debts incurred in the college years.
The author adjusts her preferred financial ratios accordingly. Ideally, personal debt, not counting a mortgage, shouldn't exceed 20 percent of annual take-home pay, she writes, but "of course, anyone with student loans probably fails the debt-rule test." She suggests ways of paying down debt more quickly -- there's still pain, but less of it, thanks to smart planning and maybe the judicious use of a low-interest credit card.
Backed up by bibliographies, source lists and useful phone numbers, this book could be tucked into one of those ubiquitous backpacks to guide novices through the thickets of apartment rentals, mortgage applications, taxes and more. Its strength is in explaining both the principles and the practicalities involved in each chunk of the landscape. Banks: best used only for checking and for their teller machines. Auto accident coverage: did you know that students with good grades can get significantly reduced premiums? Investments: for first-timers, money-market mutual funds are best; the author explains why. Retirement: the 401(k) is an "amazing deal," she confides.
And Ms. Kobliner passes my personal test when it comes to life insurance. "The purpose of life insurance is simple," she says firmly. "If you die, it protects the people who rely on your income." So use that 20-something skepticism to resist the sales pitches that try to convince you otherwise.
In "Now What?!" the MTV book written by J. D. Heiman, the landscape shifts a bit. Here, style rules. There are cartoons, jumbled typography, and lots of references to the heroes of popular culture this generation likes to worship self-mockingly: the Brady Bunch, for example. At times, all this gets in the way of the content (which is pretty substantial, actually), and the author comes off like a nerdy teacher trying to be hip. Downsized corporations are characterized as "Kate Moss-like," for example. Sometimes, though, the tone is just right. At work, the author says, "dress for the job you want to have, be clean and cover your navel."
Interestingly, this MTV book assumes quite a harsh tone when discussing credit-card debt, calling it a "horrendous monkey on the back of young America." The book covers budgets, insurance, taxes, job-hunting, working and housing and along the way wanders into spheres not covered by the Kobliner book: how to handle E-mail at work, for example. "Catty comments can end up in the wrong hands with a slip of your finger," the author notes.
And he addresses the problems of balancing values and work. Wall Street is conservative, he cautions; be sure you can handle that before suiting up.
Much of the fun, and some of the failings, of this book comes from its attitude that its audience is no doubt clueless when it comes to the weird financial world it is explaining. Yet the author cites MTV surveys of young people that clash with this image. Asked to name an "appealing" job, for example, more than half of 800 respondents put owning a business at the top of the list. Talk about a willingness to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

HEADLINE: Revamping Welfare, Rebuilding Lives

BYLINE: By Steve Goldsmith; Steve Goldsmith, Mayor of Indianapolis, is the Republican nominee for Governor of Indiana.

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
Last week's historic action to dismantle the Federal welfare system could not have come too soon. A program that began with the best of intentions -- providing help for families who lost their primary source of income through no fault of their own -- has contributed to the breakdown of the family and stymied efforts at urban revitalization. The new law provides the best chance in decades to improve the lot of cities and the people who live in them.
But while the first critical step has been taken, it is only a first step. The next is even more important. 
 The authority now leaving Washington must pass through the state governments and continue down to the local level. Replacing a bloated, unresponsive Federal bureaucracy with bloated, unresponsive state bureaucracies will not do much to help the urban poor. Communities must have the authority to break up the welfare bureaucracy and incorporate welfare into local attempts to rebuild families and revitalize neighborhoods.
From my perspective as Mayor of America's 12th-largest city, the problem with welfare is not that it costs too much. Most of my constituents would not complain if the dollars spent on welfare created happy, healthy families and quickly returned people to the work force. But the inescapable truth is that welfare has done neither, and America's cities have paid the price.
How can they begin to reap the benefits of the new era in welfare? Here are four ways.
* Cities can integrate public assistance with a program that encourages responsible fatherhood. Under the existing welfare program, intact families are punished by the system, and the government takes the place of the father. In my state, a mother qualifies for welfare only if she does not marry her children's father, and a teen-age mother qualifies only if she leaves home. When we collect child support from deadbeat dads, the money does not go to the mother -- it goes to the government, which then turns around and writes a welfare check to the mother.
The long-term consequences of failing to rebuild families will be fatal for cities. David Blankenhorn, author of "Fatherless America," got it right when he wrote, "Unless we reverse the trend of fatherlessness, no other set of accomplishments . . . will succeed in arresting the decline of child welfare and the spread of male violence."
In Indianapolis, we have brought together representatives of the city, including law enforcement, schools and the health department, to create an initiative called Rebuilding Families. We intend to reverse the old incentives by tying benefits to positive behavior -- work, education, marriage -- and toughening the consequences for young fathers who dodge their responsibilities.
Yes, this may cost more in the short term. But the long-term benefit of encouraging family formation far outweighs any short-term increase in the cost of administering welfare.
* Cities can transform welfare into a jobs program. Economic revitalization of troubled neighborhoods is virtually impossible when their residents don't take available jobs. One reason is that welfare often pays more than work, when you take benefits into account. Another is that people on welfare often lack the incentive and the skills to take and hold jobs.
In Indianapolis, a nonprofit organization called Eastside Community Investments helps residents develop what its president, Dennis West, calls "marketable character." It gives its clients what most employers say they want most: the ability to show up for work on time and a willingness to learn.
* Cities can dismantle the welfare bureaucracy. Recently I met with a group of 30 welfare recipients enrolled in an innovative job-training program in New York City. I asked them if their welfare caseworkers had helped them find jobs. One woman said yes; the other 29 laughed out loud.
The current welfare system is like most government agencies. It traps good people in a bad system. Instead of judging the performance of welfare caseworkers by the number of people they successfully place in the work force, government judges them on how many paperwork errors they make.
Instead of paying welfare workers to hand out checks, we must pay organizations for finding people jobs. We need a competitive, performance-based system with many providers.
Long before there was such a thing as Aid to Families With Dependent Children, voluntary charities were helping the poor, the elderly and the sick. These traditional institutions have been weakened by government's drive to acquire a monopoly on the business of helping people, but they are still our best hope. They should be given a chance to compete for contracts to deliver services to the needy.
* Cities can be flexible. No one has figured out how to solve the problems associated with welfare because there is no one solution. The much-touted "two years and out" provision of the new welfare law may sound impressive, but it does not address the immense variety of problems experienced by those who apply for government assistance. For able-bodied welfare recipients, two years is too long. For the disabled, it may not be long enough.
With welfare controlled at the local level, delivered by a variety of competing organizations whose workers are focused on the goal of getting recipients into long-term jobs, we can have a system with the flexibility and heart.
But if local governments are not given the authority to change the system, then all we will have accomplished is a cruel continuation of the old one -- trapping people in a bad system for two years, and then kicking them out.

Free Trade? Don't Sell Us That.

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, Rosa Molina felt she was doing pretty well in life. But now, like many Mexicans, she feels as if she's been mugged by a 19-month economic crisis. Her once-sunny outlook has withered to a brooding cynicism.
Ms. Molina's monthly salary as a stitcher in a garment factory rose during the early 1990's to about $700 a month, and she even began thinking about buying a modest house. Then, in December 1994, the Government devalued the peso by 40 percent and soon Ms. Molina was laid off. A single mother in her 20's, she searched for work for six months before pleading her way into another factory -- at $160 a month. 
 "Now they pay me whatever they want," Ms. Molina says bitterly, pulling her 3-year-old son close to her skirt during an interview in Mexico City's central plaza. In recent months, she has been nursing her anger over Mexico's economic calamity. Like many of her compatriots, she suspects that Mexico's association with the United States and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement is one cause of her downward slide. Meanwhile, she has followed with fury the reports that Raul Salinas, the brother of the former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, amassed more than $120 million during his brother's tenure and that his partners included some of Mexico's wealthiest oligarchs.
"It's frightening, because all this thievery is just sinking our country further," Ms. Molina said.
In other words, disgust with corruption and with Nafta are intertwined in her mind: Like many Mexicans, ever cynical about their officials, she is skeptical of any deals they make.
Opinion polls show that Ms. Molina's bruised perceptions about her country's economy, the job market and how Nafta and political graft may be hurting both are shared by many Mexicans. And it matters little to them that Mexican and American officials and economists believe something quite different: that the country has begun a robust recovery, that the scandals are having little effect on the marketplace, and that Nafta has in fact helped Mexico.

 
 
The Case for Nafta
 Experts, for example, make a convincing case that Mexico's misery has been caused not by Nafta but by the Government's clumsy devaluation of the peso in December 1994 and by the subsequent recession. In that context, the trade treaty, which was preceded by reforms opening Mexico to foreign investment, seems almost certainly to have saved Mexico from meltdown. When the crisis came, the Clinton Administration assembled a $50 billion package of emergency loans, offered by the United States and other governments, which stabilized the peso, partly because Nafta had irrevocably tied Mexico's economy to the United States. (Mexico eventually borrowed $12.5 billion from the United States, about three-quarters of which it has repaid.)
From the first months of the crisis early last year, tire, auto and other manufacturers, vegetable farmers and other stricken Mexicans took advantage of the peso devaluation and the reduced trade barriers to greatly increase northbound exports; Mexico has enjoyed hefty trade surpluses with the United States ever since. (During the first four months of this year, the surplus was $2.6 billion.) The surging exports have helped create new jobs to replace some of those lost. So it is clear that most Mexicans would be in far worse shape today without Nafta.
But that isn't how many Mexicans see it, among them truckers and other businessmen who complain that the treaty has threatened them with overwhelming American competition. A national sounding taken in June by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma found that 67 percent of Mexicans believed that the Government was having little or no success with the free-trade treaty. That marks a considerable shift from 1993, before the treaty took effect, when Mexicans were vastly more hopeful than Americans or Canadians about the pact.Today citizens in all three countries view the treaty with suspicion.
Mexican views have grown gloomier on other topics as well. Reforma's June poll found that 86 percent of Mexicans believe that the economy has either not improved, or has actually worsened, since the dust settled after the crash last year; 64 percent expect it to remain mired at its current level or deteriorate further in 1997.

 
 
Grumpiness Reigns
 It is also a common view that wanton looting of the public treasury by the last Government helped plunge the country into crisis, and 8 out of 10 Mexicans believe that the current President, Ernesto Zedillo, is making "little or no progress at all" against corruption, the poll indicates. "The Mexican people were far more optimistic during the last presidency," said Rafael Gimenez, Reforma's 31-year-old chief pollster. "Now they're grumpy and unhappy."
The contrast between these dispirited public sentiments and the views voiced by officials here and in Washington could hardly be more dramatic. Mr. Zedillo and Treasury Secretary Guillermo Ortiz have repeatedly said Mexico's economy is showing signs of mounting vigor, although Mr. Ortiz acknowledged that "it will be at least a few years before we're able to reach the levels of consumption that we had before the crisis."
In an interview, the United States Ambassador to Mexico, James Jones, insisted that the corruption scandals were not slowing growth, especially as measured by investment. Direct foreign investment -- money spent to build factories or otherwise expand businesses, as opposed to indirect investments in the money markets -- dropped to $5.5 billion in 1995 from a peak of $8 billion in 1994, but is rebounding and is likely to hit $10 billion this year, Mr. Jones said. "The ongoing investigation of Raul Salinas does not appear to have affected foreign direct investment," he said.
On this issue there is considerable debate, however. "In several recent cases the effects of the political scandals have been straightforward," said Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City. Last month a string of Mexico's most eminent businessmen acknowledged that they had conducted murky financial transactions, still under investigation, with Raul Salinas, who is in jail here on murder and illegal enrichment charges. Shortly thereafter, Mexico's stock market took a huge tumble, and several of the companies hurt most were those led by Mr. Salinas's newly revealed partners, Mr. Heath said.
"There's been an increase in investors' perception of risk, derived from the scandals and other things, which cause people to ask how events in Mexico will all turn out," Mr. Heath said.

THE SOCIAL COMPACT
Ending Welfare as We Know It
The New Deal, that 60-year-old foundation of modern government, quaked when the Democratic President agreed to a bill sailing through the Republican Congress that would end Washington's guarantee of cash assistance for the poor. President Clinton signed off on the bill, which will affect tens of millions of people, including one-fifth of the families in America with children. "The current system is broken," he said, and half the Democrats in the House agreed, with a sense of resignation, while almost all the Republicans went along enthusiastically. The Senate followed, by a lopsided vote of 78 to 21. Under the new system, states will manage their own programs with their own rules. The intention is to get the head of every family working within two years, or the family loses benefits.

REPUBLICAN UPLIFT
Gump's Last Fan
Bob Dole's campaign for Director in Chief, or First Critic, took him to Hollywood for the sequel to his lacerating address of last year, when he accused film makers of producing a "nightmare of depravity." This time he took a different tack, saying that the marketplace rewards movies that "raise our vision of life instead of dragging us down." "Schindler's List," "Apollo 13" and "Forrest Gump" were on his list of personal faves.

WHAT CORRECTION?
Clipping Right Along
The economy boomed in the spring, clipping along at a 4.2 percent annual growth rate, but now seems to have slowed to a pace that Wall Street finds very comfortable. The second-quarter's growth in gross domestic product was the fastest in two years, the Commerce Department said, and came on top of slight inflation. But last month, executives who make buying decisions reported weaker demand. And job creation slowed in July, sending the unemployment rate a bit higher. The bond and stock markets liked those signs that the Fed would not have to quiet the economy by raising interest rates. The Dow industrials ended the week at 5,679.83, up 206.77 points, marking a substantial recovery from the market's jitters of mid-July.

BLACK COLLEGES
Graduating to the Big Leagues
Talk about gardening. Bill Cosby tilled the soil, and Johnnetta Cole has brought in the harvest. Dr. Cole heads Spelman College, a historically black women's college in Atlanta that in a coup has raised $114 million. That puts it in a fund-raising league with Bryn Mawr and Mount Holyoke. Camille and Bill Cosby started the ball rolling when they gave $20 million; since then, foundations have anted up $27 million and corporations and alumnae $15 million. When meeting with businessmen, Dr. Cole is known to give them stoles of kente cloth, the multicolored weaving from West Africa, and just might happen to bring along a tax lawyer specializing in gift giving.

STAR-SPANGLED COLOMBO
Imperial Hollywood
Mr. Dole might not be far off when he points out the prowess of Entertainment Americana. For good clean, middle-brow fun, what could be more Americana than "The Rockford Files," "Colombo" and "Miami Vice." They may be cold at home, but they're hot overseas. Hollywood, in this case the production company MCA, is thrilled. MCA sold broadcast rights to those and other television shows and movies for $1.5 billion -- and that's just for the German rights. MCA is also getting a cool billion for some pay-TV rights in Germany.

RETAIL THERAPY
Another Spring for House & Garden
Conde Nast killed House & Garden after a mere 92 years in business, but the magazine can't seem to stay dead. Its return issue is a giant -- it has 207 pages of ads -- but it still begs the question of the revival's survival, because the category of shelter magazines is mighty crowded. But advertisers are convinced that baby boomers are as zealous about their houses and gardens as they are about their 401(k)'s. "It's like hero worship," says Mario Buatta, a designer. "They are looking in the windows of houses where they would never be invited." For tone, the new issue deconstructs the crystal chandelier, and Cynthia Ozick rhapsodizes about the ladle.

PHONE FIGHT
Bells Protect and Defend
The time is arriving for local phone companies to open up their monopolies to the long-distance carriers. The F.C.C. issued elaborate rules -- that is, if you consider 500 pages of rules elaborate -- determining how the Bell companies must open their networks to competition later this year. Bell stocks had been suffering in trepidation for months, but with the rules finally out, the stocks bounced back, and some analysts predict that in the long run, the Bells might retain their local dominance.

 FREE MARKETS
Subsidies Under the Glare
The conservative winds coursing through Washington are rattling other capitals of the welfare state, like Bonn. And now even Tel Aviv is trembling, to the alarm of Histadrut, the labor federation that represents almost half of all Israeli workers. With a Newtish regard for the free market, the new Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, wants to trim back the state's central economic role. He plans to cut the vast network of subsidies to families and state businesses and to bring on competition in areas like bus routes and oil refineries. One commentator, Hanah Kim, loudly said that Mr. Netanyahu was "striking the death chord of social solidarity in Israel," and the debate has only just begun.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
After Magellan, More Navigating
Jeffrey Vinik hasn't taken long to let his bruises heal from his wild ride at Fidelity Investments's Magellan Fund. He left there two months ago after turning the giant fund in a cautious direction a bit prematurely. Now he is said to be in talks with George Soros about managing some of the billions under his care.

HEADLINE: Vision Things;
Democrats Are Fat, Happy and Adrift . . .

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOT since, well, the election of Bill Clinton in 1992 have Democrats sounded so triumphant. If Mr. Clinton maintains his lead in the polls, they note with a touch of braggadocio, he will be the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Party leaders no longer dismiss out of hand talk that maybe, just maybe, Democrats will retake Congress in November.
To top it off, many prominent Democrats were even willing last week to put aside the policy consequences of Mr. Clinton's decision to sign the Republican welfare bill -- and to repudiate a guarantee that had been a legacy of the party for 60 years. For now, they are satisfied that they have snatched another crucial issue from Mr. Dole. 
 But the expectations for a lovefest later this month at the party's convention in Chicago may obscure the fact that the world's oldest continuing political party is suffering from an identity crisis. It is wracked by ideological divisions and starved for fresh ideas, lurching between securing its liberal base and luring support from the right.
Perhaps the only reason the Democrats look so formidable right now is that their standard bearer has proved more agile than Mr. Dole at taking ownership of the Republicans' own ideas. And the relatively high poll ratings of one man -- the President -- have apparently given his party a false sense of security.
"The smugness of Democrats these days has to do with the fact that we have a better horse," said Ted Mondale, a state Senator in Minnesota whose father, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, is Ambassador to Japan. "I don't think there's a clear definition about what Democrats are all about. People just don't think we're relevant."
Former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, whose "new ideas" credo helped him come close to knocking off Mr. Mondale in the 1984 Democratic primaries, said that from education to the military to technology, his party still has not fashioned themes for the post-cold-war era. "The party is intellectually adrift," he said. "The Democratic Party has got less than a decade to really become a progressive reform party with some new domestic and international focus -- or there will be a new independent party in America."
And former Gov. Richard Lamm of Colorado, a longtime Democrat who is seeking the nomination of Ross Perot's Reform Party, declared last month: "Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats want to deal with our most pressing issues. They have hit the snooze alarm and they've gone back to sleep."
White House officials argue that Mr. Clinton can claim a significant record: raising the minimum wage, revamping welfare and putting together a modest yet important package providing continued health insurance for people who move from job to job.
Maybe Mr. Clinton deserves praise for finding common ground with the party that controls Congress. And something might be said for old ideas. After all, new ideas are not always good ideas; the President's last bold initiative was comprehensive health care.
But the liberal Democrats in Congress -- torn between yielding to Mr. Clinton's ever more moderate tendencies and remembering that their party's moderate ranks were thinned in the 1994 rout -- have had no more success at agenda setting. After years of simply bashing Speaker Newt Gingrich, Democrats have unveiled a campaign blueprint calling for new toughness on welfare but also containing the usual nostrums like preserving Medicare and Social Security.
The platform mimics the Republican anti-government pitch, while suggesting that Republicans are too extreme. "That is what today's Democratic Party offers," the document says. "The end of the era of big government, a final rejection of the misguided call to leave our citizens to fend for themselves -- and bold leadership into the future."
To be fair, Democrats have long been a party of coalitions and contention. And Republicans also can be said to be bereft of new ideas. In grandly announcing a new economic plan tomorrow, for instance, Mr. Dole risks being accused of serving warmed-over Reaganomics. But at least it is clear what Republicans stand for: lower taxes, less government regulation and the notion that people can make it on their own.
Democrats have other troubles. Defeats and retirements have nearly wiped out the party in the South. Fewer younger voters everywhere are registering as Democrats. And despite high expectations for Vice President Al Gore, there is a scarcity of promising young leaders. That is why, when Democrats talk about finding a young, dynamic politician to deliver the convention's keynote address, only one name, Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, comes up regularly.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party, insists that reports of fissures in the party are exaggerated. "We've seen tremendous unity in this party," he said. "Maybe some people find unity within the Democratic Party to be something of an oxymoron. But it's one of the reasons we're doing as well as we are."
Others argue that the Democratic Party will eventually have to resolve an identity crisis. "If Bill Clinton had a Democratic Congress," said John R. Petrocik, a political scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, "they'd be at war with each other for the kinds of things he's proposing."
If anything, the internal debate is over degrees of conservatism: No longer are Democrats debating the need for welfare reform, just the extent of it. No longer are Democrats disputing the merits of a balanced budget, only the mechanics. And no longer are Democrats mocking the calls for restoring family values.
There's nothing like success to silence the critics. Last summer, Representative Dave Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, was furious about Mr. Clinton's budget-balancing plan, and said, "If you don't like the President's position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks."
But now Mr. Obey concedes that "we're certainly riding far better than we thought." He argues that the Democrats do stand for something: "To use Government as a backdrop to make sure that certain norms of justice are met -- that means protecting workers and their right to be dealt with honestly in the work place, and protecting their pensions from unfair ripoffs."

 
 
What's the Alternative?
 Even leaders of Americans for Democratic Action, a bastion of liberalism, are willing to forgive Mr. Clinton for his welfare decision, for the moment. "If Dole becomes President, it will only strengthen the more radical conservatives," said Jack Sheinkman, the A.D.A. president. "If we re-elect Clinton, I feel we will be moving in an entirely different direction."
One sign of the ferment just below the surface among Democrats is the relationship between Mr. Clinton's most influential political advisers: Harold M. Ickes, an unapologetic liberal, and Dick Morris, who devoted years to working for Republicans. The two men have never particularly liked each other and certainly have not respected each other's politics. But at meetings with Mr. Clinton, they sit as if they were on the same side. They are -- at least until November.

. . . As Dole Seeks a Verb

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE day last March, as Bob Dole was nailing down the Republican Presidential nomination, he bounded up the steps to his airplane and turned to wave. There was no crowd below, just a couple of aides and a stray reporter. A playful Mr. Dole waved anyway and bellowed: "And if elected . . . ."
Then he went blank. His caricature over, Mr. Dole dropped his arm, turned and stepped inside his cabin. 
 Unlike most politicians, Mr. Dole, a lifelong legislator, is not comfortable making promises. But with his party's national convention next week and the election only three months away, he is being forced now to make a number of commitments that will define his candidacy as clearly as anything he has said or done so far.
Tomorrow, he is to unveil his long-awaited economic plan. At week's end, he is to announce his choice of a running mate. In between, his party is to hammer its platform into place. And next week, he is to give the most important speech of the campaign.
"People have been waiting for him to say something that would give himself a larger definition than Senate majority leader," said Richard Fenno, a political scientist at the University of Rochester.
This week's "declarative statements" should give the campaign a new momentum going into the convention, said John Buckley, Mr. Dole's director of communications. The Dole advisers have long hoped the convention would be the campaign's turning point -- when a bold economic plan, an inspired choice for a running mate and a well-crafted, well-delivered acceptance speech could help Mr. Dole trim President Clinton's 20-point lead in the polls.
But committing himself and laying his cards on the table are antithetical to Mr. Dole's nature.
As a legislator, and certainly as Senate majority leader, Mr. Dole's job was not to make promises but to make deals. The Senator's task was to follow agendas, not set them. Opening negotiations with 99 other individual egos by announcing an end goal would virtually guarantee failure. "He never makes promises until he can count the votes," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas. "It's his legislative soul."
Mr. Dole has also shied from making promises because in a sense they are irrelevant. His candidacy was premised on character and leadership. His experience was his promise.
Mr. Buckley said that when he asked Mr. Dole recently what he was most proud of in his 35 years in Congress, Mr. Dole answered: "I kept my word." Mr. Buckley added, "Dole, in his laconic, sincere, rough-hewn way does not make promises that he doesn't intend to deliver," something Mr. Buckley hopes to contrast with what he describes as President Clinton's ease in making promises and his difficulty keeping them.
But over all, Mr. Dole's tendency to withhold has not helped. When he was first feeling his way along the campaign trail, the most definitive pledge he could muster was this: "I will not take you over a cliff."
Some advisers feared that Mr. Dole's reluctance to tell voters what he would do as President reinforced the idea that he had no reason for running -- except that it was his turn after toiling so long for the party.
"Politics is about making promises and struggling to keep them," one adviser said. Another Republican close to the campaign said: "Promises are central to why you are running. That's why his campaign has seemed so empty -- he never made any."
Mr. Dole has attempted to compensate for his lack of promises by using phrases like "in a Dole Administration" or "when I'm in the White House" to describe what might be different if he ran the country. But he still avoids specifics. Complaining about the Endangered Species Act recently in California, he said: "I know all this is very important, the fairy shrimp and the kangaroo rat and other things, but people are important too. You're important, and you will be important in a Dole Administration." The audience cheered.
Sometimes, in a particularly deft act of circularity, Mr. Dole will make a promise, but only about promises: "We need a President who will tell you something and then deliver on it," he said last month. "That will be my promise to California."
This is in vivid contrast to Mr. Clinton, who by this stage in 1992 had made so many detailed proposals on so many fronts that his aides worried he was raising expectations too high. (The quantity of Mr. Clinton's promises prompted President Bush to note that Mr. Clinton had more solutions than there were problems.)
Instead, Mr. Dole tends to give a nod toward already existing legislation. But even in speaking favorably of, say, school vouchers, or of a plan to deny public education to the children of illegal immigrants, Mr. Dole avoids making a specific pledge. As a result, there is little in his campaign that bears his personal imprint, and voters tell pollsters they are fuzzy about what he stands for.
Now, 16 months into his formal candidacy, it may be time for Mr. Dole to start making commitments.
Statements like the one he gave last week when he emerged from the movie "Independence Day" -- "We won, the end, leadership, America, good over evil" -- are not likely to move a nation.
If Mr. Dole is going to be more effective, he needs to start using verbs, says Roderick P. Hart, a professor of communication and government at the University of Texas. Verbs establish "the language of leadership," Mr. Hart says, allowing someone to say, "Follow me over the hill, men." Once Mr. Dole commits to where he wants to go, then he can use verbs to ask the nation to join him.
"What is a promise," Mr. Hart asks, "but a verb?"

So, You Want to Hold an Olympics

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE between the constant carping of 30,000 journalists from around the world, bus drivers afraid to drive their buses on the freeway and the pipe bomb at Centennial Park, the same thought occurred to a lot of Atlantans early last week -- what have we got ourselves into?
But as the Olympics lumbers to a close much like a soap opera with overwrought twists and turns but a triumphant ending, cities around the country are salivating at the thought of being in Atlanta's shoes. 
 Their reasons vary from ego to economics but they often come down to this: at a time when taxpayers are tight with their money and great civic empire builders have gone the way of the Olympic star without a product to endorse, the Olympics has become for cities the biggest single economic event on the planet.

 
 
Move Over, Izzy
 "The Olympics have replaced the World Fair as the new gimmick of city building," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. New York is one of the cities where there has been substantial talk of bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics.
"We haven't had a major new highway or park in New York since Robert Moses," Mr. Moss said. "The Olympics would be the 21st-century equivalent of Robert Moses, the one way you can mobilize support for massive public investment" (which is what Mr. Moses last did with the 1964-65 World's Fair as his vehicle).
Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani is forming a group of city officials and business leaders to consider bringing the 2008 Olympics to New York City. Daniel Doctoroff, a financier who has begun efforts to stir up interest, said: "Seeing what they did in Atlanta and transposing New York on the event," he said, "I'm even more convinced New York would be the perfect host for the Olympics."
Expressions of interest have also surfaced in Boston, Chicago and other cities. A Houston businessman, Jim (Mattress Mac) McIngvale, best known for late-night TV ads, was here hosting a splashy party to drum up interest in a Texas Olympics in 2008, much to the dismay of the officially designated Houston International Sports Committee, which is hoping eventually to land the Olympics.
Of course, much of what potential Olympic hosts saw in Atlanta wasn't so encouraging. Early in the Games, reporters from around the world lampooned the city as tacky, incompetent and in over its head, although the criticisms softened over time. The pipe bomb incident, which is still unsolved, was a chilly hint of the kind of large-scale terrorism that can occur at such a venue.
But experts say the Olympics offers at least three huge inducements.
One is the economic payoff -- from $4 billion to $5 billion in Atlanta -- of the single biggest single tourist event in the world.
The second is an unparalleled opportunity to draw attention to the host city.
The third is the ability to mobilize public support for rebuilding roads and bridges, building new stadiums and housing, and rethinking urban planning in a way that is otherwise almost impossible in today's fractured, financially constricted cities.

 
 
Never Again
 The problem with the vision of the Olympics as a grand engine of true urban renewal is that it relies on a game plan devised in Los Angeles in 1984 and refined by Atlanta in 1996 of having the Games totally supported by private funds. (Actually, federal, state and local contributions for security and other needs surpassed a half billion dollars).
That plan resulted in so much commercialism in Atlanta that the International Olympic Committee has said it will never again approve a privately financed Olympiad without at least a government guarantee of the financing. Public monies would lessen the need to sell so many sponsorships.
"We have probably seen our last summer Olympics in the U.S. for a very long time," said John MacAloon, a University of Chicago anthropologist who studies the Olympics.
But such doubts do not bother potential American bidders. Mr. Doctoroff of New York City said there are many avenues of "creative" financing that could allow a city to host the Games without resorting to rampant commercialism. And, given New York City's status as the world's media capital, the city could raise more money from fewer sponsors, he said.
"I think America is too important to the Olympic movement to bar it from hosting future Olympics," he said.

HEADLINE: Burundi in Crisis;
America Sits and Watches

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: BUJUMBURA, Burundi

 BODY:
ONE of the many diplomats now struggling to end the chaos in Burundi says that a former Burundian minister sincerely believes that an American aircraft carrier is cruising Lake Tanganyika, ready to invade. When he's told that there's no way to sail a carrier into a lake in the central African highlands, he answers: "They brought it in by helicopter."
Burundi's citizens see plots everywhere, and with reason. Leadership there has been transferred by democratic elections only once, substantially fewer times than by assassination. 
 But how the United States came to figure in the national paranoia is an interesting question.
Burundi, a poor, landlocked, French-speaking country the size of Connecticut, is hardly central to United States policy. There are no historical ties -- Burundi was colonized by Germany and Belgium -- and no minerals or sea lanes. Until last week, American interest was mostly humanitarian.
As in Rwanda and eastern Zaire, the two main ethnic groups, the Hutus and the Tutsis, are in a death struggle, sparing no one, not even women and children.

 
 
A Chilling Statistic
 About 150,000 Burundians have been killed over the last three years -- on average, 100 per day. A former American ambassador came up with a chilling lens for that statistic: given the relative size of its population to that of the United States, Burundi is suffering the mortal equivalent of the Oklahoma City bombing (where 168 died) every hour.
In the last two weeks, the United States has been thrust into the center of Burundian politics. On July 23, the President, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya (pronounced en-tee-bahn-toon-GAN-yuh) arrived at the American embassy asking for protection.
A Hutu leading a weak coalition government, he had denounced his own Tutsi-dominated national army for killing dozens of civilians. Then, at a funeral for 340 Tutsis who were massacred by Hutu rebels at a tea plantation, a furious crowd had pelted him with rocks and cow dung while soldiers watched impassively. He fled in his helicopter. Fearing he would be murdered like his two predecessors, he asked the brand-new American ambassador, Morris Hughes, if he could come in. He's still at the embassy. "Look, we're not going to push him out the door," one official said. "It's important to have assurances of his safety, and I don't know that we've got them."
After two days of denials, the army, led by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, admitted that it had taken over the government. The new President, it turned out, got his military training in Belgium and Germany but his political training in America, and was well known to a few Americans, including former President Jimmy Carter.
Major Buyoya first took power during a 1987 coup. But by June 1993, he had written a charter of human rights and set up an election, pushing Burundi into its brief moment of democracy. He lost gracefully to a Hutu candidate, Melchior Ndadaye (pronounce enn-duh-DIE-yay), despite winning "a respectable number of Hutu votes," an official said. Four months later, though, Mr. Ndadaye was killed by soldiers. Hutu politicians are sure Mr. Buyoya was involved, but international observers are skeptical, especially since he didn't take power.
Instead, he set up the Foundation for Peace, Unity and Democracy, which included Hutus and Tutsis. Helped by as much as $145,000 from the U.S. Agency for International Development, money earmarked for fostering democracy, Major Buyoya visited the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta, was an observer at the South African elections and designed studies of Burundi's refugee problem and justice system. "Frankly, all his proposals were good," said Vincent Farley, diplomat in residence at the Carter Center.
Now American officials seem mildly embarrassed that one of their pupils has ridden a coup to power, but they consistently say the alternatives were worse. Ethnic bloodshed was increasing, Mr. Ntibantunganya's Government was impotent, and Mr. Buyoya's Tutsi military rivals -- who are by no means out of the picture even now -- are far more bloodthirsty than Mr. Buyoya.

 
 
The Larger Nightmare
 But most important, State Department officials want not to be the leader in righting the world's Burundi policy. They sat by quietly as the Organization for African Unity denounced the coup and as the presidents of nearby African nations called for economic sanctions.
The larger nightmare to ward off, of course, is an explosion of killings on the scale of those in Rwanda.
American officials, soured by their experience in Somalia, have said they would, at most, transport and feed another country's troops. They have reason to be reluctant. The hilly, malarious land would be even harder to invade than Somalia (another country where new instability is feared after the slaying of Mohammed Farah Aidid). There's only one jet airport, and it's a long way to the coast. The Burundian army is well-armed and xenophobic, and the Tutsis have warrior legends to live up to. Meanwhile, the Hutu rebels have said they, too, will shoot at foreign troops.
Even if someone were to call for an American peace enforcement mission, the prospects look as likely as a flying aircraft carrier.

HEADLINE: Greek Lawyer Pleased To Defend Serb Leader

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Aug. 2

 BODY:
When criminal lawyers are asked how they can represent unsavory clients, they often say that everyone has the right to counsel.
But Alexandros Lykourezos, one of this country's most prominent and flamboyant lawyers, does not resort to that cliche when asked about his work for one of the most wanted men in the world today -- Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, who has been indicted on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. 
 "I like him," Mr. Lykourezos said, explaining why he has taken up General Mladic's cause. "I consider him a friend" -- so much so that the lawyer, who would not discuss the international war crimes tribunal's indictment against General Mladic, said he was representing him pro bono. While evasive about what he was doing for General Mladic, he did say that he had traveled to Bosnia to meet him.
Mr. Lykourezos acknowledges that it may be hard for Westerners to understand his association with such a notorious suspect. Indeed, he said, he is censured by friends in London, Paris and New York. But not in Greece, where there is much sympathy for Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs.
"The reaction has been only positive here, totally positive," said Mr. Lykourezos. The lawyer, who is 62 and has wild, collar-length gray hair, spoke as he sat at his highly polished mahogany desk in khaki slacks with penny loafers and no socks.
"It is difficult for anybody outside Greece to understand rationally," Mr. Lykourezos said about Greece's relationship with Serbia.
It stems from Greece's hostile relationship with Turkey, which is also often hard for outsiders to fathom, Mr. Lykourezos added. The animosity is rooted in centuries past, to the days of the Ottoman Empire, when both the Serbs and the Greeks chafed under rule from Istanbul, which Mr. Lykourezos calls Constantinople, the Greek name for the city.
These days, though both are NATO members, Greece and Turkey have been on the brink of war, most recently earlier this year over a small, rocky island. The Greeks and the Serbs are also Orthodox Christians and see themselves fighting to hold the line against Islam in Europe.
In recent NATO debates, Greece has strongly opposed any military operation to seize General Mladic, or other people indicted on charges of war crimes, and it did not like the idea of forcing Radovan Karadzic to resign from the leadership of the main Bosnian Serb political party as a condition for the party to be allowed to take part in elections.
During the Bosnian war, Greek companies shipped oil to the Bosnian Serbs and to Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia, in violation of the United Nations economic embargo. Greek arms merchants got weapons to the Serbian forces, in violation of the arms embargo.
When the Bosnian Serbs attacked the United Nations "safe area" of Srebrenica last summer, Greek mercenaries fought with them and raised the blue and white Greek flag triumphantly when the enclave fell. Several thousand Muslim men were massacred, and General Mladic has been indicted on charges related to the killings.
But the fall of Srebrenica and the massacres went virtually unreported by Greek journalists. Indeed, Bosnian Serbian atrocities throughout the war were ignored by the Greek press, leaving most Greeks as ill-informed about the war as the Serbian people themselves.
A couple of months after the fall of Srebrenica, Mr. Lykourezos went on television to raise money for Serbian refugees. More than $400,000 poured in, he said.
Does all this mean that General Mladic or Dr. Karadzic might find asylum in Greece?
While avoiding a direct answer, Mr. Lykourezos noted that while France, Italy and Germany had passed laws to insure that anyone indicted on charges of war crimes who was found on their territory would be arrested and extradited to The Hague, some countries -- including Greece -- had not.
Even though international arrest warrants have been issued for General Mladic and others who have been indicted, some countries must pass domestic laws to provide for compliance with them.
Recently, representatives from the war crimes tribunal came here to ask the Government to adopt laws that would insure full cooperation with the court, Mr. Lykourezos said. He said he thought Parliament would take up the issue when it returned in September from its summer recess.
But given the attitude of the Greek people, it might be difficult to get such laws enacted, he said.

HEADLINE: To Punish Colombia, U.S. May Revoke Air Route

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Avianca, the Colombian airline whose owner is among a handful of major business figures who have supported President Ernesto Samper as the United States exerts pressure for his ouster, is facing the possible cancellation of its lucrative service to New York or Miami.
The United States Transportation Department has announced plans to cancel the flights of Avianca or Aces, another Colombian airline, to Miami or New York after the Colombian Government rejected a request by American Airlines to resume its Bogota-to-New York service, which it stopped in 1993. 
 "We honor our bilateral agreements, and we expect our aviation partners to do the same," the United States Transportation Secretary, Federico Pena, said in a written statement. "We will make every effort to resolve this dispute through further negotiations but are prepared to impose sanctions if we cannot."
Officially, the United States notice is being treated by officials in both countries as a trade issue, unconnected to the threat of economic sanctions that has hovered over Colombia since March 1, when President Clinton decertified Colombia as a reliable ally in the fight against drug trafficking.
But Eugenio Diaz, a member of the Colombian Senate's communications committee, said, "The prospect of sanctions is a direct consequence of the political situation."
Fernando Cepeda, a former Interior Minister and a columnist for the newspaper El Tiempo, agreed. "The U.S. wants to harass the President's main support base, which is Santo Domingo," Mr. Cepeda said, referring to Julio Mario Santo Domingo, Avianca's owner.
Last month, Washington canceled the visa of President Samper, whom State Department officials accuse of accepting more than $6 million from drug traffickers for his 1994 election campaign.
American officials have raised the prospect of further sanctions, most recently after a meeting in Washington with the new Colombian Foreign Minister, Maria Emma Mejia. The sanctions could include eliminating preferential tariffs on Colombian exports or cutting landing rights at airports in the United States.
In July, President Samper was absolved of charges by the Colombian Congress, which counts more than 20 members who are under investigation for possible connections with drug dealers. Business leaders, the church and the news media long ago called for the President's ouster.
Until recently, he has enjoyed the undiluted support of Mr. Santo Domingo, Colombia's wealthiest businessman and owner of its largest conglomerate, the Santo Domingo Group.
In addition to Avianca, the group owns the Caracol radio and television networks, the country's most popular stations, which have been unflagging boosters of the President, and Cromos magazine. It also owns Bavaria, Colombia's most popular beer; a helicopter company; two banks, and many other concerns.
In the last few weeks, there have been signs that Mr. Santo Domingo's support may be wavering.
Augusto Lopez, the president of Bavaria beer, who acts as Mr. Santo Domingo's spokesman in Colombia, visited President Samper to discuss the deteriorating economic situation in Colombia. Associates of Mr. Santo Domingo have reportedly been in contact with Vice President Humberto de la Calle, who may become President if Mr. Samper resigns.
And the editor of Cromos magazine was replaced by a young maverick who describes his profession as "anti-Samperista."
Mr. Santo Domingo, through his lawyer, Bruce Rubin, declined to say whether he believed that there was any political motive behind the United States' threat to cancel his airline's landing rights in Miami or New York, and referred questions to Gustavo Lenis, the president of Avianca. He, too, declined to discuss the political climate.
Washington's decision in the matter was to take effect on July 15 but has been postponed. The air dispute began with an announcement by American Airlines that it intended to resume daily service between Bogota and New York, without holding the public hearings required under Colombian law.
After American Airlines' withdrawal from the run three years ago, Continental Airlines stepped in with nonstop service between Bogota and Newark in 1994.
American argued that under the terms of a treaty dating to 1956, it could resume the flights anytime it chose. Colombia argued that the "equal opportunity" mentioned in the 1956 agreement provides only for an equal number of carriers and flights between the countries.
Alvaro Cala, former director of civil aviation for Colombia and a former president of Avianca, noted that Colombian airlines relied on the routes to the United States for about 25 percent of their revenues, while for United States companies the figure was about 1 percent.
"If too much competition in these routes leads to a price war, that would damage Colombian airlines much more than American airlines," Mr. Cala said. "This competition would give the U.S. an advantage over Colombia, which contradicts the ideals of equal opportunity and reciprocity."
After Colombia's refusal, American Airlines filed a complaint with the United States Transportation Department in April, opening the way for imposition of sanctions on Colombia.
Colombia, in turn, has threatened to cancel the 1956 agreement, giving one year's notice of its intention to scrap the treaty. Robert Booth, a consultant to Latin American airlines, said an air war could result, similar to one that suspended direct flights between the United States and Peru for three years in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICANS;
Unease Over Dole Leads to Separate Campaigns

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Increasingly uneasy that Bob Dole could bring them down in November, many Republican Congressional candidates say they are beginning to run campaigns independent of the presumed Presidential nominee.
The biggest worry among these Republicans is that Mr. Dole will lag so far behind in the polls that many of their own supporters will not bother to vote. Party leaders are particularly concerned this year because there is more at stake, since Republicans hold both the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. 
 "Bob Dole's running his race," said Representative Jim Bunn, a freshman from Oregon. "I'm running mine."
By passing a flurry of legislation in the closing days before their vacation, Republicans in Congress this week underscored their intent to pursue distinct agendas. Most notable was the welfare measure that President Clinton vowed to sign, depriving Mr. Dole of an issue in the fall while allowing Republican lawmakers to boast of a major accomplishment.
Mr. Dole's inability to gain ground on Mr. Clinton, at least thus far, compounds fears of Republican candidates who already have to contend with the deep unpopularity of Speaker Newt Gingrich -- or, as Kevin Phillips, the Republican analyst, calls him, "Typhoid Newtie."
In Congressional district after district, Republican incumbents are finding that Mr. Dole is trailing their own popularity, in some cases by more than 20 points.
"We were already looking to be cloned into Newtoids," Representative Mark E. Souder, a Republican freshman from Indiana, said of Democratic efforts to link Republican members of Congress to the Speaker. "And now we've got Dole on top of that. One recourse is to go independent."
He added: "If Dole wins, we'll probably gain 30 seats, but we're not banking on that right now. If Dole loses by 10 or more, then the whole thing is up in the air because there's only so much an individual member can do to overcome what would be a national tide."
Spurning the Republican leadership, Mr. Souder's bumper stickers proclaim: "Independence, integrity and leadership."
These moves by candidates to separate themselves from the Presidential ticket reflect the continuing reversal of a longstanding pattern in Republican politics: For years, Congressional candidates turned to the standard bearer to help them win. That changed in 1992, when many Republican candidates snubbed President George Bush at public appearances as he slid behind Bill Clinton in the polls.
But when Ronald Reagan headed the ticket, the party's candidates went all out to link themselves to him. If Mr. Reagan was reluctant to campaign on their behalf, as he often was, candidates would display his photographs at their rallies.
This year, several contenders said they were coming up with their own advertisements rather than feature Mr. Dole in them, or adopt his campaign slogans. Recently, after months of running commercials that featured Mr. Dole, Republicans unveiled a new advertising campaign that promotes the records of vulnerable House members.
Representative David Funderburk of North Carolina, for one, said his campaign would run a biographical advertisement featuring not Mr. Dole but Mr. Reagan, who appointed Mr. Funderburk Ambassador to Romania, and Jesse Helms, the state's senior Senator.
While he raised concerns about Mr. Dole's conservative credentials, Mr. Funderburk offered something of a defense of the Kansan: "No matter what," he said, "it's still better to be aligned with Bob Dole than Bill Clinton in North Carolina."
But for now, House candidates are easily edging Mr. Dole out in the polls. If the election for the House were held today, 44 percent of registered voters nationwide say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district and 41 percent for the Republican contender -- a virtual tie -- according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted July 11 to 13. But in that same poll, Mr. Clinton led Mr. Dole, 54 percent to 34 percent. The margin of sampling error in the poll of 743 registered voters was plus or minus four percentage points.
Congressional Republicans are concerned not only about Mr. Dole's lagging poll numbers, but also by the fact that he has proposed few initiatives. "At least for now, the Presidential campaign is not driving the issues' agenda," said Ed Goeas, whose company is polling for 93 Republican House contenders. "Tax cuts, welfare reform, cutting Government, the overall role of Government -- all of these things are playing in the Congressional races."
In what is something of a "reverse coattails" strategy, many Republican Congressional candidates said they would do what they could to help Mr. Dole by turning out voters and sharing their telephone banks -- but not at the expense of their own electoral fortunes. "I'm willing to lose several points in order to help Bob Dole win," Mr. Souder said. "I'm not willing to lose over it, however."
The moves by Republicans for independent identities is quite a turnabout, given that in the 1994 campaign many Democratic lawmakers opted not to be seen with Mr. Clinton.
Republican lawmakers have not given up on Mr. Dole altogether -- and many still argue that he can turn things around -- especially after he chooses a running mate and the party stages its convention. In recent days, Republicans in Congress have endeavored to get Mr. Dole to improve his campaign even as they tried to establish their own identities.
Earlier this month, putting their interests ahead of Mr. Dole's, Congressional Republicans split the welfare legislation off from proposed changes in Medicaid. That was followed by an effort among Republican leaders in Congress to call for a program of broad tax cuts in a move partly intended to pressure Mr. Dole to take their lead in formulating his own economic plan.
"The recent effort to put together a Republican agenda on Capitol Hill was partly designed to influence Dole," said John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California and a former Republican Party official. "But it was also designed to establish a Republican identity that isn't defined by Dole."
Representative Bill Paxon of upstate New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said, "I do not see our people running away from Bob Dole." Yet he said he had long advised his candidates against relying on any nominee, explaining, "It's less important than it used to be who's at the head of the ticket."
But The Columbus Dispatch reported that Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the Budget Committee, told Ohio Republicans recently: "If the Presidential election is relatively close, I think we'll do fine. If he gets blown out, I think we'd be in trouble."
In another instance of Republicans worried about Mr. Dole hurting their own prospects, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, who is running for the Senate, said he did not have time to appear with Mr. Dole at a recent event in Boston. While he later changed his mind, his lack of enthusiasm seemed unmistakable, and Mr. Dole ended up sending his regrets -- and his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole -- in his place.
Virginia Buckingham, Mr. Weld's campaign manager, said that it was a scheduling problem. But, she added, "Bill Weld is running on his own two feet and his own merits."
Mr. Dole may not be too concerned about candidates running apart from him. After all, by quitting the Senate last month, Mr. Dole sought to distance himself from Congress in general and Mr. Gingrich in particular.
While Representative Bunn said "he would welcome him" if Mr. Dole wanted to campaign in Mr. Bunn's district, he had no plans to invite him. "I just think November looks pretty good for the House," Mr. Bunn said. "I wish it looked better for the White House."

HEADLINE: Some Look at the Welfare Plan With Hope, but Others Are Fearful

 BODY:
For generations, Americans accepted the idea that the Federal Government should have a leading role in easing the toll of poverty.
Now Congress has voted to overhaul the network of Federal welfare programs that have supported the poor since the New Deal. Even though opinions of the changes in welfare vary among Congressional Democrats [page 22], many of them support it, and President Clinton has pledged to sign the bill. 
 The measure abolishes the Federal guarantee of support for the poor, the program known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children, replacing it with lump-sum Federal grants that states may use as they wish to help the poor. The measure establishes a lifetime limit of five years for welfare payments to any family and requires most adults to work within two years of receiving aid.
Most of the measure's savings -- nearly $55 billion over six years -- come from restricting Food Stamp benefits and barring aid to immigrants, even those in the country legally.
The effects of the Congressional votes, and the President's decision, will resonate far beyond Washington. A grocery cashier serving poor customers in Los Angeles, a 17-year-old immigrant who got a leg up from welfare, a policy analyst who has spent her career immersed in the issue -- what follows are comments from those and others who have a stake in the changes to come.

Isabel Sawhill
Senior Fellow, Urban Institute
The argument is that the current welfare system has failed poor children. If that's the case -- and I believe it is -- then we ought to be coming up with something better.
But that's not what we're really doing. We're taking about $60 billion and withdrawing it from low-income families over the next six years, and we're not reinvesting that money in more effective anti-poverty programs. We're not using it to improve Head Start, expand the earned-income tax credit, improve inner-city schools.
It looks as if we're going to spend the money on either a middle-class tax cut or protecting middle-class entitlements from the budget ax.
This is not welfare reform. It's a redistribution of income from the poor to the rest of us.

Maria De la Rosa
A 39-year-old cashier at George's Meat Market in the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles. Most of her customers are welfare recipients. Many come from the Nickerson Gardens housing project nearby.
This welfare reform is going to affect us a lot. Ninety-nine percent of our clients are on welfare. We get a flood of customers around the first of the month, when the welfare checks have just come in. Most of our sales this morning were with food stamps. There will be a lot more crime, too. Without money, people are going to have to find some way to get food. Already, kids steal potato chips. Why? Because their family doesn't have any money.
We offer credit to our old-time customers. By the middle of the month, a lot of people's checks have run out, especially if they have three or four kids. They can't manage their money. If we go out of business, where else can these people go to get food? No one has a car.

Glenn C. Loury
Professor of Economics, Boston University
We're biting a bullet now and hoping that will induce changes in behavior in the future. I'm not convinced that it will. I don't see in the research the degree of behavioral response to incentives that will produce the kind of improvement the advocates of this bill say it will.
I worry that the advocates are trying to do something that can't really be done with income transfer policy: turn back the influence of modernity. With the influence of television, movies and other media, the changes we see today, like the increase in single-parent families, are as much in the nonwelfare population as in the welfare population.

Bishop Felton E. May
Central Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church
After visiting Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire, I spoke to a gathering of 2,000 women in nearby Mutare, Zimbabwe. As I described the refugee children I had seen sitting naked and violently ill in the mud and muck of the camps, my sermon was interrupted by the women coming forward and laying their coats -- the only ones they had -- in a tall pile at the front of the assembly for me to take to the refugee children.
After that, they wrapped themselves in sheets of plastic to protect themselves from the chill.
I refuse to believe that Americans care any less about our children -- including the 1.2 million children who would be tipped over the edge into poverty by the current proposed "welfare reform" legislation. If we, as individuals, would be willing to give a hungry child our last loaf of bread, as I believe we would, how can we collectively -- as a national Government -- turn our back on any child in poverty?
The most significant long-term reform would break down the segregation in housing between the affluent and the poor that keeps us from knowing one another as real people and not just myths.

Senator Phil Gramm
A Texas Republican, and former Presidential candidate who voted for the bill
The message of this legislation is honest and straightforward: If you are able-bodied and on welfare, we're going to find you training and we're going to help you find a job, but you will reach a point where you have to go to work.

Raul Yzaguirre
President, National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic service organization
This is the worst thing that has happened to Hispanics since President Polk declared war on Mexico.
It's always been a principle that you treat resident aliens the same way you treat everyone else.You expect them to serve in the armed forces, pay taxes and live up to other responsibilities. You don't say, You're not a citizen, you don't have to pay taxes.
Now, you have a requirement to pay in, but the government has no requirement to respond to you. I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's biased; it's bigotry; it's anti-immigrant fever run amok.

Rosemary L. Bray
Author of "Unafraid of the Dark," a forthcoming memoir of her childhood on welfare and the growth of her political consciousness. Ms. Bray is a former editor on The New York Times Book Review.
What would I do about welfare? I'd begin by remembering my own childhood on welfare, what made it workable (a national commitment to help poor children) and what made it difficult (the contempt of the more fortunate for those who have less).
I'd remind those who seem not to know better that poverty is not a genetic condition. . . .
As for practical, concrete efforts: I'd be sure to demand a minimum standard of care from each state, so that states' rights did not come to mean the right to deny food, housing or medical care to poor children and their parents.
Next, I would be sure to provide basic medical and dental care for every family in America, regardless of income. When poor women know their sick children will be cared for, they are more likely to take an otherwise unacceptable minimum-wage job.
Safe and reliable child care is crucial. . . .
Finally, I would coordinate efforts among law-enforcement and child-support agencies to track down and prosecute adult men who have chosen to have sex with teen-age girls.
These sexual liaisons account for more than 50 percent of all babies born to teen-age mothers, and a significant number of them are coercive in nature. If adult men knew that sex with a woman under 18 -- consensual or not -- would result in mandatory jail time, teen-age pregnancy rates would plummet.

Toby Herr
Founder and director of Project Match, a welfare-to-work program at the Cabrini-Green public-housing development in Chicago
In an ideal welfare system, every welfare recipient must do something every month to prepare for work. Those who refuse to cooperate will lose their grant until they do. However, this strict policy is fair only if the system provides activities and services to meet the needs of every type of welfare recipient. . . .
In a time-limited system, where every month counts, it is more important than ever that there are sensible and creative ways for people to gain the skills and experiences they need to climb the ladder to steady employment.

Representative Robert T. Matsui
A California Democrat who opposed the bill
It's fantasy to believe the states will be able to protect children in poverty. By abdicating responsibility for America's poor to the states, we force children to compete with services like fire and police protection. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where state and local government priorities will be. . . .
Nobody should be under any illusions that it will be easy to reinstate over $20 billion in benefits for legal immigrants. Plain and simple, the attack on legal immigrants was a budget-cutting move. To assert that we will somehow find the funds to restore these benefits is naive at best.

Hugh Price
President, National Urban League
The states cannot be counted upon to protect their most vulnerable citizens. Years ago, we ended mental health treatment as we knew it, and the states never established community-based mental health care. Fiscally strapped states left those programs in a lurch and removed the safety net.As a result, the mentally ill are out on the streets of the nation's cities. If you impose a time limit and there is a local labor market where there are not enough private jobs to go around, what are mothers and children going to do? They are going to resort to prostitution and panhandling.

Alex Kotlowitz
Author of "There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America"
Welfare did not cause poverty. Nor is it the reason for its persistence.
Put together a cohesive agenda to rebuild these inner-city communities. (After all, that's really where this current welfare legislation is aimed.)
Strengthen the schools. Build decent housing. Offer drug treatment. Provide job training centers. Create a modest public works program, putting people to work repairing infrastructure in their communities. . . .
In short, furnish opportunity. Then let's talk about reconfiguring welfare, which might include extending Medicaid coverage for those whose employers don't provide health insurance, continuing a rent or food subsidy through the first few months of a new job and giving vouchers for child care. Sadly enough, there will be some who, because of depression or drugs or just plain irresponsibility, will remain out of the mainstream. But at least they will have had real choices.

Douglas J. Besharov
Resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization
After you get done with all the rhetoric -- from both sides -- this bill hardly forces states to do anything. States that want to "end welfare as we know it" now have the tools to do so, but states that want to continue the status quo can do that, too. Real welfare reform is now up to the states.

Peter Eisinger
Professor of political science and public policy at the University of Wisconsin
My specific concern is the draconian cuts in regard to those who depend on food stamps. There will be enormous hardships across the board for all food stamp recipients, and my guess is that 20 percent will be cut in food stamps and that is typically inadequate for supplementing a family. We don't know if hunger is increasing in this country, but the demand in food pantries is enormous and increasing, and independent pantry contributions are decreasing, so the private sector won't be taking up the slack. Generally, the principle to put people to work is a good one, but as we discovered in Wisconsin, you have to spend more, not less, to achieve this end. And of course, that's not going to happen.

Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr.
 A Florida Republican and one of the principal authors of the bill
It definitely helps the poor; that is the way it should be. It helps to build their self-esteem and puts them to work. The measure replaces a welfare system with a work program. It will be a revolutionary way we attack poverty. . . . We have a responsibility to see that everyone is given the opportunity and is able to accept a job. It is the obligation of government to allow everyone the opportunity to share in the American dream. We are helping them more than halfway to that goal.

Sieglinda Meyer
A 28-year-old nurse from Spout Springs, N.C.
I don't have any problem with people who need help. Things happen. But I have a problem with helping perpetuate the cycle.
When I was a single mother, I worked two jobs in order to support my kids. Some women are having baby after baby, and they're telling the state, "Take care of it." If I can't afford to have a baby, I don't have one. Others can be just as responsible. You can get birth control for free.

Jack Connelly
Executive Director, Jobs For Youth, a program in Chicago that helps welfare recipients find jobs
I would keep the central goal of encouraging people on welfare to become self-sufficient. This simple idea is vital and long overdue.
There are many things I would change, but I would dump the idea of passing the job on to the states without providing them with any direction on how to get it done. As it stands, we have a goal without a game plan. At the same time, we actually know a lot about how to move people from welfare to work. And we should use this knowledge to shape the law. I am astonished that such sweeping legislation could develop, and be passed into law, without looking at successful models. . . .
Also, I would add a "Plan B" that tells us what to do when there's a downturn in the economy, and the job market dries up. That has happened before, and only someone out of touch with reality would believe that this won't happen again.

Senator Christopher S. Bond
A Missouri Republican who voted for the bill
There can be no doubt that the current system is a failure. That should be the one thing that is agreed upon by Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives and anyone else who is concerned about their fellow man today. It is cruel to adults who are treated like numbers when they need public assistance. It is even crueler to the children because it encourages a lifetime of dependency and they are raised in an atmosphere without hope. The current system discourages work, but it encourages illegitimacy. . . .
In Sedalia, a private employer was trying to hire workers at a $6.50-per-hour wage to process food. The employer worked with the local Family Services Division office and had some welfare recipients come out and get jobs. That was a win-win for those folks who got jobs and for all of us in Missouri as taxpayers. Some of the recipients were interviewed and then hired. . . .
However, A few folks did not get a job because they failed a mandatory drug test. . . . As a result of the Federal requirements, they were sent back to get their food stamps without having to take a job. . . . The people of Missouri are fed up with it.

Mayor Edward G. Rendell
A Democrat of Philadelphia
The better solution is the one I urged the President to do: not sign until $12 billion is put in that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said was necessary to properly fund job creation. He should have held his ground and insisted upon the most human of all parts of it, vouchers to go directly for the needs of children of parents no longer on A.F.D.C. -- for medicine, diapers, things like that. We're all in favor of ending welfare as we know it, but with real job creation.
This was a budget- balancing act, not transition from welfare to work. . . .
To me, opportunity means every American who wants to work has a job. The Federal Government has fallen woefully short. It has an obligation to create opportunity, notwithstanding the 10 million jobs that have been created, but generally those jobs do not exist where the highest concentration of welfare recipients live.
Up until recently, the central idea driving welfare reform was the economists' idea that we need to increase work incentives. Labor economists dominated the debate. This changed in the 1990's. The focus now is on changing behavior -- work, school and family-forming behavior.
 
Richard Casuso
 A 31-year-old records manager for a law firm. He lives in Brooklyn's Bushwick area, which has many poor residents.
My parents always pushed me on to go on to school and do the best I could so I could land a good job. As I did so, a couple of people I knew from the neighborhood, they were career welfare people -- their grandparents were on welfare, their parents were on welfare. . . . It's so funny because I remember a guy who grew up with us -- we used to play sports together. When I would go to work in the morning, he was going to the park with his basketball. . . .
There are people who do need it, and I really hope to God that there is a way they can prove that they need it, and the government is willing to work with them. I think this an excellent way to weed out the hypocrites, the liars, the people taking us for a joy ride. . . . I hate to hear Democrats saying we're going to hurt the poor. That's not necessarily true. What I think we're going to do is start breathing new life into them.

Loula Tesfai
Ms. Tesfai, 17, emigrated from Eritrea, in northern Africa, five years ago and lived on welfare with her family in Oakland, Calif. She now attends Eagle Rock School, a boarding school in Estes Park, Colo., for teen-agers who have not thrived in conventional school settings. She spoke about teen-agers she knew who had received benefits from the main welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
If I had to reform the A.F.D.C. for teen parents, the first requirement would be that they attend school. The teachers would have a record of their behavior, their attendance and their grades. The reason for this is that a lot of teen parents do not go to class; they can easily write a note explaining why they were absent, and there are no consequences. However, if you check on their academic progress, desire to learn, participation and effort, which might not be reflected in grades, you can determine if the person is willing to change. . . .
I would reform welfare by having the state identify areas in which many people depend on Federal aid; creating schools, which would teach them to speak English and communicate effectively; providing job training and sending them to places that need employees.
Even if the government set up these schools, people might not go to them. The social worker would give structure and firm expectations to the person who is on welfare. The social worker would give the welfare recipient a list of local training schools and a deadline for registration, and would call the school to check up on the process.
If the parent was not attending, the child would get coupons, and there would be no welfare money received. After finishing his or her training, the person would have to get a job, and if the job paid low wages, the government would supplement the income. If the person wanted a better job, he or she could go to job training once a week.
The reason I believe that education is crucial is that people who have never had self-esteem will develop confidence in school to provide for themselves and their children. Let's not forget that everyone has a dream to succeed in life and make something out of him- or herself. You just need to help him or her with the first step.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
DOLE SEEKS A LIFT AS CAMPAIGN TILTS TO THE CONVENTION

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
In what his advisers say amounts to a third start-up of his Presidential campaign, Bob Dole is heading into an event-packed 11 days in which he plans to unveil a centerpiece economic proposal, select a running mate and deliver his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in San Diego.
The flurry of events will be the most crucial period so far in Mr. Dole's campaign, one that his aides hope will help him overcome President Clinton's months-long double-digit lead in public opinion polls. 
 "The acceptance speech is important," Mr. Dole said in a recent interview. "The running mate is important. The whole atmosphere of the convention -- how we're perceived compared to '92. It's going to be very important to my campaign. That's why we're working so hard to get a good one."
With all the deadlines fast closing in, Mr. Dole met today with advisers to work on an economic plan, which he is scheduled to announce Monday in Chicago. After a day of intense negotiations and lobbying by rival Republican factions, Mr. Dole was said this evening to be leaning toward endorsing an across-the-board reduction of up to 15 percent in income-tax rates.
If Mr. Dole moves ahead with that decision, he would be following the advisers who believe that a clean, steep tax cut would best frame his economic case against President Clinton. Mr. Dole has been moving back and forth on this, but the aides said late today that he seemed inclined to accept the tax cut proposal rather than a more complicated plan to roll back Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase.
Mr. Dole stopped short of revealing any details when he previewed the plan in his weekly radio address today. But he said the proposals would put the country on a path to a balanced budget by the year 2002, would create a "flatter, fairer, simpler tax system and will begin to change the size and power" of the Internal Revenue Service.
Anticipating criticism, Mr. Dole said the Democrats would say it would be impossible to cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time -- and that Mr. Dole's program is a tax break for the rich.
"The fact is," he said, "that last year Republicans in Congress passed a plan that would have cut taxes and put us on a path to a balanced budget, but President Clinton vetoed it."
Mr. Dole's advisers said the coming days would represent what was essentially the third start of his campaign: the first was last year during his weeklong announcement tour, then his resignation from the Senate on June 11 and his post as majority leader. But those actions did not give Mr. Dole the lasting surge his aides had hoped for.
After the economic plan, the next big splash will be the announcement of his running mate, which Mr. Dole has long said he considers his campaign's most important decision. Aides said he had probably narrowed his list to three or four. Nearly a dozen have been notified, his aides said, though many of the contacts were what one called "courtesy inquiries."
The selection of a Vice-Presidential candidate could reveal a great deal about Mr. Dole's judgment. While the short list seems to be ever shifting, Mr. Dole's advisers recently gave a great deal of attention to Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina and Senator Connie Mack of Florida. The current plan is for Mr. Dole to announce his choice next Saturday in his hometown, Russell, Kan., before heading to San Diego for the convention.
Mr. Dole, whose organization is virtually broke from spending during the primaries, said his campaign was eagerly awaiting the Federal money, close to $70 million, it will receive after he becomes the official Republican nominee. Mr. Clinton's campaign, flush with cash because he had no challenger in the primaries, has been running commercials since last year.
"It's the time we get some money, finally, so we can get our message out there instead of playing defense," Mr. Dole said in the interview.
The challenge facing Mr. Dole is not easy. Expectations are so high -- and Mr. Dole is perceived as so far behind -- that he needs to seize the opportunity to capture the nation's attention in a positive way.
From Michigan to California and Pennsylvania to Texas, polls in states where Mr. Dole traveled recently show that his support dwindled even further after his visits -- even though the White House has been mired in controversies, like the Whitewater investigation.
In a poll released on Friday by the independent firm of Epic/MRA, Mr. Clinton leads Mr. Dole 58 percent to 35 percent in the battleground state of Michigan. It was the President's best showing in the state all year, although Mr. Dole has recently taken numerous trips to Michigan.
But John Buckley, Mr. Dole's communications director, offered this preview: "The American people in the course of the next two weeks are going to learn an awful lot about someone whose presence they felt and whose face they're familiar with, but who has yet to be fully introduced to them. So many elements that will be important throughout the fall will begin to be snapped into place."
Lyn Nofziger, who was an aide to Ronald Reagan, and informally advises Mr. Dole, said that "Dole's got to do something that creates a little excitement in the party right now because the thing that's killing Dole now is that there ain't none."
Indeed, a nationwide poll made public this week by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonprofit group, found that 7 of 10 Americans think that the Presidential campaign is dull so far -- and just about the same number expect that Mr. Clinton will defeat Mr. Dole in November. The survey found that enthusiasm for this election is noticeably lower than four years ago.
In laying new markers for his campaign, Mr. Dole will be competing for the limelight with the Democrats, factions within his own party and with Ross Perot, whose Reform Party will stage gatherings just before and just after the Republican convention, which begins on Aug. 12.
Republicans are counting on the upcoming events to add spice to the Presidential race in general and to Mr. Dole in particular. His aides reel off statistics to make the case that it can be done -- that others, like George Bush in 1988, have entered their nominating convention woefully behind in the polls, only to emerge victorious in the election.
Jack F. Kemp, the former Congressman and onetime quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, described the challenge for Mr. Dole: "It's the end of the second quarter. The convention is halftime. By the time the second half starts, we may be behind. But it's certainly winnable, and the Democratic Party is playing not to lose. The party that plays not to lose ends up many times losing."
But Harold M. Ickes, the deputy White House chief of staff who is overseeing the President's political operation, said Mr. Dole had precious little time to polish his image.
"Time is literally running out," Mr. Ickes said. "But I don't discount that there's still time for him to gain his footing. He is more than a respectable candidate. He is a man of considerable accomplishment."
As Mr. Dole prepares to announce his economic plan on Monday, it was unclear what value the Dole campaign would put on the plan or what proposals it would make to pay for it.
One proposal that Mr. Dole's aides said tonight he had all but discarded would reduce the number of tax brackets to three, from five; make Social Security taxes deductible; allow nonworking spouses to put more money into Individual Retirement Accounts; establish charity tax credits; reduce the capital gains tax, and make a variety of other changes. The plan might call for permanent elimination of the 4.3 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax that was enacted in 1993.
Another option that Mr. Dole had originally favored called for a repeal of the 1990 tax increase as well as the 1993 increase. But he was leaning against including the 1990 increase, in part because he voted for it, said the people close to the discussions.
One person involved in the debate said several of Mr. Dole's former colleagues from the Senate had lobbied hard for the 15 percent across-the-board reduction, arguing that it would be easier to sell to voters. But several other in Mr. Dole's top campaign staff had favored the repeal option, the person said.
The biggest splash for Mr. Dole could come at the convention. Yet there is no guarantee that he will get free, and favorable, coverage there. Democrats are weighing whether to step up the television advertising barrage during the Republican convention.
Closer to home, Mr. Dole will also have to try to keep the spotlight away from ideological splits within the party, which will be highlighted when the Republican Platform Committee begins meeting in San Diego on Monday morning to write a platform for Mr. Dole and other Republican candidates to run on.
Republican rules make it unlikely that there will be a platform fight at the convention, so the bloodletting over issues like abortion, gun control and taxes are expected to occur within the Platform Committee.
No one doubts that the most conservative elements of the party will prevail. Republican convention delegates this year are, as a body, much more conservative than the party's rank and file, and the platform committee's members might be even more conservative.
The abortion plank calls for a constitutional amendment that would make abortions illegal in all circumstances, a position that Mr. Dole himself does not embrace. Mr. Dole favors legal abortions when the mother's life is in danger or when pregnancy was caused by rape or incest.
In the meantime, Patrick J. Buchanan, who has yet to take himself out of the race for the nomination, has said he will show up in San Diego to push his own preferred planks on taxes and trade.
He has also vowed to fight Mr. Dole's efforts to soften the party's platform language on abortion. "It's a matter of life and death," Mr. Buchanan said at a press briefing this week.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plays Appeaser on Outlaw Regimes, Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Reading John R. Bolton's July 28 Op-Ed article on Europe's conciliatory policies toward nations like Cuba, Iran and Libya, I was reminded of the old phrase about glass houses and stones. While I agree with his identification of a vacuum on the part of the United States in dealing with such countries, it is one of credibility rather than of leadership. 
And our nation is just as practiced at following policies of appeasement as the Europeans. Even as we pass measures to penalize foreign companies trading with "outlaw" nations, we continue to renew preferred trade status for China despite its sales of missile technology and nuclear reactors to aggressive regimes.
The justification for renewal? That trading status encourages China to behave as a responsible member of the world community, an argument the Europeans merely echo in explaining their economic ties to Cuba and Libya.
And we are hardly in a position to criticize the Europeans' high-technology trade with Iran considering the Reagan Administration's sale of weapons to the Khomeini regime. Given such practices, how can we ask Europe to adopt policies our own Government refuses to follow?
Perhaps Mr. Bolton and his friends should worry less about the conduct of our allies and more about our own country's.

Shortsighted Boycotts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal's "Certain Treason" (column, July 26) demonstrates the ideology that perpetuates war: when a nation is ruled by someone whose policies we detest, we should cut off all contact with that nation and wage economic war. 
 The ruler whom we detest does not suffer from this: he continues to live whatever life style he deems appropriate. It is the ordinary people who live under his misrule who suffer. What are they supposed to do? In a democracy, they could vote the ruler out. But Cuba or Iraq, for example, do not provide their citizens with any such opportunty.
Punishing a nation's people accomplishes no objective other than to make us feel good. The evidence shows that the best way to put an end to a dictatorship is to give its people access to the free world, so that they can see what it is like.
Just as the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, through his contacts with the West, learned what the price of dictatorship was, so I want Fidel Castro's successor in Cuba to be someone who has experienced the democracy of the United States, for example, or of Costa Rica or Spain.
Similarly, South Africa changed not because it had been isolated but because even though it was something of a pariah state, it had not been isolated at all. We need to find ways to express our distaste for rulers while doing everything possible to open their country to the ideal of freedom.

HEADLINE: BLACKBOARD;
Grant Opens Doors for Native Americans

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
At Wolf Creek Elementary School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, 98 percent of the 540 students are Indian. But only a handful of the instructors are fluent speakers of Lakota, the language of the Indians who live there.
"Our people need to teach our own children," said Marjorie Pumpkinseed, an Oglala Lakota tribal member who works as an aide at the school and hopes to soon win certification as a full-fledged teacher. "I know all the kids," she said. "They respect me." 
 A recent $200,000 grant by the Philip Morris Companies to the American Indian College Fund is helping Ms. Pumpkinseed and other Indians who aspire to be teachers in the 29 Indian colleges and universities, most situated on reservations. The schools serve 20,000 students representing more than 210 tribes, but even in these schools only about a third of the faculty members are Indians.
The thought is that Indian youth best respond to teachers knowledgeable about their own experience and language. But of the 105,000 new teachers certified for all levels of education in 1991, only one percent were American Indian, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which said 1991 was the last year such a survey was done.
Of that one percent, said David Cournoyer, a spokesman for the Indian College Fund, some never actually teach and many go to schools that are not on reservations.
Why is it important that Indians teach Indians?
"On a broad level it is understanding," said Mr. Cournoyer. "Other Indians are familiar with the students' backgrounds, as well as their social and economic problems."
He cited the importance of role models and the relative ease with which Indians -- as opposed to whites -- can deal with disciplinary problems.
The money will be used differently in different places, but 170 potential teachers will be helped.
At Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, the goal is to increase the number of Indian teachers, who now account for only 9 percent of the faculty.
At Sitting Bull Reservation in Fort Yates, N.D., a new degree program in teaching special education will be launched.
At Leech Lake Tribal College in Minnesota, existing ties with the faculty of Bemidji State College will be strengthened.
Though numerous other companies and foundations have supported Indian education, Mr. Cournoyer said Philip Morris is the sole supporter of the teacher education initiative.
In a way, the company's long support of Indian education is appropriate, he said.
"Tobacco is part of the sacred tradition of numerous tribes," he noted.

HEADLINE: African-Americans Turning To Christian Academies

BYLINE: By DAVID J. DENT; David J. Dent, an assistant professor of journalism at New York University, is finishing a book on the black middle class.

 BODY:
Thelma Anderson treasures her experiences in segregated, all black schools in Jackson, Miss., in the 1960's, an era before debates began over school prayer in Mississippi.
 "I learned Psalm 100 in elementary school," said Mrs. Anderson, who lives in Jackson today. "We always prayed and it was a public school." 
 Mrs. Anderson says she became aware of the vast changes in public schools when her daughter Andrea entered a predominantly black elementary school. "I was disappointed," she said. "I wanted her to have the experience that I grew up with."
 So last fall, Mrs. Anderson found a school to give Andrea that experience: Mt. Salus Academy in Clinton, a small Mississippi town outside of Jackson. The school was private, Christian and predominantly white. In fact, when it opened in 1969, the school was cloed to blacks.
 "The school is very compatible with my background and what I believe today," Mrs. Anderson said. "Isn't it ironic that the very thing I was looking for I found it there?"
 She is not alone. Increasingly around the country, black parents are finding what they're looking for in the private Christian academies that were opened in the 1950's, 60's and 70's by whites, many trying to avoid integration. Now, with declining enrollment and a shrinking economic base, many of these schools have either been taken over by other organizations that have abolished restrictions or have been forced to take in any student who can pay the fees. Some are even recruiting black students, exhibiting a new attitude toward race.
 Educators say black parents are being drawn to these schools for many reasons: dissatisfaction with public schools, lower tuition of Christian private schools compared with other independent schools and conservative social values.
 "There are a lot of things that go on in these schools that do resonate with many African-American parents and African-American tradition," said Jacqueline Jordan Irvine, a professor of urban education at Emory University. "There is the sense of order and discipline. Segregated black schools were highly disciplined, highly structured schools and a lot of older black teachers were teaching religion and values."
 Across the country, many schools, from Old National Christian Academy outside Atlanta to the Inglewood Christian school in a Los Angeles suburb, have gone from all white in the early 1970's to nearly all black today. Many others, like Mt. Salus, have a growing black population. At Mt. Salus, the number of black students has doubled over the past three years, reaching 10 percent of the 210 students this coming year.
 The transitions haven't been smooth at all schools. Some schools struggle with introducing multicultural curriculums in conservative school structures and with charges of racism. "There's a change going on but you still have some residue of the past," said Dr. Charles Ware, president of Baptist Bible College of Indianapolis and formerly the first black headmaster at a Christian school outside of Washington.
 "What we're beginning to see on the far right is the breakdown of racial stereotypes and racism," said Jack Layman, a professor of Bible, history and education at Columbia International University in Columbia, S.C. "It is slow because that is a fortress area. But it is reflected in many of these schools. There's also great diversity among Christian schools today. They go from one end of the spectrum to the other."
 While some Christian academies certainly maintain barriers against integration, the diveristy in Christian schools is growing, alongside another trend: the rising numbers of black church schools. More than 300 black churches and organizations across the country have started schools in the last 10 years, according to Professor Layman, and James Carper, a professor of education at the University of South Carolina, authors of a forthcoming study on the trend.
 Black private school enrollment is now growing at a faster rate than that of the overall private school enrollment and that of white private school enrollment. The overwhelmingly largest share of the growth is in the Christian school population, according to the National Center of Education Statistics. The number of African-Americans attending conservative Christian schools nearly doubled from 1991 to 1994, rising from 36,710 (7 percent of the total population of students at those schools) to 71,399 (12 percent) according to the center.
 Originally, the very idea of sending Andrea Anderson to a private school of any kind was almost blasphemous to Thelma Anderson and her husband, Melvin. The term "private school" wasn't common in their vocabulary, Mrs. Anderson says. The couple, who run a community service organization, generally referred to private schools as "council schools," a term for institutions created by the White Citizens Council in Mississippi in the wake of the Brown V. Board of Education decision in 1954.
 As a student in the 1960's, Mrs. Anderson says, she wanted to stay distant from the city's struggle with desegregation and remain in her all-black high school. But, in her sophormore year in 1969, the courts ordered the school system to accelerate its steps to total desegregation. Before Christmas, Jackson students received busing assignments. They were reassigned to schools in the middle of the school year. Mrs. Anderson turned in an incorrect address so she could remain at her neighborhood high school. In January, the school remained nearly all black because most white students assigned to the school either fled to private schools or,like Mrs. Anderson, gave incorrect addresses.
 Mt. Salus was founded the same year as a wave of private schools opened. These schools were not directly tied to the White Citizens council, but most, like Mt. Salus, were closed to African-Americans.
 Since then, many private schools that excluded blacks gradually opened their doors to African-Americans. At Mt. Salus, the change came with new leadership. Phyllis Hurley became administrator of Mt. Salus in 1985 with the mission to resurrect the school. Enrollment had dropped from 200 1980 to 45 in 1985. Under Mrs. Hurley's leadership, the numbers ran in the other direction. So did the school's attitude toward diversity.
 "We felt that our children were missing the experience of being with other races and cultures," Mrs. Hurley said.
 In 1990, the first black student, Antonio Downing, applied for admission. "I hope this doesn't seem like a battering-ram effect, but we thought maybe this will open the doors a little bit so that other African-American families would feel safe and bring their children here because we want the total experience for our children," Mrs. Hurley said.
 Six years later, Antonio, now an eighth grader, describes the school as open, friendly and free of racial tension. He says the only time he has seen anything close to racial dissension at the school was in the wake of the O.J. Simpson verdict.
 "That's the only time we had problems." he said. The black students there, he said, "disagreed with everyone else."
 Antonio says that the school has greatly influenced his views on social issues. He's opposed to abortion, upset with President Clinton's views on gay issues and says that he prays that God will help him refrain from premarital sex. He says the school mirrors what he learns at the Pentecostal church his family attends.
 Some educators argue that the popularity of Christian schools among some African-Americans could be a sign that race is a diminishing factor in the alignments of the cultural wars.
 "Instead of race or ethnicity being the basic division, the divisions are between orthodoxy and progressivism," said Daniel Duke, a professor of education at the University of Virginia. "So, in terms of the fundamentalist Christian movement, it's no surprise that orthodox whites and orthodox blacks are attracted to the same kinds of schools."
 But other experts hesitate to decipher a broad message from the growing enrollment. Charles Willie, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, says black parents turn to Christian schools because they've been failed by public schools. "Therefore, any alternative seems better than what they have," he said.
 The process of assimilation has not always been easy in the formerly white schools. Alma White, a homemaker whose daughter, Natalie, was enrolled in the Indiana Christian Academy in Anderson, Ind., says Natalie encountered problems in the seventh grade when she raised the question of interracial marriage in Bible class.
 Natalie says that when she arrived in class the next day, there were three teachers and a minister to address the issue. "They let the pastor take over, thinking he would have something better to say when actually he kept restating the question and never really said whether or not it was not O.K.," she said. "They wanted us to be happy-go-lucky little Christian-school-uniformed girls. So they got a little angry when I started to ask questions like that."
 William Newton, principal of the school, said that he would not discuss the details of Natalie's experiences at the school. "She was an exception to what we normally have as far as the type of satisfaction among our minorities, she was definitely in the minority there," he said.
 Natalie left the school after the eighth grade and is now a sophomore at a public school. Alma White says she does not regret sending her daughter to the school. "They were very disciplined and I like that," she said. "They like academic excellence. It was just the silly stuff that was the problem."
 "Yeah, the racism," Natalie said.
 "But then, that's anywhere you go," said Alma White.
 Alvin Thornton, a professor of political science at Howard University and a member of the Prince George's County School Board in Maryland, says racism or even just its heritage at Christian schools doesn't matter to many black parents because they perceive racial tension to be inevitable in integrated settings.
 "Parents are just looking at these schools as a place to get an education," Professor Thornton said. "Many of them would have no knowledge of the history in terms of the school being built to keep white children from black children. They have no interest in that. The only thing they want to know is: 'I pay you my tuition, can my child read and write? Is my child in what I perceive to be a safe environment where he or she has a smaller teacher-student ratio, with some Christian education?' They don't think of it in historical terms."
 Even some Christian school administrators admit that parents are less than pleased with many aspects of their shcools. "I've heard a parent say, 'They don't have multicultural education like we'd like, they don't have all black teachers but take what they have and get the rest somewhere else."' said Wayne Baker, prinicpal of Capitol Christian Academy in Prince George's County. "They know it's a good education."
 But many education experts question whether the education is so good at Capitol Christian and other Christian Schools. "You wouldn't look to a Christian school to find exemplary teaching or anthing out of the ordinary," says Professor Duke.
 Mr. Baker counters that 60 percent of Capitol graduates go to four-year colleges and nearly all of the others go to junior colleges. Some administrators complain that their schools cannot be lumped together and judged as a monolith. Two Christian school organizations have annually released reports of average test score results compiled for the associations by the Stanford Achievement Tests, a standardized national examination administered by some schools. Last year's scores show students at all grade levels at least one year and eight months above national norms.
 The changing population of many Christian schools also reflects demographic shifts in communities. "From the schools' perspectives, it might also be an economic issue," Professor Irvine said. Capitol Christian, a formerly all-white, fundamentalist Prince George's county school, would have trouble surviving as an all-white school today since whites have fled the school's community, which is now predominantly African-American. The school is now 85 percent black.
 The trend is an extension of the growing number of African-Americans who began turning to inner city Catholic schools a generation ago, Professor Irvine said. But Dr. Ware of Baptist Bible College said many families may find stronger bonds with non-Catholic Christian schools. "More African-Americans have either a Methodist or a Baptist heritage in this country and many Christian schools will come out of that framework also," he said.
Barbara Patterson, executive director of the Black Student Fund in Washington, says the growing enrollment in some communities merely stems from the absence of other alternatives to public schools. The fund receives 4,000 calls a year from black parents interested in private schools. Ms. Patterson, whose office helps place black students in independent schools in Washington, says most black middle- and upper middle-class families inquire about prestigious independent schools and some request information about Catholic and private black schools.
"We get very few people in Washington looking for religious education," she said. But there is a dearth of secular schools in neighboring Prince George's County, where most of the private schools are religious and formerly white-flight academies, she said. "Some parents have to choose between those schools or driving their children into Washington or another county every day," Ms. Patterson said. "If I had some money, I'd build a good independent school right out there because there is just not anything around for people to take advantage of."
Many white Christian school teachers and administrators admit they are at a loss when it comes to the issue of multicultural curriculums. Some question the need for a Christian school to even explore some influential figures in American history because of religion. At Capitol Christian Academy, Malcolm X is not part of the curriculum largely because "of his anti-Christian views," Mr. Baker said.
Dr. Ware, who leads workshops for Christian schools on multicultural issues, says many teachers are products of fundamentalist colleges and are unfamiliar with African-American culture and history.
In College Park, Ga., Old National Christian Academy created its own methods of broadening the curriculum and recruiting teachers. The school, which has gone from all-white in 1973 to 99.5 percent black today, routinely goes to the black churches that students attend to find teachers and even relies on those churches for resources to expand the traditional Christian school curriculum. Seventy percent of the school's teachers are African-American. The school also solicits parents to bring in books by African-Americans to supplement the curriculum.
"It's not that we've arrived, by any means," says the principal, David Barber, who is white. "I'm sure there are still problems, but we're still making a lot of headway."

HEADLINE: Taking Education Beyond the Classroom

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT; Michel Marriott is a reporter in the Style department of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Like practically everyone who had ever driven through the Russell neighborhood near downtown Louisville, Ky., John I. Gilderbloom, an associate professor of economics and urban policy at the University of Louisville, was struck by the community's decay: trash-strewn lots, abandoned houses and drug haunts popping up behind boarded-up windows. It was a familiar portrait of inner-city American poverty, unemployment, crime and despair.
 But in the early 1990's, Dr. Gilderbloom, 43, saw something else in the neighborhood: an opportunity. He could turn the considerable resources of an urban research university to the problems of the Russell neighborhood while giving some of his students a chance to test textbook theories in practice. And just as important, he said, the challenge could help build their characters and better prepare them to face formidable realworld problems. 
 Under his leadership, the Housing and Neighborhood Development Strategies program began in 1993 with the intention of improving the quality of life for Russell residents. The program, back by Federal and local government and civic groups, placed Dr. Gilderbloom and his students in the middle of a struggle to redevelop the troubled community.
"It has been a tremendous experience for them," Dr. Gilderbloom said of his cadre of 50 graduate and undergraduate students whose work over the years in the neighborhood has helped bring it hundreds of new homes, new jobs and new hope. As a result, the professor added: "I think they'll be better citizens. I think they'll function much better in the real world."
 And his students agree. "It's been real, real, real," said Latondra Jones, a 25-year-old native of Louisville who is completing her master's degree in public administration. "It's made me more well-rounded. I see myself growing."
 In recent years, as the demands and definitions of success have grown more complex, American college educators have been rethinking their mission to students. No longer is it enough, many of them say, simply to equip graduates with the academic skills necessary to excel in their chosen careers.
 "People want to hire people who have integrity, are team players, who are socially responsible, because they have gotten into a lot of trouble with people who weren't," said Daniel L. Ritchie, Chancellor of the University of Denver and the former chief executive of Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable Inc. "We don't want to graduate barracudas."
 As the class of 2000 prepares to enter college this fall, there is a great deal of discussion in higher education about how the whole student must be educated. Educators like the late Ernest L. Boyer, who was president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, have raised the issue and the stakes for colleges. In his article "Creating the New American College," published two years ago in the Journal of Higher Education, he argued that higher education must pay much more attention in preparing students to be responsible citizens, and not strictly scholars and professionals.
 Portland State University, a public research university in Oregon with 15,000 students, reworked its undergraduate curriculum in 1993 so that today it "promotes social responsibility, respect for diversity and a commitment to lifelong learning," said a university spokeswoman.
 Lloyd Jacobson, the national programs director of Campus Outreach Opportunity League, which promotes the expansion of college-based community service projects, said he has noticed a sea change in how colleges are encouraging students to learn through real-world experiences.
 "It is as different as night and day," Mr. Jacobson said. "I think that people still hold up the 60's as the litmus test, but I think the difference between the 80's and the 90's, in the numbers of campuses that have esstablished these kinds of programs, is tremendous."
 That idea is increasingly finding expressions in scores of revamped freshmen orientation programs with emphasis placed on guidance, student seminars about character and values, renewed interests in off-campus volunteerism and the new popularity of college speakers who preach an old-fashioned sermon on the virtues of compassion, community service and the value of giving with no expectation of reward.
 Shannon Swanson, a Japanese language major at Indiana University in Bloomington, said she was required to take diversity training in preparation for being resident assistant in her dormitory. Ms. Swanson, who grew up in Valparaiso, Ind., said she learned a lot more than she had expected.
 "I was surprised that people on my floor had never talked to a gay person before," the 19-year-old junior recalled. "A lot of white kids on my floor had never talked to a black person before."
 A random roommate selection policy assigned her to an openly bisexual woman. "She thinks differently than I do about some things," said Ms. Swanson, who is not bisexual. "But 95 percent of the things we do are the same."
 With ambitions of becoming an international businesswoman, Ms. Swanson said learning to be comfortable with all kinds of people on campus will be as important an asset as her financial acumen.
 At West Virginia University in Morgantown the administration is experimenting this fall with placing some of its senior faculty housing literally outside the front doors of freshmen dormitories. The university's president, David C. Hardesty Jrs., calls the plan his "highest priority."
 Mr. Hardesty, a Rhodes scholar, said that while attending Oxford University he was impressed with its tradition of having faculty and students dine together and work closely in organized tutoring sessions. "This is not Oxford," he said, "but that experience, I think, got me started thinking about how we could improve."
 His aim, he said, is to give first-year students an experienced hand away from the lecture hall, where a lot of the real learning occurs.
 Bernie and Cookie Schultz will be two of those hands.
 Dr. Schultz, a professor of art history and associate dean of academic affairs in the college of creative arts, said he is looking forward to living and working closely with up to 455 freshmen who may be assigned to him.
 "Our job is to bridge that gap between the acadmeic experience and the student-living experience," He said. "Cookie and I are going to spend a lot of time with these students in the residence halls.
 By the fall of 1997 a complex of town-house-like faculty housing should be completed near the freshmen dormitories to extend the program, university officials said.
 In the meantime, Dr. Schultz said he and his wife, an art history and humanities instructor, plan to have an open-door policy.
 "Cookie is planning a number of afternoon teas," Dr. Schultz said.
 Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., is considering permitting students to operate an on-campus pub, complete with alcoholic beverages and built-in lessons on responsible drinking.
 John Smeaton, vice provost for student affairs, explained that the pub is part of a larger program intended to "enhance the overall learning experience in and outside the classroom." Students, he said,learn many important lessons outside the classroom. "We want to take advantage of that, in the residential setting and the social setting," he said, referring to the proposed pub.
 Perhaps the most holistic approach in higher education these days directly links course work to community service, like Dr. Gilderbloom's urban redevelopment program in Louisville. These courses, usually organized under the rubric of service learning, can be found at campuses of the smallest community colleges and the largest and most elite universities.
 Service-learning courses generally regard students as a kind of worker-scholar. They are placed in environments in which their experiences are likely to augment their classroom work, and where they can actually do some good for others, educators say. Those environments include inner-city soup kitchens, homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. Some students at the University of Denver have even worked over their spring breaks in rural northern Mexico, building walls at a community youth center.
 Dan Lloyd, an associate professor of philosophy at Trinity College, which operates about 30 service-learning courses out of its campus in Hartford, said the programs are extremely valuable to students. "They discover, through their encourters with other people who are different than them, a different perspective," said Dr. Lloyd, who coordinates the college's service-learning programs. "It pushes a diversity of thinking between members of the student body, the faculty and the people who live in the city around us."
 Judith Rodin, president of the University of Pennyslvania in Philadelphia, agreed.
 "We believe that students today ought to learn how to become involved with the local neighborhood and with the broader communities in society," she said. "Penn was founded by Benjamin Franklin and he talked about service as an important part of teaching and learning. We want to insure that we continue with the Franklin mission."
 She noted, for example, that some University of Pennsylvania students studying geology have taught some middle-school students living in a depressed area of Philadelphia how to identify houses where they and other children might be at risk of lead poisoning.
 The number of service-learning courses offered at the university increased this year to 60 from 40 last year, she said. "We are very excited about it," Dr. Rodin added.
 Dr. Lloyd of Trinity said he views the college movement to reach and teach the whole student as a return to higher education's ancient roots. "Much of this is a harkening back to the traditional mission of the liberal arts education," he said. "In that liberal arts context, our role was to create, essentially, people who were able to make their own best choices."
Johnnetta B. Cole, president of Spelman College in Atlanta, said she is trying to strengthened the mission that has been the 113-year-old legacy of her historically black, women's college by producing leaders. That, she said, requires something more than simply scholarly instruction.
"You can't be a leader if you as a person are underdeveloped," Dr. Cole said. "You can't be a leader if you don't know where your own moral center is. I really don't think you can be a leader if you selfishly desire to advance yourself without any concern about the community around you."
Part of Spelman's program to reach and develop the whole student is to require first- and second-year students to attend weekly convocations to hear speakers like Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund. Dr. Cole said convocation speakers are so inspiring that if she had the auditorium space she would extend the attendance requirement to all of the school's 1,900 students.
The timing of all these efforts could not be better for college students today. Faculty, students and administrators all agree that these students tend to be more politically aware and willing to take stands and actions than the students of Generation X, the post-baby boomers often criticized for being self-absorbed and disconnected from the world.
"The whole idea of a generation of students that really doesn't care about their community is being rebuffed by the movement of service learning," said John Oda, the director of the California Campus Compact, part of the national organization that supports and encourages college-based community service. "We have students -- students of color, white students, all sorts of students -- coming out to do service in all different kinds of communities."
Mr. Oda's program is based at San Francisco State University, where students work with disadvantaged people in, among other places, the Mission District, Hunters Point and the Tenderloin District. He pointed out that San Francisco State University's motto is, fittingly, "Experience teaches."
Suzanne Goldsmith, a spokeswoman for the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a national public-interest group in Washington, said she has also noticed that college students today tend toward activism. "They are interested in making a difference now," she added.
Ms. Goldsmith, who graduated from Harvard University in 1982, said that when she was in college she remembered a "small interest" on the part of students in getting involved in the community outside of campus. "But it has grown exponentially since that time," she said. "Most students get involved in community service at some point in their college careers, and they get involved and see linkages between what they are learning in the community and what they are studying in, for instance, sociology and political science."
Some parents are also holding higher education, a $200 billion-a-year industry, to more demanding standards that include spiritual fulfillment and a civic conscience.
"Colleges and universities still do not have the whole vision to educate the whole person, but they are getting closer," said Miriam Weinstein, who calls herself a "concerned parent" of four and who lives in San Rafael, Calif.
Last year she wrote a book, "Making a Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You Make a Better World (SageWorks, 1995)."
"Students themselves are looking for more meaning in their lives and a more meaningful education," she said. "The 80's are really gone, and now people are much more willing to go into service careers -- even at Harvard."
This month, a team of seven students from the University of Denver is scheduled to begin humanitarian work in the refugee camps of the former Yugoslavia.
Todd W. Waller, director of the university's Community Action Program, the organizer of the project, said the monthlong experience in war-ravaged Croatia should help give students a better understanding of the complexity of the issues there. They should see, he said, with a clarity of firsthand experience, the impact of war on families.
The students are expected to prepare and serve meals, teach English and conduct activities for the refugees, many of whom are school-age children and teen-agers.
Mirian Colic, an international relations major with a minor in Japanese at the university, is a member of the team. For Ms. Colic, who was born 20 years ago in Sarajevo, the project could never be purely academic. "I haven't been back in nine years," she said. "I'm just wanting to know and see my homeland. I still have a lot of ties there. It's still my home."
Of her classmates making the trip, Ms. Colic said they will certainly learn that "everybody is a victim in this war."
In anticipation of the trip, Ms. Colic, a junior, said she has already learned one valuable lesson: "College is not just textbooks and sitting in classes. It is definitely a remarkable experience."
That is exactly what University of Denver's Chancellor Ritchie wants to hear.
"What we're trying to bring here is a total package of education for the individual," he said. "Many schools do a very fine job to prepare you to enter a profession. But in the future, it is going to take more than a professional education.
"It will take," he said, "a sense of self and self-awareness to recognize the differences and similarities among various people and cultures."

HEADLINE: NEXT TARGET: Nicotine

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Goldberg 

 BODY:
THE MEDICAL REPORTS LYING ON A TABLE IN DAVID KESSLER'S office include only the thinnest detail about the death of George Korizis, a 24-year-old Tufts University graduate and Greek citizen who died alone in his Boston apartment on April 18. But there is a curious aspect to Korizi's case that has interested Kessler, who is the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and who does not ordinarily pay attention to obscure deaths.
 
 Korizi's death has been attributed to myocardial necrosis, a condition in which key heart muscle cells die and that leads to cardiac arrest. It is an unusual although not unprecedented cause of death in a healthy young man. The case became intriguing, however, when a doctor dispatched by the Greek Consulate found several empty bottles of a product called Ripped Fuel in Korizis's apartment. One of the ingredients in Ripped Fuel, an over-the-counter powder used by weight lifters to maintain lean body mass, is ephedrine, a stimulant derived from ephedra, or the mahuang plant.
 The doctor recalled reading about the recent death of a Long Island man that was linked to mahuang. So he called the F.D.A., which is why several of the agency's senior scientists and lawyers are gathering Kessler's office on this Tuesday afternoon: to figure out what the commissioner should do about Korizis's death.
 Or, more to the point, what he can do, because when it comes to dietary supplements - and Ripped Fuel, like thousands of herb-based products, is considered by law to be a dietary supplement, no a drug - Kessler is not allowed to do very much. A 1994 law, passed with the help of full-bore lobbying by dietary-supplement makers, severely limited the F.D.A.'s power in the supplement regulation business. It was a signal ideological victory for those Americans who believe that the Government best stay out of their medicine cabinets. And it was a devastating defeat for those who believe that Government should play an activist role in protecting the public health.
 Today's meeting is focused squarely on the possible link between ephedrine and Korizis's death. But for Kessler, who has spent the past 20 months being squeezed in the fist of the Republican deregulation revolution, there is an acutely political subtext to any discussion about dietary supplements: the decision by Congress to curtail the F.D.A.'s regulation of dietary supplements was a prelude to its current attack on the F.LD.A., and it served to remind Kessler of America's bone-deep ambivalence toward Government regulators.
 But Kessler is an unapologetic enforcer of food and drug laws, and he has a lot to enforce. The F.D.A. regulates, in effect, every supermarket and pharmacy in America, one-fourth of all consumer spending - some $1 trillion of goods, including food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices and the nation's blood supply. As a result, the F.D.A. is constantly placing itself at the center of controversy. Two weeks ago, one of its advisory panels recommended that the agency approve RU-486, the so-called French abortion pill, for use in America. And now, even as Congress fights to dilute the F.D.A.'s powers, Kessler is trying to expand his agency's reach in a historic direction. Any day now, President Clinton, undoubtedly with Kessler by his side, will announce that the F.D.A. will begin regulating nicotine as a drug. It will be an announcement with profound public health - and political - consequences.
 Is Daivd Kessler a Traitor?
 Three weeks before Kessler convened his working group on ephedrine, he was called on to perform an unpleasant and difficult task, namely to testify before a House subcommittee whose Republican members seem to consider him the red-bearded equivalent of Ralph Nader.
 An hour before the hearing, Kessler met with his deputies to prepare for curve balls. "Tell me the difference between good hemlock and bad hemlock," Kessler said.
 "Bad hemlock is the kind that killed Socrates," one of his deputies told him. "Thanks a lot," Kessler said. "What about the oleo margarine standard? Can someone please explaint he margarine standard?"
 The mood was good-humored, though not overly so - "Final Jeopardy" with a suggestion of auto-da-fe.
 We felt the F.D.A.'s Washington office for the short walk to the Capitol. Kessler, ordinarily an even-keeled man with the disarming manner of a pediatrician, which he is by training, turned grim. "This is as serious as it gets," he said quietly, traffice shooting by him unnoticed. "This is about the weakening of a century's worth of food and drug laws. This is about undermining the safety of the drugs Americans take."
 What troubles Kessler so strongly are three House bills, which, if enacted, could lead to the privatization of a wide slice of the F.D.A.'s drug and medical-device review work, as well as less stringent standards for drug approval and blood safety. They are the House's versions of a more moderate Senate measure that would order the F.D.A. to review all new drug applications within six months or farm the work out to private companies. The bills could lead to overwhelming changes in the way the F.D.A. does business, changes that Kessler fears would imperil public health but that F.D.A. critics say would speed the release of life-saving drugs.
 Taking his seat at the witness table, Kessler was quite literally surrounded by foes. Before him were Congressional critics, some of whomo are committed to a nearlibertarian vision of a self-regulating private sector. Behind Kessler, in the audience, sat the private sector itself, a blue-suited battalion of lobbyists representing the drug and medical-device industries, food-additive and dietary-supplement makers, grocery and tobacco conglomerates. All of them would like to see more quiescent F.D.A. than the one Kessler now commands.
 Kessler seems to have developed immunity against partisan attack (Newt Gingrich has labeled him a "thug" and a "bully" and conservative magazines have long treated him like a pinata), and he sat impassively as the Republicans made their opening statements.
 "If you are here today to say that no, the F.D.A. will not or cannot make America's access to life-saving drugs the best in the world, don't waste my time," warns Richard Burr, a frehman Congreeman from North Carolina.
 For deregulationists, Kessler is the personification of overbearing, intrusive Government. This is partly because of his Clinton-anointed role as Public Enemy No. 1 of Big Tobacco. It was Kessler who 18 months ago handed the White House a fat politcal winner by redefining tobacco as a "pediatric disease," not as an issue of adult choice, as the cigarette industry would haveit. And it is because of tobacco that the F.D.A., never before a factor in Presidential politics, has suddenly emerged as a campaign issue.
 The White House is trying to protect Kessler's scientific independence - and thus the integrity of his proposal to regulate tobacco - by removing itself, publicly at least, from the process. "The F.D.A. makes its own decisions," says George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's senior adviser. "The President has taken a lot of heat from tobacco companies for standing by Dr. Kessler and the F.D.A."
 Most of the heat, though, has been absorbed directly by Kessler. In fact, Bob Dole has made a point of saying that if he is elected President, he will fire Kessler. Like many Republicans, Dole says it is Kessler's overall performance, an unacceptably pro-regulation performance, that makes him persona non grata in conservative circles. but Dole is a major financial beneficiary of the tobacco industry. The Republican National Committee has taken in $2.1 million from tobacco interests since 1995, compared with $78,2000 that the Democratic National Committee received. And Dole has been openly critical of Kessler's campaign to regulate cigerettes.
 To the delight of the White House, Dole spent parts of June and July questioning nicotine's addictiveness and subsequently found himself drowning in ridicule. Dole and Kessler have aparrently never tangled personally on the issue of tobacco; Kessler, the ostensibly nonpartisan head of an independent agency, who was in fact first appoointed by President Bush, keeps publicly clear of Presidential politics, although the F.D.A.'s rollout of its tobacco regulation program will obviously add momentum to the Clinton campaign.
 Kessler has, though, tangled with the other Dole, Elizabeth, who, until she took a temporary leave to campaign for her husband, served for five years as president of the American Red Cross. The F.D.A. closely regulates the Red Cross, which collects half of the nation's blood supply. Three years ago. the F.D.A. went to court to force the Red Cross into a consent decree after F.D.A. investigators found widespread weaknesses in the way it tracked donors and tested blood. Today, the F.D.A. says, the Red Cross has corrected about 75 percent of those problems.
 It is unclear whether Bob Dole's animus toward Kessler might stem from his wife's F.D.A. difficulties, since Elizabeth Dole's spokeswoman steers all questions about her Red Cross service to the Red Cross and a Dole campaign spokeswoman refuses to comment. A senior Administration source says that Elizabeth Dole was "severely agitated" by the F.D.A.'s intervention and threatened to pull the American Red Cross out fo the blood business; the F.D.A. took the threat seriously enough to draw up a contingency plan. Kessler refuses to talk about Elizabeth Dole, on the principle that talking about a woman he regulates, who is married to a man who has pledged to fire him, can do him no good.
 In Kessler's enthusiastic oversight of the Red Cross can be found at least one clue to his high profile: he was been nuscular in enforcing the regulatory statutes at hisi command and not at all shy about publicizing this muscularity. Early in his tenure, he earned the nickname "Eliot Knessler," which is one of the nicer things he has been called in Washington. All too often, I have haeard Kessler's critics use Nazi imagery to characterize his job performance; Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post even referred to the F.D.A. as the "Food Gestapo."
 At bottom, though, Kessler's high profile may simply be a reflection of the awesome reach of the F.D.A. As head of a 9,000-person agency within the Health and Human Services Department, Kessler is one of the few bureaucrats below the rank of assistant secretary who have regular access to the President. The issues facing the agency today are as complex as its mandate, but at the core of each issue is a single question as old as regulation itself: where is the border between responsible consumer protection and obstructionist meddling? Conservatives say that Kessler crossed the line long ago.
 "David is a liberal, and there's no question that liberals think the F.D.A. can do no wrong whatsoever," says Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who backed Kessler for Commissioner but is now one of his most persistent critics. "The liberals think the more time the F.D.A. takes to approve products and the stronger they adhere to the zero-risk quotient, which means little or no American innovation or ingenuity, the better off we are."
 There are two paradozes in the Republican criticism of Kessler: one is that he is a Republican himself 9a Rockefeller Republican, to be sure). That he happily joined the Clinton Administration after his service under Bush was proof to many Republicans of his weak character.
 "The Republicans consider David a traitor," says Kessler's boss, Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Even worse, the Republicans believe that he campaigned to keep his job, a violation of Washington mores. Kessler did make a speech during the transition that seemed sympathetic to the Clinton vision of regulstion, but he denies campaigning and Shalala backs him up: "The White House asked me who I wanted to keep and David was first on my list."
 Kessler was seen, until the transition at least, as nonpartisan. When he was appointed in 1990, the F.D.A. itself was less politicized: the Bush Administration was not looking to privatize the agency but merely to salvage it. The F.D.A. had just been tarred by a scandal involving corrupt generic drug inspectors and was widely perceived as limp and underachieveing. Kessler, 39 at the time, brought to the agency a reformer's zeal and a perfect resume: he had alw and medical degrees from the Unversity of Chicago and Harvard, respectively; he had taught food and drug law at Columbia Law School, had been medical director of the albert Einstein teaching hospital in the Bronx and had, fatefully, served as a staff member on Senator Hatch's Labor and Human Resources Committee.
 Another paradox of the Republicans' criticism concerns the main charge directed at Kessler: that the F.D.A. drags out the drug-approval process interminably. That might very well have been true a decade ago, but according to a General Accounting Office study, the F.D.A. slashed the time it takes to approve new drugs for an average of 33 months in 1987 to 19 in 1992. In fiscal 1994, the F.D.A. says, it reviewed 96 percent of all new drug applications within 12 months. And in 1995 approval times for cancer and AIDS drugs dropped even more sharply. drags out the drug-approval proccess interminably. That might very well have been true a decade ago, but according to General Accounting Office study, the F.D.A. slashed the time it takes to approve new drugs from an average of 33 months in 1987 to 19 in 1992. In fiscal 1994, the F.D.A. says, it reviewed 96 percent of all new drug applications within 12 months. And in 1995 approval times for cancer and AIDS drugs dropped even more sharply.
 "People have formed set ideological views to the point that they're not willing to recognize the changes under Dr. Kessler, particularly since 1993, in the speeding up for drug approval," says Vice President Gore.
 Some Republicans, though, take credit for any acceleration. "Kessler doesn't do anything without pressure from us," says Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, a deregulation advocate. Coats blames the F.D.A. for forcing the pharmaceutical industry to spend more time on drug development than ever before, a claim that the industry happily seconds. Republicans also criticize, on firmer ground, the F.D.A.'s lag time in approving medical devices, anyting from an ultrasound breast-cancer detector to a threaded fusion cage, a device for treating degenerative disk disorder. The F.D.A. is required to review mosttypes of medical devices within 90 days; in 1995, on average, it took 136.
 Gore suggests another possible reason fro Kessler's vilification: "Since the tobacco industry sees Dr. Kessler as an incorruptible force for goodk, which means he's against them, they have made him their bete noire. They've gone all out to try to attack him."
 Several conservative foundations leading the anti-F.D.A. campaign are financed in part by tobacco companies, a fact that Kessler's allies eargerly note. And many of his opponents in Congress, including Burr, represent tobacco states or, like Coats, are top recipients of tobacco industry largess.
 It may be that Kessler's unpopularity is simply the price paid by regulators in a culture that glorifies outlaws and entrepreneurs. Every day, Kessler confronts the American ambivalence toward his role. "Ask whether Government should get off the backs of business, get out of our lives, and the answer is always a resounding yes," he says. "Then ask whether Government has a role to play in protecting the food supply and the blood supply, and you get a resounding yes. That's the American way."
 A Death He Can Do Nothing About
 Did George Korizis die because the benevolent filter of Government that stood between manufacturer and consumer was removed by Congressional fiat? David Kessler suggests so one day in his office: "I don't think you can deregulate in areas of public health without real effects on real people."
 For Kessler, the law that changed everything was the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which exempts self-styled dietary supplements, like Ripped Fuel, from stringent F.D.A. oversight. Manufacturers of dietary supplements had conducted a noholds-barred campaign to get the act passed, protraying the F.D.A. as the enemy of unfettered free enterprise; one TV commercial weirdly presaged today's Freeman-style paranoia, showing a Government SWAT team breaking into a man's house to seize his vitamins.
 The 1994 supplement law proved a boon to those manufacturers, of cours, as well as to consumers who wanted nonprescription access to so-called alternative medicines. But it became a burden for the F.D.A. Before the supplemenet law, the F.D.A. could force a manufacturer to prove, at its own expense, a product's safety. Today, the F.D.A. at taxpayers' expense, must mount a court case against a specific dietary supplement is believes unsafe.
 And it certainly has serious concerns about the safety of ephedrine in dietary supplements. Over the past four years, the agency has received reports of 15 deaths and at last 400 "adverse events" associated with such ephedrine use. So Kessler and his advisers wlak through the facts of Korizi's death, looking to see if they should build a case against Ripped Fueld.
 Kessler, reciting Korizis's habits and the clinical signs of ephedrine abuse, steers the meeting firmly; he gets impatient witha run-on anssers.
 "The pattern is so typical for cocaine-induced cardiac myopathy," Lori Love, the senior scientist on the case, tells the crowded room.
 "Everybody said the boy didn't abuse drugs," says Gerald Vince, an F.D.A. enforcement official.
 But Love explains that cocaine, amphetamines and ephedrine can all damage the hear in the same way.
 "You can't distinguish the difference among all three?" Kessler ask.
 "Well, we know that he had none of these other products in blood or urine, and there was ephedrine in the urine," Love says.
 "Tell us what else you were able to get," Kessler asks F.D.A. investigators on the speaker phone from Boston.
 "His friends threw out some containers," one investigators says. "There were various containers of vitamins, but they couldn't recollect what they threw out."
 "Shoot," Kessler mutters.
 The Korizi death is a tougher case for the F.D.A. than that of Peter Schlendorf, a 20-year-old Long Island man who died after swallowing eight pills of Ultimate Xphoria, which includes mahuang and caffeine and promises an herbal high. Because products like Ultimate Xphoria are marketed as alternatives to street drugs, it's easier for the F.D.A. to crack down on them than on products marketed as nutritional supplements.
This becomes clear as the meeting progresses. Kessler, aware that the facts of the Korizis death don't yet warrant action, issues a call for more information, hoping espeically for something definitive from the Boston medical examiner.
 "They didn't realize the signficance of the case," Love says. "After it was explained to them, they showed interest -"
 "- in putting two and two together," Kessler finished.
 After the meeting, Kessler sits on the edge of his couch, Diet Coke in hand, and talks about the impact of the 1994 supplement law.
 "No one intended for the act to have these consequencies," he says, referring to mahuang-related deaths. He speaks slowly and carefully as he edges close to implicating Congress. "In some ways, if you think about it, you could have predicted it. You open a loophole and now we're dealing with the consequences."
 The proposals to trim the F.D.A.'s reach come after more than half a century of almost continual expansion of that reach. The agency was founded in 1906 after scandals invovling adulterated food and quack doctors. It was empowered to monitor drug safety by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which passed amid outrage overthe deaths of more than 100 children who ingested a flawed sulfa drug. In 1962, in the wake of the thalidomide disaster overseas (thalidomide was kept out of America by a skeptical F.D.A. reviewer named Frnaces Kelsey), the agency was allowed to demand from companies more extensive clinical and efficacy testing of new drugs.
 What Kessler fears, he says, is that a drug fast-tracked to the marketplace will go on to kill people. This fear, critics contend, is what stops him from taking bold steps toward reform. "David ought to be the first one to say that people are dying because we're not getting drugs through fast enough," Senator Hatch says. "He is paralyzed by the idea that a dangerous drug will slip through."
 Not a bad thing to be, Shalala suggests: "I want him to be kept up at night over questions of safety."
 The Mentor and the Errant Protege
 Among F.D.A. critics like Hatch, it is an idea as inviolate as Scripture itself that people die because David Kessler refuses to release the drugs that could save their lives.
 But the Commissioner's most prominent critics are often stumped when asked to cite a particular drug. C. Boyden Gray, the former Bush White House counsel who is now the chairman of Citizens for a Sound Economy, could not name any such drug, event though his organization regularly bashes the F.D.A. for laggard approval times. Sam Kazman, the general counsel fo the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has accused the F.D.A. of casuing thousands of deaths by dragging out its review process, also stumbles on this question. When asked to give examples of drugs that were stalled in review, Kazman could name only one - Elmiron, which treats a chronic bladder disease (According to the drug's maker, Ivax, Elmiron has been declared "approvable" by the F.D.A. and has been available for several years under the agency's "compassionate use" guidelines, which allow a company to provide drugs that are still in clinical testing to patients in dire need.)
 Even Hatch, Kessler's long-ago mentor, has trouble producing concrete charges against the F.D.A. Indeed, Hatch's criticism of Kessler seems more personal than ideological. During an interview in his office, Hatch offers, without prompting, a neatly organized presentation of his Kessler problem.
 "Let me talk about the publicity-seeking aspect of David," he begins, reading from handwritten notes. Kessler, the Senator says, is too eager for self-aggrandizement, too nakedly political for an office that should be science-oriented. "If I have a big criticism of David, it is that he loves publicity and seeks it. I think it's fine for bureaucrats to be interviewed, but he goes overboard."
 It is true that Kessler is a canny political operative who makes headlines. And it is true that Kessler protects his image by cloaking himself in the mantle of medicine, which is why he frequently begins testimony with the words "As a physician. ..." but seldom with the words "As a lawyer. ..." He also assiduously courts sympathetic Congressmen and makes himself readily accessible to reporters.
 But Hatch's hostility toward Kessler is apparently motivated by something deeper than media envy. Hatch was a co-sponsor of the 1994 dietary supplement act and he bitterly disputes Kessler's claims that it has allowed dangerous drugs onto the market. "Kessler's misleading the American public on herbs like mahuang," Hatch says. "Now, any death is tragic, especially when it might have been prevented. But what is even more tragic is that Kessler is laying it at the feet of Congress."
 The flight over the supplement law was the breaking point in the relationship between Hatch and Kessler. The Senator says he now regrets lobbying for Kessler's appointment back in 1990, if only because his opponents never let him forget that his help was crucial: "The Nader types get great glee in reminding me."
 Kessler, observing the time-honored Washington rule that senators criticize bureaucrats and bureaucrats get criticized by senators, says he will "only talk in the fondest terms about Senator Hatch."
 But he does add, slyly, "There's a reason F.D.A. commissioners aren't elected."
 An elected F.D.A. commissioner would almost certainly be driven from office, not necessarily over a grand ideological battle but over a thousand little skirmishes. At any given moment, a dozen interest groups are angry at Kessler and at least a handful are eager to drape his name in glory. It is the nature of such an all-encompassing agency that, during one recent week, Kessler was criticized by a Senate panel for approving potentially life-saving drugs too slowly and criticized by consumer groups for approving an anti-obesity drug, desfenfluramine, too quickly.
 There is often no orderly theme to attacks on the agency. Take, for example, the criticism of Joe Barton, a Texas Congressman leading the F.D.A. reform fight. Barton, like many Republicans, sees the F.D.A. as an agency that abuses its power. But he has been especially critical of the F.D.A.'s handling of the long-running Halcion saga - not for overregulating the sleeping pill but for failing to regulate it enough. The F.D.A., faced with information in the early part of Kessler's tenure that Upjohn, Halcion's maker, hid proof of adverse Reactions, soft-pedaled its investigation and did not refer the case to the Justice Department. This spring, an F.D.A. task force found that the case was indeed mishandled, and Kessler admits that the agency "made a mistake."
 A victory for Barton, then, but a strange one, considering that he wants to weaken the F.D.A.'s hold over pharmaceutical companies like Upjohn (now known as Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.).
 Or take a June editorial in The Wall Street Journal, which has elevated Kessler to the ranks of its first-tier Administration targets. The Journal's editorial page, a dogged proponent of deregulation, in this case blasted Kessler for being too slow on issuing new regulations concerning mammography quality.
 "As long as they have something to beat us up on," Kessler says with feigned resignation.
 But there are still stranger sights these days than conservatives calling for more stringent regulation. Consider the new stance toward drug acceleration within the AIDS lobby, which has historically been implacably hostile to the F.D.A. It was the intense lobbying of AIDS activists, of course, that prompted the stepped-up approval of new drugs. But these drugs are now being released so fast - several new protease inhibitors were recently approved in a matter of weeks - that some AIDS experts think it may be time to refine the F.D.A.'s review process. "Once the drug is on the market, the incentives for companies to do the trails, to confirm their clinical efficacy, is much less," says Ellen C. Cooper, clinical research director of Amfar, the American Foundation for AIDS Resarch. "Everybody is in favor of getting rid of inefficiences, fo dead time in the process, but am I willing to give up three or six months for more information? Absolutely."
 Kessler, having cast his lot with accelerated drug approval, defends it - to a point. "We have pushed drug review time probably as short as can be and still do a credible job," he says.
 Cooper, a former F.D.A. official, responds with a rare note of understanding for Kessler: "As a regulator, you can never get it exactly right."
 The End of Tobacco as We Know It?
 Paulette Kessler is doping out the pluses and minuses of Government service and is coming up in the red.
 "What's the payoff?" she asks her husband as they sit in their living room in suburban Maryland. "Let me know when you figure it out."
 Paulette Kessler is a slight, youthful-looking woman, a lawyer by training and the mother of the Kesslers' two children, Elise, 13, and Ben, 11. She does not fear letting her opinions be known: she plainly states that she would like to leave Washington and the people who regularly excoriate her husband. "Every time there's a rumor that he's leaving the job," she says, "The joke is that I started it."
 On the other hand, she suggests, as long as her husband remains F.D.A. Commissioner, he might as well bloody the tobacco industry. She is the hothead in this house, it seems. It is an odd thing about her husband, how coldly clinical he comes across on an issue weighted with such emotion.
 Because the tobacco companies are suing the F.D.A. to keep it out of the nicotine-regulation business, Kessler steps lightly. He won't even give in to public moralizing. Once, when I asked him to comment on the mock anguish in yuppie investor circles about the morality of buying Philip Morris stock, Kessler rolled his eyes. "Do I really have to give stock tips?" he asked plaintively.
 But tonight in his home, over a dinner of takeout Oriental chicken salad, I hope he will talk about whatever it is that motivates his tobacco war. I am stymied for a moment, though, by the dressing that comes with the salad; I fear the hidden fat in most dressings. But after watching Kessler pour dressing on his salad, I follow suit. Surely the F.D.A. Commissioner wouldn't let dangerous dressing into his house.
 Is it anger, I ask him, that feeds the tobacco campaign?
 "Let me step back and answer that in a little longer way," he begins. "Let me answer that as a pediatrician and as a parent. Look at adolescence. What's going on during adolescence? The search for identity, the rebellion, but at the same itme, the need to conform. The looking for cues from one's peers, the need to feel accepted. In the end, it is a search for self-esteem. What the tobacco industry has known for a long time were these vulnerabilities of adolescence. And rather than using that knowledge to reduce the incidence of kids becoming addicted, they played on that knowledge."
Focusing solely on underage smoking seems an indirect way of fighting tobacco. But, Kessler explains, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, there is a 90 percent chance that a person will not take up smoking if he or she makes it to 19 without having started.
 So Kessler, who understood that it was politically untenable to propose an outright ban on tobacco, devised with his staff a new way of looking at nicotine: as a pediatric disease. Through a barrage of policy papers and interviews during the past two years, Kessler helped to shift the debate away from the concept of "adult choice," putting the tobacco industry on the defensive. He forced it to agree with him, in theory at least, that children shouldn't smoke - it couldn't possibly do otherwise - while knowing that teen-age smokers represent the industry's future in America.
 Ultimately, though, the F.D.A. could not have taken the offensive without the mistakes made by the tobacco industry. Cigareete companies had left behind a paper trail stating their goals of developing, through clever advertising campaigns, children as customers. leaked industry documents also show that some companies privately recognized cigarettes as little more than nicotine-delivery devices. What the tobacco companies agressively dispute, and what will undoubtedly be argued in court, is whether, as the F.D.A. charges, the industry manipulated the nicotine levels in cigarettes to create addiction.
 In interviews, Kessler tends to answer questions about the F.D.A.'s tobacco campaign by reading directly from tobacco industry documents; it is his way of avoiding a discussion of his own opinions, certainly, and also hi sway of letting the enemy make his case. And so it is tonight: Kessler roots around his living room in search of a document. "Here," he says, thumbing his way through some oft-visited pages in cigarette company reports from the 1970's that were recently obtained by the F.D.A. " 'The adolescent seeks to display his new urge for independence with a symbol, and cigarettes are such a symbol,' " he reads.
 "The fragile, developing self-image of the young person needs all of the support and enhancement it can get. Smoking may appear to enhance that self-image in a variety of ways. This self-image enhancement effect has traditionally been a strong promotional theme for cigarette brands."
 He takes a breath and puts the document down silently, as if that's all that needs to be said.
 So doesn't that make him angry?
 "There's a time and place for anger," he says, "but not in this job."
 What the conservation does produce are strong hints about where Kessler hopes to carry his anti-cigarette campaign. So far, some of the F.D.A.'s ideas have won wide attention: the proposals to ban cigarette vending machines, to forbid sporting events from naming themselves after tobacco companies, to halt distribution of Joe Camel-style paraphernalia and to force cigarette companies to abandon their visually seductive magazine ads, restricting them to text-only ads in magazines with significant teen-age readership. But is it not enough, Kessler tells me, to separate advertisers from their target audience. Teen-agers must be actively convinced that smoking is, in his words, "uncool."
 There is a provision, mostly unnoticed, in the proposed F.D.A. regulations that demands $150 million each year from tobacco companies to finance anti-smoking ads. It is this sort of campaign, Kessler says, that will help the Federal Government reach its goal of cutting under-age smoking in half over the next seven years.
 "You want to talk about getting angry - ask a 16- or 17-year-old how they feel when they see an 11- or 12-year-old smoke a cigarette," Kessler says, implying that an ad featuring a teen-ager attacking cigarettes would prove more effective than a simple advertising ban.
 And if it doesn't?
 "What the agency has said is that once we assert uridiction over tobacco, we will put these measures into effect. and then if there needs to be other measures, we'll take other measures."
 This is what frightens the tobacco industry, the idea that banning vending machines and rodeo sponsorship isn't the end for Kessler. He won't say what measures he would take if the current propsals prove ineffective, but there is speculation that he would try to force tobacco companies to produce cigarettes that are less toxic and less addictive.
 It may have been Kessler's threat of even more regulation that in May prompted Philip Morris, America' slargest cigarette maker, to issue with another tobacco company a plan to curb under-age smoking. The plan, which Philip Morris said would be adopted only if the F.D.A. agreed to leave the industry unregulated, mimics the F.D.A. proposals in many ways. But it is laced with holes and semantic sleights of hand. For one thing, the F.D.A. proposal states that the text-only cigarette ads would appear in magazines with 15 percent or more under-age readers; the Philip Morris proposal calls for the ads in magazines with 15 percent or more under-age subscribers, which would allow visual ads in, for instance, Rolling Stone.
 "Their propsal fell substantially short," Kessler says.
 But what if the tobacco industry truly matched the F.D.A.'s plan, proposal for proposal? Would the agency step aside?
 "They would still need to be regulated," Kessler says, giving no quarter. "It would have to be credibly done. There would need to be a regulatory framework."
 Kessler can aford to feel cocky just now; the new rules aren't yet in effect and the lawsuits from the tobacco companies haven't yet been heard. It is far from certain, though, that the Supreme Court would view sympathetically any attempt by a Government agency to regulate advertising or let the F.D.A. force the tobacco industry to sponsor anti-smoking messages.
 Over the course of a dozen conversations, it becomes clear to me that Kessler won't leave the F.D.A., willingly at least, until he humbles the tobacco industry. I asked him what he would do if he lost the fight. He replied that, with the fundamental perception about cigareets so radically altered, losing is not longer possible. "The truth," he said, "will survive."
 What Do Americans Truly Want From Kessler?
 It is almost certainly true that David Kessler is the only regulator in Governmetn service who draws admirers the way that, say, George Stephanopoulos does. This should help his battle against cigarettes, except that he doesn't seem to like the attention.
 "You're David Kessler, right?" a woman asks as she passes him in the cereal aisle of a Bethesda supermarket. After an uncomfortable pause, he admits tht he is. "Keep up the good work on cigarettes," she says.
 This happens twice more in 20 minutes. Granted, the supermarket is located inside the Beltway, deep in NPR and Volvo country, but such attention is presumably not accorded, even here, to high officials of the F.T.C. or OSHA.
 Kessler and I are visiting the supermarket to discuss the impact of one of his key achievements: the 1994 introduction of the more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know food labels, which place into dietary context the amount of fat in nearly every product sold American food stores.
 "I suppose I'm guilty," Kessler says as he reaches for a pint of Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby ice cream (350 calories per serving, 210 from fat). "If you're asking for public apology for every time you've put something back ona shelf after reading the label, I'm guilty and I apologize. Sometimes, I pick up something and read the label and put it back. Sometimes I don't."
 Surely David Kessler, a man painted by his enemies as an abstemious kvetch, bent on bleeding the joy out of life in the name of public health, doesn't eat ice cream? "In moderation," he says, then puts the Chubby Hubby back in the freezer.
 He sweeps his arm across the aisle. "Look at this selection," he says, referring to the logjam of "low fat" and "no fat" products. "What we did nwith the new food labels - it's about information. Information created demand. The food label changed the way manufacturers manufacture. What the critics of the new food labeling don't understand is that it's about choice."
 Kessler's critics, though, say that the new food label, like the battle to regulate tobacco, is an example of an imperious Government agency infantilizing the American public by deciding what's in its best interests.
 Just as Walker Merry-man, a Washington lobbyist.
 "Have you ever looked at what Kessler did with orange juice?" he says, referring to the F.D.A.'s 1991 seizure of thousands of gallons of Citrus Hill orange juice. The juice made from concentrate, and the company, Procter & Gamble, ahd refused to remove the word "fresh" from the label.
 "Now, I love orange juice, I really do," Merry-man continues. "But I only like fresh. I remember seeing the advertising for this brand and I saw the word 'fresh,' right under the brand. I also remember that it was clear to anyone who looked at it that the orange juice was made from concentrate. Butnot to Kessler. I remember thinking when he seized it, that's the dubest goddamn thing I've ever heard of. Does he think people can't read a (expeltive) label? Kessler thinks consumers are too damn dumb to look at a label and make uptheir minds. There's a philosophical divide we're talking about here."
 Now, discounts for a moment that Walker Merry-man, the orange juice lover, is also the vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the industry trade group, and a prime spokesman for the "adult choice" cigarette argument. Merryman's view of Kessler is similar to that of most F.D.A. crtiics, who see at the core of everything that Kessler's agency does a flock of theoretically brilliant, Ivy League-trained lawyers to believe in their ability to protect Americans from themselves and who believe even more in their own superiority.
 It doesn't take long, in fact, for some of the F.D.A.'s detractors to veer away from specific, policy-based criticisms to a sort of amorphous, class-based attack rooted in the cultural divide between Eastern, Government-friendly elites and everyone else. Such is the case with Joe Barton, the Texas Republican. When I asked him to talk in specific terms about the agency's weaknesses, he said: "They've had regulatory authority for so long tht they think they're above people. To me, they're like the professional bureaucracy of the French Government. If they're supposed to go to lunch at 12, they do, and they come back at 2, and you'll just have to cool your heels waiting for these people."
 Kessler, predictably, is hesitant to analyze the culture gap that may explain some of the hostility directed at him. He usually prefers instead to make mention of an eternal verity about Government regulation: "If you want to make people happy, don't become a regulator." He says this ruefully, but only half seriously, because he does believe that most Americans, when faced with a choice in the matter, would opt to have the Government watching over "the stuff they put into their bodies," as he calls it.
 What's at stake on Capitol Hill is just howmuch watching the F.D.A. will be allowed to do in the future. Though he was pessimistic in May about the Republican legislation, Kessler seemed less burdened by July. Some Republican leaders in the House began to worry that apush fro radical F.D.A. deregulation, and the floor right that could follow, would be unhelpful to the party, still reeling from the perception that it had tried to gut environmental regulation.
 In late July, the Republicans agreed to one maor compromise, on an issue concerning both the F.D.A. and the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans had wanted to scrap the Delaney Clause, a 1958 law that banned carcinogens in food additives and pesticides. Most scientists agree dthat the Delaney standards were outdated, but the Administration didn't want to repeal the law unless it was replaced with other safeguards. Congressional Republicans are now proposing to do cut that, having devised peticide standards that are acceptable to Democrats while keeping, for now, the food-additive provisions of the Delaney Cluase.
 But support for deregulation still runs strong and, even if Congressional Republicans jettison their F.D.A. wish list, they are still pushing to check the agency's power. Meanwhile, Kessler continues to fight the impact of previous deregulation. Trying to take action against ephedrine int he wake of George Korizis's death, the F.D.A. is now investigating at its own expense, each of the several hundred adverse event slinked to ephedrine in dietary supplements.
 And then there is the F.D.A.'s plan to regulate tobacco, which could be unveiled by President Clinton even before the Republican Convention. The announcement would surely be the climax of Kessler's F.D.A. stewardship. A few weeks ago, I asked him if he worries about a Dole victory this November and the attempt to undo tobacco regulation that might well follow follow.
 Kessler dodged the question, as he dodges nearly all partisan questions, instead taking the opportunity to scold the agency's critics for misunderstanding the American public. "I learned something when I was Senate staff in 1981 and 1982," he said, referring to the early Reagan era and its deregulatory fervor. "THe public does not want deregulation in the areas of health and safety. Time and time again, there are people on the Hill who misjudge this."
 I asked Kessler if perhaps, as a young Republican, he, too, misread the public's position and is now repenting for that misreading. It is the sort of question that Kessler doesn't like, so he gave a nonanswer: "I watched the Republicans coming to deregulate the F.D.A., and in the end it didn't work because it's not what the American people want."
 He is too cautious to make bold predictions, but he sees the current push for deregulation as a pendulum swing brought on, as it were, byt he agency's success. "The better we prevent things from every happening, people will feel more and more secure about their food and drugs and the more pressure there will be on us to stop regulating. But the pendulum is dangerous. People get hurt by the pendulum. It's been the same pattern for 40 or 50 years."
 Kessler is confident that, current F.D.A. controversies notwithstanding, the pendulum will swing back in the agency's direction. "There's a disconnect in this country ont his isssue - I mean, take a look at Britain," he said, referring to mad cow disease. "The Government could have fallen, and over what? A food issue. And ehre they want to lower safety standards. In Britian, the one thing they're crying out for its a commission that has no other conflicts or loyalties other than making sure the public health is well served. Well, we already have that here."

HEADLINE: Democracy and Its Malcontent

BYLINE: By Alan Ryan; Alan Ryan is the author of several works on the philosophy of the social sciences, most recently "John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism."

 BODY:

Max Weber
Politics and the Spirit of Tragedy.
By John Patrick Diggins.
334 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $35.
At first sight, Max Weber, the dour, neurotic, late-19th-century German professor of sociology, seems an unlikely subject for John Patrick Diggins. Mr. Diggins is a professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and one of the liveliest and most interesting of contemporary intellectual historians. Over the past 25 years, he has written about a great many subjects in American political and intellectual history, but in particular about the dilemmas of the 20th-century American left. 
 Mr. Diggins's explorations of the difficulties of left (or leftish) American intellectuals began with "Up From Communism," published in 1975 and reissued three years ago. This was an extremely engaging account of a familiar story -- the movement across the political spectrum of Max Eastman, John Dos Passos and James Burnham. On the whole, the young Mr. Diggins preferred the young Eastman, Dos Passos and Burnham to their right-wing older selves, even though his motive for writing the book in the first place had been his growing suspicion that his left-wing colleagues of the 1960's would soon be making their own journeys to a conservative middle age.
The most recent of these reflections was "The Promise of Pragmatism," published in 1994. Its theme was the failure of pragmatism to provide America with a persuasive public philosophy. In Mr. Diggins's account, the chief failing of pragmatism was that it could not take authority seriously. But its failings went further: it had nothing persuasive to say about the role of violence in politics, and its attachment to democracy was so complete and unthinking that it could make no sense of antidemocratic sentiments, not simply those of dictators and insurrectionists, but of the best sociological and philosophical intelligences of Europe.
If the less youthful Mr. Diggins had not become a conservative, he had become perhaps somewhat melancholy. That was why the very un-American figure of Max Weber was lurking in the wings. After John Dewey's sunny optimism about the prospects for a society built on a democratic moral consensus and committed to mildly progressive social policies, Mr. Diggins felt the need for a more astringent, more skeptical, even more cynical, voice.
In the United States, he found some of what he wanted in Henry Adams. Adams's doubt that history led anywhere in particular was an antidote to the sentimental belief that evolution favored democratic states and liberal societies. But Adams was too fragmentary a commentator on politics to provide quite what Mr. Diggins wanted. Max Weber, on the other hand, spent all his life trying to understand what, if anything, underpinned modern society. If it was moral commitment, to what was that commitment owed? If it was only the brute force of the political state, how did the state maintain its monopoly on the means of violence, and when would that monopoly break down?
It is easy to see why "Max Weber" is subtitled "Politics and the Spirit of Tragedy." Weber (1864-1920) was the thinker who announced that modern man had built for himself "an iron cage" in the form of a capitalist, industrial economic system that was increasingly run by an army of managers, and that offered those who ran it prosperity in exchange for a life of numbing routine. No doubt, boring prosperity is an improvement over the boring near-starvation that has been the lot of most inhabitants of most agrarian societies. But no amount of comfort was a fair exchange for a life as uninteresting as modern capitalism seemed likely to provide.
Assessing late-19th-century society in these unenthusiastic terms was hardly unique to Weber; both before and after Nietzsche, German social critics had lamented the spiritual emptiness of the modern world in similar terms. What was more distinctive about Weber was his insistence that there existed no easy way out. Weber is grist to Mr. Diggins's mill because democratic and industrial America occupied a central place in his sociological imagination.
Weber came to this country only once, in 1904, when he attended the International Exposition in St. Louis, or rather the intellectual jamboree associated with it that the Harvard psychologist Hugo Munsterberg had organized. On that trip, which Mr. Diggins compares to the visit of Tocqueville and Beaumont 70 years earlier, Weber saw a scene that epitomized what he later analyzed as the connection between American religion and American economics. Visiting cousins in the South, he went to a baptism where grown men and women were firmly immersed in an icy stream by the local preacher before they dashed off home to get warm. He was surprised to see a local banker undergoing this ordeal, and on asking what the man was up to, he was told that the banker was establishing his bona fides. Anyone wanting to open a bank in the neighborhood needed to be trusted; a banker under the eye of a Baptist congregation was unlikely to leave the straight and narrow.
This makes it less surprising that when Weber wrote the little book for which he is best known, "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," both sides of the equation were illustrated by the very American persona of Benjamin Franklin. What Weber was up to in that book has puzzled many commentators. He cannot have meant to say that only in Protestant countries does capitalism have any chance of success; he was well aware that the very first capitalists in Europe had been Roman Catholics. Mr. Diggins suggests that Weber was fascinated by a paradox that was central to American life. Puritanism was not, on the face of it, a creed that encouraged worldly ambition. Calvinism in its purest form emphasized the futility of earthly hopes, and reminded its adherents that God chose the elect and the damned for His reasons, not for any that we might dream up. Yet believing in the inscrutability of Providence did not lead American Calvinists to sit around anxiously wondering whether they were saved or damned. It stirred them to work extremely hard. It seemed they could not help thinking that their good works must surely count for something.
Weber's gaze was not directed only to the strange this-worldly consequences of otherworldly allegiances. Almost nothing in the culture of late-19th-century Germany or elsewhere escaped him. As Mr. Diggins says, Weber thought about "topics as varied as Russian peasants and Oklahoma Indians; types of authority throughout history and possibilities of freedom in an age of bureaucracy; the mystical animism of non-Western religions and the despiritualizing mechanisms of Western rationalism; a theory of politics that emphasized leadership and ethical responsibility and a theory of scientific inquiry that cautioned against ethical intrusions; ancient Judaism and the Torah and modern women and the erotic." Mr. Diggins does not try to impose on all this more tidiness than it will bear. The attentive reader will find most of the main incidents of Weber's life here, and some interesting and perceptive commentary on most of the topics listed above. But the originality of the book lies in its larger, underlying purpose. That purpose is an essentially uncomfortable one. It is to get readers to take Weber's distaste for the brashness, vulgarity and general foolishness of modern democratic societies as seriously as he, John Patrick Diggins, takes it. In that he is rather successful, not in showing that Weber's distaste was right, but in demonstrating that Weber made a case that needs to be answered -- and today, surely, more urgently than ever.

HEADLINE: When Hospitals Merge, Giant Corporations Are Sure to Follow

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The City Gets Bigger, Better Hospitals" (editorial, July 30) contains insupportable assumptions about the benefits that will accrue to New Yorkers as a result of the merger frenzy of academic medical centers.
Your notion that a merged Presbyterian-New York Hospital will gain competitive strength through its combining of the "regions" of the Upper East Side and Upper West Side ignores the reality that its Upper East Side "region" must now be shared with a merged Mount Sinai-New York University, which in turn has to share the center East Side "region" with a merged Beth Israel-Long Island Jewish Medical Center. 
 The result, advocates worry, will be fierce competition for "covered lives" resulting in layoffs of thousands of skilled medical and support personnel and a frightening erosion of quality standards.
After vulnerable hospitals serving the poor are forced to close because they cannot compete, after our Mayor squeezes the life out of our public hospitals, who will take care of the poor and uninsured? When surviving medical centers discover that there is no merger magic bullet that insures their longer-term economic viability -- what next?
It just might be that super corporations -- like the Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corporation or U.S. Healthcare and the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, which are merging -- will charge in to the rescue.
Will we find ourselves with two or three gigantic health care organizations insuring and caring for New York? If I remember my high school economics, that's monopoly, or at least oligopoly, and the antithesis of competition. The sick will then be totally dependent on corporate giants, accountable to no one but their shareholders. That is bad public policy.

THE COMING AMERICAN RENAISSANCE
How to Benefit From America's Economic Resurgence
By Michael Moynihan
319 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23.
Despite its get-rich-sounding title, Michael Moynihan's new book is far from one of those gimmicks that promise to earn you a fortune based on some hitherto undetected correspondence between common stocks and tree toads. 
 Instead, Mr. Moynihan's study is an analysis of the prospects of our economy as sober and serious as his credentials are weighty. Which is saying something, given that he is a senior policy adviser in the United States Department of the Treasury, as well as a former World Bank consultant and senior technology adviser for the Federal Department of Commerce.
That the seriousness of his book comes as a surprise may be partly a reaction to its subtitle, "How to Benefit From America's Economic Resurgence." Yet this appears to have been added as the publisher's afterthought. Any promises of advice are vaguely fulfilled, and only in the form of predictions about what sections of the country will prosper and what sorts of businesses are likely to do well.
A better explanation for our shock at Mr. Moynihan's optimism would be the pessimism provoked by the recent past that has turned us, in his words, into "a nation of Eeyores." As he elaborates, "Like Winnie the Pooh's pessimistic companion, we view every cloud as a sign of rain and every pot of honey as beyond our reach."
Good reasons exist for this outlook, Mr. Moynihan concedes. Although the era after World War II was a "golden" one for the United States, certain shocks in the 1970's and 80's served to undermine our economic confidence. These culminated in the Reagan years, which Mr. Moynihan calls "the largest Keynesian experiment in history."
During this time, Mr. Moynihan says, three developments fueled America's pessimism. First, "the military buildup created a huge Federal debt and debt service bill that linger to this day and continue to dampen people's spirits and consume their taxes." Second, "an exchange rate flip-flop boosted imports and eviscerated America's export sector, creating a series of trade deficits." He continues, "This same flip-flop then enabled foreign investors to buy up significant portions of the U.S. economy." And third, "Competition from Japan and Asia caught American industry by surprise."
These developments produced a fear that "Americans were going to have to adjust to competition from developing countries and, some worried, work as hard and for as little as people there."
But these were "one-time events," Mr. Moynihan argues. In response, the economy changed direction and set itself on course for a more promising future. And the country had certain advantages -- like its size, its unsettled spaces, the mobility of its growing population, the world dominance of its language and culture, the widespread use of its computer software and the advanced development of its information networks -- that would allow it to "thrive and prosper over the next quarter-century, a period that will become, doomsayers to the contrary, an American renaissance."
What is further surprising about Mr. Moynihan's analysis is the number of areas in which he sees honey where others see clouds. For instance, he argues that some of the biggest political issues of recent years are "chimerical," since the Federal deficit, the Federal debt, taxes, social expenditure and the rate of inflation are now all "relatively low." (To illustrate just one of these points, he writes, "The current U.S. deficit is half the size of deficits during the Ford Administration and one-eighteenth the size of the deficit after World War II.")
He argues that the corporate downsizing of recent years has actually been beneficial. On the one hand, it has produced more streamlined companies better able to compete, and, on the other hand, most of the people laid off have either gone to work for smaller companies or started small businesses of their own. Both of these developments have sped the way to what Mr. Moynihan foresees as the more dynamic, adaptable economy of the future. He even insists that the Social Security system is going to stay healthy, thereby countering the pessimism of his uncle, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
The author's bouncy hopefulness may not convert every Eeyore into a Tigger. Some readers will argue that Mr. Moynihan hasn't fully acknowledged the environmental problems that will inevitably be created by a growing population building bigger homes and driving more cars in the diminishing free space that remains on the North American continent. Others might simply point out that no time in human history, no matter how renascent, has proved as rosy-colored as Mr. Moynihan foresees our future. And still others might dispute his assertion that America once again makes the best cars in the world.
All the same, his views effectively rebut the various doomsday books he cites in his Introduction, particularly Clyde Prestowitz's "Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take the Lead"; Lester Thurow's "Head to Head," which predicted that a unified Europe would soon wrest dominance of the world economy from the United States, and Paul Kennedy's books "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" and "Preparing for the 21st Century."
In the latter work, Mr. Kennedy, the Yale historian, based his pessimistic view of the future on the Malthusian grounds that the world's resources are running out. Mr. Moynihan counters this outlook by pointing to the new electronic frontier of cyberspace. His enthusiasm for its potential might excite even Frederick Jackson Turner, the historian famous for his theories on the significance of the frontier in American history.
"Like previous frontiers," Mr. Moynihan writes, "it's a blank canvas on which entrepreneurs seeking profits and others seeking less clear-cut goals from religious salvation to political revolution will paint their destinies and the future."
Now all we have to do is fence off our electronic homesteads and start rounding up our cybercattle. There's virtual gold in them thar hills!

HEADLINE: A Battlefield Topped With Felt;
Casino Mogul Helps Mohegans Renew an Old Rivalry

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: UNCASVILLE, Conn., Aug. 2

 BODY:
Clad in buckskin and feathers, Mohegan Indians danced to a booming drumbeat. Their chief sprinkled tobacco on the ground in a ritual tribute to the spirits and then joined tribe members in smoking an ancient pipe on the graves of their ancestors.
"The dying days are done," declared Jayne Fawcett, the vice chairwoman of the 1,100-member tribe. "The cycle of life has begun anew." 
 The celebration that day in November was for the start of a $275 million project to transform an eastern Connecticut factory where nuclear reactor components were built into a glitzy casino, the Mohegan Sun Resort, which will open in October. After years of struggle, the tribe that James Fenimore Cooper eulogized in "The Last of the Mohicans" was experiencing a stunning renaissance.
And it came about through an unusual partnership between the tribe and an international gambling mogul, Solomon Kerzner, sometimes referred to as the South African Donald Trump, who began looking to move into the American gambling market more than a decade ago and now appears to have found his opening.
The opportunity is not without risks. On one hand, the Mohegans will tap into a $2 billion New England gambling market with a casino that is just 2 hours and 20 minutes from New York City by car. But that market is already being served by a casino only 10 miles away, Foxwoods, which is owned by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and is the nation's most profitable gambling venture. It is expected to be a fierce rival.
To compete with Foxwoods and build a casino that could stand with the new generation of Las Vegas and Atlantic City extravaganzas, the Mohegans say they needed the financial resources and the know-how of Mr. Kerzner, whose family trust alone is valued at $750 million and whose company, Sun International, operates 32 casinos in Africa, the Bahamas and Europe. Although some critics say the Mohegans have given him too much -- he and his partners will get as much as 40 percent of the casino's profits over the next seven years -- the Mohegans insist he is worth every penny.
They point to Mr. Kerzner's record. Sun City, a resort that opened in the Bophuthatswana homeland outside Johannesburg in the early 1980's, was South Africa's answer to Las Vegas, with stars like Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli playing to crowds in a 6,000-seat arena. A few years ago, he built an addition known as the Lost City, a fantastical invention of a lost water-loving civilization that includes a miniature ocean for surfing, a nightly volcanic eruption and a golf course with live crocodiles near the 13th hole.
It is this panache that Mr. Kerzner says he is bringing to the rolling hills of eastern Connecticut, where he hopes to capitalize on the history of the Mohegans, the "Wolf People."
The new casino is intended to be a Disney-like monument to a tribe that is said to have lived centuries ago without money or private property. It will be in the shape of a giant wigwam with a river running through the food court, faux animal skins hanging from the rafters and slot machine games like "Cash Canoe" and "Mohegan Money Tree."
An indoor forest is being built out of logs, steel and aluminum beams. A replica of a sacred cliff, where the great sachem Uncas is said to have leaped across a river, is being created in fiberglass. The "makiawisug," the little people who the Mohegans believe walk between the natural and spiritual worlds, will somehow be incorporated.
"Every aspect of its design will connect to Mohegan," Ms. Fawcett said.

A Generous Deal Raises Questions
Still, the project has raised questions among those who regulate and follow Indian gambling.
Since 1988, when Congress authorized gambling on Indian reservations and established a National Indian Gaming Commission to regulate it, about 130 tribes have opened casinos. The Mohegan contract with Trading Cove Associates, the partnership that includes Mr. Kerzner, was by far the largest deal to have come before the commission.
Although Foxwoods and perhaps two or three other Indian casinos are physically larger, those did not require commission scrutiny because they are operated by tribes or their employees, not a non-Indian contractor.
The commission officially approved the deal last September, but the chairman, Harold Monteau, had to exercise his power to overrule the two other commissioners, who said it needed further review.
In a memorandum to Mr. Monteau, the two dissenters, Jana McKeag and Tom Foley, argued that the commission had not conducted a comprehensive background check of Mr. Kerzner, who has been accused of allowing a $600,000 bribe to be paid in 1986 to the leader of Transkei, a South African homeland, so a company he owned an interest in could maintain a gambling monopoly.
While Mr. Kerzner has acknowledged that a payment was made, he and others said it was extortion on the part of the Transkei leader. An investigator hired by the Mohegans, Francis M. Mullen, a former head of criminal investigations at the F.B.I. and former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, cleared Mr. Kerzner. A Connecticut State Police investigation also found him fit to be licensed here, echoing the decisions of gambling authorities in the Bahamas and France.
Perhaps more important was the commissioners' criticism that the contract was too generous to Trading Cove Associates. While independent operators are allowed to have seven-year contracts and receive up to 40 percent of an Indian casino's profits, as Mr. Kerzner has, such deals are supposed to be allowed only in unusual circumstances; the law sets a standard deal at five years and 30 percent.
The two commissioners concluded that the Trading Cove contract could not be justified, and Ms. McKeag called it a "crummy deal."
But others in the industry disagree. Tom Brosig, executive vice president of Grand Casinos, which manages four Indian casinos, said all his company's Indian casinos had seven-year contracts with 40 percent returns. He said any contractor who had helped to raise $275 million clearly was taking some risk and should expect a sizable return.
"It's not unreasonable," he said.
The Mohegans brushed aside the idea that their partners might be getting a windfall.
"If they're getting $600 million, that means we make $1 billion," said Roland J. Harris, the tribe's chairman. "Someone's going to criticize me for making $1 billion?"
Yet the Mohegans' loyalty to their partners has other roots. In 1992, the tribe's 14-year effort to win Federal recognition and reclaim its reservation faced substantial hurdles. The Federal Government had rejected the application three years earlier.
It was Len Wolman, a hotel developer who joined with others to establish Trading Cove Associates, who approached the Mohegans and pledged his group's help in winning Federal recognition for the tribe in return for being able to manage a future casino.
The deal was sealed with a handshake, Mr. Wolman said, and over the next three years, Trading Cove spent $10 million in the tribe's efforts to win Federal recognition and gain approval for the casino.
"They stood by us," Mr. Harris said. "We'll stand by them."
Mr. Wolman, a South African emigre distantly related by marriage to Mr. Kerzner, brought Mr. Kerzner into the deal when it became apparent that they needed a major player in the gambling industry. Mr. Kerzner's reputation let the Mohegans go to Wall Street and raise $175 million in a bond sale, the first time such financing had been available to an Indian casino start-up.
With Foxwoods so close, Mr. Harris noted, the Mohegans could not afford to do as the Pequots did and build their operation in stages, financing it with gaming revenues.
"We have to open with a big flash just because of the company in the neighborhood," he said.

Age-Old Tensions In a Modern Form
Not surprisingly, the development of the casino in the former United Nuclear Corporation plant here has not brought the Pequots and Mohegans closer. In fact, their new rivalry echoes age-old tensions from a time when the Pequots dominated Connecticut and the Mohegans contributed to their downfall.
According to published accounts by both tribes, the Mohegans were established in the early 17th century when Uncas, a Pequot warrior, broke with the tribe's leadership. He and his followers asserted their independence, using the old clan name, Mohegan. In 1636, when the British declared war on the Pequots, the most powerful tribe in the area, Uncas joined with the colonists.
A turning point in the war occurred the next year when the English, Mohegans and another tribe burned a Pequot fort, killing 400 men, women and children. While historical records suggest that the Mohegans opposed the massacre, the event remains a bitter one for the Pequots.
"Uncas was the main reason for the rise and fall of the Pequot nation," said Joey Carter, a Mashantucket Pequot who is a spokesman for the tribe. "He was a key figure in the genocide of his own people."
He added: "There's an old saying that history has a tendency to repeat itself. And here we are again. The Pequots are again the most powerful tribe in the East, both politically and financially. We controlled trade in the 1600's, and now we're controlling a different kind of trade, worth a whole lot more."
Mr. Carter said that he harbored no grudge against the Mohegans for events of long ago, and that the Pequots wished the Mohegans well.
But at least one dispute has already erupted. Last year, the Mohegans opposed the Pequots' plan to build another casino in Bridgeport, helping to kill the proposal in the State Legislature. State regulators project that competition from the Mohegans will cut the Pequots' slot machine revenue by 8 percent, to $548 million this fiscal year from $595 million in the previous one.

New Casino Brings Economic Hope
Yet it is possible that neither side will lose. Some analysts say there are roughly 21.8 million people within a 150-mile radius of the two casinos -- 3 million more than in Atlantic City's scope -- and the market has potential to grow.
And few people in eastern Connecticut are complaining about another casino. In an area hit hard by cuts in defense contracts and military bases, there seems to be a bottomless appetite for casino jobs. So far, more than 25,000 people have applied for the 4,500 jobs at Mohegan Sun.
"That old defense-based world has crumbled," and this one is growing," said Tom Haynor, a 33-year-old electrician laid off from a defense contractor, Pratt & Whitney, who was applying for a bartending job at the new casino. "I don't know what we would do without the Indians."
The Mohegans see the casino as bringing a new era.
Over the years, the tribe had seen its hunting grounds restricted from a broad swath of the state to a reservation, Ms. Fawcett, the tribal vice chairwoman, said. Then they watched as the reservation was taken away, leaving them with only a tiny parcel where a church had been built decades earlier. The last native speaker died decades ago.
Many have taken literally the final sentence of Cooper's 1826 novel, a remark by the warrior Tamenund over the death of a fictional character, Uncas, who has little basis in historical fact. "Before the night has come, have I lived to see the last warrior of the wise race of the Mohicans," he said.
Asked whether a casino flew in the face of Mohegan tradition, Ms. Fawcett bristled and remarked that it is being built on the cove overlooking the Thames River where the tribe had once traded fish, game and pelts.
"Thirteen generations after Uncas, we're going to be conducting business once again," Ms. Fawcett said. "The times have changed and we have had to change with them to survive. It is the Mohegan way."

HEADLINE: For U.S-Japan Trade Pact, Less at Stake

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Only a few years ago major trade negotiations between Japan and the United States had an air of epic struggle about them. These were not only arguments about money, the politicians and the economists insisted, but about national economic security and dominance of the new technologies that define national power.
But as Japanese and American negotiators argued from sunrise to sunrise last week in this gracious Canadian port city about what is unquestionably one of the key technologies of the next century -- trade in the computer chips that are the heart of every computer and telecommunications system -- it was clear that the aura had ebbed. 
 All the old trappings of trade battles past were still there: Warnings that the talks were about to collapse, endless room-service caffeine, tense phone calls back to the White House and to the Japanese Prime Minister's office, as President Clinton and Ryutaro Hashimoto weighed the politics of it all. But the passion was gone, the latest sign of how rapidly economic power has shifted, not only between the United States and Japan, but between the two economic superpowers and the rest of the world.
When all the world's chips arose from clean rooms in Silicon Valley and the vast semiconductor plants dotting Japan's western coast, and when Japan's markets seemed hermetically sealed to American imports, everything seemed to ride on accords hammered out between the two governments. America's fears of its own technological decline and soaring trade deficits with Japan gave the contests a bitter political edge.
Almost all those conditions have now been reversed. The raft of new countries now becoming big players in the once-rarefied world of chip production -- South Korea, Taiwan, soon even China -- made the United States-Japan negotiations a bit like nuclear arms talks limited to Washington and Moscow. What about the Indians and the Pakistanis, the North Koreans and the Israelis?
Moreover, the fear that Japan was about to control a set of technologies that America could not afford to lose has been replaced with a confidence within American industry that at times almost borders on complacency. Several studies suggest that American companies are spending as much or more on research and development now as their Japanese competition, and yielding considerably better results.
Also, almost no one in the semiconductor business claims that protectionism remains a huge problem. Foreign manufacturers now boast a 31 percent share of the Japanese chip market -- the United States has about 20 percent -- a figure that was unimaginable when the first semiconductor accord was signed exactly a decade ago.
"We're still fighting the last trade war," one senior American semiconductor executive said after the deal was closed on Friday. Declining to let his name be used because his view is not in accord with the official position of the American semiconductor industry, he said: "Five, 10 years ago we really needed to break open the Japanese market, and the trade agreements then really worked. But today the far more complicated problem is China." Perception always trails reality, though, so "there is still a fixation on Japan as the real challenge."
Not anywhere near the fixation, however, that dominated Washington just a few years ago. In 1989, for example, Congress was denouncing a deal the Bush Administration made with Japan to help design and build a prototype fighter-jet called the FSX, based on the F-16. Critics of the plan, both Democrats and Republicans, called it another technological surrender: the Japanese, they argued, would seize the technology to build commercial airplanes to compete with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, just as they seized the technology of the fax machine to become the world's dominant producer.
Now the Japanese are ready to actually begin manufacturing the plane, and they have come back to the United States to negotiate a second deal. But those same critics were silent last week when the Pentagon quietly reached an understanding with the Japanese government to have the two countries share the production. Congress paid no attention because, with the economy strong in the United States and Japan still groggy, the threat seemed to have magically disappeared. (Japan did pick up one American secret: The price tag of the Japanese fighter project has doubled.)
Similarly, there seems to be little threat that Japanese semiconductor makers could use their market power to wipe out the competition. Even Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, who stayed up several nights running to hammer out the details, acknowledged at one point that the main American goal these days is not to fight for new territory in the Japanese market as much as it is to keep Japan from backtracking.
"It's important that Japanese companies know that you are watching," said Ms. Barshefsky, who is filling the post left vacant when Mickey Kantor became Commerce Secretary. "And it is important that they know that their own government is watching."
Ms. Barshefsky was asked by the White House this weekend to continue in an acting capacity through the end of Mr. Clinton's term, a White House spokesman said Sunday.
The agreement she signed greatly loosens the government oversight of trade flows, statistics that the Japanese dislike because Washington has used such numbers to justify unilateral sanctions in the past. Instead, the two industries will monitor trade and periodically report to their governments. Ms. Barshefsky calls this "a light touch." Other countries will be encouraged to join the accord when they promise to eliminate all tariffs on the import of foreign chips.
The potential inclusion of other nations was Japan's idea, and its self-interest was clear. For years now Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been trying to come up with alternatives to one-on-one deals with the United States -- negotiations in which Japan feels disadvantaged, not least because it is always weighing, saying no to American demands against risking the military and political alliance between the two countries. The inclusion of other countries, many that are more protectionist than Japan, is seen in Tokyo as a way of resisting American pressure to open markets too fast.
Yet the agreement reached here has its utility in a presidential campaign where trade deals are referred to in slogans -- "level playing field" or "free but fair trade" -- but are usually regarded as too arcane to talk about for long.
President Clinton can go to California this week, dine with Silicon Valley executives who have been more lukewarm to his campaign than they were in 1992, and argue that he is still engaged in defending their interests. Because there was a deal -- any deal -- Mr. Clinton's likely opponent, Bob Dole, is deprived of the chance to declare that the President let a successful 10-year-old trade deal with Japan lapse. And even Mr. Dole's argument that the trade surplus with Japan has risen under the Clinton Administration has been undercut by recent statistics, which show it declining fast.
The Japanese, meanwhile, are increasingly convinced that the pressure is off. Patrick J. Buchanan's defeat in the Republican primaries took the wind out of trade as a major issue for the campaign. Then there was President Clinton's visit to Tokyo in the spring to renew the three-decade-old security pact that underpins the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Japan took it as an indication that Mr. Clinton was backing off on three years of unrelenting trade pressure.
Japanese negotiators are intensely attuned to the mood in Washington, and they repeatedly said here that Mr. Clinton's focus on the broader security relationship showed he is eager to declare victory, not pick a fight. "These things don't help," a senior American official deeply involved in the talks here said during a break. "We don't have the leverage we once did."

HEADLINE: Open the Iraqi Oil Tap, Slightly

 BODY:
The United States has made an honorable and reasonable effort to be sure that a planned humanitarian break in the Iraqi oil embargo is not abused by Saddam Hussein, but Washington should now stand back and let the oil flow. The Clinton Administration's latest objections do not justify further delay in alleviating hunger and illness in Iraq.
After years of diplomatic stalemate, Iraq earlier this year accepted an American-sponsored plan to allow a limited resumption of Iraqi oil exports to pay for food and medicine. Some of the oil income would also finance reparations payments to the victims of Iraqi aggression and United Nations administrative costs. 
 Months of hard diplomatic bargaining since then have established basic ground rules and detailed procedures for international monitoring of oil sales and food distribution to make sure none of the funds are diverted for illegitimate purposes. Fourteen of the fifteen Security Council members are now sufficiently satisfied to allow the program to begin. But the Clinton Administration insists on an even more detailed agreement on technical aspects of the monitoring program.
A high degree of caution is appropriate in dealing with Saddam Hussein. He has demonstrated repeatedly that he still hopes to revive Iraqi military power and will exploit every loophole presented to him. But in this case, the risk of abuse has been made minimal. The United States, like every Security Council member, retains the option of halting oil sales and food deliveries the moment any evidence of misconduct appears.
The plan would not end the oil export sanctions imposed on Iraq for the past six years. That must await Iraq's full compliance with its obligations to destroy stocks of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons components and eliminate most of its missiles. Iraq must also submit to effective long-term U.N. monitoring to insure it is not secretly rearming.
The arrangement now before the United Nations represents the latest version of an idea first put forward by the Bush Administration in 1991 to make long-term economic sanctions against Iraq more humane by protecting the innocent from malnutrition and disease. It would permit Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over the next six months -- about 20 percent of its normal export level.
An initial understanding worked out between Iraq and the U.N. this spring was reasonably rejected by the United States and Britain because it allowed Iraq too much control over arrangements for banking the proceeds of oil sales and for interfering with food relief in Kurdish areas. Those problems were fixed, and for the last eight weeks Security Council members have thrashed out procedural details.
Germany's U.N. representative, who has chaired the effort to draft procedures, now expresses frustration with Washington's seemingly endless objections. At this point, the Administration seems to be more interested in looking tough on Iraq in an election year than dealing with the painful side effects of the oil embargo.
American diplomats say the problems they have raised can be worked out fairly quickly. They have already delayed too long.

HEADLINE: Buying Clothes Tax-Free for a Week, Courtesy of New York State

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
It almost has the ring of an advertising slogan, if not the power to keep New York consumers from going to New Jersey or Pennsylvania: buy clothes tax-free, courtesy of New York State.
Of course, there is a catch: the offer is good for only one week, starting Jan. 20. 
 And there is another catch: the offer covers only the 4 percent state sales tax. Shoppers in some jurisdictions may still have to pay local taxes on their purchases.
Over all, though, retailers are enthusiastic. "Anytime an opportunity presents itself where taxes can be reduced, which would in effect increase our business, we're fully in favor," said Tim Ray, a spokesman for Macy's. "It only becomes a win-win situation for our customers."
The state tax exemption, which applies to purchases of $500 and less, was part of the budget package that the State Legislature approved and Gov. George E. Pataki signed last month. The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, pushed for the weeklong exemption after a 1995 campaign to permanently eliminate the sales tax faltered in the State Senate. He sees the 4 percent levy as putting New York at a competitive disadvantage to the half-dozen nearby states that he says do not have sales taxes on clothes.
"Unfortunately, they're all on our border, if you count Rhode Island, which is on the border of Long Island Sound," Mr. Silver said. "They all impact on our sales."
But the officials from those states are not worried about the New York exemption. "It's a one-week thing," said Jayne Rebovich, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. "We have no sales tax on clothes and shoes 365 days a year."
Exactly how much New Jersey and other states draw from New York is unclear, retailers and analysts say. Mr. Silver estimated that state tax revenues would drop $10 million to $15 million for the week. But he maintained that some of the lost revenue would be offset by higher taxes from improved corporate profits resulting from increased sales during the week.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani supports the state exemption and will match it by exempting clothes from New York City's 4 percent local sales tax for the same week, said a spokeswoman for the Mayor, Deirdra Picou. She said the weeklong suspension would have to be approved by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which oversees the city's finances.
But lifting the 4 percent local tax would not make clothing purchased in the city tax-free. Shoppers currently pay an additional one-quarter of 1 percent, which goes to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "It's not clear that we have the discretion to suspend it, or if we were included in the legislation," said an M.T.A. spokesman, John Cunningham. "We're concerned about the revenue impact if we were."
If the M.T.A. decided not to rescind its tax for the week, the sales tax on a $100 purchase would fall to 25 cents, from the usual $8.25.
On Long Island, the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, favors the local exemption. But it is subject to approval by the Nassau County Legislature, which has not scheduled a vote.
"Our position is, the necessities of life should not be taxed," said David Vieser, a spokesman for Mr. Gulotta.
In Suffolk, the County Executive, Patrick J. Gaffney, has not decided whether to lift the 4 percent local sales tax or an additional one-quarter of 1 percent that pays for a drinking water protection program, said a spokesman, Rick Belyea.
The Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, has also not decided whether to suspend the local sales tax.
Mr. Silver said he believed that the weeklong exemption would provide fresh evidence that lowering sales taxes increases sales, which might in turn persuade legislators to lift the sales tax on clothing for good, starting in 1998.
But Pearl Kamer, the chief economist of the Long Island Association, a business and civic organization, said a permanent exemption would cause new financial headaches for officials already struggling with reduced Federal and state contributions to local budgets.
"County government has come to rely on revenues from the sales tax," she said. "You'd have to find another source of taxation. I don't think you could raise property taxes. They're onerous as is. And if a county imposed a personal income tax, you risk that people will vote with their feet and go to areas where there is no such tax."
Fred Kaplan, the executive director of Local 340 of the Retail Clothing and Salesmen's Union, said he doubted that dropping the sales tax for only one week would change customers' clothes-buying habits.
"Maybe I would think about buying a TV" if the exemption covered appliances, he said. "But I don't see clothing as the kind of thing where somebody's going to go out and buy clothing in January that they don't need 'til May. They're not going to go and buy a summer suit in January. I'm not even sure the retailer will have it."
Marcy Syms, president of the Syms Corporation of off-price clothing stores, fretted that the company would have to reprogram the cash registers for only one week.
"In terms of preparing for this changeover, it seems like a lot of work," she said. "And if we were really going to do something about affecting decisions by consumers, we probably should have used a week in either November or December, when you get the most activity for Christmas and holiday shopping. January tends to be a very slow month."

HEADLINE: Political Counterpunching Moves Onto the Internet

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
The first Presidential World Wide Web battle was joined Friday as Bob Dole's campaign introduced a zippy new site and accused President Clinton of being stodgy and behind the times.
Mr. Dole offers a custom home page (http://www.dole96.com) that registers you, then on future visits greets you by name, reports on your pet issues and displays graphics you have chosen. 
 President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore introduced a Clinton/Gore '96 site (http:// www.cg96.org) in July. It invites contributions to "America's Home Page," including video, audio and text submissions.
Christina M. Martin, a deputy press secretary in the Dole campaign, called the Democrats' site too static.
"For a campaign that prides itself on high technology, it needs to start thinking about tomorrow, again," she said.
Adam H. Sohn, the Clinton campaign's technology director, said: "The point of these things is to make them live and breathe with the pace of the campaign. We've got a lot more stuff to roll out."
The two sites offer a comparison of records and rhetoric. On the Dole site, there is a map that lets voters find Mr. Clinton's record in their state. In California, the Dole site asserts, the President has surrendered on drugs, dallied on crime and sapped the economy. The Clinton-Gore site's map counters that in California the Administration has delivered new jobs, stronger families and safer streets.

Dole's Song: Solid G.O.P.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
No political strategy is considered more potent by Republicans or truer to their core beliefs than promising big tax cuts.
In advocating a $548 billion tax cut, Bob Dole has seized an issue that he can use to define his differences with President Clinton, and one that opens the door to a debate over why Americans feel so insecure and overworked despite the economy's solid performance in recent years. 
 But Mr. Dole is also betting his career on being able to persuade the electorate to come down on his side of a complex and often bitter dispute: whether it is possible to slash taxes in the American political system without sending the deficit sky-high again, and if so, whether the smaller government that results will lead to faster economic growth and improved living standards.
It is not an easy dispute to follow, much less conclude, because it involves an array of questions like how much additional growth tax cuts might generate, how much human behavior is changed when economic incentives are changed and to what extent do political leaders have the desire and the will to enact deeper spending cuts than they have so far.
In assessing Mr. Dole's plan, both sides of the argument point to the 1980's, but they focus on completely different consequences of the Reagan tax cuts and draw completely different conclusions.
"In the 1980 election, the Republican Presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan, promised a tax cut, and Bob Dole led the effort to implement it," said Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, a Republican and one of the first and most influential backers of Mr. Dole's tax-cutting plan. "The result was we got the longest peacetime expansion in history."
But in an advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday, the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group led by two Republicans, former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Peter G. Peterson, who was Commerce Secretary in the Nixon Administration, and a Democrat, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, argued that a big tax cut now would be fiscally irresponsible.
"Let the 1980's be a lesson," the advertisement said. "The original supply-side concept of targeted tax cuts quickly led to a general tax cut bidding war, with both parties joining in the frenzy. This resulted in unprecedented peacetime deficits and interest costs that will be with us for years to come."
Mr. Dole's aides have long argued that he is well aware of the lessons of the Reagan era, and that Mr. Dole's long commitment to deficit reduction should give him credibility as a responsible tax-cutter.
But in outlining Mr. Dole's economic platform today, Republican officials gave only sketchy details of how Mr. Dole would pay for the tax cuts he is proposing. They said that increased economic growth resulting from his plan, which also includes reducing government regulation and overhauling the legal system, would make up about 27 percent of the cost. An additional 18 percent might come from sales of unallocated broadcast frequencies and reductions in Government administrative expenses.
The only details the party aides offered were that Mr. Dole had supported scaling back or eliminating at least four Cabinet departments and that the plan would not call for additional cuts to Medicare or Social Security. It is unclear how much more information Mr. Dole will provide when he formally presents the plan in Chicago on Monday.
Democrats are already arguing that the numbers cannot possibly add up in a way that will keep the nation on track to a balanced budget.
"He is saying that part of this is going to be paid for by growth in the economy, which again is the kind of supply-side voodoo that did not work in the 80's," Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said of Mr. Dole today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
As the Presidential campaign heats up, the varying positions of the two camps amount to a role reversal of sorts: the Democrats are talking about the importance of the bond markets and responsible fiscal policy, while the Republicans are using Mr. Dole's economic plan to appeal directly to working Americans.
As the debate over the Dole plan unfolds, the Clinton Administration has begun portraying itself as the protector of the deficit reduction the nation has enjoyed over the last several years. In part their strategy is intended to insulate them against Mr. Dole's attacks on Mr. Clinton for raising taxes in 1993. But they are also trying to draw a direct line between the reduced deficit and benefits to voters, primarily in the form of a reduction in long-term interest rates that accompanied the shrinking deficit.
"Under the guise of cutting taxes for some in the short term," Mr. Panetta said, "what we are going to wind up doing is increasing the most regressive taxes of all, which is interest on the national debt that is going to be passed on to our kids.".
Republicans said Mr. Dole's package would directly address the economic anxiety that they said had seized much of the country.
"Working families in my state say they work hard but have less to show for it at the end of the month," Mr. Abraham said. "Salaries and incomes have been flat under Clinton, but taxes have gone up. Under the Dole plan, hard-working American families could keep more of what they earn."
But beyond any immediate political appeal, the Dole plan, his advisers said, is intended to improve the nation's capacity for economic growth. A tax cutting plan could theoretically help boost the economy in two ways. If it is not accompanied by offsetting spending cuts or other revenue gains, a tax cut provides a short-term stimulus by putting more money into the economy, generating more growth for a short time but also inflation.
Mr. Dole's plan is at least partly aimed at improving the nation's capacity for noninflationary economic growth in the long run. Most economists agree that reducing the size of the government and reducing regulation, among other steps, could help make the economy more productive by freeing up capital for investment.
How fast the effects of such a policy would become evident in the economy, and how large they would be, are matters of debate among economists. And economists said that nothing in Mr. Dole's package would significantly improve the nation's growth capacity overnight.

HEADLINE: Holding Firm Over Welfare

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has often distanced himself from the conservative social policies of his fellow Republicans, but after last week's upheaval of the country's welfare landscape, he has suddenly found himself to the left of President Clinton and much of the Democratic Party on issues of welfare and immigration.
In unsuccessfully urging Mr. Clinton not to sign the welfare bill passed by Congress last week, he argued that the Federal Government was in effect shifting millions of dollars in costs to the city and state. But he also evoked a tradition of social generosity in the city and state that goes back to the great waves of immigrants in the last century, and that makes it difficult even for a budget-cutting Republican Mayor to endorse wholeheartedly the welfare retreat now under way across the country. 
 "The city of New York is really just a better place than a lot of other places in terms of caring for people and understanding the worth of human beings," Mr. Giuliani said last week, explaining why local government would inevitably have to shoulder the burden that Washington has now dropped.
To be sure, the Mayor is hardly an advocate for the welfare state. He has removed 155,000 people from the welfare rolls since taking office and has forced thousands of others to be finger-imaged, or electronically fingerprinted, and to work for their benefits. He has advocated the wholesale abolition of the joint state and city Home Relief program, which provides assistance mostly to childless, able-bodied adults; barring that, he has said, he favors a 90-day time limit on benefits. Last year, he noted that the combined effects of state and city welfare cutbacks could prompt many recipients to move out of the state, though he stopped just short of saying that would be a good thing.
Nonetheless, Mr. Giuliani has made it clear that he will not follow the President all the way to welfare's new terrain, and his opposition seems to grow from the nature of governing the nation's largest city, the one with the highest population of welfare recipients.
On a political level, his opposition to the bill may play well in next year's election among those Democratic voters who support social programs and have otherwise been critical of some of his actions. On a financial level, the city does not have the necessary money to pick up the new burden. And on a historical level, he can assert that the bill's severity violates the city's tradition of embracing immigrants and supporting the needy.
"The instinct for generosity and taking care of people began in New York State, and it is still strongest here," said former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who added that the state was one of the few in America to enshrine that principle in its Constitution. "There are more people clustered here, in a smaller space, and the intensity of the need is so much greater," he said.
That tradition began around the turn of the century, when the Tammany Hall machine won the loyalty of its immigrant working-class constituency with generous helpings of public relief. It continued through the Depression, said Frances Fox Piven, a professor of political science and sociology at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, through the support of labor unions and leaders like Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia.
In recent years, the tradition has begun to erode somewhat, although not as fast as elsewhere. Even before the new Federal bill, Mayor Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Democratic leadership in the State Assembly had come out in favor of time limits of some sort on public assistance, though political differences kept any from being approved.
The Mayor and the Governor favor reducing the size of the state's welfare grant, a proposal that the Democrats killed. And thousands of people in New York City, Westchester and Suffolk Counties are now working for local governments in exchange for their benefits.
When the details of the Congressional bill emerged last week, the Governor said he was pleased with the time limit and workfare provisions, expressing some disagreement only with the decision to cut off many legal immigrants from food stamps and some other benefits. He said he may call a special session of the State Legislature to wrestle with Albany's new welfare responsibilities.
With Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato supporting the bill, the loudest voices against the bill in the state became those of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- who said the effect on New York would be "apocalyptic" -- and the Mayor, who used somewhat less florid language to say the same thing.
But even some of those who have differed sharply with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki in their attempts to reduce welfare's benefits believe New York State will remain more generous than other states when the time comes to assume the responsibility passed on by the Federal Government.
True, the state's monthly welfare grant of $577 hardly seems generous in light of the area's high cost of living, and the size of the grant has gone up only three times since the 1970's, falling far behind inflation. But only four states have a higher monthly benefit, and at least for the time being, the state is considered likely to maintain that relative position. The state has not cut its benefit or dropped its Home Relief program the way other states have, and New York's constitutional protection for the needy may prevent the impoverishment of many legal immigrants that is predicted in many other states.
"I think there is a commitment among a substantial part of the people of New York to maintain some basic level of decency for their neighbors," said Henry Freedman, executive director of the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law, a Manhattan-based organization that assists lawyers for welfare recipients. "The reason is that they understand the consequences of the social disaster that would otherwise result."
Those consequences, Mr. Cuomo said, include the prospect of more families living on the street, more people committing crimes, more people in public hospital beds, more AIDS cases, more domestic violence -- "more of all of the things that abject poverty brings," he said.
It remains unclear, however, just how the city and the state will be able to sustain their generosity in light of fiscal pressures that were enormous even before passage of the bill, which local officials say will add hundreds of millions to their annual welfare costs. Earlier this year, for example, Mr. Pataki, with Mr. Giuliani's approval, proposed reducing the monthly benefit for a one-parent family with two children to $424 from $577, a 26 percent cut that would match New Jersey's level. The idea was quickly blocked by the Democrats in the State Assembly, continuing the party's tradition as a defender of the social safety net.
But now, even the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, acknowledges that time limits on benefits have become a reality, both for the main welfare program for families and for the state's Home Relief program. With the state about to pay a much larger share of the costs, welfare advocates fear that the spirit of generosity may be difficult to afford.
"I don't see how they can sustain it indefinitely," Ms. Piven, the professor, said. "The financial pressure may now be too intense."

HEADLINE: Despite Flawed Form, Atlanta Claims a Victory

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 4

 BODY:
It began as a real estate lawyer's goofy pipe dream, turned into unlikely reality and for the last two weeks veered between triumph and nightmare, the inspirational and the tawdry.
But when the Olympics ended today with marathoners racing through streets packed with cheering spectators, Centennial Olympic Park jammed and the main stadium filled with exultant participants for the extravaganza of the closing ceremonies, for most people here, Billy Payne's folly had paid off for Atlanta. 
 Despite a fatal pipe bomb and rampant commercialization that drew protests from international Olympics officials and derision from many journalists, experts say spending for the Olympics and by visitors gave the area a boost of $4 to $5 billion. The Games left Atlanta with new stadiums, downtown improvements and transportation projects, a higher -- if not entirely flattering -- international profile, and perhaps a newfound drive to address its substantial urban ills.
Experts disagree about how big the payoff will be, especially given the lack of long-term gains from other Olympics, like the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
Others question whether Atlanta did enough to use the Games to help the poor in a city that is 67 percent black and one with the fifth highest poverty rate among nation's large cities.
But few doubt the Games worked economically, providing a remarkable pageant of interracial unity in a nation racked by racial division, and instead of the world-class headache a lot of people here expected, they proved to be a giddy party few people here will ever forget.
"People ask me now, knowing the good and bad that went on, would Atlanta still want the Games," said Donald Ratajczak, an economist here at Georgia State University, and one of the more skeptical economists who have followed these Games. "Well, if you ask people in Atlanta, 90 percent of them would say yes."
"I think there's a general agreement," Mr. Ratajczak said, "that in the end, we won."
Some benefits of the Games, brought to Atlanta largely by the efforts of the Olympic chairmen, Mr. Payne, a suburban real estate lawyer, and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, are clear.
As a result of the Games, Atlanta ended up with the 21-acre Centennial Olympic Park, the largest urban park built in America in 25 years. It is viewed as the centerpiece for the development of what had been an eyesore and what is likely now to become a new focus for downtown Atlanta. The Olympic Village, will become student housing for Georgia State University. The Olympic Stadium becomes the new home of the Atlanta Braves, guaranteeing they will stay downtown instead of leaving for the suburbs.
In all, eight permanent competition sites were built with private money by Olympic organizers and turned over without charge to local universities and public bodies. The Games spurred or accelerated $2 billion in publicly financed transportation projects, including $700 million in improvements to Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. These construction projects and other spending helped Atlanta sail through the national recession with no downturn. And they led to new municipal art, improved streets and maintenance projects that radically improved the look of downtown.
Some say that those improvements, rather than the immediate spending by visitors, were the real payoff of the Games.
"The Games allowed Atlanta to solve a lot of problems pretty inexpensively, without a lot of political bloodletting, in ways that lots of other cities are really having to confront now in a very serious fashion," said Thomas J. Cunningham, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta.
What the Games did for Atlanta's image is less clear. The European press in particular was merciless for the first week in depicting Atlanta's handling of the Games as incompetent and its staging as like a flea market. The commercialization was so omnipresent that Olympic officials have vowed they will never again mount the Games as Atlanta did with virtually all money raised from private sources.
But many economists and business experts say that what are likely to be far more lasting are the upbeat televised images and the sense of Atlanta's arrival as a major city.
"I think three months out all that will remain will be a very positive statement about Atlanta and the South as an area on the upswing, which is why you see so much international business here already," said Helmut Panke, chairman of the American arm of BMW, the German car maker, which built its new American factory in Greer, S.C.
The short-term gains, though, may also be mixed. After a very slow first week outside the downtown area, many major restaurants and malls reported extremely strong business during the Games' second week, and this weekend local malls were full of athletes, coaches and dignitaries from around the world taking part in Atlanta's usual favorite sport -- shopping.
On the other hand, hundreds of small vendors, particularly those relegated to side streets outside the main crush downtown, suffered substantial losses. Businesses in areas like Auburn Avenue, the historic heart of Atlanta's black community, found that the Olympic gains they had anticipated were nonexistent.
"There are more people here visiting this area on an average summer day than what we've seen during the Olympics," said Lanard Collins, executive director of the Sweet Auburn Improvement Association.
Similarly, the Olympics fell far short of the most rosy expectations of new housing for the poor and other neighborhood improvements that some expected in 1990, when Atlanta won its bid to hold the Games. But, by their finale, even most of the harshest critics said that they had done some good for neighborhoods, that blacks as well as whites had shared in the prosperity and that the Games left behind a warm glow with the potential to continue the Olympic development.
Olympic proponents say that whether the momentum continues will be the real test of the long-term impact.
"The question is whether we can continue to use the energy churned up by the Olympics for economic and community development," said Johnnetta B. Cole, president of historically black Spelman College here. "I say we must, and we can."
In fact, Atlanta's urban ills were lost in the hoopla of the Games, but they did not go away. The police reported 23 homicides since the Games began on July 19, or nearly three every two days, in a city that averages about one homicide every two days, or 160 to 180 a year. And some experts note that there are risks as well as rewards in raising expectations.
"Los Angeles put on a successful Olympics, and 10 years later they had their terrible riots," said Arthur Naparstek, a senior associate at the Urban Institute in Washington. "I'm not saying there is a cause and effect there, but when you create expectations and those expectations are not met, you can create bitter disappointment, and I think that's the challenge for Atlanta now."
But one thing is beyond any doubt. People here loved the Games as spectacle, as street party and as a civic manifesto.
Despite the picture that sometimes emerged of Atlanta as a city of quick-buck hucksters, it also takes seriously its own civil rights legacy, its history of overcoming adversity and its sense of being at the heart of a renascent South.
The civic drama that went on, from the multiracial nature of Atlanta's Games to the emotional reopening of Centennial Olympic Park after the bombing that killed an Albany, Ga., woman and left 110 injured, spoke to many here to the best parts of Atlanta's character.
"The Games exceeded my expectations on every level," said Mayor Bill Campbell. "The crowds were larger, the athletes performed better, our city responded to tragedy in a way that was perhaps the most emotional point of the games. It's not accidental that our symbol is the Phoenix, a bird rising from the ashes."
The tens of thousands of local people who flocked to the park on the Games' final day had much the same feeling.
"I used to park down here back when this was parking lot gulch where the winos hung out," said Hugh Woodall, a local lawyer, after he and his 7-year-old son, Zach, doused themselves in the Centennial Olympic Park fountain. "Now look at it. I never thought I'd see the day."
He paused a moment and then said what most people here, however exhausted, were thinking today.
"I wish it could keep going on."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE STRATEGY;
DOLE TO ADVOCATE 15% CUT IN TAXES, HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
After weeks of debate among his advisers, Bob Dole has settled on the economic and political foundation of his Presidential campaign -- a $548 billion tax-cut package highlighted by a 15 percent reduction in individual income tax rates and a halving of the capital gains tax, campaign officials said today.
Mr. Dole plans to go to Chicago on Monday to present the package, which his aides described today as the single-most critical component to reviving his fortunes against President Clinton. 
 Mr. Dole will call for a 15 percent across-the-board reduction in personal income tax rates, starting in 1997 and spread over three years. He will also advocate cutting the capital gains tax to 14 percent, from 28 percent; endorse a Republican Congressional proposal to provide a $500-a-child tax credit for families, and call for increasing the allowable contribution to Individual Retirement Accounts by nonworking spouses.
He will also support repealing the Clinton Administration's 1993 tax increase on upper-level Social Security benefits.
Aides to Mr. Dole offered only sketchy details today on how he would pay for the package. But the aides said $145 billion, or about 27 percent, of the cost of the tax cuts would be covered by new revenue created by the economic growth resulting from the cuts -- a figure that the aides put at the conservative end of estimates by economists.
With this decision -- which forced Mr. Dole to wrestle with competing Republican factions over how he should approach both the economy and his campaign -- he has settled on the most politically aggressive and clear-cut of the economic plans that were presented to him.
In advocating a comparatively simple across-the-board tax cut, Mr. Dole is adopting a political strategy that has become a steadfast element of national Republican campaigns since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. A similar pledge was at the heart of Christine Todd Whitman's successful campaign against Gov. Jim Florio in New Jersey in 1994.
"Dole needed a wedge issue where he could draw an unambiguous distinction between him and Clinton," said Bruce R. Bartlett, a former Treasury official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations who was among the first to suggest the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut.
"The challenge to Dole is to convince the American people he means it and will do his best to see it enacted if elected. One of the biggest problems he's got to overcome is the feeling among the American people that politicians always promise candy at Christmas and don't deliver."
The Dole campaign was keenly aware that the plan carried not only political promise but also high political risk. The prolonged debate seesawed through Saturday afternoon, when Mr. Dole finally signed off on the 15 percent plan.
During 35 years in Congress, Mr. Dole framed his political career as an advocate of reducing the deficit. He has been among his party's most caustic critics of supply-side economics, which asserts that tax cuts produce enough economic growth to offset losses in tax revenues.
Even as Mr. Dole was weighing an across-the-board tax cut against rolling back the 1993 tax increase, an approach that other advisers had urged, Mr. Clinton's re-election team was distributing to reporters quotations in which Mr. Dole disparaged supply-side economics.
The effort by Mr. Clinton's campaign was intended to rattle Mr. Dole, but the White House's intense concern with the issue suggests nervousness in Mr. Clinton's camp over an issue that has historically proven highly effective for Republicans.
The President is particularly vulnerable on this issue, in the view of Mr. Dole's aides, because Mr. Clinton ran in 1992 on the promise of pushing a middle-class tax cut and, after taking office, abandoned that pledge to instead push for measures to close the budget deficit. In fact, he pushed through an increase in taxes over the objections of Republicans.
Joe Lockhart, the Clinton campaign spokesman, said of Mr. Dole's plan, "It appears Bob Dole is taking the political route that will balloon the deficit, hurt long-term economic growth and destroy his own credibility -- all in one speech."
The tax cut plan is part of an overall economic growth program that is titled "Restoring the American Dream: The Dole Plan for Economic Growth." It also calls for reducing Federal regulations, a staple for Mr. Dole on the campaign trail, and adopting Republican legislation, vetoed by Mr. Clinton, to change the way civil lawsuits are handled by the courts. Mr. Dole's aides argue that this change would improve the nation's business climate.
The tax cuts, though, are the heart of the plan. Mr. Dole will call for a 15 percent reduction in existing tax rates -- 5 percent a year -- starting in 1997. His aides said that would affect about 90 million taxpayers. Tax rates now vary, depending on income, from 15 percent to 39.6 percent. Under Mr. Dole's plan, each of those rates would be cut 15 percent.
Under the Dole plan, taxpayers paying the bottom rate of 15 percent in Federal income taxes would see their rate fall to 12.75 percent. Those paying a rate on their last dollar earned of 28 percent would have their rate go down to 23.8 percent. Those paying 31 percent now would pay 26.35 percent under the Dole plan, with the current 36 percent bracket declining to 30.6 percent and the 39.6 percent bracket falling to 33.66 percent.
Significantly, Mr. Dole did not embrace the position of a former rival for the Republican Presidential nomination and now an economic adviser, Steve Forbes, for a single flat-tax system.
Aides to Mr. Dole said he would instead promise to work toward simplifying the tax system. Mr. Forbes, who based his entire campaign for the nomination on a call for a flat tax, is scheduled to travel with Mr. Dole to Chicago.
Although Mr. Dole has frequently called for sharp restrictions on the power of the Internal Revenue Service, his plan stops short of that. Instead, it calls for ending filing requirements for about 40 million low- and middle-income taxpayers, on the assumption that the agency would be able to adjust automatic withholding so that it is accurate enough that there is no reason for a taxpayer to file a form.
A large part of the cost of the plan would be covered by what economists call feedback, or the amount of increased tax revenue created by the tax cut. In this case, the figure is about 27 percent, or $145 billion. Mr. Dole would also raise $37 billion with the sale of unallocated broadcast frequencies, and $60 billion with a 10 percent cut in administrative cuts in non-military programs.
Even before Mr. Dole settled on his plan, it was clear that the brunt of the attacks would be on his decision to impose a deep tax cut. On the CBS News program "Face the Nation" today, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, reprised President George Bush's famous reference to supply economics in a preview of the tone to come from Democrats.
"This is Deja Voodoo II," Mr. Daschle said. "This is a revisit back to the early 1980's, three trillion dollars of debt later. I am amazed that after all of the speeches Bob Dole has given on balancing the budget, he'd do it again."
A Dole aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said this evening that the plan's projections were conservative enough to refute that argument.
"This is not wild-eyed supply-siders saying that we are going to get a dollar back for every dollar in taxes that we cut," the aide said. "This is a very moderate, even conservative, analysis of what will be returned in revenue after a significant reformation in the economy."
Donald H. Rumsfeld, a senior adviser to Mr. Dole, said the entire economic plan -- and not just the cut in taxes -- would produce a change in the economic climate that would produce more growth and revenue. Mr. Rumsfeld said the country had been suffering under "puny and anemic growth."
"People do behave differently when their taxes are reduced," he told reporters outside Mr. Dole's headquarters here. "People do behave differently when regulations are reduced. People do behave differently to the extent litigation stops being a burden."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: MICHIGAN;
G.O.P. Storms Rumble in a Primary

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 4

 BODY:
A nasty Senate primary race in Michigan is echoing the likely divisions at next week's Republican National Convention in San Diego, as the Republican Party has split deeply on abortion and economic policy lines here.
A populist candidate, Ronna E. Romney, is struggling to retain an early lead. She has called for a Federal ban on most abortions, the legalization of semiautomatic weapons, the elimination of corporate tax breaks and a review of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 The state's business and political elite has rallied around her rival, Jim Nicholson, a wealthy Detroit businessman who has been a strong supporter of Dennis Archer, the city's mayor and a moderate Democrat. Mr. Nicholson has argued that Federal and state governments should neither restrict nor pay for abortion. He has also favored lower trade barriers, an end to corporate subsidies and the repeal of taxes on capital gains and inheritances.
A former talk radio host who lost the 1994 Republican primary to Senator Spencer Abraham, Mrs. Romney started the race with polls showing that she had more than twice as much support as Mr. Nicholson, who had never sought public office before. But Mr. Nicholson has virtually erased her lead, moving to within several percentage points of her in the latest polls. He has used a lavish campaign of television advertisements, often negative, during the Olympics.
"It's a complete tossup now," said Edward V. Sarpolus, a pollster in Lansing, Mich. He added that whoever wins the Republican primary on Tuesday would have a hard time beating Senator Carl Levin, who is seeking a fourth term and is running unopposed in the Democratic primary.
According to the most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Nicholson had raised $1.3 million from campaign contributors by July 17 and put in $1.2 million of his own money. Mrs. Romney has raised half as much money from contributors and has put in little of her own, forcing her to rely more on less costly radio advertisements.
Both sides' ads have grown nastier as the primary approaches. Mr. Nicholson's ads have questioned whether Mrs. Romney deserves to bear the surname of George W. Romney, a popular Governor of Michigan who died last year. Mrs. Romney is divorced from one of the late Governor's two sons, G. Scott Romney. She has not remarried and uses the honorific "Mrs."
Mrs. Romney has retaliated with radio advertisements criticizing Mr. Nicholson for allowing his disabled brother to live in a federally subsidized group home, instead of using a family trust estimated at $1.8 million. While the Nicholson family's 400-employee chemical company has kept its headquarters in Detroit's inner city and has actively supported neighborhood social projects, Mr. Nicholson has also been more emphatic than Mrs. Romney in favor of limiting the time that anyone can collect welfare benefits, arguing that the current system creates a culture of dependence.
In separate interviews, Mr. Nicholson and Mrs. Romney each dismissed the other's personal criticisms as inappropriate invasions of their families' privacy.
Lacking the financial resources of her opponent, Mrs. Romney has relied heavily on support from Right to Life of Michigan, one of the most powerful groups in Republican politics statewide. Like the anti-abortion group, Mrs. Romney contends that abortions should be allowed only when necessary to save the mother's life.
Right to Life of Michigan did not take a position in the 1994 primary, when Senator Abraham also favored restrictions on abortions. But the group has been mailing pamphlets to its members, printing yard signs and bumper stickers and taking out radio advertisements this year to help Mrs. Romney. Barbara A. Listing, the group's president, said that its only previous radio advertisements for a candidate were in 1990, when the anti-abortion group helped Gov. John Engler win his first term.
Mrs. Romney has also won the support of the National Rifle Association. While Mr. Nicholson has also come out for the repeal of the Federal ban on assault weapons, Mrs. Romney has been more outspoken in contending that Americans should not blame guns for the violence in society.
"More is done with fists, feet and knives," Mrs. Romney said in a telephone interview from western Michigan, where she is campaigning. Polls have shown that Mr. Nicholson leads in the Detroit area, and among younger, more moderate voters, while Mrs. Romney is ahead in the rest of the state, particularly among older, more conservative voters.

HEADLINE: Provincetown Journal;
Resort Where Lesbians Can Feel Right at Home

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: PROVINCETOWN, Mass. July 30

 BODY:
The Pilgrims, seeking shelter from a treacherous storm, landed here aboard the Mayflower in 1620. Three hundred seventy five years later -- after the whalers, the traders, and the Portuguese fishermen, after the famous artists and writers like Edward Hopper and Eugene O'Neill, and after the gay men -- Ann Maguire and her longtime partner, Harriet Gordon, arrived from Boston.
"Here come the women!" said Ms. Gordon, who left her job as a deputy director of a homeless shelter to run an inn here with Ms. Maguire, who had been the campaign manager for Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, and his chief of health and human services. Ms. Gordon, the 51-year-old mother of two grown children, smiled. "But we're not going to exclude the men." 
 This constantly evolving town at the tip of Cape Cod, surrounded by the sea, has long been an oasis for gay men. Now, in its latest incarnation, it is home to a growing number of gay women.
The women say that AIDS, which has killed dozens of men in Provincetown, is partly responsible for their increasing visibility and influence. The other reason is economic. Earning power has increased for many women, especially professionals in their late 30's, 40's and 50's, like the women who now find themselves able to afford Provincetown's escalating real estate prices.
Women are buying houses and businesses, and opening restaurants. Where once there were five inns run by women, today there are 15. What began as an annual women's weekend in October 12 years ago now lasts a week. More than 7,000 women from around the country gather for events that include a prom, community dinner and golf tournament run by Ms. Maguire, a devoted golfer.
Ms. Gordon and Ms. Maguire moved to Provincetown for all the things that have always drawn people here -- the sea, the dunes, the spectacular sunsets, the art galleries, the lush gardens, the laid-back friendliness. And Provincetown, they say, is the one place where, while gay women are still a minority, they feel absolutely comfortable, and safe.
"I can sit in a restaurant and hold Ann's hand," said Ms. Gordon, who was talking with Ms. Maguire over coffee and muffins the other morning at their inn beside the bay, the popular Hargood House. "I don't have to think about it."
Two middle-aged women holding hands does not rate a second glance in Provincetown, where men in evening dresses and high heels promenade along Commercial Street. Everyone holds hands on Commercial Street: young women in Doc Martens and Lesbian Power T-shirts, mothers pushing babies in strollers, white-haired grandmothers; men in jeans and T-shirts, men in bikinis; men and women.
In Boston, a prominent woman who is gay is considered remarkable. "When I was appointed director of neighborhood services," said Ms. Maguire, who worked for former Mayor Raymond Flynn as well as Mayor Menino, "the media always made reference to the fact that I was a lesbian." In Provincetown, she said, "it's no big deal."
"You never feel you're in the minority," added Ms. Maguire, who is 53. "We're in the fabric of the community. We're in the A & P, the banks, the town committees."
Ms. Maguire is head of the local housing authority. Jane Antolini, who owns Lady Jane's Inn, is the head of the board of selectmen. Conny Cash, an accountant, is the vice chairman of the zoning board. Roe Callahan, an architect, heads the disability commission. Sarah Peake, who left a successful law career in New York to become an innkeeper in Provincetown, is the vice president of the Provincetown Business Guild.
Alix Ritchie is the publisher of The Banner, a local newspaper. Deb Paine is one of several women contractors. Barbara Gard is a pilot and mechanic. Molly Benjamin, who helped bring clam farming to Provincetown and was named by Yankee Magazine last year as "one of the 60 people who make New England New England," writes a popular fishing column for The Cape Cod Times.
While some inns cater specifically to women, or men, Ms. Peake's inn welcomes both sexes. "There are men and women in the world," Ms. Peake said. "I didn't move here just to be in a women's community."
Joy McNulty, who used to work in food service at the Bedford Hills prison for women in upstate New York, owns The Lobster Pot restaurant, which serves more than 1,000 people a day in the summer.
Moving through her packed dining room overlooking the harbor the other afternoon, Ms. McNulty, who runs the restaurant with her four children, recalled her decision to move to Provincetown, 22 years ago. "I was gay, I was out," she said. "Where else would you go?"
Provincetown, with a year-round population of 3,500 that swells to more than 60,000 in summer, has, in keeping with its tradition of tolerance, welcomed the new settlers.
Custodio Silva Jr., the son and grandson of Portuguese fishermen, grew up in Provincetown. "There have always been gay people in Provincetown," said Mr. Silva, who is not gay, and, as a member of the board of selectmen, usually votes with Jane Antolini. "My parents made me appreciate that people are people. One of my best friend's mothers is a lesbian. I always thought it was cool. She always had two mothers in the house."
Even as more gay women take positions on local boards, there are plenty of men in charge, including the town manager, the police chief, and the head of public works. Still, Ms. Antolini said, "We try to say, 'Let's get some men, let's get some straight men.' "

HEADLINE: Women's New Relationship With Fashion

SERIES: OUT OF FASHION: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and CONSTANCE C. R. WHITE 

 BODY:
Relegated to the back of Renaire Frierson-Davis's closet are the high-priced business suits she wore daily until two years ago. Front and center now is a less costly assortment of jeans and khakis, casual wool pants and shorts sets.
It is a change in wardrobe that mirrors a quiet but clear shift in Ms. Frierson-Davis's attitude. A 36-year-old self-employed lawyer with two children from Freeport, L.I., Ms. Frierson-Davis still loves fashion. But increasingly she thinks she no longer needs to dress up to show she is someone. "I used to use clothing to define me," she said. "Now I know a little better who I am." 
 And, given her busy life, she would rather wear something comfortable and appropriate not just for the courthouse but also for grocery shopping and shuttling the children. Furthermore, she now looks elsewhere for the pleasure she once got from shopping for clothes -- to exercise, tennis, manicures.
The American woman has radically changed her attitude toward clothes, and that has drastically altered what she buys. Recent studies and interviews with 40 women are finding that especially among the aging baby boomers, money that once went to the perfect red suit is now going to a variety of new places.
Nor is it only being spent on more casual, often less expensive clothes, from jeans to chenille sweaters to workout wear. Now the money is also increasingly going to other passions, from one's children, to investing, to a variety of goods and services being marketed as salves for a stressful life: backpacking trips and gardening tools, vanilla-scented candles, spiritual retreats and manicures.
It is as if women have decided they prefer experiences to outfits as relief from their demanding lives. "We are not just an industry competing with ourselves anymore, but with every industry," said Eric Hertz, executive director of the Fashion Association, a trade organization.
This profound shift, just starting to be understood in the fashion business, has contributed greatly to a 12 percent drop in sales of women's apparel in the United States, from the record $84 billion set in 1989 to $73 billion last year, according to Tactical Retail Solutions, a market-research firm in New York. Industry experts, economists and Government agencies that track spending confirm the significant drop.
The decline is all the more stunning when compared with overall personal spending -- which grew 37 percent during the same period, according to figures from the Commerce Department -- and with sales of men's apparel, which rose 16 percent, between 1991 and last year, according to Tactical.
A decade ago apparel makers and retailers expected a glorious future. After all, more women would be working. And designers and retailers saw little reason to believe that women in 1996 would not continue their ascent in the workplace and continue to demand the expensive, complicated armor that went with it. When sales instead began to decline in the 1990's, many in the business attributed their problems mainly to too many stores and too many women sitting out a few fashion seasons.
Now they are increasingly recognizing that women are moving on to other things, and that money that once went to fashion might be going elsewhere for good. That has huge implications for one of the nation's largest industries. Counting textile mills, manufacturers and retail stores, the apparel business employs more than five million people and ranks among the country's four largest employers, along with health care, automobiles and government.
Indeed, the change in women has produced some striking losers -- mainly clothes perceived as too formal, too impractical, too expensive or too unflattering on maturing bodies. The navy power suit with padded shoulders and the accompanying floppy bow, the uniform of millions of women in the 1970's and 80's, is nearly extinct, little more than the butt of a joke. Sales of blouses fell 12 percent between 1991 and last year, according to a study of 16,000 American households by the NPD Group, a market-research firm in Port Washington, L.I. Hosiery sales dropped 6 percent between 1993 and last year.
The designers and retailers that counted on such merchandise have struggled. Among them are the fashion companies Anne Klein, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Escada, Leslie Fay, Esprit and Liz Claiborne, and the retailers Martha, Barneys, Ann Taylor, the Limited, Charming Shoppes and Casual Corner.
One example of how not recognizing the changes among women can mean disaster is the so-called modern romantic look, typified by ruffled blouses with full cascading sleeves and long velvet skirts. Bloomingdale's bet big on the look in 1993, devoting an entire catalogue to it. But women did not want a costume that seemed impractical in a variety of settings, from the office to the supermarket. Sales were less than half what the store projected. High-priced "grunge" fashions, the monastic look (capes and crucifix jewelry), and see-through and lingerie-style clothing met similar fates.
But there are also signs of life in the business. Some designers and retailers are finding ways to win women back, as indicated by mild sales upturns among various apparel retailers in recent months. They are selling comfort and practicality. The winning words among fashion retailers are no longer "power dressing" and "designer label" but rather "casual comfort" and "multiple end-use" -- clothes that will serve women through their various role switches and long days.
Sales of pants suits grew 167 percent between 1990 and last year, NPD Group numbers show. Sales of knit shirts increased 31 percent during that same period. Vest sales rose 488 percent. Among the winners are the labels Dana Buchman, Emanuel and Searle, and the retailers Sears, Roebuck; Target stores and the Gap.
Two recent hits epitomize how responding to the changes in women can produce great profits. One is pants, with khakis a good example. For years labels like the Gap, Banana Republic and J. Crew sold them as a wardrobe staple, to be worn on the weekend and the occasional Friday at the office. Then, last fall, the designer Karl Lagerfeld, sensing the rebellion among women against high-maintenance fashion, sent khaki pants and denims down the runway of his spring presentation for Chanel in Paris.
The move had a major impact. Khakis were splashed across the pages of top fashion magazines, and manufacturers at every price added khakis to their collections. Women now wanted to wear them at work and as a fashion statement. Sales of khakis have jumped everywhere from Saks Fifth Avenue (at $760 each) to discount stores (at $19.99).
Then there is the chenille sweater, a warm, cozy knit of lustrous yarn popular since the early 1990's. Initially available in tunic lengths, they cost $300 to $600. Women seemed to revel in the deep, rich colors, the sensuous touch and the versatility: a chenille sweater works well with a rugged pair of jeans and the most glamorous evening skirt.
Now the chenille sweater has become a staple everywhere, from Madison Avenue boutiques like Searle to 34th Street emporiums like Conway, which expects to sell thousands of an acrylic-blend version of the sweater for $14.99. Last Christmas, the Bloomingdale's chain sold 5,000 chenille sweaters a week.
Of course, the apparel industry's problems can be traced to factors beyond women's changing attitudes toward clothes. For one thing, despite the decreasing interest in fashion, the number of stores has continued to rise. There was 12 square feet of retail space per person in this country in 1985; today there is closer to 20, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
This has forced many manufacturers and retailers to lower their prices. NPD Group found that that the average price paid for women's clothes declined 7 percent between 1991 and 1995.
But perhaps a more long-lasting challenge for American stores, from the Mall of America discount outlets to the Madison Avenue boutique, is the change in women's attitude.
 
The Transformation
More Casual, More Versatile
What transformed so many American women?
For one thing, many of the women on whom the apparel business was counting work at companies that have relaxed their dress codes.
The Ford Motor Company went casual five days a week at the beginning of last year, and since then Michele Kotcher, an executive who regularly does business at Ford, has no longer felt an obligation to don skirt suits and high heels each day. Five to 10 years ago, Ms. Kotcher preferred Christian Dior suits.
Today, Ms. Kotcher, a mother of two grown children whose day begins at 5:45 A.M. and often ends late at night with business entertaining, said she was wearing more trousers, and sweaters under blazers from labels like Emanuel, Anne Klein's less expensive lines, Ellen Tracy and Banana Republic. More often than not her feet are shod in Oxfords.
"A lot of the way I dress is for comfort," said Ms. Kotcher, 50, who lives in Birmingham, Mich. "My day can easily go into the evening. I don't like real fitted jackets or clothes tight around the waist because I'm in and out of my car."
It is not so much that she has traded down in fashion -- at about $800 an outfit, a wardrobe of these clothes can cost as much as one filled with Dior suits -- as that she has switched to lines that offer comfortable, conservatively stylish sportswear for middle-aged bodies.
But far more common is the woman who spends less as she switches to more casual clothing. For instance, Gap khakis cost around $40, a simple linen shirt $29. The old work outfit -- say, a navy blazer, matching skirt and blouse from the moderate-priced specialty store Casual Corner -- would run closer to $300. "The average transaction goes down dramatically with casual apparel," said Ike Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions.
The move to make work attire more casual is not just a function of corporations loosening their dress codes.
The number of businesses owned by women like Ms. Frierson-Davis -- women who can dictate their own dress codes -- has increased by 43 percent, to just over 1.8 million, since 1987, according to Census Bureau figures.
If there is any doubt that casual, inexpensive dressing has become a status symbol, reflect on the uber sex goddess Sharon Stone, who appeared on stage at the Oscars this year wearing not her signature Valentino but a black Gap turtleneck.
 
Changing Priorities
New Siren Songs And Commitments
Just as important, women are deciding there are better ways to spend their money than shopping.
Baby boomers are now middle- aged, and women and men, historically, spend less on clothes after the age of 45, according to the National Retail Federation and studies by Lee, the large apparel manufacturer.
And the generations behind the baby boomers are not likely to pick up the slack. For one thing, there are fewer of them. For another, they earn less, when adjusting for inflation, than the older baby boomers did at their age. Last year, among full-time salaried workers 25 to 34, median weekly earnings were 85 percent of the overall median, down from 92 percent in 1985, the Labor Department said. Finally, the youngest generations may well make their fashion statements through casual clothing instead of tailored outfits.
Also hurting the apparel industry is growing competition from other kinds of businesses, many of which have recognized that relaxation and stress reduction are a siren song.
Many women are spending more on their bodies and less on what goes on them. Denise Weathersby, 38, a music publishing executive in Los Angeles, said most of her extra cash poured into her savings and massages, eyebrow waxes, trips to the spa and manicures and pedicures. She has consulted a nutritionist, and now attends spiritual retreats and seminars. "There was a time in my 20's when it did all go on my back," she said of her discretionary income.
Personal-care services and products are booming. Facial-treatment products like wrinkle creams and mud masks have grown about 5 percent a year for the last five years after years of declining or flat sales, said Lenka Contreras of Kline & Company in Fairfield, N.J.
Between 1990 and 1995, sales of bath products jumped nearly 30 percent, said Diana Temple, a cosmetics analyst at Salomon Brothers. Clothing retailers and designers are recognizing this, and many have started selling bath products.
There is also a big increase in toning up. Women's spending on fitness activities from backpacking to lifting weights has risen. The number of women with memberships at commercial gyms in the United States rose 108 percent between 1987 and 1995 to 7.58 million.
What creams, salon visits and exercise may not solve, cosmetic surgery can. Liposuction, a process that vacuums away fat, and body-sculpturing procedures have soared nearly 40 percent over the last decade, in part because of improvements in surgical techniques, said Dr. Ronald Iverson, a plastic surgery expert.
"Now that we can do invasive procedures over the weekend for the cost of an Armani jacket, they're doing it," said Carol Farmer, president of C. F. Associates, a trend research firm in Boca Raton, Fla.
In the last few years Susan Green, a homemaker who is 46 and lives in Great Neck, L.I., underwent plastic surgery and has begun making yearly visits to the Spa at Doral in Miami. "I have more money to spend on clothes and I can't spend it -- everything is either too career or too young," Ms. Green said.
Many baby boomers who started a family later than their mothers said money they once spent on their own clothes now went to outfitting their children and their homes. Between 1991 and last year, spending on children's apparel has grown 21 percent, Tactical Retail Solutions found.
Nancy Rickman, 43, a chef and chiropractic assistant in Freeport, L.I., has children 9 and 7. "I'm a homeowner now and I hate to say it but when you end up having kids you spend more on them," she said.
Some of the money lost to clothes has gone to the home and garden. "I think I get more pleasure from creating my surroundings and making my home look terrific," said Ms. Green, who has bought eight armoires in the last three years.
Brooke Dennis, 46, a medical-office manager in Dallas, said she would "give up a new suit any day before I'd give up my maid."
"It doesn't matter to me what I wear because no one really notices," she said. "But I notice what my house looks like."
Even more striking in its growth as a diversion has been gardening. There are now 78 million gardeners, 57 percent of them women, a 30 percent increase since 1992, according to Organic Gardening magazine.
Many women, eager to capitalize on the rising stock market and increasingly worried about their financial futures in an era of downsizing and threats to their retirement benefits, are investing more of what might have gone to clothing before.
Clarissa Magsarili, a 51-year-old loan officer who lives in Queens, is shifting into investments some of the dollars that five years ago would have gone to suits. "I'm trying to cut my expenses," she said. "I figure I have a lot of clothes I have not even worn in my closet. Now I'm trying to spend more money on investments."
One of the most notable shifts from apparel has been toward leisure -- female adventure travelers now outnumber men by a hair, said Jerry Mallet, head of the Adventure Travel Society in Englewood, Colo.
With so much competing for their attention, many women say they do not have time to sort through racks of clothes to choose an outfit. "I don't have time to go through a lot in the morning," said Lisa Gersh Hall, a 37-year-old partner in the law firm of Friedman & Kaplan in Manhattan. "I have 50 minutes to get myself and my daughter out of the house."
The fashion business has its own high-profile example of a woman in transition: Donna Karan. In the 1980's, her clothes embodied power dressing, as in a 1992 advertising campaign featuring a model in a chain-belted skirt suit and high heels being elected President. The campaign reflected how Ms. Karan seemed to perceive herself.
Now, Ms. Karan regularly visits the Canyon Ranch spa, has become a follower of Deepak Chopra and is a proponent of juice therapy. In July she introduced a collection of home accessories that include pillows filled with buckwheat, and perfumed candles. Then there is Chaos, her new fragrance, which she contends lowers blood pressure.
Women, Ms. Karan said, want comfort, though she seems as flummoxed as the rest of the industry in how to convey this in clothes.
 
The Backlash
A Desire for 'Nice But Not Too Nice'
Some women who once found it important to look stylish, to show they were in the know about fashion, now want to look as if they know better than fashion. For many it is better to err on the side of understatement than to look like a "fashion victim."
Take Terri ReBell, a Beverly Hills homemaker and volunteer in her daughter's school district. She once made shopping trips to Europe or New York to buy $30,000 Chanel suits handmade in French designer studios, and she can afford to continue that. Yet she now prefers clothes that are "nice, but not too nice" -- Chanel sweaters, chenille sweaters and some avant-garde items.
Ms. ReBell, who is 35, said high fashion is not as exciting now. "A lot of the stuff looks the same," she said, adding, "As you get older, if you gain weight it's not so easy to put on that miniskirt with nicely cut jacket and high heels."
At the same time, women with jam-packed stressful lives are looking to be entertained or relaxed, and a shopping trip has come to represent the antithesis of that.
Judith Gordon once liked her trips to the mall. Now, "I hate shopping," said Ms. Gordon, 49, a massage therapist in Delton, Mich. "I can't find anything; there is never a clock, so I can't keep track of time, and the salespeople won't leave me alone."
"For entertainment now," she said, "I'd rather sit in my kayak in the middle of the lake, call L. L. Bean and get it over with."
The rise of a technological world embodied by the Internet, in which speed and availability are paramount, has reshaped the American shopper's sensibilities. The mere act of driving to a mall, looking for a parking space and combing 20 aisles is incongruent with this mind-set.
"Technology has changed expectations," said Therese E. Byrne, editor of Retail Maxim, a newsletter. "People go into a store, and they want their size and their color and the price and they want it now. The average American wants to get away from the past, and retailers have to figure out how to use that."
Tomorrow: Winners and losers in the fashion business.
 
For Men, a Different Story
Even as women spend less on clothing, men are spending more. Between 1991 and 1995, retail sales of men's apparel rose 16 percent, says Tactical Retail Solutions, a market research firm in New York.
To be sure, that rise has not been as fast as the increase in personal spending as a whole -- meaning men, like women, are devoting less of their budgets to clothing.
But from a retailer's viewpoint, the numbers for men look better than those for women, for several reasons. For one thing, women's apparel prices have fallen more than men's. That is partly because there has been more competition in the women's business. Also, the women's industry, more than the men's, has been able to lower prices by using less expensive fabrics and simpler designs, experts said.
"The women's tailored dress of $79.99 or $100 has been replaced by the cotton or rayon dress that can sell for $39 or $49," said Peter Simon, the director of apparel service at the NPD Group of Port Washington, L.I.
Like women, men have been buying more casual clothes for the office, with khaki pants, sport coats and trousers, knit shirts and penny loafers replacing suits, dress shirts and wing tips.
Also buoying the men's market is the mirror. Men who once paid little attention to clothes now feel pressure to look fit and fashionable in a culture that still prizes youth, many fashion and retailing experts agree.
But even with men's recent gains, women still outspend men by a lot. Retail sales of women's clothing last year totaled $73 billion, Tactical reported, while men spent $40 billion.

Dole Plans to Announce $548 Billion Tax-Cut Plan
After weeks of debate within his campaign, Bob Dole has settled on the economic and political foundation of his Presidential run. In Chicago today, he is expected to announce a $548 billion tax-cut package highlighted by a 15 percent reduction in individual income tax rates and a halving of the capital gains tax.
Dole aides said that the plan was the single-most critical component to reviving Mr. Dole's fortunes against President Clinton. [Page A1.]
 
Mr. Dole is betting his campaign on convincing voters that tax cuts won't send the deficit sky-high and that smaller government won't hurt the economy or living standards. [A1.]
 
Bob Dole's campaign opened a Web site and accused President Clinton of being stodgy and behind the times. [D5.]
 
Revolution in Type Design
A new generation of designers of typefaces, or fonts, has emerged since the birth of the Apple Macintosh and desktop publishing. But the digital technology that makes type easier to design has made the profession more difficult and styles easier to steal -- and more designers mean more competition. [D5.]
 
Restrictions for Bond Lawyers?
Lawyers are raising the same ethical question that investment bankers have already answered: Should municipal bond attorneys be barred from donating to politicians with whom they do business? [D2.]
 
Global Village in Olympic Ads
In its coverage of the Olympics, NBC has been accused of chauvinism, featuring mainly home-grown athletes. But wait for the commercials. Some are so globally sophisticated, like ads from I.B.M. and Coca-Cola, that they are in French or Thai. Advertising. [D6.]
 
The Olympic Games in Atlanta began as a real estate lawyer's pipe dream, turned into unlikely reality and veered between triumph and nightmare. But at the end, by almost any accounting, a folly had paid off. [A1.]
 
Silicon Graphics Shares Lag
Silicon Graphics just can't seem to win. The company reported earnings last week that exceeded most expectations. Yet in the next two trading days, its shares fell and analysts lowered earnings estimates for fiscal 1997, citing slower growth. Market Place. [D4.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: WELFARE;
Fresh From Battle Over Welfare, Congressmen Seek Counsel at Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFKSY, By The New York Times 

 BODY:
After voting to overhaul the nation's welfare system, Congress has gone home for a month of vacation as the parties hold their national conventions.
In Newburyport, Mass., and the Detroit suburbs, people seldom brought up the welfare vote as they talked with their members of Congress. But in Pennsylvania's Second District, which includes metropolitan Philadelphia, the decision excited much more attention. 
 Here are the reactions and concerns three members encountered at home in the days after the decisive House vote:
 
Philadelphia
For Some, a Threat To Fragile Stability
For most of his life, Roger Atkins was a drug addict, living on the streets, using heroin, cocaine, crack, angel dust, whatever he could find. To support his habit, he robbed, sold drugs and lived on welfare benefits.
That went on for 26 years until Mr. Atkins, now 43, entered a recovery program. He is now proud to say that he has been clean for three years.
But if Mr. Atkins represents the worst abuse of the 60-year-old national welfare system, he also represents the major reason his Congressman, Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania's Second District, joined 100 other House members in voting against the overhaul legislation passed last week.
Mr. Atkins has no discernible work skills. While in recovery, he has found menial jobs that pay as much as $5 an hour. But his benefits of $80 a month in cash and food stamps were shut off this year when Pennsylvania, as one of 43 states granted Federal waivers to implement their own welfare overhauls, tightened rules for eligibility. And the new Federal legislation could fall short by as much as $12 billion, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, in creating job-training programs.
In Mr. Atkins and hundreds of other recovering addicts who attended the annual Drug-Free March here on Saturday, Mr. Fattah sees only Congressional miscalculation and a huge loss of human potential.
"The majority of these people want to work," Mr. Fattah said in an interview after the rally, his first public appearance in the district since the welfare vote last Wednesday. "So the real issue is providing training opportunities to develop skills and job opportunities."
Mr. Fattah, a freshman Democrat who won election by the widest margin of any new Congressman, 86 percent to 14 percent, was greeted warmly by many in the crowd, if not for his vote on the welfare bill then for his work on behalf of the poor and minorities. But in the Philadelphia district he represents, an ethnically diverse region that includes downtown and neighborhoods to the west that span all economic levels, the job equation is difficult to solve.
Over the last 15 years, Philadelphia has lost about 200,000 jobs, many of them through the scaling back or closing of small manufacturing plants. During the same period, 40,000 jobs have been created in the service, health and high-tech industries, and as Mr. Fattah said, 70 percent of them require a college education. That leaves unskilled people like Mr. Atkins in limbo.
Mr. Atkins said his most immediate problem was maintaining a stable environment to continue his recovery. As part of a community program, One Day at a Time, he has been living in a house with six other former addicts; they pool their money for rent and food. But he said that now, cut off from public assistance and lacking a higher-paying steady job, he was afraid he might be forced into the streets again.
"This is a transition period while I try to get my dignity back," he said. "I don't need a lot of money. I just need to be productive. I need direction. I'm not asking for more."
Even if Mr. Atkins could stabilize himself, competition for a higher-than-minimum-wage job is certain to become fierce here and elsewhere, with former welfare recipients chasing fewer jobs and limited new slots in job-training programs. The legislation is expected to provide access to training programs for only half the projected 1.2 million people severed from public assistance.
In many areas around the country, community groups like the Philadelphia Urban League work with businesses to create substantial jobs for people trying to escape welfare dependency within state and Federal time requirements for welfare recipients to find work.
Thomas Henry Massaro, a real estate developer in the Germantown section and a supporter of Mr. Fattah, said he recently hired eight people for local construction jobs. But their low economic standing makes it hard for some of them just to hold the job.
Mr. Massaro said that one woman he hired had to drop her children at a day-care center and take two buses to reach work, sometimes arriving 45 minutes late. He is not sure how much longer he can afford that.
To Mr. Fattah and others who voted against the Federal overhaul, more money for job training might have given the woman better options. "There's no problem with saying able-bodied people should work," he said. "But in pockets of America, major urban cities as well as rural sections, we have to realize that lives are going to be made paltry because of these policies." MICHAEL JANOFSKY

HEADLINE: Tough Line On Grants For Arts: Shape Up

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Arts organizations pride themselves on their appetite for innovation and risk. Now they are being asked to entertain a truly novel idea: black ink.
Alarmed at the organizations' tendency to run up deficits year after year, foundations and local arts agencies have in the last few years taken a new tack in assisting arts groups. In a variety of initiatives that now funnel about $100 million into the arts each year, they have begun experimenting with "tough love" grant programs that force cultural organizations to change their behavior and develop habits that will allow them to prosper in the long term. 
 These programs, supported by the Ford Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the Heinz Foundation, among others, are often lumped together under the bureaucratic-sounding term "stabilization." Broadly speaking, stabilization grants are intended to help recipients impose financial discipline and institute long-range planning.
"This represents a real shift in thinking by grant makers and the organizations they fund," said Thomas Wolf, a partner in Strategic Grantmaker Services, consultants in Cambridge, Mass. "It demands real thinking about how to do strategic planning, the realization that you can't grow your way into stability and a greater awareness of market forces and consumer demand."
One of the most rigorous programs is National Arts Stabilization, which grew out of the Ford Foundation's early stabilization efforts in the mid-1960's. Since 1990, with its own money and backing from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs, the program has been working with a dozen New York organizations with financial problems, including the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Pan Asian Repertory Theater and El Museo del Barrio.
To qualify for a grant, paid out over four years, organizations must reduce their debt and then work with the program to develop a long-range plan that forces them to confront the issues that arts institutions frequently tend to avoid. The questions can be as basic as: Who am I? Why do I exist? Where am I going? How do I get there?
The soul-searching is more than a form of institutional therapy. In pondering the basics, arts organizations often end up changing the makeup of their boards, devising strategies to reach a broader audience and casting about for new income sources.
In December 1990, the Alvin Ailey dance troupe went to National Arts Stabilization on the brink of collapse. With a debt of $1 million, the company was thinking of shutting down its school.
"Typically, when an arts organization is in trouble, the focus is on short-term cash requirements," said Michael M. Kaiser, who was the executive director of the Ailey company when it went through the stabilization process and is now the executive director of American Ballet Theater. "You're asking, 'How do I get to next week, to the opening,' and not 'How do we become viable in the long run?' "
Over the next two and a half years, the Ailey company eliminated its accumulated deficit. By drafting a long-range plan, it helped convince potential donors that the company knew where it was headed. As a result, contributed income doubled. At the same time, the company introduced operating efficiencies, switching from a basic health plan to a health-maintenance organization, for example, and setting its touring schedule more efficiently.
It also unleashed a furious marketing campaign in late 1992 and early 1993 that included several high-visibility "look at us" performances. The company appeared at President Clinton's inaugural gala, did a full hour on Phil Donahue's show and gave a free performance in Central Park.
"These activities, one after the other, made donors want to reassess their relationship to Alvin Ailey," Mr. Kaiser said. "The national exposure helped attract tour sponsors, and the tour contributed to earned income."
"There was not a personality change with respect to the art," he added. "In fact, our expenditures for new works went up each year under N.A.S. What the process did was change many modes of behavior, particularly on the administrative side."
That is exactly what National Arts Stabilization had in mind.
"In the arts, there's rapid turnover in staff and boards," said Nancy R. Sasser, the president of National Arts Stabilization. "You are trying to create behavioral changes that will outlive specific people."
El Museo del Barrio, which is entering its third year in the stabilization program, is enjoying its first deficit-free year in a decade. In the course of developing a plan that will take it to the year 2000, it doubled the size of its board, recruiting some non-Hispanic members, and adopted the kind of strict financial reporting procedures typical of larger museums. It hired a development officer, rather than relying on outside consultants, as well as a professional finance director.
"Strict reporting and controls, and bringing the development in-house, made the fund raising much more targeted," said Susana Torruella Leval, the museum's director.
The museum also broadened its mission. Responding to demographic changes in the neighborhoods surrounding it, the museum, founded 27 years ago as a Puerto Rican institution, formally declared that it would address the history and culture of other Hispanic groups in New York.
"All this is key to a museum competing in this city," Ms. Leval said. "We have to be viable, relevant and go forward, and this is not just a matter of money. It's intelligence in growing the board and staff. It's remaining relevant so you'll survive."
Arts organizations are not alone in going through a period of intense scrutiny. Foundations, too, have been asking whether they bear some of the blame for encouraging unhealthy patterns of dependency.
"Unwittingly, the foundations have interjected themselves between the audience and the arts producers," said Melanie Beene, an arts consultant in the San Francisco area. "It's much easier to get a $50,000 grant than to get 1,000 people to give you $50, or 25,000 new audience members to see your show. It's much easier to play to the foundations, if the money is there."
Foundations often found themselves rewarding unsuccessful organizations and penalizing successful ones, which often worried about how to conceal their cash surpluses. "People in philanthropy have a history of strategies for social engineering," Ms. Beene said. "They feel they have to find a problem and fix it. But that is not appropriate if your goal is the long-term sustainability of these organizations."
In Philadelphia, the Pew Charitable Trusts have re-evaluated their relationship to the local nonprofit organizations that they have unstintingly supported in the past. As a result, they have shifted their emphasis from individual projects and grants to supporting broad program strategies, with tough requirements on deficit reduction that have come as a rude surprise to organizations like the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Philadelphia Opera.
Pew and other groups have also begun to think the unthinkable, that foundations should question their natural instinct to come to the aid of ailing organizations. "Often you don't have a lot of success when you do that, because you address the symptoms, not the problem," said Marian A. Godfrey, the director of Pew's culture program. "Organizations need to solve their own problems. You challenge them to do that and reward them when they do."
Even more radical, for traditional grant-givers, is growing acceptance of the notion that some arts organizations can and should die.
"Twenty years ago, the loss of any arts organization in any community was seen as a tragedy by the funding community," said Mr. Wolf, of Strategic Grantmaker Services. "Today that's not the case. Funders are much more interested in seeing that arts disciplines are being provided to the community, rather than ensuring that everyone should survive."
In Charlotte, N.C., the Arts and Science Council gathered local arts organizations and encouraged them to seek areas in which they could cooperate or, in the case of groups pursuing identical goals, to merge. Two children's theaters merged into one, three theaters formed one Actors Equity company, and the oratorio society merged with the symphony.
"When you get one dance company's board to list needs and goals and it comes up with 30 of them, and another comes up with a list of 25, and only two items on the lists are different, the desirability of a merger becomes fairly clear," said Michael Marsicano, the executive director of the council. "There were four different groups doing 'Nutcrackers,' all hurting each other at the box office. We got them to do one major 'Nutcracker.' "
Not everyone is convinced that the best-run organizations necessarily create the best art. "My concern is that we worry so much about the institution that we forget about the art," said Penny McPhee, the director of arts and culture programs at the Knight Foundation in Miami and the president of Grantmakers in the Arts, a professional association. "Stabilizing the infrastructure theoretically frees artists to do the work, but there can be a tipping of the scale in which more attention is paid to bureaucrats than the artists."
Most foundations agree that they cannot create leadership and artistic vitality, they can only recognize and reward it. The language surrounding discussion of the arts has become increasingly Darwinian, and those who award grants seem to be taking a cooler view of cultural struggle and the possibilities of intervention.
"Some organizations will fall by the wayside, not because of changes in funding patterns, but because the environment is changing," Ms. Godfrey said. "The ones that fall will be the ones that don't have the right relationship to their environment."

HEADLINE: Cutting Aid to the Poor Ignores History;
Employment Mirage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Commenting on the continuing "welfare crisis," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan asserts that "we have had full employment for the last five years" (news article, Aug. 2). He appears to be another victim of Washington doublespeak.
An official unemployment rate of about 6 percent is indeed considered "full employment." Congress, the White House and the Federal Reserve Board strive to keep that many people jobless, and often more, in an effort to prevent inflationary wage increases. 
 Among teen-agers age 16 to 19 affected by that policy, 19 percent of males are jobless and 16.2 percent of females. For young black males, the rate is 37.6 percent; for black females, 32.6 percent.
These figures include only those actively seeking jobs.
The "crisis" Senator Moynihan deplores, especially out-of-wedlock births, heavily afflicts the young. A policy that prevents them from joining mainstream society seems obviously connected with that "crisis."

HEADLINE: Atlanta Games, a Celebration for 197 Nations, Close

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 4

 BODY:
After 16 days of competition, the centennial Olympics ended tonight after spellbinding performances that perhaps exceeded the expectations of even the organizers. But the success of the athletic competition could not eliminate all the disruptions that left these Games short of delivering on the promise that they would be the greatest ever.
In the wake of the bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, a distressed transportation system, glitches in the I.B.M. computer system and tacky commercialism, the president of the International Olympic Committee was muted in his assessment of the Games in his speech at tonight's closing ceremony. 
 Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, called the Atlanta Games an event of "universality and unity." He referred to them as "most exceptional." His speech, however, did not award Atlanta his customary verbal pat on the back as "the best Games."
Atlanta succeeded on the playing field with such electric performances as Michael Johnson's world record at 200 meters, Carl Lewis's fourth victory in the long jump, Kerri Strug's courageous gold-medal vault and Amy Van Dyken's four gold medals in swimming, which overcame the favored Chinese and her own lifelong battle with asthma.
Johnson, winner of the historic sprint double at 200 and 400 meters, carried the five-ringed Olympic flag into the stadium for the closing ceremony, when the flame was extinguished. As Gloria Estefan and Stevie Wonder serenaded the 80,000 spectators and the 8,000 athletes still on hand, the formal separation of athletes from different countries dissolved into an informal, celebrative mingling in the stadium infield.
As riveting as the competition had been in the stadium, it was also fleeting. As the ceremony ended, the Olympic Stadium faced a removal of the track and downsizing of its capacity to 50,000 seats for its second life as a baseball stadium for the Atlanta Braves.
The centennial Games will be remembered in particular for the impressive showing of female athletes, from both established and emerging sporting nations. Michelle Smith, with three swimming victories, became the first Irish woman to win an Olympic medal. Ghada Shouaa, the heptathlon champion, became the first Syrian to win a gold medal. Deon Hemmings, the 400-meter hurdles champion, became the first Jamaican woman to win a gold medal. Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria, the long-jump champion, became the first African woman to win a field event. Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia became the first African woman to win a marathon.
The African men, long represented on the medal podium by distance runners from Kenya and Ethiopia, were joined in Atlanta by victorious stars from unlikely places like Burundi. Venuste Niyongabo of Burundi won the men's 5,000 meters on Saturday night, bringing riveting success to a country riven by a recent coup d'etat and murderous ethnic hostilities between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes.
All told, African athletes won 11 gold medals, 5 more than the previous best eight years ago at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. Nigeria won the men's soccer competition. The swimmer Penny Heyns won both breast-stroke races, giving South Africa its first gold medals in 44 years. The country was banned from the Summer Games from 1964 through 1988 because of its apartheid policies. Today, the possibilities of the post-apartheid era were made dramatically evident in the men's marathon when Josia Thugwane became the first black South African to win an Olympic gold medal.
These were the most inclusive Summer Games ever held. All 197 invited nations participated before a record number of three million spectators, who bought 8.6 million tickets. Athletes from 78 nations won medals, 12 more nations than the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, and 26 more than the 1988 Seoul Games, Samaranch said.
"This had never been seen before in the Olympic Games," Samaranch said of the record crowds. "In the beginning, we had some problems. The arrival of some teams, transportation, technology. Bit by bit, things were controlled and last week was excellent.
"While we celebrate the success of these Games," Samaranch went on to say, "we have not forgotten the tragic explosion of last week, nor have we forgotten the victims, their families and their friends."
The speech linked Atlanta to the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany, where 11 Israeli athletes and officials were killed by Palestinian gunmen. A moment of silence was called to honor the victims of these attacks. Unlike the Munich Games, where terrorism resulted in the deaths of athletes, no athletes were killed in the Atlanta explosion, and the Games continued without delay.
"No act of terrorism has destroyed the Olympic movement, and none ever will," Samaranch said.
Earlier today, Samaranch addressed the issue of financing at a news conference, saying that it would be impossible to organize the Games without corporate sponsorship. One of the enduring memories of Atlanta is certain to be the commercialism that left downtown with a feel more closely aligned with a trade show than an Olympics.
"This commercialization must be controlled and directed by the organizing committees or the I.O.C.," Samaranch said.
It did not help Atlanta organizers that television rights were sold during an economic downturn. While NBC paid $456 million for the Atlanta Games, it paid $715 million for the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia.
In terms of the competition and the enthusiasm of the spectators, however, there can be little criticism of the Atlanta Games. Olympic Stadium was filled with 80,000 fans night after night, and the track and field performances were greeted with throbbing roars.
"They even cheered for the shot-put," Michael Johnson said.
With its roundly criticized concept of "plausibly live" coverage, NBC concentrated on the teen-age gymnasts at the expense of the more mature and compelling American women who won the softball and soccer competitions. And the questioned success of Smith in swimming -- there were whispers that Smith had used performance-enhancing drugs -- means that almost no come-from-nowhere performance can be achieved without raising suspicion. But these realities could not negate the fact that women drew as much attention at these Games as did the men. Of the 44 gold medals won by the United States, 19 were won by women, including tonight's basketball competition.
"Female athletes are being accepted," said the American soccer player Julie Foudy. "It's O.K. to be successful. It's O.K. to want to be successful."
Or, in the words of Van Dyken, "It's cool for a woman to be able to bench-press her husband."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: WELFARE;
Fresh From Battle Over Welfare, Congressmen Seek Counsel at Home

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, By The New York Times 

 BODY:
After voting to overhaul the nation's welfare system, Congress has gone home for a month of vacation as the parties hold their national conventions.
In Newburyport, Mass., and the Detroit suburbs, people seldom brought up the welfare vote as they talked with their members of Congress. But in Pennsylvania's Second District, which includes metropolitan Philadelphia, the decision excited much more attention. 
 Here are the reactions and concerns three members encountered at home in the days after the decisive House vote:
 
Northern Massachusetts
'It's About Time,' Civic Leaders Say
Representative Peter G. Torkildsen felt no need to defend his vote for a welfare overhaul when he appeared at the annual Yankee Homecoming festival in Newburyport, an old seaport dotted with the stately homes of whaling and clipper ship captains.
"Congress had a very productive week," Mr. Torkildsen, a second-term Republican, told an audience of 68 civic leaders at a luncheon in a local restaurant on Saturday. "We passed welfare reform."
That was good enough for David Outhouse, the president of the First and Ocean National Bank. "It's about time," Mr. Outhouse exclaimed, with a Yankee economy of words.
Mr. Outhouse's sentiments seemed to be shared by the other people in the room, most of whom were dressed in blue blazers and white pants or dresses, in honor of Newburyport's maritime heritage.
"I really believe this is a step in the right direction and is a popular vote," said James P. Jajuga, a Democrat who represents Newburyport in the State Senate and who was also participating in the lunch.
Even Geri Dorr, a registered nurse and social worker who is executive director of the local social service agency, said: "It's a good change. I think everybody should work. How many people can you put on welfare anyway?"
Mrs. Dorr, 53, directs a staff of 250 employees and helps 2,500 people a year, including battered women on welfare and elderly people who are retarded. Her work with women on welfare has only made her more aware of the problems the old system created, Mrs. Dorr said.
"I see too many people just hanging around, not getting jobs and depending on welfare," she said.
The new system will work well as long as there are services to help people on welfare get education or training for jobs, she said. "If the services are there, I think these women will be able to find jobs in a year and go back to work," Mrs. Dorr said.
Mr. Torkildsen's Sixth Congressional District encompasses the area along the seacoast from Boston north to the New Hampshire border, just across the Merrimack River from Newburyport. It is divided demographically and politically between upper-class Yankee towns like Newburyport, whose voters tend to be moderate to liberal Republicans, and mill towns like Lynn whose voters are working-class Irish or Italian Democrats.
Mr. Torkildsen said his vote in favor of the welfare bill was as popular with his Democratic constituents as it was with Republicans like those in Newburyport.
Frank Cousins, a Republican State Representative who lives in Newburyport, agreed. "They worked out a good compromise on the welfare bill," he said. "I was really glad to see President Clinton get behind it." FOX BUTTERFIELD

HEADLINE: Baby Bells' TV Developers Are on Hold And Frustrated

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Gaze out the windows of Sandy Grushow's 16th-floor office here and you can trace the arc of his life. Off to the east lies Beverly Hills High School, from which Mr. Grushow graduated in 1979. And due west, barely visible in the haze, is the sprawling studio of 20th Century Fox, where he spent most of his career at the Fox television network.
Mr. Grushow is a consummate Hollywood specimen. The only twist is, he now works for the telephone industry. And that has meant nothing but problems. 
 Sixteen months ago, Mr. Grushow agreed to take over the programming arm of Tele-TV, a television joint venture owned by Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Pacific Telesis. The three companies had set a lofty goal: to develop an interactive alternative to cable television. They recruited Mr. Grushow to forge ties to the studios, develop ideas for original programs, and fashion a distinctive image for the service.
But after repeated delays in technology and a tectonic shift in regulations, the Baby Bells now admit that getting into television is only one of several priorities. Having completed his design for Tele-TV, Mr. Grushow wonders how many people will ever see it.
"I think we've come up with a compelling product," said Mr. Grushow, an intense 36-year-old who clambered up the corporate ladder at Fox because of his talents as a marketer of television programming. "The thing that's left me frustrated is that I came on board because of interactivity. And interactivity is no longer on the table."
For Mr. Grushow, it is just one of a litany of disappointments. Tele-TV's partners originally planned to deliver an array of conventional video and new interactive services through telephone networks upgraded with digital switches and high-capacity wires. But they have scrapped much of that because of high costs and technological hurdles.
The Baby Bells originally planned to roll out Tele-TV to 30 million homes in six of the nation's seven largest markets by the end of the century. Now, they will be lucky to reach one-fifth of that. Under Bell Atlantic's latest timetable, the company's digital fiber optic phone network would be available to no more than two million homes by the year 2002.
Tele-TV's shrinking ambitions have fanned a smoldering resentment between Hollywood and the Baby Bells. Entertainment executives hunger for a mass audience because it gives them the economic base to finance original programming. Telephone executives are content to treat television as a sort of research and development effort, where they can experiment over several years with pockets of viewers.
"If you're a rising star in Hollywood -- the kind of guy who may someday run a studio -- you're not going to want to stick around in an R.& D. operation for five years," said one executive at Tele-TV, who insisted on not being identified. "Without two million subscribers, you won't get your phone calls returned. You won't be a player in Hollywood."
With the financial muscle of three Baby Bells behind him, Mr. Grushow still gets his calls returned. But power in Hollywood is fleeting. So Mr. Grushow is showcasing his work to the media in a last-ditch effort to persuade the regional telephone companies to roll out Tele-TV aggressively this fall.
"If the telephone companies deliver this product with appropriate focus and emphasis, they can steal customers from cable," he said.
To compensate for the technological delays, the three Baby Bells shifted Tele-TV's focus earlier this year from wired to wireless delivery -- using a microwave technology known as wireless cable. Using wireless cable would enable the Baby Bells to begin offering Tele-TV in limited areas by the end of this year.
But because wireless cable does not have interactive capabilities, Tele-TV in many ways is a plain, old cable system. Under its current plan, it will offer 38 cable networks, including CNN, ESPN and HBO, plus the major broadcast networks. It will also offer a selection of pay-per-view movies, which can be ordered in half-hour increments by pushing buttons on a remote control keypad. Still, Mr. Grushow has come up with some novel innovations.
For example, the company's designers have devised an electronic program guide that features the programming lineup and is constantly updated. Unlike other such guides, viewers can choose a channel simply by pointing their remote controls to an icon on the screen and clicking.
In addition, Mr. Grushow hired two producers from "Entertainment Tonight" to create a promotional show that will present features about the shows on Tele-TV, plus interviews with the stars. He also created a pair of animated characters, Terrance and Virgil, who will pop up from time to time before and after shows as roving mascots for the service.
David Grant, a former executive vice president of Fox and Mr. Grushow's deputy, is wrapping up complex negotiations that would enable Tele-TV to carry all the major cable and broadcast networks. He persuaded his backers to outbid a sports network backed by Rupert Murdoch and John C. Malone for rights to telecast the Los Angeles Dodgers beginning next baseball season.
"It doesn't matter whether we open on Broadway in front of one customer, 1,000 customers, or 10 million customers," Mr. Grant insisted, "This is going to be a great product."
Those are brave words. But Howard Stringer, the chairman and chief executive of Tele-TV, acknowledges that it has been very difficult to maintain the morale of his executives -- especially those in Los Angeles -- when the regional telephone companies operate so differently from traditional media companies.
"The telephone companies are disappointed that the technology hasn't worked in their favor," Mr. Stringer, a former president of CBS said. "But I also think they are more patient than the rest of us."
Both Mr. Stringer and Mr. Grushow are careful not to criticize their backers. They sympathize with the decision of the Baby Bells to focus on long-distance telephone service, which is a larger and less risky business than television. And both men said they intended to honor their contracts, which run another two to three years.
But their foray into the telephone industry has been bruising, not least because Tele-TV was born amid such great expectations. The venture was engineered by Michael Ovitz, then the most powerful talent agent in Hollywood and now the president of the Walt Disney Company.
Bell Atlantic, Nynex, and Pacific Telesis each pledged $100 million over three years. The companies have since sliced Tele-TV's 1996 operating budget to $130 million from $160 million.
Mr. Grushow is still keeping his fingers crossed that the Baby Bells will forge ahead with wireless cable. But that is uncertain, too. Pacific Telesis, which had planned to offer Tele-TV through wireless cable in Los Angeles this fall, recently sold itself to another Baby Bell, SBC Communications. People close to Tele-TV said they were not sure that SBC would allow Pacific Telesis to retain its heavy investment in video.
One executive at Tele-TV said that senior Bell Atlantic executives were already formulating plans to dissolve the venture if Pacific Telesis pulls out. If that happens, Tele-TV would simply be reabsorbed into Bell Atlantic. Were that to happen, Bell Atlantic would probably deliver traditional cable services, and Mr. Grushow and Mr. Stringer might well exit.
In 12 years at Fox, Mr. Grushow worked for two of the toughest bosses in Hollywood, Barry Diller and Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Grushow said the top executives of the Baby Bells had been uniformly decent. But he is nostalgic for his days at Fox.
"Rupert Murdoch used to point at a mountain and say, 'Take it,' " he recalled, "And we took it."

HEADLINE: With Rise of H.M.O.'s, Medical Research Needs Federal Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You are right (correction, Aug. 1) to correct the statement (news article, July 30) that the Senate Finance Committee was not able to report out a bill during the health care debate of the last Congress. We did, indeed. It would have extended health care insurance to 95 percent of the population by the year 2002. Your correction, however, states that "the bill stalled in debate on the Senate floor and never came to a vote." Alas, not so. It was never called up for debate by the Senate leadership, as the Administration deemed it less than perfect. Only 100 percent would do. 
 The bill was dismissed with a measure of contempt at the time, and with the passage of time, has become a nonbill. This would be a loss. I believe the Finance Committee, in the course of a year of hearings, was the first to pick up the economic rationalization then sweeping through the health care sector. Charles Fahey of Fordham University described it as "the commodification of medicine." Another witness told of a spot market for bone marrow transplants in California.
All of which Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a health care expert, had foretold, particularly the growth of health maintenance organizations. But next the familiar unanticipated consequence emerged. Teaching hospitals can't compete in a world of H.M.O.'s. Absent teaching hospitals, you can't have medical schools. Absent medical schools, the heroic age of medical discovery, with its epicenter in New York City, comes to an end.
Accordingly, our bill included a graduate medical education and academic health centers trust fund. A 1.5 percent tax on private health insurance premiums was to be levied and deposited into the fund. Such a trust fund would receive $66.1 billion over five years, 1996 to 2000. This would have constituted an 80 percent increase in Federal funding.
A motion to strike this trust fund was defeated by a vote of 13 to 7. This shows bipartisan support for responding to a health care crisis most of us had not known existed. The Administration was not interested at the time. But this could change.

HEADLINE: Bilingual Americans Serve Global Markets

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The House's approval of a bill that would make English the official language of the United States (news article, Aug. 2) is not only mean-spirited and divisive, it is also unnecessary. There is no danger of Americans being segregated into linguistic ghettos. Indeed, the cultural pressure to learn English is so strong that it may end up hurting American business. 
 With Latin American trade the bulwark of a strong economy in Miami, most local business leaders believe South Florida's future growth requires more bilingual employees. Yet according to a recent study by Sandra Fradd of the University of Miami, young Hispanic Americans are leaving school with such insufficient Spanish-language skills that Miami's role as an international marketplace is at risk.
Despite a Hispanic majority in Dade County, fewer than 2 percent of its recent high school graduates are fluent in Spanish. Most second-generation Hispanic children who grow up with Spanish as their first language at home lose fluency after starting school, even with bilingual education.
Hispanic children in Florida often grow up speaking "Spanglish," picked up from parents and relatives. While they may get by conversationally, they are ill equipped for the bilingual job market, where high levels of literacy are required.
Professor Fradd's study, commissioned by the local Chamber of Commerce, concluded that the only thing keeping Spanish alive in South Florida was the flow of Latin American immigrants to the area and suggested that a cutback in immigration would kill Spanish fluency in Miami within a generation.
Second-generation Americans do not need legislation to encourage them to learn English. Most of them will reach adulthood unable to communicate effectively in any other language.

What A Dunce

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
It takes great self-confidence to write a newspaper column. Some might say it takes arrogance. Be that as it may, my willingness to pronounce on a great many matters of which I have little or no knowledge is one of my prime qualifications for this trade.
When it comes, however, to matters economical, or to put it indelicately, money, I invariably lose courage, hesitate to speak at all, and, when I dare, do so only after groveling in apology for my unfitness. 
 Experience has shown that there are far too many people whose expertise in money matters qualifies them to crush my opinions under tonnages of wisdom. Many others, not content with demolishing me, take cruel pleasure in calling attention to the comedy I have created by playing the fool.
As I now want to talk about economics questions that leave me baffled, let me first, therefore, apologize for not knowing the answers to these questions, which would be perfectly obvious to anyone who had studied his Samuelson, Friedman and Galbraith. With great humility, then, and greater trepidation, I put my questions.
The first concerns the bipartisan welfare bill, which proposes to punish the children of welfare parents who do not, after time, take jobs. My first question is: What jobs?
It is my impression that unemployment now stands at 5 percent. Doesn't this mean that 5 percent of people who want jobs cannot find them? If there are no jobs for people who want them, why do the President and the Congress assume that there will be jobs for these additional people being sent into the job market under work-or-else orders?
This, however, is only part of my question. It is my impression that the present 5 percent unemployment rate is regarded happily by our wisest money people as "full employment." What's more, as we have seen repeatedly, Wall Street has conniption fits whenever there are signs that unemployment might drop below 5 percent.
I mean, when statistics show more people going to work, the stock market always goes down. Wall Street obviously hates having too many people working. Not long ago a man obviously learned in matters financial explained this in The Wall Street Journal. The details were beyond my grasp, but he seemed to be saying that too much employment drives up the price of labor, which causes inflation, which causes disaster in financial markets.
Therefore, he said, it is the duty of the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates whenever employment rises noticeably. The rule here is: Raise interest rates and you depress the economy, thereby wiping out jobs and keeping the financial markets stable.
The Federal Reserve, apparently accepting this theory, is forever raising and lowering interest rates to maintain unemployment at the happy 5 percent level.
This being so, why in the world do Mr. Clinton and his Republican allies insist on making welfare clients take jobs? I realize it's good for their souls, but isn't it terrible economics? Here is one arm of government, Congress and White House, trying to raise the employment rate while another arm, the Federal Reserve, struggles to hold it down. Does this make sense to everybody but me?
It seems to me that common sense would force us to stop people who are already unemployed from taking jobs since their doing so will cause inflation, create havoc in financial markets and destroy the stability for which we can thank our 5 percent unemployment rate.
If this is so, shouldn't we be encouraging welfare people to stay unemployed? Where is the sense in threatening to put welfare children out in the cold unless their parents take these jobs that threaten to devastate our economic stability?
Are they not, in fact, performing a valuable economic service to the country? By staying unemployed they seem to me to be contributing to the economic stability that brings such pleasant prosperity to the rest of us.
Wouldn't it be logical for a grateful nation to recognize the value of their services by opening its purse to them, instead of churlishly kicking them until they take jobs that the masters of money don't want them to take?
I'm just asking, that's all.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Bad Day for the Mark Helps The Dollar Make Slight Gains

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed in lackluster trading yesterday, despite broad weakness in the German mark.
The mark was sold off against the Japanese yen and against higher-performing European currencies, traders said. 
 "There was some good buying of other European currencies and the yen against the mark, which helped the dollar move above the 1.48 mark level," said Tim Summerfield, senior foreign exchange trader at the Bank of Boston.
The mark's weakness against the yen was attributed to expectations of a near-term narrowing in Japanese and German interest rates, according to dealers.
If Japan is indeed prepared to raise rates while Germany pushes its rates lower, as many in the market expect, Japanese assets, and thus the yen, would become relatively more attractive.
"The assumption has long been that the Bundesbank will ease if it can, while the Bank of Japan will eventually have to raise rates," said Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currency Watch. "It's not new news, but it is the story that's being talked about."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4826 marks, up from 1.4750 marks on Friday. The dollar traded at 106.60 yen, down from 106.89. The British pound fell to $1.5440 from $1.5520.
The mark's weakness in Europe was most pronounced against the Italian lira. The mark fell considerably over the course of the session, to 1,022 lire, after touching highs of 1,029 earlier in the day.
Analysts said the release of the Italian consumer price index, which showed inflation at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, lifted the lira's value.
The dollar was also bolstered as Switzerland's central bank moved to curb the recently robust Swiss franc by adding money to the banking system. The dollar has dropped nearly 5 percent against the Swiss franc in the last month.
Over the last few weeks, the Swiss have injected overnight funds to help reduce upward pressure on the franc.
Yesterday's infusion of funds lifted the dollar off its lows against the Swiss franc and spurred its exchange value against the mark, as well. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.2023 Swiss francs, up from 1.2000.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Fall as Yield Hits 6.76%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday in quiet trading, as the market prepared for the sale of $39 billion in new securities.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 90 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.76 percent, from 6.73 percent on Friday. 
 The Treasury is scheduled to sell $19 billion of 3-year notes today, $10 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday. The Treasury also held its regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday.
Concerns about the market's ability to absorb new supply tend to weigh down prices. And the leading bond firms that underwrite the Treasury's debt often push yields higher before auctions to spur demand among their customers.
"The backdrop is positive, but we have to eliminate some of the sticker shock," said Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities, referring to the week's auctions.
After the Treasury refunding, the 30-year bond yield "could take a run at 6.5 percent," said Peter Van Dyke, who manages more than $2.8 billion in bond mutual funds at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "The economy is on the cusp: It was strong in the second quarter and now it's getting weaker again. Higher rates will start to bite," he added.
Bond prices surged on Friday, completing their biggest one-week rally in 15 months, after the Government's July employment report suggested that robust economic growth was moderating with little inflation.
"The data has confirmed that the economy is decelerating and we've probably taken the Fed out of the picture," Mr. Saslow said.
The employment data strengthened expectations that the Fed would leave short-term interest rates unchanged when its policy makers on meet Aug. 20.
Still some economists say the Fed will be forced to raise rates by the end of the year to prevent the economy from overheating.
"I thought they'd move in August and now I think they'll move in November and December," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The economy probably is growing at a pace of about 3 percent, which is faster than the Fed had anticipated, Mr. Roach said. By the end of the year, the central bank will have to raise the Fed funds rate to 5.75 percent or even 6 percent, he said, and the 30-year bond yield will climb as high as 7.5 percent.
Bonds were little moved by a plan announced by Bob Dole, the apparent Republican Presidential candidate, to cut taxes by 15 percent.
Bond investors would presumably be concerned about a tax cut because it could widen the Federal budget deficit unless equivalent spending cuts were made or faster economic growth increased tax receipts.
Those concerns may grow "if it looks like there's a ghost of a chance that he'll win or the Democrats respond with a similar package," said Kathy Jones, director of futures research at Prudential Securities Inc.
The Treasury is not the only borrower in the bond market this week.
The Norwest Corporation and the Anheuser-Busch Companies took advantage of the recent drop in yields to sell $400 million of new bonds.
In addition, New York City, the New York State Thruway Authority, and other municipalities are expected to see strong demand for this week's $2.3 billion in debt sales.
Norwest sold $200 million of 10-year notes priced at 99.338 to yield 6.968 percent, 44 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than the 10-year Treasury note.
Anheuser-Busch sold $200 million of seven-year notes, priced to yield 6.75 percent, or 35 basis points more than a seven-year Treasury note.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills yeterday:

HEADLINE: MidAmerican in Bid for Rival Iowa Utility

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Aug. 5

 BODY:
In an aggressive move that highlights the desire of power companies to become bigger and stronger, the MidAmerican Energy Company made a $1.2 billion offer today to buy IES Industries.
The offer would head off a planned three-way merger that involves IES, another utility from Iowa and one from Wisconsin. Instead, a Mid American-IES deal would bring together the two largest utilities in Iowa. IES rejected an approach by MidAmerican a year ago, but it said that it would consider the latest proposal. 
 "It will be given full consideration by the IES board of directors," said Diane Ramsey, an IES spokeswoman. "We expect to move on it quickly."
Utility mergers are coming at a furious pace as power companies seek to become more competitive as the industry moves toward deregulation. MidAmerican, which is based in Des Moines, itself was formed by the merger last year of Midwest Resources and Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric.
The board of IES, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has already approved a merger with the Interstate Power Company in Dubuque, Iowa, and WPL Holdings Inc. of Madison, Wis. That would create a utility with 862,000 electric customers and 361,000 natural gas customers. Under the plan, IES shareholders would exchange their stock for shares of WPL at ratio of close to 1 to 1.
WPL's stock offer was worth $32.15 a share, based on Friday prices, and would cut dividend returns to IES shareholders by 4.3 percent.
MidAmerican said that its offer would give IES shareholders a 21 percent premium over the three-way merger plan, along with a 42 percent increase in dividends.
Utility investors are usually conservative, seeking low risk and steady income, and dividend return is often considered more important to them than to other stock buyers.
The MidAmerican transaction calls for IES shareholders to receive either $39 in cash or 2.346 shares of MidAmerican stock for each share they hold. That values the deal at $1.17 billion, based on MidAmerican's closing stock price Friday, the last trading day before the announcement was made.
In New York Stock Exchange trading today, shares of IES rose $3.50, to $33.25, and shares of MidAmerican fell 75 cents, to $15.875.
"Our proposed merger will create a larger company with a regional growth strategy starting from an Iowa base," Stanley Bright, the president of MidAmerican, said in a letter Sunday to Lee Liu, the chairman and president of IES. "Our commitment to local and regional business growth will contribute to higher employment for the economy than the Wisconsin transaction."
MidAmerican, Iowa's largest utility, has 635,000 electric customers and 600,000 natural gas customers in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota. IES has 330,000 electric customers and 175,000 natural gas customers in Iowa.
The two utilities have contiguous, and sometimes overlapping, service areas across Iowa. MidAmerican initially proposed a merger in August 1995. But later that year IES announced its agreement to combine with Interstate Power and WPL.
IES shareholders are scheduled to vote on the three-way merger Sept. 5.
Mr. Bright said in his letter to Mr. Liu that if the two companies could reach agreement on MidAmerican's proposal, "we intend to solicit proxies against the Wisconsin transaction" for use at the shareholder meeting.
He said a MidAmerican-IES merger would keep more utility jobs in Iowa, but cutbacks were likely under either plan.

HEADLINE: Eastern Europe's Ailing Press

 BODY:
When Russian television and newspapers hid Boris Yeltsin's health problems in the recent elections, it highlighted health problems of their own. Aware that a return to Communism might threaten their freedoms, journalists shamelessly plugged Mr. Yeltsin and ignored his Communist opponent. Unhappily, the deformed election coverage was not an exceptional case of bad journalism in the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In many places the press is as distorted and shackled as it was under Communism.
In countries where democratic reforms are doing relatively well, the media are, too. In the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, the Baltic states and to a lesser extent Russia and Ukraine, the biggest problem for locally owned newspapers is generating enough income to stay in business. The practice of journalism is improving, with a few excellent newspapers, such as Warsaw's Gazeta Wyborcza and Prague's Respekt, leading the way. Foreign-owned papers and private television expand the news spectrum, but most show little interest in serious political coverage, and can hurt the local media by sucking up scarce advertising. 
 In more authoritarian nations, the press is not prospering by any measure. There is little real journalism in countries like Bulgaria and Albania, and none at all in some former Soviet republics, the worst being Turkmenistan. The controlled economies in these countries provide little advertising, so most papers are financed and indirectly controlled by the government or political organizations.
The quality of journalism will likely improve in most places through economic growth and expanded contact with the West. But government censorship is tough to change, and it is getting worse. After a car bomb exploded in Albania in May, the Government arrested the entire staff, even the cleaning woman, of Koha Jone, the country's major independent paper, arguing it was a secret organ of the old Communist Party.
Belarus' president recently sacked the editor of the country's leading daily, the fifth editor he has fired in his two years in office. In February, Slobodan Milosevic shut down Serbia's last major independent television station. Many formerly Communist countries now have only state-managed TV news. The broadcasts are eerily reminiscent of the Soviet era, with a half-hour of the national leader signing decrees and greeting foreign guests.
Eastern European governments eager for Western approval use subtler strategies to control the press. These include financial pressures like new taxes, the withholding of advertising and the impounding of delivery trucks. Dangerously broad defamation laws, usually enforced by courts lacking independence, provide jail terms for journalists who damage the image of political leaders. As part of a broad effort to silence critical voices, Croatian authorities have turned a new defamation law against two reporters from the country's most independent paper.
The new generation of authoritarian leaders in these countries is unlikely to warm to the principles of a free press on its own. But some leaders, especially those eager to join European institutions, do respond to pressure. The Council of Europe recently delayed Croatia's application for membership, in part because of President Franjo Tudjman's crackdown on the press. Mr. Tudjman also got a lecture on the issue from Vice President Al Gore in Washington last week. The United States and its European allies must remain insistent that an unfettered press be a condition of partnership.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Show More Strength in the Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict business activity over the next half-year, advanced to the highest level on record in June, a sign the economy could be regaining momentum.
In another report today showing economic strength, the Commerce Department said that the number of homes on which construction was completed in June rose four-tenths of 1 percent from a month earlier, although the more predictive numbers -- housing starts and permits for new construction -- were down in June. 
 "This is an economy that has shown surprising vigor," William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said. "The economy may have somewhat greater potential in the months to come."
The index, which is calculated by the Conference Board, rose a larger-than-expected five-tenths of 1 percent in June to 102.9 after rising a revised two-tenths of 1 percent in May. The business research group estimated a month ago that the index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Rising prices of raw materials and slower deliveries, signs of rising demand from industry and consumers, led the June advance, which was the fifth in a row.
Today's report suggests "the danger of a recession seems fairly remote," David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said.
Low inventories suggest manufacturing activity may accelerate in late 1996 and early 1997 to meet increased demand from consumers, especially during the Christmas shopping season, Mr. Sullivan said.
In the second quarter, the economy was expanding at a 4.2 percent annual rate, the fastest rate in two years, the Commerce Department said last week.
Analysts are estimating the growth rate is slowing to between 2.0 percent and 2.3 percent in the second half, however.
Of the 11 index components, six had a positive effect in June. In addition to rising raw materials prices and slower deliveries, they were: stronger consumer expectations for the economy; an increase in the money supply, a sign more cash is available in the banking system for investment; an increase in the average workweek, to 41.8 hours in June from 41.7 hours in May, and higher stock prices.
Five other index components had a negative effect. They were fewer unfilled factory orders for big-ticket products, a sign of weaker consumer demand; weaker contracts and orders for capital investment; fewer building permits; weaker factory orders for consumer goods, and an increase in average weekly jobless claims to 351,000 in June from 349,000 in May.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity including industrial production, increased five-tenths of 1 percent in June after rising four-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The index of lagging indicators, including consumer credit and business loans, which generally improve or weaken after other parts of the economy, decreased one-tenth of 1 percent during June after rising two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
In another report today, the Commerce Department said the number of homes on which construction was completed in June rose four-tenths of 1 percent from a month earlier.
The total number of homes completed increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.398 million in June from a revised rate of 1.392 million in May.
While housing completions lag behind new construction starts by about six months, more timely reports suggest a spring rise in borrowing costs is weighing on the housing sector.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
For Britain, No 'Chariots of Fire' in '96

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
It has been the worst Olympics since 1952 for Britain, which is limping sadly home today with only 15 medals, just one of them gold. And to the British people, already beaten down by a summer of alarming revelations about so-called mad cow disease, the realization that their country has won fewer gold medals this year than places like Belgium, Ethiopia and Kazakstan is practically the last straw.
In an effort to find someone to blame for what is seen as nothing less than a national disgrace, they are picking the season's most popular target, Prime Minister John Major, whose promise last year of more money for sports seems to have done his country little good in Atlanta. 
 "People can moan that other countries are overtaking us, and I would agree," said Dick Palmer, secretary of the British Olympic Association, in an interview with The Daily Mirror last week. "I have a message for John Major, and I think these Games have already told him: we need money."
It's not just that the athletes have performed badly this year. They have also performed embarrassingly. First, one of Britain's great running stars, Linford Christie, was disqualified from the 100-meter race, a glamour event in which he was the defending champion, after two false starts; he then sulked and refused to leave the track. Then, the men's 4x100-meter relay ended in ignominy when two British runners violated the first rule of a successful relay race: they dropped the baton.
But perhaps the most humiliating event of all took place Sunday, when two unemployed British divers, complaining that they had been impoverished by lack of government support and commercial sponsorship, decided to stand on a street corner in Atlanta and raise money for dinner by selling off some of their Olympic T-shirts, hats and tote bags.
"We are skint," Robert Morgan, Britain's top-ranked diver, told British reporters, using the national slang for "totally broke." Because his annual stipend of $22,500 goes entirely to training, and because his social security benefits were canceled while he competed in Atlanta, he said, he was left with no cash for a relaxing evening on the town. "We are desperate for money, we have no sponsorship and we are selling the gear to have a night out," he said.
It's a far cry from the British Olympic team celebrated in "Chariots of Fire," a film about the 1924 Games in Paris in which gorgeous runners full of noblesse oblige and natural gifts fell all over themselves in an effort to demonstrate their fine sportsmanship.
By contrast, this year's effort has been marked by missed chances and churlish behavior, and finally by a chorus of criticisms directed at the Government for failing to do more to support Britain's athletic programs. No longer can Britain expect its athletes to compete against the heavily subsidized athletes of the world on good manners and raw talent alone, the critics say; what they need is cash.
"If we don't all agree that we must make a serious effort to match the rest of the world," Craig Reedie, the chairman of the British Olympic Association, said in Atlanta on Sunday, "then we may as well put our blazers back on and treat the Olympics as if we are all going off on our holidays, in the hope that one or two naturally talented athletes somehow come through."
Realizing that a poor Olympic showing would look bad for him, as nearly everything seems to do these days, Major two weeks ago announced plans to invest upward of $450 million in lottery money in sports facilities and programs. In addition, he scheduled an emergency post-mortem meeting with the British Olympic Association to discuss what had happened in Atlanta.
But that was not enough for the leader of the opposition Labor Party, Tony Blair, who seized on the issue as a perfect election-year opportunity to make a few grandiose pledges and score a few quick points. "I think we have got to decide from now on that as a country we are going to treat this as a major national priority," he told the British Olympic team in Atlanta, speaking via a satellite link. The Government, he added, should "undertake a review as to what needs to be done and then get on and do it and put some real muscle and effort behind it."
Matthew Pinsent, who with his partner, Steve Redgrave, won Britain's only gold this year, in the coxless pairs rowing event, said in Atlanta that the country needed to abandon its old image of the gentleman sportsman, and start shelling out some cash to its athletes.
"We have a great history of amateur sport, a history of struggling against the odds, of gallant losers, I'm afraid," he said. "We admire people who are gallant in defeat almost more than we admire our winners."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Sydney Organizers Pledge a Different Experience

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Next up for the Summer Olympics: The Down Under Games in Sydney in 2000, to be staged in venues situated along Sydney Harbor during a usually pleasant Australian spring. (And if you believe the weather reports, the average September temperature is 68 degrees.)
The Sydney Games will, its organizers pledge, differ from Atlanta's in several ways: there will be no carnival-like sponsors' enclave; athletes and officials will be able to walk to most venues from a combined village, alleviating many potential transportation nightmares, and the New South Wales state government will finance most new venue construction, including a 115,000-seat Olympic stadium, and cover all debts. 
 That last point is crucial: Atlanta's venue construction was financed privately, from TV rights, sponsorships and licensing. Those areas, enhanced by NBC's well-in-advance $715 million deal, will finance the Sydney organizing committee's operations, not construction.
Every organizing committee likes to say it is prepared, that its airport will be ready, its new roads built in time, its mass transportation system able to accommodate the epic surge of Olympic humanity.
But as the Atlanta experience amply proved, every transportation, technology or security problem cannot be predicted. "Be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances, from reacting to crowd flow to managing your financial forecasts," said A. D. Frazier, chief operating officer for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
Sydney's organizing committee watched as the Atlanta committee operated, stumbled and adapted over the 17-day Olympiad. "The biggest lesson we've learned here was the more you can put into early preparation the better you'll be down the track," said Mal Hemmerling, the chief executive of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games.
He added: "The surprise is the effect of layering the Olympics over the infrastructure of a city and the effect it has on the city. Sydney is much larger than Atlanta and we won't have a lot of the problems that Atlanta had. In Atlanta, they put 600,000 people downtown every day in a city that was not designed for that."
Sydney will not have to cope with record crowds that choked sidewalks, stadiums and the rail system. Similar numbers of athletes, news media and officials are expected in Sydney, but organizers will make only 5.5 million tickets available, half of what Atlanta organizers offered for sale.
When the final tally is in, an Atlanta official said today, 8.6 million of the 11 million tickets made available are expected to have been sold, a record. Bob Brennan, the Atlanta press chief, said 6.2 million sales in was originally projected, then that figure was revised upward. The 8.6 million tickets sold, Brennan said, would exceed even the revised projection.
The pipe-bombing in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park that killed one woman and injured 111 raised the consciousness about security in Sydney and in Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake City, sites of the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics, as well as in the 11 cities vying for the right to be host to the 2004 Summer Games.
"We've taken it very seriously," Hemmerling said. "It's one of our most developed areas." But is a relatively isolated island nation with little history of combatting terrorism ready? "True, we have a very low incidence, but it's an issue in our plans," he said.
The cities eager to land the 2004 Summer Games were encamped in Atlanta, forming a sixth Olympic ring on the oval 11th floor of the International Olympic Committee's headquarters hotel. They offered brochures, videos, posters, chocolates and fruit, making their pitch to whomever roamed into their rooms.
An I.O.C. vote on the 2004 games is 13 months away, and the bidders are Rome; Athens; Rio de Janiero; Buenos Aires; Cape Town; Stockholm; Istanbul, Turkey; Lille, France; St. Petersburg (Russia, not Florida); Seville, Spain, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. An I.O.C. vote is 13 months away.
Handicapping the sweepstakes is like scoping out exactas. Atlanta was not a 1996 favorite. Athens was, certainly, as the historic choice for the centennial Games, because it had been the host for the 1896 Games. Various informal samplings of opinion have placed Rome, Stockholm and Cape Town at or near the top of the leader board, but ultimately, the decision will come down to I.O.C. politics. Some pre-vote speculation puts Cape Town atop the favorite list because it would be the first African city to host the Games, with South Africa having returned to Olympic favor in 1992.
The I.O.C. looks with pleasure upon cities that have government financial backing. Worried about an overdependence on private-sector fund-raising, and the commercialism that comes with it, bidding cities cannot hurt themselves by having government support.
"It is not required, but we'll take it into consideration," said Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president. And the Atlanta Committee's Frazier added: "I'm not sure any other economy in the world can sustain the private investment we've made here."
The next step is for I.O.C. members to visit each city, then for the bid groups to appear next spring before an evaluation committee that will narrow the field to four or five.
"The I.O.C. owns the brand and are looking for the best franchisee," said Bjorn Unger, the executive vice president of the Stockholm bid.
Yevgeniya Alexeeva, one of the people pitching St. Petersburg's long-shot bid, said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has promised $3 billion to stage the Summer Olympics. Even in economically depressed Russia, Alexeeva said: "The Olympics are the best thing to spend money on. Most of the venues will be built regardless of the Olympics. We need this."
Now, regarding Pittsburgh, which wants the 2012 Games: it already has a Web site.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Trickery

 BODY:
Bob Dole's tax-cut plan is a politically bold if irresponsible ploy to resurrect his campaign. The 15 percent across-the-board tax cut is big enough to win voters' attention and excite their greed. With this move, Mr. Dole is hoping to put some spark in his campaign and cast President Clinton as a guardian of the Government programs the Republicans have yet to dismantle.
Mr. Dole proposes to cut personal income taxes by 15 percent, reduce the top tax on capital gains -- profit on the sale of stocks and bonds -- from 28 percent to 14 percent and reverse tax hikes, proposed by Mr. Clinton in 1993, on Social Security benefits. Mr. Dole, long an advocate of fiscal prudence, says that it is possible to pay for these cuts without throwing the budget out of whack -- first through spending cuts, then through faster economic growth. Both assumptions are unrealistic. 
The tax cut, Mr. Dole says, will cost $550 billion. Of this, he would find $50 billion by further cuts in discretionary spending by the year 2002 -- on top of the $70 billion the G.O.P. has already proposed to cut. That would require chopping about 35 percent out of everything the Government does outside of entitlement programs like Medicare -- from law enforcement to highway construction. Since Congress could barely muster the courage to cut mohair subsidies, it could take until 3002, not 2002, to meet Mr. Dole's spending targets. If somehow Mr. Dole managed to defy Congressional history and get his cuts, he would do irreparable harm to the economy.
In addition to these faults, the budget numbers are excessively optimistic. Mr. Dole's projections assume that the tax cuts will boost the economy's growth rate much faster than conventional estimates would suggest is possible. Of the $550 billion package of tax cuts, about $450 billion involve rate cuts on workers and investors -- the only kind that spur growth. Yet Mr. Dole assumes a revenue windfall from faster growth of about $150 billion. That assumes that about 33 percent of the original revenue loss will be recovered through faster growth, which is about twice as much as serious research would say is likely to occur.
Economists have found that small tax cuts -- Mr. Dole's would raise take-home pay by about 5 percent -- would produce very small increases in work effort, savings and investment. Mr. Dole's backers suggest that 5 percent is nothing to sneer at. While gains in personal income are important, they are not the only measure of an economic policy. The question that must be engaged is whether there is a reasonable balance between income and public needs.
The Federal deficit is temporarily low and falling -- lower, as a percentage of G.D.P., than that of any other major industrialized country. But by every account, the deficit threatens to soar as baby boomers retire, collecting Medicare and Social Security. By cutting Federal programs to pay for a tax cut today, Mr. Dole makes it that much harder tomorrow to pass any tax hikes and spending cuts needed to offset the looming deficits. Even aside from the suspicious accounting, the Dole budget is massively wrong in its general psychological thrust. One benefit of Mr. Clinton's emphasis on deficit reduction is that voters know there is no magical substitute for fiscal discipline. By holding out false hopes of a tax-cut panacea, Mr. Dole risks a reversal of these gains in public understanding.
Washington owes voters a menu of prudent spending programs balanced by the taxes needed to pay for them. What Mr. Dole would give voters is a huge tax cut with a promise of spending cuts that are either illusory or destructive.

HEADLINE: At Corporate Ground Zero;
AT&T Partition and Layoffs Open Torrents of Regional Change

SERIES: A GIANT IN MOTION: Surviving corporate reinvention

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
When AT&T embarked last fall on its one-year journey of discovery, dismemberment and downsizing, the company's 60,000 employees and their families in the New York metropolitan region were at the epicenter of a corporate earthquake.
But the shock wave did not stop at the company's front gate. What AT&T began in its drive to divide and remake itself has taken on a momentum of its own, changing lives and local businesses, altering perceptions about jobs and careers, and rewriting the equation for how the pieces of the regional economy might fit together as the communications revolution advances. 
 The wave was felt by the students at Lord Stirling Elementary School in New Brunswick, N.J., who saw many AT&T volunteers suddenly disappear from their classrooms. Some volunteers had been laid off or transferred. Others withdrew from the program, squeezed by time and longer work hours as they scrambled to hold onto their jobs.
It was felt by Jill Wagner-King, whose new assignment was as a spy. Her target: AT&T.
She watches the company's every new move from a second-floor command station, "the Bunker," at the New Haven headquarters of Southern New England Telephone, the Connecticut telecommunications company. Every morning at 8, she briefs top executives about the last 24 hours' developments on the telecommunication war's field of battle, where the two companies are fighting for long-distance customers.
It was felt in the unpolished confines of the small Manhattan computer software company Ex Machina. Last month the company managed to lure away a top AT&T Internet programmer, Paul S. R. Chisholm, who gave up a private office and a 10-minute commute for two hours on the train, a cinderblock wall for a view and a spot on the ground floor of a growing company.
Mr. Chisholm, who joined AT&T as a college graduate 15 years ago, said his choice would have seemed wild in the old, regulated monopoly days of Ma Bell. But he said he thought that by introducing waves of constant change into its once static culture, AT&T has opened a kind of Pandora's Box that cannot now be closed. Change has become a force in its own right. New rules issued last week by the Federal Communications Commission encouraging local telephone competition promise to hasten the pace further still.
"I found myself adapting to change so well that I started to say, 'How much change can I handle?' " Mr. Chisholm said. "So here I am."
This is the story of what happened outside AT&T when the floodgates of change opened within. One corporate decision has had a variety of effects, from Silicon Valley, where companies have been quietly recruiting AT&T talent and buying up small New Jersey companies to gain a foothold in an evolving telecommunications market, to Dayton, Ohio, where one of Sajid Malhotra's first calls upon arriving from his former life at AT&T and New Jersey to his new job at an AT&T breakaway company was to the first Indian restaurant he could find in the phone book. He needed a taste of home.
The company opened this new chapter last September, when it said that it would break up the company into three components: AT&T for telecommunications service, Lucent Technologies for hardware and the NCR Corporation for computers.
Three months later, the company announced that 40,000 jobs, 13 percent of its work force, would be eliminated. That number has since been muted by an increase in hiring, especially at AT&T and Lucent, and especially in the New York area.
AT&T now has slightly more employees in the New York region than it did at the beginning of the year, despite the 17,000 voluntary buyouts and layoffs worldwide. Lucent has shed 6,000 jobs, but has reduced its work force in New Jersey by only about 100 or 200 from its base of 17,500 in January, a spokeswoman said.
The job changes within the companies have been uneven as well, creating a checkerboard of effects as some divisions are decimated while neighboring business units clamor for new workers. The administrative offices in Basking Ridge, N.J., for example, have been the scene of deep bloodletting as middle-management ranks are thinned. But Mr. Chisholm, the programmer, said that his former corner of the company had seen only growth.
But the job numbers also mask what economists and local business people say is a much deeper shift. In a region still finding a new footing after the deep recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, AT&T has become a symbol of the uncertainty about what comes next. Whether it grows or shrinks, the company is in motion, and taking a significant portion of the region's economy along for the trip.
"There's a whole bunch of uncertainty, and for the region, that's good," said Roderick K. Randall, a former AT&T researcher who founded his own company, Teleos Communications, in 1987, in Eatontown, N.J. Teleos was bought out by Madge Networks, a San Jose communications company, in February.
"Any time there is uncertainty, the venture capitalists come in and say, 'Isn't there a company in this?' " said Mr. Randall, now a vice president at Madge.
But that uncertainty, despite the opportunity it presents, runs against years of ingrained traditions -- not to mention high costs and taxes -- that have given the New York region a poor reputation as a place for a new business.
AT&T itself has been responsible for some of that image. Until fairly recently, it epitomized stodgy stability and the lifetime job.
Because of its huge base in the New York region -- and especially in New Jersey, where it has long been the state's largest private employer -- those traits became a cornerstone of both the local business community and the work force as well: educated, conservative, hierarchical. The entrepreneurial spirit and market savvy that built places like Silicon Valley in California and Route 128 around Boston found shallow soil in the land of rigid giants like AT&T.
The question now is whether a leaner, faster AT&T can drive forward the very forces it once inhibited. In recent months, Lucent Technologies, from its new headquarters in the old Bell Labs complex in Murray Hill, N.J., has said it hopes to foster an entrepreneural spirit inside and outside the company.
Company researchers will be given greater economic incentives, while the research itself will be moved faster to the marketplace, changing its pace and its outlook. AT&T has also said it would seek partners for new ventures.
"We're trying to create a venture capital mentality, a Silicon Valley feel," said Carly Fiorina, an executive vice president for corporate operations at Lucent. "We're trying to bring the marketplace and the technical talent closer together."
How the world views AT&T and the New York region may be harder to change. High technology, however hip and futuristic it may be, is rife with old biases and prejudices, said Jim Swartz, the managing partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in Princeton and San Francisco. Investing in a technology firm in New Jersey is one thing, but hiring the next superstar programmer, or luring talent from another company, is simply easier if you have a California address.
Mr. Swartz said: "People say, 'New Jersey or New York or Connecticut or Pennsylvania -- my God, if I go there, it's the end of the earth. I'll have no one to talk to.' "
 
Changing Lives
A Little Chat With the I-Man
Don Imus was bad-mouthing Southern New England Telephone, reading advertising copy for AT&T on his morning drive-time radio show in a typically sardonic fashion that made S.N.E.T. officials wince.
The Bunker swung into action. Within 24 hours a plan of counterattack was drawn up and a team assembled.
"The next morning, we had a chat with the I-man," said Ms. Wagner-King, S.N.E.T.'s first-ever director of Operation Win Connecticut, a position that was created last October. She said that Mr. Imus was less disrespectful of the company after that.
Tough talk and swagger is part of the new competitive culture in the New York region, as companies brace for full competition in local telephone service, a market that AT&T plans to enter this fall in Connecticut, followed quickly by New York and New Jersey.
At S.N.E.T., Ms. Wagner-King combs the classified ads, looking for evidence of hiring by AT&T. Company employees around the state have been put on notice to call her office at once if they hear anything, especially a new marketing campaign, that AT&T might be beginning.
Other companies have been thrown into competitive motion as well. Since the break-up was announced last year, Cisco Systems, in San Jose, has quadrupled its work force in New Jersey, with 15 new hires just this year working on selling network systems to AT&T. That business was once an entirely internal affair, with one AT&T division buying from another, but it has been thrown open to competitive bidding as Lucent, the hardware supplier, has separated.
Other California companies, like the 3Com Corporation in Santa Clara, a provider of data networking equipment, have bought their way in, establishing their own beachheads in the changed climate. In the 18 months since 3Com purchased a small Holmdel, N.J., company called Access Works Inc., the work force there more than tripled, from 12 to 40 people.
"In general, that's a bellwether of what's going on," said Reginald Best, the general manager for remote access products at 3Com's Holmdel office. "With convergence of computing and communications and networking, companies are finding they need to have a broadened expertise within the company."
But Mr. Best said the scale could just as easily have tipped the other way, toward California's favor and not New Jersey's, if the company had decided simply to hire the people it needed and move them west.
One factor, he said, was his employer's close relationship with AT&T, which has become a partner with 3Com in a project. The new Lucent relationship is even more complicated. "3Com buys specialty fabricated silicon from Lucent, and then, on the services side, they're one of our customers," he said.
In town halls across New Jersey, watching the shifting balance has become a new avocation for municipal officials whose tax base and, perhaps, their own jobs depend on reading the tea leaves of AT&T or Lucent.
The Murray Hill section of Berkeley Heights, for example, has gone this year from being simply the home of Bell Labs to the headquarters community for an instant huge new corporation, Lucent Technologies. The town's Mayor, Harold Weideli Jr., said the new dynamism can be a bit jolting.
"We have a history of being able to react when we know the situation," Mr. Weideli said. But all he has now is guesses. "Anything Lucent does has a huge impact on us," he said.
 
Altering Perceptions
Breaking Up Isn't So Hard to Do
Mr. Malhotra and his wife, Shalini, and their daughter, Rhea, who turned 1 in June, had never lived anywhere but the New York area since arriving from India 15 years ago. They had relatives in New Jersey. They both had jobs at AT&T and the prospect, it appeared, of advancement.
They both quit, and in June moved to Dayton, where Mr. Malhotra took a job as the director of investor relations at the NCR Corporation, generally considered the weakest of the AT&T spinoffs. The company, now at 38,600, has already cut over 8,000, and its long-term survival, analysts say, is still not guaranteed.
Mr. Malhotra agrees that he took a risk. What has happened, though, he said, is that the calculation of risk itself has changed. As AT&T has become a less predictable place to be, he said, all other options must now be considered in that new light.
"Staying back with AT&T would have been a calculated risk, too," he said. "When I weighed the risk -- a new place, starting from scratch, building a support structure -- I started to think of it less and less as a gamble."
Although AT&T has changed considerably in the 12 years since the breakup of the old Bell system, it never quite shook the idea that AT&T was materially different from the rest of the world and that a job there was somehow more stable. The illusion has now been shattered, employees and former employees say.
That is expected to make the company faster in reacting to changes in its business, but it also eliminates forever the old mentality of its empire days, that all the world would work for AT&T if it could, and that nobody would ever think of quitting.
Simply put, former employees say, breaking up has become easier for them too. With the corporate trivestiture, as it is called, and the resulting crush of competing companies looking to do business with or compete with AT&T, Lucent or NCR, opportunities beckon.
"I saw a lot of people say, 'Hey, the benefits are just like any other company, the salary is just like any other company, if I don't like what I'm doing here, I'm going to leave,' " said Vince LeDonne, an engineer who quit this spring to work for Cisco Systems. "AT&T has got to recognize that and come up with other ways to motivate their employees."
Industry experts say that California high technology companies are changing as well in a way that will further put AT&T employees, researchers especially, in their sights.
"It used to be how hard people worked, then it was who has the best connections, the next edge is getting people who are used to thinking really far in advance," said Alan Huang, a former Bell Labs department head who is now trying to start his own high technology company in California. "It's going to be bad for AT&T because people are going to realize that they have market value," he said. "They're going to be sucked out of there."
That kind of instability, though, is just the kind of environment that Lawrence West needs to survive. He left Bell Labs about 18 months ago, before the breakup announcement, and now runs a small start-up company in Wall Township.
"In my first year, I'm not breaking even," he said. "But I've hired three people from Bell Labs already."
 
New Economy
Drums of Growth Along the Hudson
Even as AT&T breaks apart, the underlying technology of its business is coalescing and recombining in new forms. Formerly distinct industries like telephones and television and computers and entertainment programming are all merging, business analysts say. The question is what companies and regions will get the benefits or suffer the losses.
In the New York area, another added variable is the Hudson River; specifically, what happens on either side of it.
New Jersey, on the western bank, is one of the great communications centers of the nation, rich in engineering talent, history, and technical expertise, with AT&T and Lucent as its fountainheads. The New York side offers entertainment, advertising and, in a more nascent stage, software and internet communications in the lower Manhattan area known as Silicon Alley.
Industry analysts are cautiously optimistic for both river banks as the communications revolution unfolds, because what they share is greater than what divides them: Both are based on information going from point A to point B.
"Any economy that is as communications intensive as the New York metro area is going to feel, I think, a pretty robust impact," said Scott Wright, a telecommunications industry analyst at Argus Research in New York. "Despite the consolidations, the net-net will be an increase in communications related jobs."
Mr. Wright forsees a growing "symbiotic relationship" between the New Jersey-based technical network builders and the New York-based content suppliers.
"The hardware guys, the technicians, will be creating this network over time and making capacity available on which the creative people can ride, and as the content becomes more interesting, there is more demand for content, which requires more capacity, which invites more applications," he said. "They depend on eachother."
But even optimists do not expect the ride to be at all that smooth. With long-distance companies like AT&T going back into local phone services and local companies like Nynex and Bell Atlantic going into long distance service -- and merging with each other at the same time -- each is expected to eat into each other's main businesses as never before.
"Technology also means that you need fewer people to do the same jobs," said Bette Ann Massick Colombo, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Company. On the other hand, she added, "that trend is being counterbalanced by new companies entering these markets, so while you may need fewer operators and marketing reps, you may need more back office people. It's unclear how the balance is going to end."
For people like Mr. Chisholm, who have crossed the Hudson River barrier, the hurdles of his first week on the job were tricky too, but more concrete.
"I'm just trying not to say AT&T whenever I pick up the phone," he said.
 
The Series So Far
The reorganization of AT&T and its impact on the company, its employees and the metropolitan region will be examined by Times reporters in occasional articles in the next year. The previous article, on May 12, explored how the company was reorganizing and how workers responded.

HEADLINE: Sales of Cars and Light Trucks Slow from Torrid Pace

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Auto sales in the United States have entered the doldrums, with sales of cars and light trucks slowing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.3 million vehicles in July, down from a 15.1 million pace in June and a torrid 15.8 million pace in May.
The Ford Motor Company, the last big auto maker to release its July sales figures, today reported flat sales. Car sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent, while sales of Ford's sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks fell four-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The slack numbers are consistent with other statistics showing that the pace of economic growth slowed at the beginning of the third quarter after a torrid second quarter in which the economy grew at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent.
"We are settling down to what I would consider to be a more sustainable pace for the next several quarters," said Jack V. Kirnan, an automotive analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
Still, last month's sales slightly exceeded the results of a fairly weak July last year. Since then, strong growth in jobs and rising wages have given many Americans the money to buy new cars and trucks. Sales of light vehicles rose 1 percent from the period a year ago based on a daily selling rate. There were 26 selling days last month, but 25 in July 1995.
Continuing the trend of recent years, car sales were weak -- they dropped 2.4 percent -- but sales of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks were strong. Sales of these high-profit light trucks rose 5.8 percent.
Indeed at Ford, sales of popular pickups and sport utility vehicles were held back by shortages, not by a lack of demand. Ford is increasing the number of factories building its F-series pickups.
"By the end of August, we'll have four assembly plants producing the new full-size pickups, so that our dealers will be able to begin satisfying the backlog of demand," said Robert L. Rewey, group vice president of marketing and sales for Ford Automotive Operations.
Some outside factors held down the July numbers, analysts said. "The CNN effect" was at work, said Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter. "Dealers report that showroom traffic fell after T.W.A. Flight 800 exploded and the bomb was set off at Atlanta's Centennial Park," he said.
Others blame the Commerce Department. Last month's sales rose 1 percent on a daily selling rate basis compared with July 1995 figures. But the Commerce Department's seasonal adjustment factors show that sales fell. Car and light-truck sales dropped from a seasonally adjusted pace of 14.5 million vehicles last year to 14.3 million vehicles last month, according to the Commerce Department's formula for seasonal adjustments.
Also today, the Chrysler Corporation announced rebates for a handful of its 1997 model cars and vans.
The 1997 Dodge and Plymouth Neon will carry a $500 rebate, while last year's model has a $1,000 rebate. The same goes for the Eagle Talon, Dodge Avenger, Chrysler Sebring Coupe, Plymouth Breeze, Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus, Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde LX and Eagle Vision ESi.
Some 1997 Dodge Ram models will carry rebates of $500 to $1,000, compared with rebates of $600 to $1,600 for the 1996 models.
Chrysler depends less on car sales and more on high-profit light-truck sales than Ford, the General Motors Corporation and most foreign auto makers. So it can afford to offer rebates on cars because tougher price competition in that segment of the market puts less pressure on its bottom line.
"Chrysler took some of the phenomenal profits it earned on trucks and is pouring them into cars," Mr. Glantz said.
Auto dealers said that July was a little slow.
"I think it was slow all over," said J. Renz Edwards, a Ford dealer on the outskirts of Kansas City, Mo. "I don't think anybody had a killer month, but we'll make money."
Mr. Edwards, who sells mostly trucks, said that sport utility vehicle sales were steady. The redesigned 1997 Ford Escort is selling well at his dealership, but the 1997 F-150 pickup is the real star.
"They are usually gone within a day," Mr. Edwards said. Last month, "I had a couple of guys fighting over a blue flare-side," he said, referring to a pickup truck.
Michael R. Cook, a Chicago-area Buick and Mazda dealer, blames the Olympics for his disappointing sales.
"People sat home and watched TV instead of coming into the showrooms," he said. "There is a general funk in the marketplace."
Sales were especially slow for the Buick Park Avenue and Riviera, Mr. Cook said. But that may be partly because buyers are waiting for 1997 models due out this fall.
"We are taking orders" for the redesigned Park Avenue, Mr. Cook said. He has sold eight, even though he does not expect to see one on the showroom floor until October. "Some of the models we have are lame ducks," he said, and that may account for slower sales. In the spring, he will begin selling Buick's redesigned Century and Regal models.

HEADLINE: Aiwa Plans A Production Shift to Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5

 BODY:
In a sign that the movement of Japanese factories offshore may be slowing as the yen weakens, the Aiwa Company, an electronics maker, said today that it was bringing part of its production back to Japan from Malaysia and other Asian countries.
The decision by Aiwa is striking because the company was one of the earliest and most aggressive of Japanese companies in moving its manufacturing out of Japan in search of lower costs in the late 1980's. About 90 percent of the company's production is now outside its home country. 
 But Aiwa said it would now shift some production of small tabletop stereos, its best-known product, back to Japan. About 70 percent of the so-called mini-component stereo systems that the company will sell in Japan will be made in Japan this fiscal year, compared with only 10 percent last year. Products destined for the United States or other countries will still be made mainly in Malaysia.
Norio Kawamoto, an Aiwa spokesman, said one reason for the move was that the weakening of the yen against the dollar had made it less disadvantageous to manufacture in Japan. The dollar is now worth about 107 yen, compared with as few as 80 yen a little more than a year ago.
The move by Aiwa, in which the Sony Corporation owns a controlling stake, could be a signal that the recent sharp declines in Japan's trade surplus will slow, or perhaps even reverse, if the yen stays at its current level or weakens further.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus, as measured in yen, plunged 40.1 percent in the first six months of 1996 from a year earlier. One reason is that many Japanese companies, partly in response to the sharp rise of the yen that began in 1993, have been moving production offshore. Japanese exports of goods such as cars and VCR's have fallen while reverse imports -- products made in Japanese-owned factories abroad and imported back into Japan -- have swelled.
Still, many economists say they expect the offshore migration of Japanese industries to continue, keeping downward pressure on the trade surplus. Costs in Japan are still higher than in many other countries, they say. In addition, some of the movement is intended not to lower costs but to tap into new markets or avoid trade barriers.
Mr. Kawamoto, the Aiwa spokesman, said the move back to Japan was being done partly for strategic reasons. The company wants to focus more on sophisticated and profitable products, such as stereos incorporating mini-disk players, whose components are available only in Japan.
Other Japanese companies have also recently began focusing more on domestic production. A subsidiary of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the world's largest consumer electronics company, has brought the manufacturing of some fax machines back to Japan from Southeast Asia. Hitachi Ltd., which used to purchase finished desktop personal computers from a company in Taiwan, recently began importing subunits and assembling the computers in Japan. That change, however, was made largely to be able to react more quickly to changing demand in Japan.

Ford Reports Flat Sales, As Industry Hits Doldrums
Ford reported flat sales for July, with car sales rising modestly and those of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks falling. Ford's announcement came after the other major auto makers also reported disappointing sales, signaling that auto sales in the United States had slowed this summer. [Page D4.]

Leading Economic Indicators Rise
The index of leading indicators rose a larger-than-expected five-tenths of 1 percent, to 102.9 in June, the highest level on record, a sign the economy could be regaining momentum. Separately, the Commerce Department said that the number of homes on which construction was completed in June rose four-tenths of 1 percent from a month earlier. [D4.]
 
Clinton Signs Sanctions Law
President Clinton signed a law to impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran or Libya, which he described as "supporters of terrorism," despite the objections of France, Germany and other trading partners. France warned that the European Union would retaliate. [A1.]
 
Holding the Chips in Private Hands
The new semiconductor agreement reached by the United States and Japan transfers some of the role played by the two Governments under their previous accord to a private group, which could make chip buyers uneasy. [D3.]
 
U.S. Order-Colonial Data to Merge
U.S. Order, which makes so-called smart phones, has agreed to merge with the Colonial Data Technologies Corporation. [D2.]
 
Dole Proposes 15% Tax Cut
Bob Dole proposed cutting taxes by 15 percent across the board, with a top rate on capital gains of 14 percent, and balancing the budget by 2002. Democrats called the plan irresponsible. [A1.]
 
Aiwa Comes Home Again
Aiwa, a Japanese electronics maker, with about 90 percent of its output abroad, is bringing part of its production back to Japan from Malaysia and other Asian countries, a result of the yen's weakening. [D3.]
 
Stock Prices Slip on Profit Taking
Even with trading enlivened by big merger deals, stocks snapped a four-day winning streak. Mild profit taking erased 5.55 points from the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 5,674.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.39 points, to 1,120.53. [D8.]
 
Treasury securities' prices fell in quiet trading, as the market prepared for this week's sale of $39 billion in new issues. The 30-year bond's yield rose to 6.76 percent. [D15.]
 
Attitudes Change and Clothing Sales Fall
As American women's attitudes toward clothes changed in the last few years -- away from the extreme and toward clothes that could be worn both to work and to P.T.A. meetings -- many apparel companies failed to notice, and some have suffered. Sales of women's apparel in the United States fell 12 percent, from the record $84 billion set in 1989 to $73 billion last year, and some companies are only now adjusting to this jilt from women. [A1.]
 
New Chief for Penguin Books
Pearson P.L.C. named a Hollywood executive to head its Penguin Group book publishing arm and also reported a 40 percent drop in profits for the first half of the year. [D7.]
 
$1.2 Billion Offer for Iowa Utility
The MidAmerican Energy Company made a $1.2 billion offer to buy IES Industries in a deal that would bring together the two biggest utilities in Iowa. [D2.]

HEADLINE: San Diego Buying Water -- and Its Freedom

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Ever since World War II, San Diego has chafed at being almost completely dependent for fresh water on a regional monopoly largely controlled by its nemesis, Los Angeles.
It was a marriage of inconvenience, a consequence of living on an arid coastal plain where control over water -- which has to be shipped in through hundreds of miles of aqueducts -- is power. 
 San Diego has finally fired the first shot in a campaign for its own source of power. Two weeks ago the city announced that it had reached a draft agreement to buy several billion gallons of water from a new source, farmers in the Imperial Valley some 120 miles to the east and beyond the reach of the Los Angeles-based government monopoly, the Metropolitan Water District.
City leaders characterized the move as a prudent step to diversify the water supply in this drought-prone region. But most Californians recognized it as a brash assertion of independence.
"We're finally taking our own destiny in our hands," the general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority, Maureen Stapleton, said. "Maybe we're, quote, growing up."
Mayor Susan Golding was blunter in describing the effect of the deal. "It purely is a question of power and control," Mayor Golding said. "Water is the basis of economics here. If we do this, they lose some control."
The draft agreement is already being fiercely resisted, and not just by the water lords of Los Angeles. Some residents of the Imperial Valley complained that it would turn productive farmers into water merchants by encouraging big landowners to leave land fallow and resell allocations of water delivered here at subsidized rates.
Some farmers are also suspicious of the huge profits the water sales would earn for the Bass brothers of Fort Worth, billionaires who have bought 40,000 acres of farmland in the valley in recent years, apparently in anticipation of such an agreement.
"This agreement really breaks us down into two groups," said Don Cox, a retired farmer who opposes the deal and is a member of the board of the valley's water authority. "There are the people who think we really need to just make ourselves more efficient in using our water, and those that want to be paid for not growing something."
Not surprisingly, the Metropolitan Water District, known as the Met, has denounced the plan as a threat to billions of dollars in reservoirs, aqueducts and dams that have been built to carry water from the Colorado River and to the additional billions of dollars that are being spent to improve the system.
So the water district is playing hardball.
San Diego is counting on the Met to deliver new supplies from the Imperial Valley using surplus capacity in its aqueducts. Constructing a new aqueduct to the valley, which gets its water from the Colorado River, would cost San Diego up to $3.5 billion and take, perhaps, 15 years.
The Met has said that it will cooperate only upon payment of fees that San Diego has characterized as prohibitive.
"I've heard people in San Diego say, 'We're not a subdivision, we're a major city, and every major city has its own water supply,' " the general manager of the Met, John R. Wodraska, said in an interview. "Well, people are going to have to make a decision on how much more they're willing to pay for this independence."
The development of Southern California, a desertlike region of 16 million people, has long been dominated by hard-edged water politics, memorialized in the movie "Chinatown." Indeed, the current intercity conflict is rooted in the late 19th century, said Steven P. Erie, a professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego who is writing a book on the region's infrastructure.
Los Angeles began to assert its dominance back then by beating out San Diego to become the western terminus for the Southern Pacific railroad. As a result, Los Angeles developed a far larger port.
Los Angeles was later able to finance construction of a 340-mile aqueduct that carried fresh water from the Owens Valley in far east-central California, fueling the city's growth. That remains Los Angeles's principal water supply. The Met was formed in 1928 to control water carried to the area through a 242-mile aqueduct from a second source, the Colorado River, which was dammed thanks, in part, to Federal financing.
The states of the Southwest have fought bitterly over access to the Colorado River, and an elaborate series of laws and agreements involving Federal, state and local governments now controls the distribution of its water. The agreements give priority to farmers in certain dry areas like the Imperial Valley and to urban areas like Los Angeles.
The Met became a water wholesaler, the nation's largest, paying for supplies sent to the region and then selling them to local water authorities throughout Southern California. Los Angeles has still retained control over the Met supplies as an insurance policy.
As part of the mobilization in World War II, San Diego, now the nation's sixth-largest city, with 1.2 million people, had to give up some rights to Colorado River water and rely on the Met instead. The city now gets about 90 percent of its water from the Met and is the district's largest customer, using 25 percent of the annual supply.
Some local water authorities in San Diego have complained that the county, from which they buy their supplies, is bidding so aggressively for the Imperial Valley water that it may price farmers out of the market.
"My farmers can't pay the same price as the people in downtown San Diego or Beverly Hills," said Gary Arant, who runs the Valley Center Municipal Water District, a predominantly agricultural area in northern San Diego County.
Some Imperial Valley residents say they also fear that the only way to free up so much water will be for substantial stretches of farmland to be left fallow, costing jobs.
The deal's proponents in the valley argue that the water sold to San Diego would be made available through conservation. It does not help, however, that perhaps the largest beneficiary of the plan would be the Bass brothers, who started buying land, and water rights, in the Imperial Valley several years ago.
"They came down here to buy up the ground and sell off the water," Mr. Cox said. "It's going to kill a lot of jobs and hurt a lot of people. It's really a transfer of wealth."
Concern about the brothers' role in the proposed agreement was heightened by the recent release of a stinging report from a county grand jury that criticized unnecessary secrecy in the negotiations by the Imperial Irrigation District, the government authority handling the transaction.
The grand jury also said that the authority and the Basses had had unreported continuing contacts and that "while the idea of a water transfer-sale is not new, the proposed magnitude and dollar value of the most recent proposal appears to have been greatly influenced by the Bass brothers."
The water district has denied any undue influence. Mike Clinton, its general manager, said, "The Basses have been active, but I've seen others equally active."
The managers of Western Farms, owned by the Basses, did not return calls for comment.
At the very least, the plan's opponents are pleading for additional time to examine how water for resale could be conserved. But the plan's backers say they must seize the opportunity now.
"When I hear about this window-of-opportunity stuff, that's when I get real nervous," said Louise Willey, who farms 3,000 acres in the valley and heads a coalition opposing the sales. "Well, we just signed up a bunch at the Rotary Club today. So now we're up to about 200 members. We're all concerned that they're rushing us into this. In this country, you just don't rush when water is involved."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH SQUEEZE -- A special report.;
Rising Health Costs Threaten Generous Benefits in Europe

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Dr. Philippe Perez, a general practitioner in the Paris suburb of Thiais, used to think nothing of prescribing $500 worth of medicated salve a month for patients with painful herpes infection, because they would be almost completely reimbursed by the French national health insurance system.
But the state-run insurance fund, under Government orders to cut its huge deficit, is now threatening to take high drug costs out of the fees it pays to doctors if they write too many prescriptions. So Dr. Perez explains the problem to his patients, and some of them now pay for the medicine out of their own pockets instead of putting in claims. 
 Peter Konig, a retired post office employee in Bonn, has found that German doctors, too, are becoming more reluctant to prescribe remedies like cough medicine that used to go on the insurance bill. Television in Bonn, he says, is now full of advertising pitches to get people to buy over-the-counter remedies that used to be reimbursable by insurance.
In Britain, more than half of the general practitioners in the National Health Service now have budgets they cannot overspend for patients' medicines and hospital care, forcing them to think twice or bargain hard with hospitals and surgeons about the costs.
The high level of health care offered by the welfare states of Western Europe was long the envy of much of the rest of the world, but they can no longer afford the vast amounts required to pay for unlimited benefits.
So in country after country, administrators are turning to the same kinds of market-oriented cost-control measures used by managed care companies and health maintenance organizations in the United States, and raising many of the same ethical concerns.
The techniques include measures like encouraging hospitals to compete with each other in offering value for money, pressing doctors to follow the most cost-effective treatment methods and to order expensive tests only when necessary, and using computers to monitor their compliance.
Just like Americans, Europeans are being forced to think about what comprehensive medical care costs, something that never worried them before.
 
Britain
Tories Introducing Dose of Competition
The debate, and the pressures to hold down costs, are most intense in Britain, where the Government provides all health care, at a total cost of $61.8 billion this year.
British Conservative governments have been cutting taxes since the late 1980's. The state is still providing more money for the Health Service, but is also putting it under tremendous pressure to squeeze as much as it can out of every penny.
Since the early 1990's, the Conservatives have been introducing the idea of competition into the system, giving hospitals and doctors' practices limited control of their funds and urging doctors to shop for the best hospital service they can find.
In a sense, many general practitioners have formed what amount to independent health maintenance organizations that then negotiate contracts with hospitals and surgeons, much the way American H.M.O.'s do.
The system now involves about 433 such hospital "trusts" and about half the general practitioners in the country, and they are rapidly changing the way health care is provided in Britain, both for better and worse.
Dr. James N. Johnson, a vascular surgeon at a district hospital in Cheshire, took a dim view of one recent experience.
"There was a practice of four G.P.'s who wanted a contract that would let them come in on ward rounds with the specialists and tell us when we could discharge patients," Dr. Johnson said.
"They clearly saw this as a way of controlling their hospital admissions costs," Dr. Johnson said. "We told them to get lost, and they took their business to another place."
While a health maintenance organization might use the money saved to increase profits, British doctors who administer their own budgets can spend it only on equipment or other services, like drugs.
But since British general practitioners usually own their practices and can sell them before retirement, critics of the Government's measures say there is a built-in temptation for doctors to scrimp at the expense of their patients' welfare to build up nest eggs.
Hospitals, under a Government-imposed mandate to perform 2.25 percent more services a year without an increase in their budgets, often do it, critics say, by closing wards and multiplying services on the ones left open.
According to figures supplied by the opposition Labor Party and not disputed by the Government, 50,000 nursing jobs and 60,000 beds have disappeared since 1990, while there has been an increase of 20,000 senior managers in the Health Service.
Henry McLeish, a Labor Member of Parliament, said, "The Tories tried to turn it into a business; we want to make it a public service again."
But about all Labor plans to do to change things if it wins the next election is to take the $2.25 billion it costs to administer the Government-imposed changes and put it into other ways of improving care, like reducing the number of people on waiting lists for routine operations. The party is no longer proposing big increases in Health Service spending as it did in the last election in 1992.
"Private polls show that most people are happy with the care they get," Mr. McLeish said. "There's no sense of a crisis."
Dr. Johnson, the vascular surgeon, said there would always be pressures to keep health costs from rising as fast as new technology and science allow. "Basically, the only choices are rationing care or raising taxes," he said, "but neither political party has the courage to say it."
 
France
Pressure to Cut Cost of Drugs
The French authorities are determined not to limit health care benefits, but they are circumscribing the freedoms both doctors and patients used to enjoy to make use of them.
French doctors are not state employees, and their bills are only 70 percent reimbursed by the health insurance the Government requires virtually everybody to subscribe to. Over the years, the deductible was raised to encourage people to think twice before going to the doctor, but gradually almost everybody -- 83 percent of the population -- has gone out and acquired supplementary health insurance to cover the gap.
As a result, most French people felt free to go to the doctor as often as they wanted without worrying about the cost. But costs are constantly rising, and the health insurance system has not broken even since the early 1990's. It was nearly $8 billion in the red last year, and is expected to fall about $6.5 billion short this year.
With France facing a 1997 deadline to cut deficits to qualify for a common European currency, something had to give.
So starting this year, the Government will impose limits for the first time on patients' freedom to bypass general practitioners and consult specialists directly, and it is putting heavy pressure on doctors to cut back on the amount and cost of the medicines they prescribe.
The Government also decreed this year that the pharmaceuticals industry had to pay $500 million to the health insurance fund this year as a partly tax-deductible "contribution" in exchange for all the money it made off the system.
According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, France spends twice as much, as a percentage of total health spending, on medicine as the United States.
And it is easy to see how, judging by the experience of Veronique de Rivoire, a Parisian mother of three small children. She visits her pediatrician in Paris at least 10 times a year, she says, and every time she leaves his office, she has at least three prescriptions.
"National insurance pays 65 percent of the cost of the medicine, and my husband's supplementary plan reimburses the rest, so I don't think about the money," she said.
Gerard Rameix, director of the national sickness fund, said, "We had a system based on full employment, with seemingly unlimited resources, that made people think health care was basically free."
This year Prime Minister Alain Juppe ordered that doctors' total expenditures and the value of the medicines they prescribe should rise no faster than inflation, by 2.1 percent.
The results so far show that he might as well have decreed that the Seine flow backward. Costs went up by 6.1 percent in the first five months of the year, and they would have to sink for the rest of the year to meet the target.
One way to get them down would be for the Government to forbid any increase next year in the reimbursements doctors get from the insurance system, and it has threatened to do that. It has also introduced lists of treatments and medicines thought to be most cost-effective. Deviations from the recommendations have to be justified by doctors if health insurance officials check up on them.
Dr. Perez, in Thiais, said: "I don't want to prescribe more medicine than necessary, but I have some patients with AIDS, which requires a lot of very expensive prescriptions. I can save on those bills by sending them to a hospital instead of giving them ambulatory treatment, but that means, if they were still working, that they have to stop and lose their jobs. Is that really in their best interest?
"I wonder how long patients will continue to trust doctors they know have a financial interest in saving money," Dr. Perez said.
To bring tighter management into the National Fund for Sickness Insurance, which covers 81 percent of the population, the Government will begin this fall to issue computer health-care cards to all patients, recording the treatments they receive, the medicines prescribed and bought, and all the other financial details the system never worried about when money was no object.
Mr. Rameix, the fund's director, said: "Our aim is to train our people to manage, rather than just to pay. The main hope is to be able to make sufficient savings by making care more efficient, while not reducing benefits, but our plan could be too little too late."
 
Germany
Government Seeks Reduced Costs
Some of the French measures may have been inspired by what has happened in Germany, where the Government has pushed the health insurance system even farther in the direction of managed care.
"Our system is like a big H.M.O.," said Dr. Gunnar Griesewell of the German Health Ministry in Bonn.
There are 850 "sickness funds" covering the 92 percent of the German population legally required to join them. All are state-regulated non-profit organizations that are supposed to break even.
The system was $4.7 billion in the red last year, and the funds want to raise premiums. But the national average is already close to 13 percent of gross salary, with employers and employees each paying half.
If premiums do not rise, the cost of claims will have to go down, and the Government is pressing doctors and hospitals to lower them.
The sickness funds negotiate fee-reimbursement schedules with regional associations of doctors taking part in the plans, as most do. For the last three years the Government has kept the funds from increasing their rates faster than wages grew.
The Government also decreed that doctors should cut back on the amount of money spent on prescriptions by prescribing generic medicine wherever possible, and by prescribing less medicine in general.
If they exceeded the target, the Government ruled, the excess would come out of the pool that pays their claim fees. And last year the excess was about $1 billion.
Such steps promise to be difficult, for the political consensus on how to pay for health care, pensions and most of the rest of the German welfare state broke down this summer after Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to make $33 billion in public spending cuts over the objections of the Social Democratic opposition, which controls the upper house of Parliament.
Part of the deficit-cutting plan is a 75-cent increase in the small co-payment that patients now make on prescriptions -- $1.50 to about $5 per prescription -- with the rest of the cost paid by health insurance. Even the 75-cent plan has been blocked so far, along with more ambitious proposals to cut health care costs.
The pressures on doctors look likely to continue to increase.
Dr. Joachim Maurer, a general practitioner with a busy practice in Bonn, said he got a computer printout from his regional doctors' association every three months, showing the total cost of all the medicines he had prescribed.
If it exceeds the average for doctors with his type of practice, he gets a warning letter, and if he still exceeds the average after that, he risks taking a cut in his fee reimbursements, which insurance funds pay to the regional doctors' associations.
He uses a thick book of guideline medicine reimbursement prices that tells him exactly how much the sickness funds will pay for thousands of different kinds of medicine. The guidelines have stimulated tremendous growth in the production of cheap generic drugs by German companies, something that worries the pharmaceutical giants.
Thomas Postina, a spokesman for the pharmacy industry in Frankfurt, said, "The Government simply decided at the end of 1992 that doctors should prescribe no more than 25 billion marks worth of medicine." That amount is the equivalent of about $17 billion.
The limit was effective for a while: the value of prescriptions went from $18 billion in 1992 to $14.7 billion in 1993. But now it is rising again.
The Government would also like to reduce the number of practicing doctors, and even the head of the doctors' biggest lobbying association says there are now too many -- about 267,000.
"We get reimbursements from the sickness funds, through the regional doctors' association, according to a point system," Dr. Maurer said. "A house call, for instance, is 400 points. At the beginning of the year, the association estimated that 400 points would be worth 40 marks ($27). But there are too many doctors performing too many services, and since the money pool is finite, it looks as if 400 points will actually be worth only about 24 marks ($16) this year."
"Even a washing machine repairman doesn't make house calls for less than 60 marks ($40) an hour," he observed, but there is a way out -- the private health insurance market.
"I am allowed to charge 83.90 marks ($56) for a house call from a private patient," he said. "I pay my bills with my sickness fund business, but I need private patients to survive."
Private insurance covers only 8 percent of the population -- people with incomes over the maximum for signing up with a sickness fund.
Franz Knieps, an official of a group of sickness funds with 30 million subscribers, said that ultimately the system would have to find ways to give patients an economic interest in lowering health care costs.
"We could negotiate contracts with groups of doctors, and we're hoping to do that in Frankfurt, for instance, and give people a reduction in premiums in exchange for lower rates negotiated with doctors," he said. "Right now the law bars us from doing that."
The Government would also like sickness funds to reduce their premiums by four-tenths of 1 percent next Jan. 1. But as things now stand, Mr. Knieps said, most of them would have to raise the premiums again on Jan. 2 to break even, as the Government requires them to do.
"It's always the little people who end up paying," said Henriette Dorr, a civil servant in Bonn, convinced that the Government or the health insurance fund will be taking even more out of her paycheck next year.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SIGNS BILL AGAINST INVESTING IN IRAN AND LIBYA

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Over the objections of America's trading partners, President Clinton signed a law today that would impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran or Libya, which he described as "two of the most dangerous supporters of terrorism in the world."
In a speech after the Oval Office signing of the bill, Mr. Clinton went on to call terrorism "the enemy of our generation" and vowed that the United States would fight it alone, without its allies, if necessary. 
 "Where we don't agree, the United States cannot and will not refuse to do what we believe is right," he told students at George Washington University.
In a pointed message to America's allies, he added, "You cannot do business with countries that practice commerce with you by day while funding or protecting the terrorists who kill you and your innocent civilians by night."
"That is wrong," Mr. Clinton said. "I hope and expect that before long our allies will come around to accepting this fundamental truth."
Germany and France immediately condemned the measure, with France warning that the European Union would retaliate if the Administration carried out the sanctions law. The European Union also protested and is expected to challenge the law at the World Trade Organization, as well as another American law penalizing companies doing business with Cuba. Iran predicted that the law was "doomed to failure."
France has been particularly aggressive in investing in Iran, and the legislation, first proposed last year by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, was prompted in part by a deal that Total, S.A., a French oil company, signed with Iran after Mr. Clinton forced Conoco Inc. to give up plans to develop two large offshore oilfields there. The Conoco episode led the President to impose an embargo on all American investment in Iran, but no allies joined the embargo.
Mr. Clinton's actions came after weeks in which the bombing of an American military apartment complex in Saudi Arabia, the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 off Long Island and the bomb explosion at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta have led to heightened national concern about terrorism. Terrorism is suspected but not confirmed as the cause of the T.W.A. disaster and the Atlanta explosion.
On Friday, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in a radio interview that he expects that "there will be an international connection" to the bombing in Saudi Arabia, possibly implicating Iran. But other Administration officials played down the his remarks and said today that Mr. Clinton in his speech was not setting the stage for immediate further action against Iran.
The President signed the sanctions measure in the presence of relatives of the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland and of two Americans held hostage by Iran during the Carter Administration.
His speech after the signing at times seemed evocative of some of the anti-Communist oratory of the cold war. "Fascism and Communism may be dead or discredited," he said, "but the forces of destruction live on."
He told his countrymen that each of them must remain resolute in an era in which "America will remain a target because we are uniquely present in the world."
"Our greatest strength is our confidence," Mr. Clinton said, "and that is the target of the terrorists. Make no mistake about it, the bombs that kill and maim innocent people are not really aimed at them but at the spirit of our whole country and the spirit of freedom."
The new law requires the President in most cases to impose two from a list of seven possible sanctions against foreign companies that make new investments worth more than $40 million for the development of petroleum resources in Iran or Libya. It also imposes sanctions on foreign companies that violate existing United Nations prohibitions against trade with Libya in certain goods and services.
The list of sanctions include some that are considered relatively minor: denying loans and loan quarantees from the United States Export-Import Bank, which helps American companies invest in projects abroad, and denying licenses to export United States goods to companies that violate the ban.
The other sanctions are considered more severe. The President could bar American banks from making loans of more than $10 million to companies that receive sanctions. He could bar financial institutions that violate the embargo from serving as primary dealers in United States Government funds or as a repository for them. He could also ban companies that receive sanctions from selling goods to the United States Government or bar all imports from the companies.
The law grants the President the ability, case by case, to decide that it is in the national interest to waive a sanction against a company for a particular investment. And he can delay sanctions for two successive 90-day periods upon determining that a foreign government is taking action to reverse an investment.
In months of negotiations, the legislation had been considerably changed from Mr. D'Amato's original bill, which had drawn protests from the State Department. The Senator had sought to punish companies that traded with Iran, rather than those that invest heavily there. And he had sought the most severe punishment Washington could muster: barring them from selling their products in the United States.
Nevertheless, Mr. D'Amato attended the signing ceremony today and said the measure sent "an important signal" and was "an important first step." He said lawmakers now had to watch that the provisions were not waived.
The law would apply only to new investments, not those existing already. Officials said they were not aware of such commercial activity on the horizon and could not say how much investment would be deterred.
Besides signing the bill, Mr. Clinton said he would present Congress with new legislation next month intended to strengthen extradition powers, to make it easier to prosecute money-laundering and to increase the ability of American law enforcement officials to prosecute those who commit violent crimes against Americans abroad.
He also condemned Congress for recessing for the summer without approving a set of anti-terrorism measures he called for after the T.W.A. disaster. "I am disappointed, and more importantly the American people are disappointed, that that job was not done," Mr. Clinton said.

Promising Less to the I.R.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Bob Dole's tax-cut plan, as analyzed through examples provided by Coopers & Lybrand, a major accounting firm, generally lightens the tax burden most significantly for moderate-income households with children. The $500-per-child tax credit accounts for much of the benefit for this group; it phases out at relatively high incomes.
 The firm assumed standard decuctions for each individual or family, with only high-income taxpayers having capital gains.
 The Dole staff provided a similar set of six examples whose accuracy was confirmed independently by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche.
In one case, for a $35,000 family with two children, the Coopers & Lybrand and the Dole figures overlapped. Mr. Dole, who cited this example when he unveiled the plan yesterday in Chicago, contended this family's savings would be $1,371, or 55.5 percent, compared with a $1,407, or 51.8 percent savings found by the accounting firm used here. The difference appeared to reflect a somewhat higher deduction, perhaps itemized, assumed by the Dole camp. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

THE CRASH
New Trail of Wreckage Found
Investigators located a new trail of debris from Trans World Airlines Flight 800 several miles closer to Kennedy International Airport than anything found before and, among the items scattered on the ocean floor, officials said, were large suitcases and pieces of clothing. The discovery bolstered the theory that an explosion occurred in or near the Boeing 747's forward cargo hold, investigators said. [Page A1.]
 
Families as Formidable Force
In the frustrating hours after the crash of Flight 800, the families of the victims coalesced into a formidable political force. Their pleas over the slow pace of body identification and their heartfelt stories caught the attention of politicians and, ultimately, of President Clinton, who proposed that an office in the Federal Government be set up to assist aviation victims' families. [B5.]
 
Web is Headline Service
In the quest for information about the crash of Flight 800, computer users have turned in record numbers to the global computer network, in particular, the World Wide Web. Several major news organizations, which had expected a surge in activity because of the Olympics, report that activity at their Web sites rose sharply immediately after the July 17 crash. [B5.]
 
NEW YORK
 
Scaffold Collapse Kills Worker
A 10-foot section of parapet wall high up on a garment center office building collapsed under the weight of what authorities called an improperly rigged scaffold, and a deadly cataract of bricks and coping stones roared down on workers and pedestrians on a busy midtown sidewalk. A workman on the sidewalk holding a scaffolding rope was struck and killed; another worker was seriously injured. [B1.]
 
Paroled Rapist Arrested Again
A Manhattan man who won early release from a prison sentence for his fourth rape conviction was arrested in a rape case over the weekend in Central Park, the police said. [B1.]
 
Chronic Undercount Syndrome
The time is at hand to decide exactly how the Census Bureau will calculate the United States population in 2000, under the Constitutional imperative of a national head count every 10 years. In fact, the next census is enormously important to New York City, a victim of what might be called chronic undercount syndrome. Every decade, the city ends up being credited with fewer souls than it actually has. Understandably, the Giuliani administration is throwing its support behind new Census Bureau procedures that should beef up the city's totals in the next go-round. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Terror Suspect Told of Plot
Testifying at the trial of three men accused of plotting to blow up American jumbo jetliners in Asia, an agent for the F.B.I. related in Federal court how one defendant talked about blowing up a nuclear facility in the United States. The agent testified that the defendant told him such attacks were supposed "to make the American people and the American Government suffer for their support of Israel." [B2.]
 
REGION
 
Shock Waves of AT&T Partition
When AT&T embarked last fall on its one-year journey of discovery, dismemberment and downsizing, the company's 60,000 employees and their families in the New York metropolitan region were at the epicenter of a corporate earthquake. But the shock wave did not stop at the company's front gate. AT&T's drive to divide and remake itself has changed lives and local businesses. It has also rewritten the equation of the regional economy. [B1.]
 
Plan to Limit Donations
Spurred by the secrecy surrounding Gov. George E. Pataki's inauguration and transition committees, the Speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, proposed a plan that would limit the size of donations made to such committees and require detailed public disclosure about their contributions and expenses. [B2.]
 
Adelphi Chief Is Defended
Adelphi University has grown financially stronger in the 11 years since Peter Diamandopoulos became president, its chief financial officer testified before a state review panel. [B2.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
2 Killed in Mall Robbery
Two people were killed and two others were wounded as gunfire from a botched robbery rang through a shopping mall in southern New Jersey, sending shoppers and their children scurrying for cover. A robber and a bystander, 17, died. [B2.]

Excerpts From Speech Outlining Dole's Economic and Tax Plans

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks yesterday by Bob Dole in Chicago, as provided by the Federal Document Clearing House, a transcription service.
It's great to be able to give this speech before President Clinton gets a copy of it and tries to give it himself. You know, he does that from time to time. But let me tell you, this is one speech Bill Clinton will never be able to give. 
 Now, I'm running for President because I believe America can do better. . . . I believe that every family, wage earner and small business in America can do better if only we have the right policies in Washington, D.C., and coming from Washington, D.C. . . .
That's why I'm in Chicago today, and why I'm announcing a program that is the opening salvo in a battle to repeal the current tax code. The end of the I.R.S. To end the I.R.S. as we know it and to get the American families' incomes moving up again. . . .
And this is not just tax, this is about a six- or seven-point program. It's a program first of all to pass a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, which President Clinton helped defeat.
To balance the budget by the year 2002, cut the tax burden on the middle class, provide new educational opportunities for low- and middle-income Americans, reform our broken-down lawsuit system, end needless Federal regulations and restore the promise of the America dream.
And it's built on the conviction that we live in a time of unparalleled and unrealized promise, because America today is competing in the most dynamic world economy we have ever seen. New markets are opening to American goods and services. Entrepreneurs are developing new technologies and creating products that weren't even imagined just a few short years ago. And I believe America stands on the threshold of a breathtaking future, with greater opportunities for growth and prosperity than at any time in our nation's history.
That's how significant this is.
We've all watched the Olympics, but we're like that Olympic runner with 50-pound weights attached to our legs. It's time to unshackle the U.S. economy from big government, from the big-government ball and chain, and go for the gold, and we're going to go for the gold.
And our history shows that the greatest force for economic growth, for lifting the poor from poverty, for opening opportunities for productive, fulfilling lives for all, is the force of a free people, free to go where God and their dreams guide them. That's what America is all about in the first place.
And that is what built America, the most prosperous, generous nation on earth. And that's what my program is all about.
That is why we're going to balance the budget, cut taxes and remove the dead weight of government to unleash the full potential of the American people once again. Now, let me say the current Administration has a different philosophy. Rather than seize the opportunities of this new era, they have taken a grow-slow approach to economic policy. Now, they had a choice between a dynamic future that is as great as the aspirations of the American people or the high tax, high-spending policies of liberal special-interest groups. And of course they chose the special interests over the uture of the American people.
So my message today is that I will put you, the American people, first. . . .
Now, let me tell you, I see this Administration's economic performance falling short, and I will change it. Clintonomics has produced an economy that is squeezing the middle class between high taxes and low growth. The astounding fact is that . . . we were growing 50 percent faster in 1992 when Bill Clinton described the economy then as the worst in five decades.
The economy then was rolling out of a recession. It was strong and should have gotten stronger. Instead, this Administration has given America the slowest growth of any economic expansion since the last century. . . .
We must commit ourselves to a far more ambitious path that puts growth, expanding opportunity, rising incomes, soaring prosperity at the heart of our economic policy.
And that is why I want to be President, and that is exactly what I will do the day I move into the White House. . . .
Attacking Clinton
Now, let's just take a look at the Clinton record. The economic insecurity felt by the middle class is not in people's imaginations. You can see it in all the indicators. The Administration rejoiced recently when the unemployment statistics went down. But the reality behind those figures was nothing to cheer about.
The disturbing fact is, we've seen the return of something we thought had disappeared more than a decade ago. The worker is so discouraged about finding a good job and a good wage that he or she just drops out of the labor force and no longer appears on either the employment or unemployment statistics.
These are called forgotten workers of Mr. Clinton's middle-class squeeze economy.
In my administration, the forgotten worker will be remembered. Growth will put those women and men back on the jobs, paychecks in their pockets and hope in their hearts once again. . . .
Let me make it clear the forgotten worker is not the only victim of the Clinton Administration's squeeze economy. Today, millions of Americans are afraid to leave their job because they can't find other good opportunities.
Now, the economists behind me call this job lock. And it's been at recession level since Bill Clinton took office. What does this mean? It means that millions of Americans feel trapped, unhappy where they are, not able to realize their potential to the fullest, but with no place else to go.
And I give this promise to all Americans who yearn to build a better life: In my administration, we will break the job lock and return opportunity to America's working men and America's working women.
During Bill Clinton's Presidency, real wages have stagnated. And the real median household income has actually dropped. It's actually dropped. No wonder Americans feel they're working harder and longer and take home less. It is that Bill Clinton has been downsizing the entire American economy. And I say it's time for us to upsize our economy again, and we will start all this on Inauguration Day, 1997.
And under President Clinton, the personal saving rate has fallen. Families aren't able to put away much for the future, and they have been forced to put more and more on their credit cards just to get by. Meanwhile, productivity growth has been cut in half, causing real wages to be a thing of the past.
The national debt has risen sharply, as have interest rates in the months since Bill Clinton vetoed our balanced budget and twisted enough arms in the Senate to defeat the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
And with that, mortgage rates have risen and the value of homes has virtually stagnated. This year, tax freedom day, the day when we stop working for the Government and start working for ourselves, came later than ever before in American history. In fact, Clinton has already moved it up a week. It was May 7. When he came in, it was May 1.
The result is that in too many two-income families, one spouse works full time for the family and the other spouse works full time for the Government.
And we think it ought to stop. And the fact is that while the Administration has waged a class-warfare campaign, the dirty little secret of its middle-class squeeze economy is that the income of the middle class has fallen even as the rich have gotten richer.
Now, think about it. What Clintonomics means is that the rich are getting richer while the middle class gets left behind.
So we've tried it your way, Mr. President. Now it's time to do something new. It's time for a new Independence Day for the American taxpayer, because for too long now, President Clinton's liberal policies have hovered like an alien ship over the American economy -- you all saw that movie, yes -- blowing away growth and opportunity in his path. Well, in 1992, he arrived. In 1993, he attacked. In 1996, America strikes back. That's what's going to happen. . . .
Balance and Relief
So today, as I said, I'm announcing my economic program for America's renewal. A program that returns economic growth, rising living standards and prosperity for all Americans to the center of the nation's agenda.
It starts with a twin necessities of a balanced budget on the one hand and tax relief for America's working families. And as you know, we've had a long debate in our party about which should come first.
Growth advocates say cut taxes first. Fiscal conservatives say balance the budget first. And I say they are both right. Let me tell you why.
The fact is that the budget deficit and high taxes are two halves of the vise that is producing the Clinton middle-class squeeze. Higher taxes pick the American family's pocket directly. Incredibly, that family now spends more on taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined -- and these aren't my figures.
Meanwhile the budget deficit is a stealth tax that pushes up interest rates and costs the typical family $36,000 on an average home mortgage, $1,400 on an ordinary student loan and $700 on a car loan. Every time a family uses its credit card, it pays a stealth tax to the Federal Government.
There is no magic in fixing this problem. With today's pro-growth Republican Congress, cutting taxes and balancing the budget are just a matter of Presidential will. And if you have it, you can do it. And I have it, and I will do it.
I will support and work for the balance budget amendment. I will reduce the size of the Federal Government -- we can do with a few less Cabinet departments. I will balance the budget by the year 2002.
As I am doing that, I'm going to follow the example of many Republican governors across this country. I will reduce taxes while I'm balancing the budget. It can be done, and it will be done.
My program follows two principles. No dollars should be taxed that will go to providing the basics for a family, number one. And number two, no dollars should be taxed that would go to creating a job. In my administration, the squeeze economy will be replaced with an opportunity economy. . . .
Somebody said I was going to bet the farm -- I said, I'm going to bet the country. I'm going to take this to the American people. And let me tell you about it.
To put it in nutshell, I intend to lower the Federal income tax bill of a family of four making $35,000 a year by 56 percent, cutting it by more than half.
Let me repeat that. This tax reduction will mean that such a middle-class family will take one dollar out of every two dollars they now pay in income tax and put it right back in their own pockets -- half of it, more than half of it.
And more dollars will also stay with the women and men who own the smaller business that will create the jobs that families depend on.
Now how we are going to do this? First, a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, fully phased in in three years, that will repeal the Clinton tax hike on the middle class. In fact, it's going to return total taxes to where they were when Ronald Reagan left office. That's a big, big step in the right direction.
Second, we will give every middle-income family a $500-per-child tax credit, 18 years and under. That's a tax credit, not a deduction. It means if you're raising one child, take back $500 dollars. If you are raising two, take back $1,000. Raising three, take back $1,500, and so on. I met a man who had 10; he is going to take back $5,000. . . .
And third, we will cut the top rate of capital gains tax in half, to 14 percent, because the capital gains tax hits smaller and growing businesses the hardest, and they are the ones who will create most of our new jobs in a decade and a half. In fact, they tell us in 25 years 3 out of 4 jobs will be created by small businesses.
And I want those businesses to use their growing value to give people better jobs and better opportunities and better incomes, not just to pay taxes. And that's why we are cutting it in half.
Fourth, we are going to call for the expansion of the Individual Retirement Accounts so people can put money away for their old age. And I will call for repeal of the 1993 Clinton tax hike on Social Security benefits that affect about four million senior citizens who aren't rich. And finally, I will call for a super-majority -- a 60 percent vote of Congress -- before income tax rates can be ever be raised again on the American people.
Let me be absolutely clear. I don't want to be President because I like how things are going today. I don't like how things are going. I want to make America better, and I know we can make America better. . . .
This program is just the first step. As of this moment, Bill Clinton and his party are the defenders of the status quo and we are the party of change. We are the party of change, the Republican Party.
This is only the beginning. This is phase one. We will not stop until we repeal of the entire tax code and replace it with a simpler, fairer, flatter system that will allow Americans to file their tax returns without the help of a lawyer, or an accountant, or both.
Now, let me talk a minute about the first phase and give you an example of what it's going to do. Today in too many families, both spouses work because they have to work. When we have achieved our goal, if both spouses work it will be because they want to work, not because they are forced to work because of higher taxes.
Our objective is to spur growth to a healthy, vibrant 3.5 percent or more. The naysayers say that's too ambitious, but the truth is they're not ambitious enough. In the last five expansions, the American economy averaged 4.4 percent growth. The post-World War II average, counting recessions, was 3.3 percent.
We were growing, as I mentioned, at a 3.7 rate before the Clinton big-government policies put the brakes on our economy and it dropped to 2.3 percent.
The question is, Why is the Clinton Administration selling our economy and the American people short? Why have they given up on the American dream?
We are going to give the engine of the American economy a full tuneup and a new tax filter to filter out big-government residue and get it humming again the way it ought to be. That's what's going to happen.
History has shown us that tax cuts, by stimulating growth, bring in more revenue. But let me be very clear: the purpose of a tax cut is to leave more money where it belongs -- in the hands of the working men and the working women who earned it in the first place.
Of course, this is an election year, so Bill Clinton has promised again that he will cut taxes, not raise them.
You give him another -- all he wants is four more years and he will do all of that.
Well, when he tells you that, ask yourself this question: How many times has he kept his word in the last four years when it came to taxes?
Zero. Zero.
Dim View of the I.R.S.
And my program doesn't stop with low taxes and balanced budget. One of the costs of stuffing a size 10 government in our size 8 pocketbooks is that the I.R.S. has taken an even bigger, more impressive role in American life. And this, in itself, has become a drag on growth.
Today, the I.R.S. is twice as big as the C.I.A., five times as big as the F.B.I. It takes the equivalent of nearly three million people working full time, more people than serve in the U.S. armed forces, just to comply with our tax laws.
The other day, in fact last week, I met a woman in Tennessee. She told me about her two-year fight with the I.R.S. It cost her time and heartache, and then they were threatening to seize her property.
And what got the I.R.S. so angry -- in fact, I've got a copy of the letter right here -- it was a dispute over $127.
Then, they added a penalty of 32 cents and interest of $1.12. So, I could see that fight over the extra $1.12.
I have got to hand it to those guys, they really know how to spend the taxpayers' money. And the file was about that thick. How much did she spend and did you spend, the taxpayers, over $127? It's crazy.
We are going to downsize the I.R.S. and upsize the amount of money the Americans get to keep in their pockets. That's what we're going to do.
I am an optimist. I believe the I.R.S. can be retrained to do something useful. And I don't have any quarrel with the people that work there; they are good people. Don't misunderstand me. But they have to follow all of these things that Congress passes and all the regulations somebody dreams up. . . .
So I'm going to start by shifting the burden of proof in I.R.S. audits so the taxpayers in America are once again presumed innocent until they are proven otherwise. That will be a switch.
We are going to end the I.R.S. K.G.B.-like life-style audits where there is no evidence of any criminal activity. That's number two.
I will eliminate I.R.S. filing for 40 million. Forty million low- and middle-income taxpayers won't have to file anymore. The I.R.S. can do it. Do it for them. Send them a bill.
We are going to privatize many I.R.S. functions. We are going to modernize the rest and shift the duties of I.R.S. personnel so that their job is to help Americans give the right answers on their forms, not to punish them for making innocent mistakes; just turn it around.
And in short, my administration will free the American people from tax tyranny.
I will eliminate the I.R.S. as we know it, and that's a big step in the right direction. And in my administration, the Clinton regulatory assault on economic growth will also end. We will thoroughly review all new and existing regulation to determine what works, what doesn't, what's too expensive and what's too oppressive.
We will end the Clinton exemption to the I.R.S. on the so-called Paperwork Production Act. They create 75 percent of the paperwork, so he exempted them. We think they ought to be included.
I will insist what the American people get from regulations is more than what they pay to comply with them. Lawsuit reform is also part of our program.
'Out-of-Control Lawsuit System'
 This is a true story. I met a little girl a few months ago whose life depends on a medical device that may not be available in a few years because of the litigation explosion that has corrupted our civil justice process.
Our out-of-control lawsuit system is a drag on growth, it undermines competitiveness and drives up prices for all Americans, and even endangering the lives of some while making a few predatory trial lawyers fabulously wealthy.
Even liberal Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller accused President Clinton of -- and I quote -- "selling out to special interests and raw political considerations" when he vetoed our lawsuit reform bill at the behest of trial lawyers, Clinton's biggest campaign contributors.
In a Dole administration we will reform our broken-down lawsuit system. We will put a limit on outrageous punitive damage awards, revoke the trial lawyers' license to search for deep pockets. We will curb the abuse of the contingency fee system to insure that most award money goes to those who are injured, not the lawyers.
We will change auto insurance laws so that car owners have more choice as to the kind of coverage they buy, and promote early settlements of claims by reducing the incentives lawyers have to run up fees by keeping lawsuits alive instead of settling them.
In my administration, the predatory, ambulance-chasing trial lawyers will no longer have a special friend in the White House. The American people will have a special friend in the White House.
Finally, economic reform requires getting children and workers ready for the jobs of the future. . . .
The Clinton Administration puts our educational future in the hands of bureaucrats and the liberal ideologues of the national teachers union. I will do things differently. My program includes opportunity scholarships for children that'll enable a parent to choose the best school for their child, allowing low- and middle-income students and parents to deduct interest on student loans, and giving them the opportunity to set up tax-free education investment accounts with this $500 credit per child.
Let me say a word about opportunity scholarships. . . . We want a demonstration project in about 15 states. We're ready to spend $12 billion to $15 billion dollars to see if it works and give it to the states. They're going to furnish half; we're going to furnish half. We're going to give that low-income parent who has just as much right to have the best education for his child as anybody in this room but they don't have the money and they're trapped in inner-city schools. They're trapped in schools that are not safe for the children.
We want to give them an opportunity.
If we want to address crime, drugs, out-of-wedlock birth, we have got to start with an education, an education for children in America. And I can do it because I am not tied to the National Education Association. President Clinton can't do a thing. . . .
Now, I want to conclude by answering some question that some people may have to save you time, save the press time; I know they're very busy.
First, let's have a debate on economic growth. And let's start with a few questions that someday someone will ask. We just sort of pull these out of a hat. It's my hat.
Question number one, aren't you abandoning your commitment to cutting the deficit? . . . I grew up as a very poor boy in Russell, Kansas. I know the importance of living within your means, and I know the consequences of not doing that. Deficit reduction is in my blood, and a balanced budget will be my legacy to America.
Now, President Clinton will tell you a balanced budget is impossible. At the same time, he's vetoed two balanced budgets, proposed one of the biggest pork-barrel spending programs in American history, passed the biggest tax hike in history and submitted a budget of his own that forecast the deficit as far as the eye could see.
What is impossible for a Democratic President captured by liberal special-interest groups is doable for a Republican President with a Republican Congress, especially when the President is going to be armed in January with a line-item veto.
I will be that President. And I will get it done. And I will balance the budget.
And this question always comes: Aren't you just proposing a tax cut for the rich? No.
I am going to give tax relief to every single taxpayer in America. Everybody in this room is going to get tax relief, whatever you make. And I know the Democrats are going to revert to their same old mantra: tax breaks for the rich, tax breaks for the rich. I think the Vice President's already started, and he knows a rich person when he sees one. And of course, their definition of rich is anyone who has a job. . . .
Question number three: Isn't this program a return to the -- quote -- "failed policies of the 80's"?
Well, let's talk about the 80's. During the Reagan years we vanquished inflation, we brought interest rates down from double digits, and averaged nearly 4 percent economic growth and the longest peacetime expansion in history. Those were the 80's that some people talk about.
I take great pride, as I said, in my reputation as a deficit hawk. But let me also say, one of my proudest achievements was helping to pass Ronald Reagan's historic across-the-board tax cut. That tax cut helped restore America's economic greatness, make no mistake about it.
And I want to return to tax cuts, this time balancing the budget, too, with the Republican Congress, and finishing the job that Ronald Reagan started so brilliantly but could not complete because the Democrats, as usual, would not go along on reducing spending.
So just as we rolled back the Soviet empire in the 1980's, we're going to roll back the empire of liberal, big-spending special interest and big government in the latter half of the 1990's. And we're going to do it with your help.
And finally, people will ask question number four. Now, Bill Clinton's spin doctors have their own numbers showing that everything is great. Their motto is, Don't worry; be happy. Now, who are we going to believe?
Let me suggest this simple test. Ask yourself, Do you believe America is on the right track today, and do you believe that we are building a future that is better for our children?
For Working Families
When I finish here today a lot of commentators will try to tell you who this program is for. So let me tell you before they do, tell you what I have in mind.
I'm thinking of the mother who works, just as her husband works, because one income is no longer enough to make ends meet. The mortgage payment on their house just went up because interest rates jumped between 1.25 and 2 percent after President Clinton vetoed our balanced budget package.
And she is wondering where she is going to find the extra money. She works in a small company -- the kind that has created most of America's new jobs over the last decade and a half, except that it hasn't been growing since Bill Clinton passed his tax increase on, quote, "the rich."
Seventy percent of that tax on the rich went to businesses owned by small businessmen or small businesswomen.
The owner can't afford to invest in its growth, and as a result the pay raises that used to come on a regular basis have virtually stopped. Now, her husband, on the other hand, works for a big company. But even as it has found itself in a new, more competitive global market, it has been hit by one regulation after another in the United States of America.
There has been talk of corporate downsizing, and she is not certain what the next year will bring. As Americans always have, she wants her children to have a better life, but the schools seem worse than when she was growing up, and they can't afford a private school, as maybe many in this audience can. She wonders if her kids will be ready for the real world, for a job or opportunity when they graduate into that world.
The family's taxes have crept up over the years, until they are paying tax rates that only millionaires used to pay. She knows that if taxes were down and growth was up to the level of the mid 1980's the family could make ends meet.
This mother and her family, they are the ones my program is for, no doubt about it. They are the reason I want to cut taxes and regulations and balance the budget, to end litigation explosion and revitalize education and training.
And you might properly ask if I know such a family. And the answer is yes, yes, I do. Many things have changed since I was a young man . . . but the story is the same now as it was then. The families described could be my family, my next-door neighbors or the people down the street, or the farmer's family or shopkeeper's family and the teacher's family in my hometown.
We all work, and we all struggle to make ends meet. We all knew what it meant to struggle in Russell, Kansas, just as families in every large and small town across the country know today.
So who am I doing this for? I'm doing it for the mothers and the fathers and the children, for families all over America. And that's why I'm running for President.
So as we enter the new century, America is going to be stronger, freer, more vibrant and hopeful than ever before, more nurturing of its families, with greater opportunities for each and every American to pursue his or her dreams.
As Winston Churchill said many years ago, and I quote, "Give us the tools and we will finish the job."
I say today that if we give America a new birth of freedom there is no limit on what the American people can achieve. I know in my heart our best days are yet to come.

New Loans for Homeowners

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Fleet Bank has agreed to refinance and refund the interest on high-interest loans made to older homeowners, a statewide watchdog group said yesterday. Fleet was the target of protests by New Jersey Citizen Action because a subsidiary of the bank bought the high-interest loans from independent contractors. The contractors had approached homeowners in low-income areas, told them they needed repairs and offered to loan them money at rates that sometimes exceeded 15 percent, said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, the group's executive director.

Now, Intense Scrutiny: Can This Plan Work?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Over the last few years political leaders of all stripes, Bob Dole foremost among them, have conditioned voters to see reducing the Federal budget deficit as Job 1 and to view with skepticism any promise of a free lunch.
So it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Dole's pledge today to cut taxes by $548 billion while still balancing the budget by 2002 is being held to a high standard, perhaps more so than most election-year economic promises. And while Mr. Dole argues that his very standing as the nation's fiscal conscience imbues his plan with credibility, many economists and budget analysts who have looked at the plan's numbers are less impressed. 
 "It's a political document through and through that postpones serious deficit reduction until after what would be the end of a first Dole Administration," said Martha Phillips, a former Republican staff director for the House Budget Committee who is now executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group. "It does not address the serious problems we've got with entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, and none of the specifics of how all of this would be paid for are outlined in any detail."
More than almost any other issue in economics, the question of whether sweeping tax-cutting policies can succeed in promoting healthier economic growth without risking fiscal disaster divides into camps of true believers and fervent foes. Even those who say they have middle-ground positions ultimately tend to come down in one camp or the other.
Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, said he supported the plan's call for further spending cuts, a simpler and fairer tax system and a reduction in regulations.
"But I don't think it's a fiscally prudent program," Mr. Gramley said. "It's difficult to imagine you can balance the budget by 2002 when you're cutting taxes by $500 billion unless you're going to make major cuts in entitlement programs, and it's difficult for me to contemplate further major reductions in entitlement programs being made by the Congress."
As he made his announcement in Chicago, Mr. Dole flanked himself today with a variety of Republican economists and politicians who put their credibility on the line with his. They included George P. Shultz, the former Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State; Donald H. Rumsfeld, a former Defense Secretary and corporate executive who is Mr. Dole's top policy adviser; John B. Taylor, an economist at Stanford University, and Wendy Gramm, an economist who is the wife of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
"We have a very conservative, sound proposal," Mr. Rumsfeld said, "and I believe the American people will agree."
Mr. Dole's plan assumes that cutting income-tax rates by 15 percent will reduce revenue by $406 billion over the next six years. Its reduction in the capital gains tax from a top rate of 28 percent to 14 percent will cost $13 billion, the plan said.
A $500-a-child tax credit for low- and middle-income families would cost $75 billion, the plan said. An expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts to promote more savings, plus education and training initiatives, are valued at $27 billion, with another $27 billion for a repeal of a 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits received by wealthy people.
To offset the $548 billion cost of the tax cuts over six years, the plan assumes that the combination of lower taxes and less regulation of business will generate faster economic growth, increasing tax revenue by $147 billion over the period.
The plan proposes a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases of $217 billion. Included are $90 billion from a 10 percent cut in nondefense administrative costs, $34 billion from a sale of broadcast frequencies, $32 billion from the Energy Department's budget, $15 billion from the Commerce Department and $46 billion from what Mr. Dole's campaign described as a 1 percent cut in "other spending programs."
The remainder of the cost is made up by including the $122 billion set aside in the last Republican budget proposal for tax cuts, and around $75 billion from an assumption that an unexpected surge in tax receipts this year will be sustained over the next six years.
But the Dole plan left many analysts questioning the economic and political assumptions underlying it.
Among the assumptions in the plan that will be studied and debated are the following:
*The plan assumes that all spending cuts in the Republican budget passed by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton last year would be enacted again, providing a $393 billion down payment on balancing the budget over six years, with $217 billion of the cuts coming in 2001 and 2002. President Clinton portrayed the cuts in programs like Medicare as extreme, and it is unclear whether even a Republican majority would be willing to go out on such a political limb again. Republicans in Congress "have cried uncle on further spending cuts," Ms. Phillips said.
*The plan starts with the assumption that an unexpected surge in tax revenue enjoyed by the Treasury this year will be permanent, providing almost $75 billion over the six years covered by the Dole plan. The surge this year is attributed to investors' taking gains from big increases in stock prices, and analysts said it was unclear whether it would continue. The Clinton Administration assumes the surge will generate $50 billion in additional revenue over the next six years. "There remains a huge question about whether this is a permanent fixture or a temporary phenomenon," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who is now with the Brookings Institution.
*The assumption that selling broadcast frequencies would yield $34 billion is open to question on both political and economic grounds. The Republican leadership in Congress is opposed to such sales, and analysts said that while the $34 billion figure was within the range of estimates for the frequencies' value, no one can predict just how much they would bring in even if the political opposition was overcome.
*The Dole plan's projection that additional economic growth would add $147 billion in revenue over six years is based on the idea that businesses will expand and individuals will consume and save more if taxes are cut, regulations slashed and corporations freed from frivolous lawsuits and huge jury awards. While most economists accept that tax cuts generate some "feedback," there are no generally accepted models for how a broad-based program such as Mr. Dole's would improve economic growth. "There is no credible economic analysis that would support that kind of number," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
*The Dole plan takes no account of the bond market's possible reaction to the plan. If the market believed that the plan would be enacted in a way that risked enlarging the deficit, it would send long-term interest rates higher, reducing the nation's economic growth rather than increasing it. "If the financial markets ever thought this was going to happen, they would react very negatively," said Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker, who is a supporter of the Clinton Administration. "You'd see interest rates shooting up and aborting any attempt to achieve a higher level of growth even before it started."
For all the questions the plan has raised, though, many economists and business executives said Mr. Dole should be praised for starting a more vigorous debate over how best to improve the nation's economic growth.
Susan F. Skerker, a director of governmental affairs at the Ford Motor Company, said: "Ford has supported tax reform aimed at encouraging savings and investment, but the top priority is getting the deficit under control." Referring to Mr. Dole's goal of balancing the budget by 2002, she added, "While we have to take a look at the details, we are pleased that Mr. Dole's proposal clearly recognizes both goals."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RESPONSE;
With a Studied Calm, Democrats Feverishly Attack the Dole Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
This morning, Democratic aides showed up at the lobby of Bob Dole's campaign headquarters here to pass out releases to reporters who had just been briefed about Mr. Dole's economic plan.
Still more critiques came this afternoon from Joe Lockhart, the Clinton campaign's press secretary, who popped up at the Fairmont Hotel in Chicago, outside the ballroom where Mr. Dole announced his plan. 
 By the end of the day, the Democrats had rolled out for broadcast in swing states a new television commercial ridiculing the Dole plan as "a risky last-minute scheme that would balloon the deficit."
For all of the Clinton campaign team's studied calm about Mr. Dole's economic plan, their insistence that it was irresponsible and would never take hold with the American public, Democrats were anything but nonchalant in their drive today to undermine their opponent's centerpiece proposal.
That is because even Democrats concede that the notion of a tax cut has innate appeal -- an appeal that they were determined to shatter.
"Whenever you say 'tax cut,' people like those two words," said Donald R. Sweitzer, a former political director for the Democratic Party. "And to the extent that the Dole campaign is trying to put Democrats in a corner to react, to say that we're not for tax cuts, is a potential problem." Democrats can only hope, he said, that after "a momentary positive rush" for Mr. Dole, once the plan is "dissected and examined, voters are smart enough to recognize an election-year ploy over what is responsible fiscal policy."
Mr. Clinton himself is well aware of the appeal of tax cuts. In a speech in Houston last October, he confessed that he had raised taxes too much in his first budget in 1993. And many Democrats are still fuming about Christine Todd Whitman's upset victory over incumbent Gov. James J. Florio of New Jersey in 1993 after she promised significant tax cuts to voters enraged by Mr. Florio's raising taxes.
Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's chief outside political adviser, had been so concerned about Mr. Dole's plan that he repeatedly pressed the President to pre-empt the Republicans by proposing a major capital gains tax cut, according to several people involved in discussions at the White House. These people said Mr. Morris had been rebuffed, in part because Mr. Clinton has been so far ahead in the polls that he felt no particular pressure to respond with a grand, competing plan.
Judging by a New York Times/ CBS News Poll of 827 adults nationwide, conducted by telephone on Saturday and Sunday, before Mr. Dole made his plan public, offering a tax cut could carry both pluses and minuses.
Cutting the Federal income tax by 15 percent was "the right thing for the country" 36 percent of the public said, while 47 percent said it was the "wrong thing." When the 36 percent who answered "right thing" were asked, "What if that meant that the Federal budget deficit would increase?" most changed their minds -- and the percentage of the public continuing to say such a tax cut would be the right thing shrank to 11 percent.
Even Republicans were divided on the 15 percent cut, with 40 percent saying it was the right thing, while 44 percent said it was the wrong thing. Among Democrats, 52 percent judged it was the wrong thing, as did 47 percent of the independents. Still, the 15 percent tax cut was attractive to a minority of independents and Democrats, and that could win votes for Mr. Dole. The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Three themes form the core of the Democrats' strategy to counter Mr. Dole'e economic plan: to deride it as reckless and posing dangers to the economy, to label Mr. Dole as hypocritical given his years of championing deficit reduction over reducing taxes and to explain that Mr. Clinton has proposed more modest efforts to help middle-class taxpayers, like tax incentives for education.
"The surface appeal of tax cuts is always attractive," said Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser. "But if we contrast targeted tax cuts for families that can be paid for, with reckless tax cuts that will blow a hole in the deficit, people will take the tax-cut option that they think the country can afford."
The challenge for the Democrats, said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, is to persuade voters that even if Mr. Dole's plan sounds appealing, it is unrealistic. "Once people get the facts," he said, "most Americans understand there's no such thing as a free lunch."
But Nelson Warfield, the Dole campaign spokesman, said the White House was clearly nervous. "They had an absolute panic attack today about the Dole economic growth plan," he said. "They went so far as to have their campaign press spokesman infiltrate the Dole campaign to badmouth it. For weeks now, they've been trashing the plan before it even debuted. That's not being pro-active -- that's being frightened."
The Times/CBS poll found that the public was split on whether the Government could reduce the Federal budget deficit and cut taxes for the middle class at the same time, with 49 percent saying it could and 43 percent saying it could not.
When forced to choose between two desirable goals, 51 percent said they preferred to reduce the Federal budget deficit, while 43 percent preferred cutting taxes. By 65 percent to 29 percent, the public preferred maintaining current spending on education to cutting taxes. But people were evenly divided on whether to maintain current spending on defense or cut taxes.
The new Clinton campaign commercial, which was filmed days ago, features pictures of people on the job and tries to make a case that the economy is so robust that Mr. Dole's remedies are not needed. "America's economy is coming back," the announcer says. "Ten million new jobs. We make more autos than Japan. Higher minimum wage."
The advertisement refers to Mr. Clinton's modest plans for "tax cuts for families," and for college tuition tax credits and for health insurance that people can take from job to job. "President Clinton meeting our challenges," the announcer says in closing. "Bob Dole gambling with our future."
But the Dole campaign intends to introduce a new commercial of its own later this week, touting Mr. Dole's plan as the best way to invigorate the economy.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CANDIDATE;
DOLE OFFERS ECONOMIC PLAN CALLING FOR BROAD TAX CUT AIMED AT SPURRING GROWTH

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Promising to "finish the job Ronald Reagan started so brilliantly," Bob Dole today proposed a wide-ranging plan to spur the economy with $548 billion in tax cuts and a $500-per-child tax credit, all the while balancing the budget within five years.
"We are going to balance the budget, cut taxes and remove the dead weight of Government to unleash the full potential of the American people," Mr. Dole told an enthusiastic Chamber of Commerce audience here as he unveiled the long-awaited plan he hopes will breathe new life into his Presidential campaign. 
 Noting that advance reports had called the plan "dramatic," he concurred: "It is dramatic. Somebody said I was going to bet the farm -- I said, I'm going to bet the country."
A longtime skeptic of the supply-side economics championed by President Reagan, Mr. Dole today adopted the Reagan formula as he tried to appeal to what he described as the besieged middle class. He pledged to cut taxes by 15 percent across the board and said he could still balance the budget by the year 2002.
Sketchy on what Government programs he would cut to make up for his forgone tax revenue, Mr. Dole, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, nonetheless contended there was "no magic" to achieving his goal of a 3.5 percent rate of growth for the economy, now at 2.4 percent.
"With today's pro-growth Republican Congress," he asserted in his 42-minute speech, "cutting taxes and balancing the budget are just a matter of Presidential will.
"If you have it, you can do it. I have it. I will do it."
Mr. Dole said his plan would cut the Federal income tax bill of a family of four making $35,000 a year by 56 percent -- for a savings of $1,371 over what it pays now. Most of that would come from a proposed $500 tax credit for each child under 18.
President Clinton said Mr. Dole's plan would weaken the economy and hurt the American people. "I am unalterably opposed to going back to the mistake we made before and having big tax cuts that are not paid for," the President said, referring to the soaring deficits of the 1980's.
But the White House was clearly worried that Mr. Dole might have struck political gold with his proposal for a relatively large tax cut, with Clinton aides suggesting that the President may propose more cuts. The appeal of such a proposal was immediately evident in the reaction of Mr. Dole's audience, which cheered when he promised tax cuts and sat on its hands when he asserted: "Deficit reduction is in my blood, and a balanced budget will be my legacy to America."
Mr. Dole emphasized that although he had built his reputation in Congress as a deficit hawk, he was embracing tax cuts with equal fervor. "We have long had a debate in our party about which should come first," he said. "Growth advocates say tax cuts first. Fiscal conservatives say a balanced budget first. I say they're both right."
While critics contend that Mr. Dole's plan is based on overly optimistic economic assumptions, Mr. Dole stoked the anxieties of middle-class workers who, he said, were caught between high taxes and stagnant wages while the rich got richer.
He said that President Clinton was rejoicing in superficial indicators of a strong economy but that the Administration's policies had trapped "millions of Americans" into jobs they did not want because they were afraid they could not find better ones.
His plan, he said, "will bring America back, I promise you that."
Democratic aides tore into the plan, describing it as a gamble on the future. Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the Dole plan was an even more radical version of Mr. Reagan's efforts at fueling growth and revenues through tax cuts and said Mr. Dole was preposterously expecting to generate more revenue than Mr. Reagan anticipated, with a smaller tax cut than Mr. Reagan offered.
Raising the Clinton campaign's "rapid response" efforts to a new level, Mr. Lockhart appeared at the hotel here for Mr. Dole's speech, explaining that he was in Chicago to plan the Democrats' convention later this month. He briefed reporters outside the ballroom where Mr. Dole spoke. He said the Clinton campaign was airing new television ads in about 25 battleground states to counter Mr. Dole's claims.
The ad says that Mr. Clinton created 10 million new jobs and that "Bob Dole endangers it all with a risky, last-minute scheme that would balloon the deficit," raise interest rates and hurt families.
But Mr. Dole asserted his plan was sound, and that a host of supporters, from John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University, to George P. Schultz, chairman of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board, would not have endorsed a "pie-in-the-sky" proposal. They said that Mr. Dole's plan was especially plausible because the cold war was over and the United States was not spending as much on the military as it had in Mr. Reagan's tenure.
Mr. Dole's plan also includes cutting the top rate of the capital gains tax by half, to 14 percent, and expanding Individual Retirement Accounts. He wants to repeal the 1993 tax increases on Social Security benefits. And he said he would ask that a super-majority in Congress -- 60 percent of each house -- be required to raise income taxes.
But perhaps his most sweeping promise was to "end the I.R.S. as we know it."
Mr. Dole has lambasted the Internal Revenue Service throughout his campaign, pledging to reduce its size and scope. "I'm an optimist," he said today. "I believe the I.R.S. can be retrained to do something useful."
He said he would end the "K.G.B.-like life style audits," privatize many I.R.S. functions and "eliminate I.R.S. filing for 40 million low- and middle-income taxpayers." The plan also calls for a one-year tax amnesty.
Mr. Dole pledged to overhaul regulations and the legal system, limiting awards for punitive damages and changing auto insurance laws.
On education, he said he would provide for "opportunity scholarships," giving grants to about 4 million of the nation's 51 million school children, allow for low- and middle-income parents to deduct interest on student loans and allow workers to receive tax-free education grants from their employers.
In an attempt to counter what he said were expected complaints that his program will help only the rich, Mr. Dole said he had designed it with working mothers in mind.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUE;
Despite Cuts and Increases, Taxes Stay About the Same

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In laying out his economic plan, Bob Dole promised yesterday to bring "tax relief" to Americans. But through Democratic and Republican Administrations, going back three decades, the Federal tax burden has been remarkably steady -- as if paying too little in taxes, getting too much relief, arouses as much public ire as paying too much.
Since the mid-1960's, the revenue from Federal taxes -- individual and corporate income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes, gasoline and cigarette taxes, and half a dozen others -- has never fallen below 17.2 percent of the national income nor risen higher than 19.7 percent. When one tax goes down, another goes up. And the Dole proposals, if they were all to become law, would not break the bounds. 
 "That pattern is telling you something," said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "It is telling you that Americans have an affinity for Federal taxes that take from them roughly one-fifth of the national income. They won't tolerate taxes above one-fifth, but neither will they tolerate the deficits that would arise or the spending cuts that would be necessary to cut tax revenues below 17 percent."
Two major "stabilizers," as some economists call them, seem to keep the Federal tax burden in its relatively narrow range, despite all the talk over the years of the benefits of tax cuts or tax increases. One is the public outcry that goes up when politicians propose spending cuts for social programs to justify tax cuts. The other is the reaction of Wall Street traders, who raise their own cry -- insisting that a bigger budget deficit would mean higher interest rates on everyone's loans -- if tax cuts are not balanced by spending cuts.
"From the standpoint of stock and bond holders, the issue is very simple," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Tax cuts are certainly wonderful, but the issue is how do you pay for them. Neither Reagan in the 1980's nor Bob Dole now has given an adequate answer. They never specify adequate spending cuts."
Federal taxes of all sorts collected this year will come to 19.1 percent of the national income, which is also known as the gross domestic product. That is $1.4 trillion of the $7.4 trillion in G.D.P, with nearly half of those taxes coming from individual income taxes. Mr. Dole, by his own calculations, would lower the tax bite to 17.5 percent by the year 2002, when the national income is expected to top $10 trillion. Most of the reduction would come through a 15-percent cut in income tax rates and a $500 tax credit for each child under 18 years of age.
Still, if Federal taxes have remained a steady portion of national income, the mix has changed drastically.
President Ronald Reagan's tax cut, enacted in 1981, reduced the individual income tax rate by 23 percent over three years, benefiting the wealthiest Americans in particular by bringing down the maximum tax rate on the highest incomes to 50 percent from 70 percent.
The 1986 tax bill brought another cut in the top rate, to 28 percent, although more income could be taxed. And in 1990 and 1993, Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton gradually raised the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent for individuals. The income tax rate paid by businesses fell to 34 percent under President Clinton from 48 percent in the early Reagan years -- although the tax base of corporate America has broadened.
But while the tax rates on income fell, steady increases in payroll taxes, mainly to finance Social Security and Medicare, offset taxpayers' gains. So did increases in gasoline taxes and in other Federal charges, keeping Federal tax revenue in the range of 17 percent to 20 percent. To help pay public bills, the taxes paid at state and municipal levels have moved up slightly in recent years, to about 14 percent of national income.
"There has been a great improvement in the Federal tax-rate structure if you look at where we have come since 1980," said Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economist and Dole adviser. "We had top rates of 70 percent then and a lot of people paying at rates of 40 to 50 percent, and the changes have been a revolution."
But if the rates are much lower, the Federal tax burden has shifted down the income scale. In the late 1970's, the wealthiest 20 percent of American households had an effective Federal tax rate -- that is, the percentage of their income actually paid out -- of 27.2 percent, while the poorest 20 percent paid out 9.2 percent of their income, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That shifted to 24.1 percent for the wealthiest group in 1985, in the wake of the Reagan tax cuts, a drop of 3 percentage points, and to 10.4 percent for the poorest 20 percent, a rise of more than a percentage point.
By this year, the tax increases enacted under Presidents Reagan, in 1986, President Bush, in 1990, and President Clinton, in 1993, had pushed America's wealthiest 20 percent, with an average household income of about $124,000, back up to paying 28.1 percent of their income, while the share paid by the poorest 20 percent, with $8,700 in average annual income, had been cut in half, falling to 5 percent.
The 15 percent tax reduction proposed by Mr. Dole would shift this mix, raising the amount paid by the lowest-income and lowering it for the highest-income households by percentages still to be estimated.
 
QUOTATIONS
Dole on Previous Plans for Tax Cuts
 
AUG. 15, 1982 -- Discussing whether the tax cuts of 1981 had stimulated investment and revived the economy:
 
"We have had a disappointment. The economy has not recovered. It's been disappointing to the President and felt very deeply by those who are out of work and continue to be out of work. That doesn't mean we back away from the President's program."
 
When asked if he was a not very committed supply-sider:
"I never really understood all that supply-side business, and now the supply-sides are asking the consumers -- they want to turn out a demand side and say that somebody ought to bail us out of this recession."
 
 JULY 1985 -- Commenting that few members of Congress who were serious about reducing deficits could rejoice about the departure of the director of the Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman:
 "Those who believe we can do it all with growth and supply-side economics might be having champagne tonight. But I think that one bottle should be able to take care of that group."

 AUGUST 1985 -- When asked whether his concern about the deficit was shared by Jack F. Kemp, a champion of supply-side economics:
 "I don't think he likes the deficit. I think he feels less strongly about it than some of us, but his theory is that you're going to grow out of it. . . . I wish it would happen. We wouldn't have to worry about cutting programs or raising taxes."

 AUGUST 1992 -- In discussing whether President George Bush would propose a tax cut during the Presidential campaign:
 "If he can offset the tax cut with a spending freeze or a spending reduction, that would make good economic sense. But a tax cut by itself, as some of the supply-siders might advocate, would be bad medicine."

 NOVEMBER 1992: -- "I'm a traditional Republican who believes you ought to restrain spending if you're going to cut taxes. I don't think you can just cut taxes alone and get gain without pain."

 APRIL 10, 1995 -- The day he began his Presidential campaign:
"Let me make one fundamental belief crystal clear: We can cut taxes and balance the budget."

With Images and Ideas, Dole Shifts His Appeal

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
From his reference to "the forgotten workers of Mr. Clinton's middle-class squeeze economy" to his sympathetic invocation of a working mother, Bob Dole repositioned his Presidential campaign today, seeking to present himself as the candidate of the middle class.
Mr. Dole's speech in Chicago -- in which he adopted the populist language of both a generation of Democrats and his Republican nemesis, Patrick J. Buchanan -- was ostensibly an economic program. But its real importance, at least for the next 12 weeks, is as a political document, a blueprint for Mr. Dole's general election campaign. 
 And from that perspective, nearly every aspect of his appearance today -- the turns of phrase, the anecdotes, the people with him on stage, even the economic policies -- was tailored to appeal to the voters whom Mr. Dole's advisers have concluded he needs to defeat President Clinton: suburban residents and women.
"From a purely political perspective," Mr. Dole's pollster, Tony Fabrizio, said this evening, "we want to draw a very bright line for the voters and give them a clear choice between someone who's committed to reducing taxes and balancing the budget and someone who is committed to raising taxes and never balancing the budget."
The result was that Mr. Dole today sounded much like Bill Clinton of 1992, presenting himself as the agent of change, the defender of the middle class and the candidate who understands the troubles of working women in today's economy.
"At this moment, Bill Clinton and his party are the defenders of the status quo and we are the party of change," Mr. Dole said at one point. And, talking about the "forgotten workers," Mr. Dole said:
"The fact is that while the Administration has waged a class-warfare campaign, the dirty little secret of its middle-class squeeze economy is that the income of the middle class has fallen even as the rich have gotten richer. Now think about it. What Clintonomics means is that the rich are getting richer while the middle class gets left behind."
Mr. Dole's economic plan and its presentation reflected several political calculations. In settling on a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, as opposed to a more selective repeal of the 1993 tax increase, Mr. Dole's aides were hoping to guard against attacks from the Clinton campaign that the tax cut favored the rich. That has been a traditional, and often successful, response used by Democrats trying to counter the promise of Republican tax cuts.
In sprinkling the speech with populist language reminiscent of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign and Mr. Buchanan's attention-grabbing campaign this year -- Mr. Dole went so far as to lift the "putting people first" phrase that was Mr. Clinton's motto in 1992 -- the likely Republican Presidential candidate also served notice that he intended to court the kind of voters that Mr. Clinton won in 1992. As Mr. Fabrizio noted today, these swing voters have been at the foundation of Republican Presidential victories, most obviously with Ronald Reagan in 1980.
Mr. Dole's concern that he has been persistently lagging among female voters was reflected throughout his speech. He repeatedly referred to "women and men," a formulation more commonly heard at conventions of liberal Democrats, and cited a "mother who works" in the anecdotal peroration that he used to underscore his theme that Americans were economically anxious, notwithstanding statistical evidence to the contrary. Similarly, as Mr. Fabrizio noted, Mr. Dole made particular mention of households in which both adults work -- again appealing to the kind of constituency where Mr. Clinton's support is strong.
This is a high-risk gambit by Mr. Dole, as he himself said: "Somebody said I was going to bet the farm -- I said, I'm going to bet the country." The key to his long-term success now, aides said, is whether Mr. Dole, a notoriously undisciplined candidate, can stick loyally to what his campaign hopes will be the script for the months ahead. In any case, his aides said, he may have opened himself to attacks from Democrats.
Mr. Dole, who told a group of California Republicans more than a year ago that he was "willing to be another Ronald Reagan if that's what you want," runs the risk now of being portrayed as someone willing to compromise his positions to win election. Mr. Dole has spent a career fighting budget deficits, a point he reiterated today, and belittling the kind of economic policies that Mr. Reagan introduced -- and that Mr. Dole today essentially endorsed.
Also, Mr. Dole's hope that he is immune from being attacked for pushing a tax cut for the wealthy might prove premature. His tax cut plan includes across-the-board income tax cuts, but it also cuts in half, to 14 percent from 28 percent, the capital gains tax. That is the tax that is, fairly or not, usually associated with upper-income voters.
Finally, it remains to be seen whether the central premise of Mr. Dole's speech -- that voters are anxious enough about the economy to throw out the President -- is true. "It's close to impossible to make people feel that the economy is in bad shape," said Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for NBC and The Wall Street Journal. "That's one of the central fallacies in his speech today."
 Mr. Hart said that in most polls, including his own, voters were satisfied with their economic station. In one recent poll, Mr. Hart said, given a choice between reducing the deficit -- which Mr. Clinton made a priority, at the cost of going back on a 1992 promise of a middle-class tax cut -- and cutting taxes, voters overwhelmingly chose reducing the deficit.
Jeffrey Bell, a conservative economic consultant, argued that wage earners believed they had been left out in the economic expansion. "That's an opportunity for Dole," he said.
And Mr. Dole's communications director, John Buckley, who was one of the main forces in the campaign pushing Mr. Dole to take this route, said the key for the candidate was making the case that middle-class voters had not shared in whatever economic growth had occurred.
"In 1996, people believe the country is on the wrong track," Mr. Buckley said. "No matter how many rose gardens are promised from the Rose Garden, people know there is an uncertain economic future unless we take the steps needed to change Clinton's policy."
Mr. Buckley said he found some humor in the fact that the Mr. Dole of 1996 was voicing the rhetoric of Mr. Clinton in 1992. "The role reversal is ironic, delightful and real," he said.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Labor Race Heats Up As the Sabers Rattle

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
If there is a single person among the owners or the players who doesn't understand that another fiery labor confrontation would spell irreparable disaster for Major League Baseball, let him come forward and be anointed a dunce. Yet, once again the two sides appear headed toward that calamitous juncture.
If negotiators don't reach agreement in the next 10 days to two weeks, the owners say, they will go to court and seek to lift the injunction that restored terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement and prompted the striking players to return to work in April 1995. 
 The owners say they have no immediate intention of imposing their own working terms and conditions on the players, but union officials have no doubt that implementation would follow soon afterward, no later than the end of the World Series. Thus comes the talk of another strike as threat begets threat, one saber rattle eliciting another.
As Yogi Berra has said, it's deja vu all over again.
Not much has been heard from the negotiators. They have kept their many bargaining sessions low profile because they don't want the labor dispute to intrude on the fans' interest in the season and on the effort to restore full faith and credit in the game. But people on the management side are starting to stir.
"When are you going to go after the union for stalling?" a high-ranking club official asked the other day.
Apparently many people on management's side hold that view, believing that as long as Judge Sonia Sotomayor's injunction and the existing rules are in effect the union has no incentive to make a deal. The longer the union stalls, they feel, the better its chances of retaining a favorable economic system for another year.
Is the union stalling?
"Anyone familiar with the give and take of the negotiations wouldn't think we were stalling," Donald Fehr, the union chief, said yesterday. "If by stalling, people mean we don't agree with their positions, I don't know what to do."
Fehr was speaking by telephone from Orlando, Fla., where he was participating in a panel discussion at the American Bar Association convention.
His absence from New York, where he could have been negotiating with Randy Levine, the owners' chief labor executive, was cited as an example of stalling by Fehr, who spent all of last week at the Olympics.
"I'm being criticized for doing Rob Manfred a favor," Fehr countered. Manfred, who Fehr said asked him to appear on the panel, is the owners' No. 2 negotiator. Then, returning to the idea that he is stalling, Fehr suggested he would be happy to have the bargaining sessions videotaped and would be delighted to have owners attend them to see for themselves if he is dragging his feet.
"I have no worry about that whatsoever," he said.
The two sides have agreed or come close to agreeing on some items in the effort to produce an economic system that will be satisfactory to both. Both, for example, are willing to have no luxury tax on payrolls the first year -- this year -- of a new agreement, then have a tax the next three years but not the fifth year.
The union wants a second tax-free year at the end of the agreement, but the owners have balked and want the union to be willing to make a concession, such as having an earlier termination date, Oct. 31 instead of Dec. 31. The 60-day difference would have an impact on that year's signing season.
The two sides also agree that a tax should affect no more than five or six clubs, but the union feels the owners' proposed tax threshold, beginning at $49 million and climbing each year, would hit more teams.
Negotiators may yet work out a new contract short of a renewed conflagration, but the owners are proceeding toward a court date just in case. Strategy will be discussed tomorrow at meetings of the executive council and the labor policy committee in Milwaukee.
If the owners return to Judge Sotomayor's Federal courtroom, the low-key nature of the negotiations will come to a crashing end. The talks may do the same. Public sniping and bashing will resume just in time for the pennant races. If the owners then subsequently impose a new system, the prospect of a negotiated agreement would be nonexistent.
The players will view the owners' strategy as highly provocative. The owners, of course, have the right to act, but they should not delude themselves that they can take their action without provoking another work stoppage. The owners don't believe the players will strike again, but they have always believed that and they have always been wrong.
Whether the owners are right or wrong about the players stalling, the players have expressed a willingness, reluctant though it might be, to accept changes in the system. If the two sides would be unable to convert that willingness into a new agreement, it would be most unfortunate. It would be worse if they provoke each other into another shutdown.
"That's a good way to destroy the industry," a person on the owners' side said yesterday. "Nobody wants to do that."
But that is where they could be headed.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The On Baseball column yesterday, about negotiations between the owners and players, inaccurately rendered the explanation that Donald Fehr, head of the Major League Baseball Players Association, gave for his appearance on an American Bar Association panel. He said he did it at the request of Mike Kelly, a partner of Rob Manfred, a lawyer for the owners, not at Mr. Manfred's request. The quotation should have read: "I'm being criticized for doing Rob Manfred's partner a favor."

Hoping to cash in on the increasing number of Medicare recipients who are joining managed-care plans, Pacificare Health Systems Inc. announced yesterday that it would buy the FHP International Corporation for $35 a share -- $2.1 billion in cash and stock.
The deal between the two companies, both based in Orange County, Calif., would form the nation's fourth-largest for-profit managed-care company, with about four million members in 15 states and $8.6 billion in combined revenue. 
 The merged company would also have nearly a million members on Medicare, the Federal program that guarantees health care for Americans 65 and older, making it the largest provider of managed care to Medicare recipients.
Medicare patients spend nearly four times as much on health care as do younger patients. They would represent about half the revenue of the new company, said Alan R. Hoops, Pacificare's president and chief executive.
Reimbursements from Medicare are rising at a time when prices that health maintenance organizations charge commercial customers like large corporations have remained flat. In addition, the number of Medicare recipients choosing to join H.M.O.'s is gaining momentum, creating a strong opportunity for growth. "This is really perhaps the heart of the opportunity of bringing the companies together," said Mr. Hoops, who will run the combined company under the Pacificare name.
Wall Street reacted favorably to the announcement, sending shares of FHP soaring 26 percent, or $7.375, to $35.25 in Nasdaq trading. Pacificare's class B shares also rose sharply, closing at $72.75, up $5 on Nasdaq.
"It's one of those big exciting deals that should work," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York.
Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to Federal and state regulatory review and approval by the stockholders of both companies, owners of FHP common stock will receive $17.50 in cash and the rest in Pacificare shares. Pacificare said it would issue 2.3 million new shares of class A stock and pay for the remainder with existing class B shares.
Mr. Hoops described the negotiations leading up to yesterday's announcement as a very "orderly process," adding, "I would say that this was done by the book."
Mr. Abramowitz and other analysts said that the merger should bolster Pacificare's profit in the first year and that its impact shuld then increase as the combined company reduced costs.
At $2.1 billion, the price paid by Pacificare works out to approximately $1,200 an H.M.O. subscriber, considerably less than the $3,800 a patient the Aetna Life and Casualty Company paid earlier this year in its $8.9 billion purchase of U.S. Healthcare, one of the country's largest managed-care concerns.
Part of the reason for the lower price, according to Robert J. Hoehn, a Salomon Brothers analyst in New York, is the highly competitive California market.
At a time when many managed-care companies are being squeezed by higher costs and seem to have little ability to raise prices for their services, Pacificare will gain by swallowing its largest local competitor. As a bigger player, it will have more power when it negotiates contracts with doctors and employers.
But Mr. Hoops said the company did not plan to use the merger to raise its prices. Instead, he said, much of the benefit would come through economies of scale.
"There is tremendous overlap" between the two organizations, he said. He declined, however, to specify how many jobs would be lost as a result of the deal, saying it was much to early to speculate.
Analysts said that FHP had stumbled a few years ago when it acquired Takecare Inc., another California managed-care company, and had failed to show much marketing savvy. More recently, the company has been plagued by defections from its upper management after a corporate restructuring.
"Nobody is going to join an H.M.O. with a name that is filled with alphabet letters," Mr. Abramowitz remarked of FHP. "They didn't want to change the name and intensify the marketing, so they just gave up."
Pacificare, though, has invested heavily in information technology and is much more focused on marketing. Mr. Hoops said he would like to turn Secure Horizons, the name of the company's Medicare H.M.O., into a nationally known brand.
The combined company would have most of its members in California. But with the addition of FHP's members in such states as Arizona, Colorado and Utah, Pacificare is in a better position to expand to other regions. Only about 12 percent of the 30 million Medicare recipients are currently members of a health maintenance organization, and most of those are in California, Florida and New York.
But banking on future business with the Federal Government can be risky, some analysts pointed out. Both Pacificare and FHP currently face allegations that they overcharged for managed-care services for Federal employees. The two companies recently set aside a total of $65 million to underwrite the cost of potential claims.

HEADLINE: Restaurateurs Rise From Supporting Roles

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
JEAN-CLAUDE IACOVELLI is scouting locations in SoHo for a pasta restaurant. He already owns Jean Claude and SoHo Steak in that downtown neighborhood and Caffe Lure nearby.
Suan Lee Cheah and his wife, June, have just opened Nyonya on Grand Street in the part of Little Italy that is rapidly becoming Little Asia. It will be the Cheahs' fifth Malaysian restaurant in the last five years. They also own two Vietnamese restaurants. 
 And by mid-August, Andrew Silverman's latest restaurant in the Flatiron district, the Flatiron Diner and Baking Company, will finally be ready for customers. A bakery that shares the space with the diner has started making breads for Mr. Silverman's restaurants and will open to the public on Aug. 19.
For a decade or more, star restaurateurs like Drew Nieporent, Alan Stillman, Jerome Kretchmer and Pino Luongo, who own high-profile places like TriBeCa Grill, Smith & Wollensky, Gotham Bar and Grill and Coco Pazzo, respectively, have dominated the New York restaurant scene. But since the early 1990's, newcomers like Mr. Iacovelli, Mr. Silverman and the Cheahs have played significant supporting roles. There are others worth noting, among them Michael Ayoub, who opened Cucina in Brooklyn Heights in 1991 and is now involved in a number of other places in Brooklyn, and Louis Lanza on the Upper West Side, whose latest venture is Ansonia.
And those roles are growing. No, these new players are not the ones invited to participate in big charity events, and their chefs are not writing cookbooks. But they have enriched the fabric of day-to-day dining out across the city, and they are even spawning disciples and imitators.
When the restaurant business went into its recent, not-yet-forgotten slump and customers kept demanding value, restaurateurs like these were there with steak frites for $13.50. And when restless appetites clamored for new tastes, their menus featured beef rendang and roti canai.
"These places ground and stabilize the restaurant scene," said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant. "And they can satisfy their clientele several nights a week with a collection of different places."
Without this new energy, ambition and imagination, the restaurant business would wither. Mr. Stillman compared it to the theater. "You need those who can put on the equivalent of an $8 million Broadway musical, but you also need Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway," he said. "You need people who can keep the market bubbling all up and down the line."
Here is a closer look at some of the newer names in restaurant lights.
 
Cheap and Chic (And Successful)
Mr. Iacovelli, a congenial bundle of energy, came to New York 11 years ago from Paris, when he was 22. He started as a busboy, gradually working his way up at places like 24 Fifth Avenue, Le Bernardin and Bouley, where he became a captain.
"I saw you could make money in this business," he said. "I decided to open Jean Claude four years ago, with the goal of doing the kind of food you got at the fancy places but for half the price."
Jean Claude, a 45-seat restaurant at 137 Sullivan Street (Spring Street), cost him about $35,000 to build. His father was a stonemason. So, do-it-yourself came naturally. To save money, he went to the Fulton Fish Market downtown and to the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx every day, armed with the expertise he had acquired while at Bouley. "Nobody thought we'd make it, but it was a big hit," he said.
But success has not changed his cheap-chic approach. At SoHo Steak, Mr. Iacovelli's three-month-old restaurant, at 90 Thompson Street (Spring Street), the hanger steak is $13.50, and the railings above the banquettes are made of the kind of copper pipe you would find under your sink. The ceiling beams are raw wood without so much as a coat of sealer. David Rockwell was not here.
Mr. Iacovelli reinforced his success by owning more than one restaurant. At any level of the business, multiples make purchasing and hiring more economical. "It's actually easier to open two, three or four restaurants than just one," said Mr. Stillman, whose company, New York Restaurant Group, owns five restaurants in Manhattan and is expanding elsewhere.
It did not take long for Mr. Iacovelli to set an example for others. "Jean-Claude gave new young chefs a way to succeed without luxe," said Raba Belkadi, one of Mr. Iacovelli's childhood friends from Paris and now his partner in SoHo Steak.
Danforth Houle, who was the chef at Mr. Iacovelli's Caffe Lure, at 169 Sullivan Street (Houston Street), went on in the last year with a partner, Richard Sandoval, to open Savann, on the Upper West Side, and Savann Est, across town.
"Like Jean-Claude, we put more sweat than money into building our places, and we're also trying to serve three-star food in a bistro setting," Mr. Houle said.
 
A Look Takes Off, Bamboo and All
Mr. and Mrs. Cheah, who emigrated from Malaysia in 1991, rapidly began filling an empty niche, that of their native cuisine. The Cheahs -- he is 35, she is 34 -- opened Penang in late 1991 in Flushing, Queens, at 38-04 Prince Street, and cloned it about a year ago in Elmhurst, at 82-90 Broadway. Then in 1993 they leaped the East River with Penang SoHo, at 109 Spring Street (Mercer Street), attracting a clientele of Asians familiar with the cuisine and Americans intrigued by its curries, noodle dishes and exotically fragrant seafood.
Another Penang, at 240 Columbus Avenue (71st Street), opened last year. In September the Cheahs plan to add a Boston branch. They also own two Vietnamese restaurants, River, at 345 Amsterdam Avenue (76th Street), and Song, at 107 Macdougal Street (Bleecker Street). There are other family members involved in the Queens restaurants. Mr. Cheah said that Nyonya (pronounced KNOWN-yah), their newest place, at 194 Grand Street (Mott Street), will serve a more richly flavored and sophisticated type of Malaysian food, especially curries.
Though Penang Bar and Grill, which opened this week in the East Village, on Third Avenue near 11th Street, looks like the other Penangs in Manhattan, it is not owned by Mr. Cheah but by his brother Michael. "My brother copied every single concept," Suan Lee Cheah said. "I won't sue him, because he's my brother, but that is why our new restaurants are not named Penang."
Suan Lee Cheah, whose family produces and exports coffee, tea and carob powder, originally recruited two executive chefs from Malaysia. These chefs have trained others, some of whom are Chinese, to cook in the various restaurants. In a pinch, when a customer requests a particular regional dish and Mrs. Cheah is on hand, she will put on an apron and prepare it. "Home cooking is the best food in Malaysia, and my mom taught me a lot," she said.
With sharply peaked ceilings, rough-hewn logs and split bamboo details, all the Manhattan restaurants are designed to resemble traditional long houses in the Malaysian countryside. "I sawed and hammered the wood myself," Mr. Cheah said. Though Nyonya shares a similar style, like the hand-brushed logo, its furnishings include some antique pieces that Mr. Cheah has collected. He and his wife hope to open another Nyonya on the Upper West Side.
This rapidly expanding family of Asian restaurants has attracted potential investors. "Americans and Taiwanese have offered us a lot of money to open more places and be our partners," Mrs. Cheah said. "But we don't want to take chances with these outsiders."
The Penang look has seeped out beyond the Cheah family. For example, Van West, a Vietnamese restaurant opening soon on West 72d Street, has similar split bamboo eaves.
 
Easygoing Empire, A Block at a Time
Mr. Silverman has anchored his growing empire of reasonably priced restaurants in the Flatiron District. "I like this neighborhood," he said. "I live on 18th Street. I know the landlords. I walk the area. With all the restaurants I have around here, it's like operating the different food service venues in a large hotel."
A native of Baltimore and a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Mr. Silverman, who looks younger than his 42 years, opened his first New York restaurant, Cincinnati, at Third Avenue and East 20th Street, in 1981. Two years later, he turned it into the Maryland Crab House.
He captured the dining public's attention in 1990, exploiting the angst about high prices with Prix Fixe, a value-driven place with a complete $21 dinner menu and the talents of Terrance Brennan, now the chef and owner of Picholine. "It tapped into the down-scaling," he said.
But in some respects, it was before its time. The Flatiron district was just starting to gear up as a restaurant venue, and with the retail development on Sixth Avenue yet to evolve, the blocks west of Fifth Avenue were a kind of no-man's land.
He closed Prix Fixe, at 18 West 18th Street, two years ago and has converted it into the Flatiron Diner and Baking Company. In the meantime, he opened the City Crab and Seafood Company, at 235 Park Avenue South (19th Street); changed what was L'Espace into Steak Frites, 9 East 16th Street, and added Chat 'n' Chew, 10 East 16th Street, and Duke's, 99 East 19th Street.
With Simon Oren, the owner of French Roast and Brothers Bar-B-Q, he recently opened L'Express, a 24-hour cafe, at 249 Park Avenue South (20th Street). Mr. Silverman plans to redo Steak Frites as a Belgian restaurant, specializing in beers, mussels and frites, with Yves Jadot, the owner of La Petite Abeille, a new catering shop on West 18th Street.
Mr. Silverman also plans to open a City Crab in Times Square, and he is a partner, with Ken Sturm of Iridium, in the new Stardust Dine-o-Mat, at 1491 Broadway (43d Street), with whom he recently bid -- unsuccessfully -- on the former Mulholland Drive Cafe location on the Upper East Side. But regardless of the location, his places remain easygoing, serving fairly straightforward food at reasonable prices. His formula has influenced others, including Ira Freehof, who once worked with him and opened Comfort Diner in midtown last spring.
Mr. Silverman, who says he employs more than 500 people yet still goes to the Fulton Fish Market in the morning and scours flea markets for funky decorative accessories, is now poised for a big change. The Flatiron Diner and Baking Company will supply all his restaurants, he is thinking of starting his own laundry, and he is about to open a real office, with desks and electronic equipment, for his Flatiron Restaurant Group, which manages all his properties.
He will no longer have to operate like some other multiple-restaurant owners, including Mr. Iacovelli and the Cheahs, who set up ad hoc headquarters in whichever of their restaurants is handy at the moment.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Fall as Iraqi Sales Seem Close to Being Cleared

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Futures prices for crude oil fell yesterday after the United States said it would approve United Nations procedures governing Iraq's return to the world oil market.
To deal with concerns expressed by the United States, the United Nations said it would increase its staff of monitors overseeing a $2 billion sale of Iraqi oil and the distribution of aid within Iraq. 
 The United States has withheld approval of United Nations procedures to monitor Iraqi oil sales, saying it wanted firmer assurances that the money would go to humanitarian projects and not be diverted to Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein.
"The U.N. has resolved our major problem, which was the presence of monitors," a State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said yesterday. The United States will approve the guidelines, he added, "as soon as the last details of the negotiations can be completed."
Marc Wall, a trader at BZW in London, a unit of Barclays Bank, said yesterday: "I think a deal is going to come out in the next five days. The market's acting like the oil is getting closer."
Crude oil for September delivery fell 10 cents, to $21.13 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Natural gas prices fell for a second day as forecasts for cool weather signaled a week of lackluster demand by utilities that use natural gas as a standby fuel when air-conditioning demand surges.
Mild summer weather could help inventories, now 24 percent behind last year's level, recover in time for the heating season.
Soybeans rose amid concern that late planting and slow crop development had left immature plants vulnerable as they entered crucial growth stages.
The Agriculture Department said after trading ended yesterday that 69 percent of soybean fields were flowering, up 53 percent from a week ago but behind the typical rate of 77 percent for this time of year.
November soybeans rose 5 cents, to $7.3975 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: Clinton's '93 Budget Drove Current Boom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 3 front-page article on President Clinton's economic record ("With a Stable Economy, Clinton Hopes for Credit") should have given more emphasis to the centerpiece of his strategy, the 1993 budget package.
Its tax increases and spending restraint, backed by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, ignited the huge 1993 bond rally. That, in turn, set off a cascade of home refinancings and automobile purchases that revived the moribund economy of the Bush years. 
 At $1 billion per basis point, the reduction in yields that greeted Mr. Clinton's budget delivered the equivalent of a $150 billion tax cut without any cost to the Treasury.
No traditional Democratic fiscal stimulus package could have hoped for anything similar. Given the crushing debt left by the prior three Republican Administrations, the bond market would probably have taken any such stimulus back in the form of higher rates.
Mr. Clinton's market-based strategy marked a historic departure from his party's usual economic approach. It also was a courageous political gamble, passing by only one vote.
Every single Republican leader in Congress predicted the Clinton plan would ruin the economy. Shouldn't you have dusted off quotes from Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich or that former economics professor, Dick Armey?
Instead of admitting its mistakes, the G.O.P. is now choosing to complain about inadequate growth. Funny, the financial markets don't seem to think growth is too weak.
The Republicans' answer to a problem that doesn't exist is an inflationary, budget-busting tax cut that would surely be recaptured by the rise in interest rates that would ensue once the impact on the Federal deficit becomes clear.
Whatever other failings his Administration might have, it is more than fair for President Clinton to take credit for the solid economic performance since 1993, especially when it's so clearly traceable to his plan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises vs. Mark on Signs Of Weaker German Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar closed modestly higher yesterday, helped for a second consecutive session by weakness in the German mark.
The dollar rose against the mark after German unemployment data suggested that the country's labor market remained in the doldrums despite a recent pickup in economic activity there. 
 Dealers said that the data left open the possibility of a German interest rate cut, which would make German assets relatively less attractive to international investors.
"The employment report was the excuse that drove the dollar up against the mark," said Dorit Ronnen, foreign exchange trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York. "The data just shows that there is a valid reason for the Bundesbank to lower rates."
The adjusted July unemployment rate in Germany fell to 10.2 percent from 10.3 percent in June, but remained higher than the 9.4 percent registered in July of last year.
The mark trimmed its losses as the day wore on, posting gains against the besieged French franc and other European currencies.
But it failed to erase all its losses against the dollar, which settled at 1.4847 marks, up from 1.4826 on Monday. The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen in light trading, settling at 106.79 yen, up from 106.60.
James Kemp, chief spot dealer at Citibank, said a rumor that French Government officials had been in touch with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany about a delay in the European Monetary Union helped to raise the mark against its European counterparts. French officials denied the rumor, but the currency markets appeared to latch on to it nonetheless.
The British pound settled to $1.5375, down from $1.5440 on Monday; the dollar also rose slightly against the French franc, settling at 5.0555 francs, up from 5.0360.
The dollar found support against the yen overnight after a Japanese public fund reportedly bought dollars around 106.45 yen, a sign that the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not want the dollar to fall below this threshold.
Rumors of Bank of Japan intervention on behalf of the dollar also bolstered the dollar against the yen overseas, but dealers characterized trading in the United States as extremely thin.

HEADLINE: It Isn't Farmers Who Kill Rain Forests

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Family farms are not destroying the rain forests. Ismail Serageldin of the World Bank makes this accusation ("A Report Blames Poor Farmers for Deforestation," news article, Aug. 4) to divert our attention from the real culprits, many of whom are clients of the bank itself: giant ranching, logging and mining interests for whom the destruction of forest is highly profitable.
Throughout the Latin American tropics and in many regions of Asia and Africa, fires are deliberately set by agribusiness and the landowning elites to destroy the forest and replace it with pasture. The loss of forests from this cause has been increasing at an explosive rate, and this is the main reason the rain forest is shrinking. 
 Small farmers are not part of the problem; they are part of the solution. Those who practice forest-fallow agriculture (so-called slash-and-burn) use fire with great care, and deliberately encourage forest regeneration, because their continued livelihood depends on the forest ecosystem. It is where peasants have been pushed off the land by big landowners and corporations that the forest suffers. And the claim that overpopulation causes deforestation is another myth propagated by the World Bank and its friends to shift the blame from themselves to their victims.

Treasury Prices Rise; Demand Light

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds ended with very little change yesterday despite lackluster demand in the first leg of the Treasury's quarterly sale of notes and bonds.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond edged up 3/32, to 90 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.75 percent from 6.76 percent.
Analysts said the market's performance was good in light of the new supply of bonds and the results of the Treasury's three-year note sale.
The Treasury sold $19.0 billion of the three-year notes yesterday with an average yield of 6.118 percent, slightly below expectations of a yield of 6.125 percent. But the bid-to-cover ratio was below average at 2.30. The ratio is the total dollar amount of all bids divided by the size of the auction.
"You have to call it a good performance by the market in the face of supply," Patrick Dimick, bond market economist at the CS First Boston Corporation, said.
Analysts said overall demand for the three-year notes was lackluster, but still came in strong enough to bring the yield in slightly lower than had been expected.
Analysts said the auction was mostly dominated by dealers, professional investors who trade on the spread between various Treasury securities' yields.
The Treasury continues its quarterly sale today, with the sale of $10 billion in 10-year notes, and tomorrow with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds.
Traders and analysts said the three-year sale gave little indication on how the 10-year note auction would fare, but some said domestic demand mainly from portfolio managers should underpin demand.
The market shrugged off a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in chain-store sales in the week ended Aug. 3 as measured by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim chain store sales index.
It also played down the importance of a 1.4 percent drop in retail sales in July as measured by the Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc. Redbook Retail Sales Index.
The overall outlook for the Treasury market remains bright on hopes the Federal Reserve will hold rates unchanged when policy makers meet on Aug. 20.
The short end of the market rallied "based on expectations of no Fed tightening and now that strength is carrying over to longer maturities," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
In the corporate market, bonds closed mostly unchanged amid a flood of fresh supply.
Traders said the recent Treasury market rally paved the way for large corporate bond issues, which found ample demand despite competition from the Treasury auction.
About $1.5 billion in investment-grade corporate bonds were sold yesterday. Dresser Industries, an oilfield equipment company, led the pack with a $300 million, 100-year issue. The debt was priced to yield 7.622 percent, or 87 basis points -- hundredths of a percentage point -- more than the 30-year Treasury.
The lead manager, Salomon Brothers Inc., said the deal was oversubscribed three times and placed with roughly 40 money managers and insurance companies, far more than the handful of investors seen buying 100-year bonds in the past. The issue was increased from $200 million on strong demand, Salomon said.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-year notes yesterday:

HEADLINE: For Zapatistas, Talk Turns to Unarmed Struggle

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: LA REALIDAD, Mexico, Aug. 3

 BODY:
About 2,000 sympathizers of the Zapatista rebels came from around the world to meet for three days on a plain of oozing mud in an Indian hamlet in southern Mexico to ruminate about the shortcomings of capitalism.
Leftists from 43 nations bathed in a turbid river and slept in string hammocks under tin-roof shelters that barely kept out the warm jungle downpour. In free-form debates that stretched into dawn hours they denounced the global trend toward free trade economic policies and brainstormed about carrying the Zapatista cause to their home countries. 
 The gathering, which ended on Saturday, was a high moment for the masked Indian guerrillas and their enigmatic leader, Subcommander Marcos, who stunned Mexico with an armed uprising on New Year's Day 1994. But as the participants of this conference slithered through the rainy season bog, the conclave also became an example of the trouble the Zapatistas are having in holding the political ground they seized in their one-week war.
Their motley military force long ago ceased to pose any threat to the Mexican Government, if ever it did. Now they are holed up in distant rain forest canyons in the state of Chiapas, struggling to build on the fame and credibility they gained from the rebellion to mobilize an unarmed nationwide opposition movement.
In their ambition to grow, the Zapatistas organized a series of colorful conventions in Chiapas in recent months that brought together leftist intellectuals and activists to talk about political reform in Mexico.
Subcommander Marcos himself unstrapped his automatic rifle and traveled unarmed to a city outside the jungle to preside over some of the sessions. The meetings kept Zapatista leaders in the media spotlight and insured a steady flow of high-profile visitors through the Indian communities they control.
But these communities, in whose name the uprising was fought, by and large are still waiting to see the improvements in their lives that the Zapatistas said they hoped to bring.
As usual, the Zapatistas' strategy is novel. Rebel armies in Central America, like the contras the United States sponsored in Nicaragua or the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, waited until the ink was dry on comprehensive peace accords before disarming and going into above-ground politics.
The Zapatistas, who have been in negotiations with the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo since October 1995, are not waiting for a formal peace before starting to change into an unarmed movement.
In 1995 they conducted a poll on the Internet to ask Mexicans what they wanted the rebels to do. A majority of 1.5 million people who answered by E-mail said the Zapatistas should give up fighting and become a grass-roots organization. So in a declaration they issued from the Chiapas jungle on Jan. 6, they said they would.
"The Government is capable of stalling the talks for years -- we have to move forward in spite of them," said Javier Elorriaga, a journalist who was jailed for more than a year for his ties to the Zapatistas and is now in charge of organizing their nonmilitary front as a "landing field" for the guerrillas after peace is reached.
On paper at least, the front is growing quickly. More than 400 civilian Zapatista committees have been organized, covering virtually all of Mexico. With their knack for communications, the Zapatistas linked together their civilian supporters through an Internet network. They are ready to go to CD-ROM format, making discs that would allow their followers to visit them in their jungle strongholds via computer without having to wade in the mud of this village, whose name means "Reality" in Spanish.
But the description Subcommander Marcos and top Indian commanders have provided of the purpose of the civilian front is so vague that even Mr. Elorriaga is not sure how to describe what it does. The commanders have mandated only that front members cannot run for political office or aspire to Government positions, and they must, of course, support the Zapatistas' eclectic socialist cause.
"It's a rainbow," was as concise as Mr. Elorriaga could be.
The Zapatistas made an alliance with an organization of bank debtors and emerged as Mexico's most effective popular movement during the recession of 1995. The biggest left-of-center political party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, flirted with the rebels but then pulled back. No Zapatista front group has yet staged a protest action that has gained any attention.
The rebels are working hard on their civilian power base partly to leave no doubt about their commitment to nonviolence. They stuck to their position even when a new masked and armed group claiming to be leftist guerrillas appeared in the western state of Guerrero in June. Subcommander Marcos carefully distanced his rebels from the Guerrero group, denying there were any ties.
But Zapatista leaders are aware that the Government wins and they lose as the peace talks drag on over time. [A new round of talks began Tuesday in a Chiapas village.]
"It seems the Government delegation is just there to give the appearance of dialogue," Subcommander Marcos told reporters here. "It makes us think those talks are bound to be a failure, and our stay up here in the jungle will be much longer than we thought."
The rebels say they cannot build a powerful opposition group unless they can move around Mexico. While talks are under way all arrest warrants and military operations against them are suspended, but they must remain in the territory they control. They want to hold a demonstration in Mexico City, but the Government has denied their demands for safe conduct.
As a result of donations the Zapatistas attracted through their international ties, La Realidad and several communities like it have electricity for the first time. The Zapatista presence finally convinced the Government to fix the treacherous road into this village -- primarily so army vehicles could get through.
A partial accord the Zapatistas signed in February called for an overhaul of the justice system in Chiapas to give fairer representation to Indians. But that pact has yet to produce changes that can be felt in the communities.
Meanwhile, within the Zapatistas' army there is a sense they are still short of their goals -- and there is resistance to leaving the armed struggle.
Commander Trini -- the highest-ranking Zapatista woman -- gave a fiery answer when asked what she thought of the proposed transformation.
"Our weapons are our treasure," she said. "As long as we have them we are not ever going to give them up."

HEADLINE: Nursing Homes Draw Attention As Worker-Safety Focus Shifts

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
When people consider the most dangerous places to work in America, nursing homes probably do not place high on the list. But they should. Only truck drivers and common laborers suffer more on-the-job injuries than nursing home workers do.
That is why the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, entering a widening rift between nursing homes and their workers, will announce this week a campaign aimed at reducing injuries and ridding the industry of its dubious distinction. 
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nursing home workers suffered more than 221,000 nonfatal occupational injuries in 1994, the most recent year for which data are available -- about 16.8 injuries per 100 workers. That ranked the industry as more dangerous than mining, construction, electrical work and automobile repair.
While back injuries from lifting patients are the most common threat, nursing aides and orderlies must also guard against infectious agents, such as those that cause tuberculosis, hepatitis and AIDS, as well as fend off violent and combative patients.
"It's significant that they have recognized that this is an industry that has a problem," said David Snapp, nursing home campaign director for the Service Employees International Union. During the last three years, the union has organized workers in 100 nursing homes, adding about 7,000 members to the 1.5 million, mostly health care workers, already in the union.
Taking on worker safety in nursing homes represents a changing role for OSHA, which has been chided in the past for focusing on safety problems in manufacturing rather than in service industries.
"The health care industry leapt to our attention because of its rapidly increasing size and the number of injuries," said Joseph A. Dear, an Assistant Labor Secretary who oversees OSHA.
In 1993, 1.8 million people lived in nursing homes and that figure has been steadily rising, according to the American Health Care Association., In terms of numbers of injuries, health care is likely to be an increasing source of problems as the industry grows to serve an expanding population of older Americans. But in terms of severity, health care will probably never be as deadly as trucking and farm labor, which lead the Government's fatalities list.
Still, changes in health care have put nursing home employees at greater risk of injury, experts say. Increasingly, patients still in need of considerable care are being transferred out of hospitals to nursing homes, even as staffing levels have not increased, Mr. Snapp said.
Oftentimes, he said, a lone worker must lift a patient, making injuries more likely. In a study released last year, entitled "Caring Till It Hurts," the union said staff shortages were a leading cause of injuries.
A spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association welcomed OSHA's attention, but warned against overstating the problem. "We think it's important that worker safety issues be addressed, and we already think the industry is doing a good job," said Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the group, which represents 11,000 nursing homesand other providers of long-term care.
OSHA's effort, which emphasizes training, is indicative of the less confrontational tack adopted after years of criticism from employers and members of Congress who considered the agency too meddlesome.
Beginning perhaps as soon as next week, with a pilot program in Florida, OSHA will teach nursing home employees how to safely lift patients and use equipment like electronic lifts. The agency will also review practices, like the use of gloves and masks, to curb the spread of disease.
Nursing home operators will get a grace period of several months before OSHA resumes inspections and begins imposing fines, Mr. Dear said. The program will involve seven states: New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.
Traditionally, OSHA would "just come in, look for hazards and cite the company," said Stephen Gaskill, an OSHA spokesman. "Now our goal is to find and fix hazards, not really to fine people."
Part of the reason for the gentler stance is economics. Operating with more limited resources -- the agency has one-third fewer inspectors than in 1979 -- OSHA is less able to mount broad enforcement campaigns. Instead, by spending a modest amount -- about $100,000 -- on worker training, the agency hopes to correct the problem and have a broader impact, Mr. Dear said.
Ms. Keegan said that some of the efforts that nursing home owners had made recently to improve safety were prompted by the industry's own recognition of safety and health problems. But some of the training and education programs were prompted by OSHA, she said.
Whatever the impetus, improving the industry's accident record could help curb one expensive component of nursing home care: rising workers' compensation costs. Such savings are expected to offset any new costs from the safety campaign, like equipment purchases or increased hiring, industry experts said.
But even using the latest equipment does not guarantee safety.
Though she was wearing a brace and the patient was wearing a belt to aid in lifting, Grace Maxwell sprained her back last October as she and another worker in a Pennsylvania nursing home hoisted a patient who was fighting their efforts.
"As I was lifting, I felt something snap in my back," said Mrs. Maxwell, who has worked in nursing homes for 12 years. "The pain was excruciating." She said she missed a week of work and spent three weeks in physical therapy.
Others believe that more emphasis on safety will make a difference.
"I may not be able to return to the career which I chose for myself," said Denita Taylor, a 36-year-old nursing home worker in Lancaster, Pa., who hurt her back last year. "I was told I had proper lifting techniques and that this happened because of repetitive lifting. I think this could have been avoided."

HEADLINE: Political Savvy Tempers European Furor Over U.S. Bill Aimed at Libya and Iran

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Beyond loud protests and warnings of reprisals, European officials today depicted President Clinton's threat of sanctions against foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran or Libya as an election-year ploy that would have little real effect on either trade or terrorism.
Moreover, officials in Germany, France and Italy said the new American policy would not deter them from dealing with the two nations, which Washington has cast as principal sponsors of terrorism. 
 Mr. Clinton signed the bill into law on Monday. The new legislation comes at a time of growing concern over terrorism in the United States, after the terrorist bombing of an American military complex in Saudi Arabia and the crash of a Trans World Airlines 747 jetliner off Long Island, in which a bomb is suspected.
At France's behest, the European Union is discussing possible retaliation against American economic interests over the new law, the French Foreign Ministry in Paris said.
But after vehement European protests on Monday, senior Italian and German officials played down the likely effect of the new legislation, seeking to prevent aggravating the dispute with Washington that could be intensified by the American Presidential election campaign.
"As for a dramatic trade war between America and Europe, I am not convinced that everything will be served as hot as it's being cooked," said Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister. Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner.
Lamberto Dini, the Foreign Minister of Italy, the former colonial power in Libya and Tripoli's largest trading partner, called the American measures "symbolic."
"We Europeans know this perfectly well but at the same time we can't just sit back in silence," he said, referring to the European stance on the new American law. "We should react, but without hysteria."
Nonetheless, the American legislation, and European reaction to it, again illuminated the differences between the United States and European attitudes on the issue of terrorism. While Washington insists that Iran and Libya must be confronted over their support for terrorism, the Europeans, seeking to protect economic interests, argue that dialogue will achieve greater changes in both countries than isolation.
Echoing views expressed by his Italian counterpart, Mr. Kinkel said in a radio interview today, "Part of what is going on in America has to be seen as part of the election campaign." He added, however, reflecting a widespread European sentiment, "this is a measure that the Europeans cannot accept."
"We agree with America on most issues," the German minister said. "On the issue of how to treat Iran -- with or without talks -- we have a different opinion."
Collectively, European Union countries subscribe to a policy that they call "critical dialogue" with Iran, meaning that while they stand ready to castigate Teheran, they are not prepared to ostracize it.
"We think it is more correct to keep talking to Iran and not drive it into a corner," Mr. Kinkel said.
As evidence of the efficacy of this policy, German officials point to events last month when a senior German official, Bernd Schmidbauer, used what were described as close ties to the Iranian intelligence community to arrange an exchange of bodies and prisoners between Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
By contrast, Mr. Dini said, the American moves "are not going to effectively counter terrorism."
The debate has widespread economic underpinnings.
In France, the Total Oil Company signed a $600 million deal with Iran last year to develop offshore oil fields, the biggest outstanding contract of its kind in the world. But the company said today that it did not regard the contract as being affected by the new American legislation. "Our reading shows that sanctions will only apply to new business," a company spokesman said.
Iran and Libya account for one quarter of all the oil imported into the European Union countries, said Christos Papoutsis, a senior official in Brussels. Mr. Papoutsis expressed worries that sanctions against European suppliers of oil industry technology could have long-term effects on the Iranian and Libyan oil and gas industries, driving up world prices.
Italy, for instance, imports some 45 percent of its oil from Libya and Iran, according to official figures.
An important first test of the American policy could come soon in Turkey, which has close economic links with both Iran and Europe. Turkey's new Islamic Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan, plans a visit to Iran this weekend, his first foreign trip since taking office. The Turkish Energy Minister, Recai Kutan, is also to visit Teheran this week to discuss a 23-year, $20 billion deal for the supply of Iranian natural gas and the building of a pipeline between the two countries.
The agreement was first initialed last year by the former government, and Turkish officials said today that it was not clear whether the deal would be signed this week.

Netscape Escalates Battle With Microsoft
Netscape Communications' bitter software marketing war with Microsoft escalated into a threat of legal action.
In a letter to Microsoft, a copy of which was sent to the Justice Department, a lawyer for Netscape accused Microsoft of antitrust violations, saying limits on the number of Internet connections that can be made to a single copy of Microsoft NT Workstation software impinged on Netscape's ability to sell its own Fastrack Server software. Microsoft replied that its NT Workstation and NT Server were two different products. [Page D4.]
 
Stocks Rise in Cautious Trading
Stocks struggled higher, erasing more of July's market correction, but traders were cautious, shying away from record territory. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.83, to 5,696.11, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 8.34, to 1,128.87, as big technology companies, notably Microsoft and Intel, continued to improve.

Treasury bonds were little changed, despite lackluster demand in the first leg of the Treasury's quarterly auction. The price of the 30-year bond edged up, pushing its yield down slightly to 6.75 percent. [D16.]
 
Stockbrokers' Earnings Climb
Brokers' earnings rose last year, the Securities Industry Association reported, thanks to higher stock prices and volume. Retail brokers' average income rose 6 percent, to $123,839; institutional brokers' earnings surged 26 percent to $289,405 on average. [D6.]
 
Westinghouse Reports Loss
Westinghouse Electric reported an $89 million loss for the second quarter, citing a $116 million charge for environmental cleanup costs. The company showed strong radio and syndications gains, but warned that it expected earnings to drop in the third quarter because its CBS network trailed rival NBC during the Olympics. [D2.]
 
The I.R.S. Not the Ogre Dole Saw?
Bob Dole has taken aim at a widely loathed institution -- the I.R.S. -- promising "a simpler, fairer, flatter" tax system and an end to "K.G.B.-like life style audits." In fact, the I.R.S. is already shrinking, but with better computers, it is more efficient. [A12.]
 
Government officials, lawmakers and industry lobbyists said that Bob Dole's proposal to raise $34 billion by selling broadcast licenses would never fly politically, even within his own Republican Party. [A12.]
 
Urine Test for H.I.V. Is Approved

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PLATFORM;
G.O.P. Moderates Vow to Revive Provision on Abortion Tolerance

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Set back by conservatives who removed the compromise "tolerance" language on abortion from the Republican Party platform, moderates vowed today to wage a fight at the convention next week to reinstate at least an acknowledgment that some Republicans favor abortion rights.
Govs. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and Pete Wilson of California spearheaded efforts today to overhaul language approved on Monday in San Diego by a platform subcommittee. Every effort was overwhelmingly rejected and proponents could not even muster the 20 percent of the delegates on the platform committee needed to force a roll-call vote. 
 That failure increased the chances of a messy floor fight over abortion when the convention opens next Monday and delegates will vote on the platform. Bob Dole, the party's all-but-certain Presidential nominee, had tried to avoid the distraction of such a floor fight by yielding to conservatives in advance.
The new language says Republicans have different views on different subjects but does not mention abortion specifically as one of those subjects. It removes references to differences on issues of "personal conscience" that the Dole campaign had inserted last month. It also includes a new sentence that suggests that those who perform abortions will be prosecuted. It still calls for a constitutional amendment against abortion and opposes the use of any Federal money for abortions.
Mr. Weld said today that he, Mr. Wilson, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine had succeeded in gaining pledges of support from leaders of eight state delegations, two more than the six needed to bring a matter to the convention floor. He also said that he had been in contact with senior Dole aides throughout the day and that they had given him their blessing in the hope that the matter could be resolved before the convention opens.
Mr. Weld, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Snowe released a joint statement today saying: "We are deeply disappointed and troubled by this flawed decision, which flies in the face of Republican opinion across the country. We believe that abortion should be treated as a matter of conscience rather than an opportunity for government intrusion into a deeply personal decision."
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who also supports abortion rights, stopped short of endorsing a floor fight but said the removal of tolerance language from the platform was "clearly out of step with the majority of our party and with the majority of Americans." His spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said today that he had not decided what he would do if the matter could not be resolved before the delegates voted, "but if it gets to the floor, he'll vote with the pro-choice forces." Governor Whitman said today that that Mr. Dole's yielding to the anti-abortion forces jeopardized his chances of winning the November election. She said she believed that many delegates were more concerned with keeping the tolerance language out of the platform than they were with getting Mr. Dole elected.
But as the moderates began mobilizing, the conservatives demonstrated that they were geared for battle throughout the convention.
Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said that his forces had lined up 102 people to work as whips on the convention floor in the event of a fight. He said they have bought a computer system to allow the whips to communicate with each other and have set up a "war room" in a nearby hotel.
The renewed dispute over abortion erupted as Mr. Dole was reaping relatively favorable publicity for the economic plan he announced on Monday and as he prepared to make public his Vice Presidential running mate later this week, which the Dole campaign hoped would produce positive publicity.
After moving toward the moderates, Mr. Dole seesawed, then reversed himself and capitulated last month to anti-abortion forces. But his nearly complete capitulation was not complete enough, leaving him without the votes on Monday to stave off their insistence that he rid the platform of all language endorsing tolerance.
Speaking by satellite to the platform committee today, Mr. Dole, ignored abortion and discussed his economic plan instead. At a news conference in San Diego, Speaker Newt Gingrich avoided answering numerous questions about abortion.
The conservatives' hold on the platform was evident from a new New York Times/CBS News poll of Republican convention delegates, which showed that only 28 percent favored the tolerance plank offered last month by Mr. Dole.
The poll of all 1,236 delegates, conducted during July and August, showed that 4 percent would not permit abortion at all, 28 percent would permit it only to save the woman's life, and 38 percent would permit abortion in a wider group of circumstances, including rape and incest and to save the woman's life. Twelve percent more would permit it subject to somewhat greater restrictions than exist now. Eleven percent would permit it in all circumstances, while 8 percent expressed no opinion.
The poll showed that 49 percent of the delegates said the platform should officially oppose abortion, while 40 percent said it should take no official stand. Rank-and-file Republican voters nationwide are slightly less anti-abortion that their representatives at the convention.
In 1992, Governor Weld and others had vowed a floor fight at the convention, only to drop it at the last minute when their support from other party leaders fizzled. Governor Wilson, who was one of those backing off the floor fight in 1992, was asked tonight in San Diego what had changed this year.
Asserting that he represented a majority of Republicans, Mr. Wilson said that he and others were doing "a doubtful kindness to George Bush" by backing off, suggesting that had they taken the matter to the floor, they might have prevailed in making the party appear more tolerant.
He said abortion-rights supporters "may be a minority inside the convention hall; it is a majority outside the convention hall."
Asked if there were a floor fight this year, would he lead it, Mr. Wilson replied, "If necessary."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE NUMBERS;
Dole Airwaves Plan Adds Up, But Is Unlikely to Win Support

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
On the face of it, Bob Dole's proposal to raise $34 billion by selling broadcast licenses would seem plausible. The Federal Communications Commission has already raised $20 billion by auctioning off other, far less precious, slivers of the nation's airwaves.
But despite its logic, Government officials, lawmakers, and industry lobbyists said yesterday that this provision of Mr. Dole's economic plan would never fly politically, even with his own party. 
 In a letter last June, the top Republican leaders of both the Senate and the House explicitly instructed the F.C.C. not to auction a new batch of digital signals to the highest bidder. Instead, they called on the commission to award these licenses without charge to broadcasters so that they could deliver a new form of digitally enhanced television.
And when Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, offered an amendment to an appropriations bill calling for spectrum auctions last month, the House defeated it by a vote of 408 to 16.
"It just shows the unreality of his campaign," Mr. Frank said in a telephone interview yesterday. "Almost everybody in the Republican Party is against this issue."
Spectrum auctions are alluring to politicians because they offer a way to squeeze billions of dollars out of a resource -- the airwaves -- that the Government has historically given away. The F.C.C. collected billions more than it expected in two recent auctions of licenses for a new type of wireless telephone service.
But in the case of television frequencies, the lure of easy money has collided with formidable lobbying by the broadcast industry. The industry says that auctions could force smaller stations out of business and jeopardize free, over-the-air television. Such an argument is persuasive in an election year, when politicians crave exposure on television.
Mr. Dole fought, and lost, this battle once before. Last January, as Senate majority leader, he threatened to hold up the passage of a sweeping telecommunications bill because it provided for the Government to hand over digital licenses to broadcasters. Calling this a multibillion-dollar giveaway, Mr. Dole insisted that Congress hold hearings to determine how much the Government could raise by auctioning off the spectrum instead.
Although Congress held hearings, Mr. Dole's successor as Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, abandoned the issue soon after Mr. Dole left. Mr. Lott, along with Speaker Newt Gingrich, were among those who signed the letter to the F.C.C.
Yesterday, Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters, said, "We cannot support the concept of spectrum auctions."
As for Mr. Dole's arithmetic on the potential proceeds from an auction, several media experts said he might not be far off. Economists from the F.C.C. recently calculated that digital television licenses would command anywhere from $11 billion to $70 million.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE TARGET;
Dole Taking Clear Aim At Nation's Tax Collector

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Just as Bill Clinton found an easy target four years ago in attacking the welfare system, Bob Dole has now taken aim at another institution that many people love to hate.
"I will eliminate the I.R.S. as we know it," Mr. Dole declared on Monday -- even invoking the same oratorical flourish that Mr. Clinton had used against welfare -- in laying out his economic program with a speech in Chicago. 
 To many Americans, the Internal Revenue Service is a bloated and meddlesome bureaucracy that goes overboard in pursuit of its mandate to see that they tell the truth about their incomes and pay the Government its due. In fact, the I.R.S. is a shrinking agency today, although its improved computer systems allow it to be a more efficient tax collector.
In his Chicago speech, Mr. Dole nevertheless proposed an overhaul that would indeed change the agency as it has been known.
For one thing, he promised a simpler system "that will allow Americans to file their tax returns without the help of a lawyer or accountant, or both."
Of 116 million tax returns now filed by individuals, 40 million are just one page long. Under Mr. Dole's plan, most of those 40 million would no longer need to be filed; adjustment in withholding from the taxpayers' wages would suffice.
Further, Mr. Dole said, the I.R.S., not the taxpayer, would bear the burden of proof in the determination of whether the information on the return was accurate, and therefore whether taxes paid had been sufficient. He also vowed to "end the I.R.S. K.G.B.-like life-style audits" of taxpayers who appear to live better than their incomes permit.
Mr. Dole said that he would stop the Government's punishment of people for what he termed innocent mistakes and that he would "downsize the I.R.S. and upsize the amount of money Americans get to keep in their pockets."
With his remarks, Mr. Dole seized on the agency's long history of periodic abuses, from agents' snooping on friends and celebrities, to the Nixon Administration's use of the I.R.S. to spy on its enemies, to a staple of the agency's critics: the case of an agent who nine years ago arranged the seizure of the $10.35 savings account of a 12-year-old Virginia boy, Garry D. Keffer, to satisfy his parents' tax debt, payment for which they had in fact already mailed.
Mr. Dole described a goliath of an agency: "twice as big" as the Central Intelligence Agency, "five times as big" as the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Rosalie Cameron, spokeswoman for the Government's Office of Personnel Management, confirmed that, with 106,000 employees, the I.R.S. was indeed about five times the size of the F.B.I., with 22,000.
As for the C.I.A., the number of its employees is not generally disclosed, and Ms. Cameron had nothing to say about it except that if Mr. Dole was correct that the I.R.S. was twice as big, "it had to be classified information he was operating on, I believe." Mr. Dole's press office did not return telephone calls seeking clarification.
In any case, the I.R.S., like the Government generally, has been shrinking under the pressure of cuts in its budget, which is $7.3 billion this year, down from $7.5 billion in 1995.
The agency has lost about 10,000 employees since 1992, and an additional 2,400 or so are to be trimmed from its payroll during the coming year.
But with better computer systems, the agency has become a more efficient tax collector. It is auditing more individual returns than ever: 1.9 million last year, or 1.7 percent of those filed -- 700,000 more than in 1992, when it audited 1 percent.
Last year also brought $3.3 billion in penalties from individuals, matching a peak reached in 1992. Throughout the 1990's, penalties collected have averaged slightly more than $3 billion a year, nearly a fivefold increase over the $670 million collected in 1980.
To many experts on the tax collection system, the I.R.S. is merely doing the job that Congress demands. And it does that job rather well, these experts say, particularly given Capitol Hill's periodic changes in tax law and reluctance to appropriate enough money to make the agency's computers, which have been improved incrementally, truly state of the art.
"The I.R.S. has one heck of a hard job to do," said J. D. Foster, executive director and chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed research organization. "And they are asked to do that with Congress looking over their shoulder at every step, constantly reinventing the law and denying them the money to upgrade their systems."
But others say that in vigorous pursuit of its mission, the I.R.S. can lose sight of its role as a servant of the public interest, defining efficiency more in terms of how much it can collect than in how close it can come to determining precisely how much a taxpayer should actually pay.
"The I.R.S. certainly has not thought of itself as representing the people's Government in that way," said Michael Graetz, a Yale University law professor, who was the Treasury's deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in the Bush Administration.
"There is a lot of anti-I.R.S. sentiment abroad in the land, and that Dole is attempting to tap into, because neither the Congress nor the I.R.S. has thought about the I.R.S. this way," Professor Graetz said. "In the last decade, you have seen a system of increasing penalties that Congress sets by law, and it is creating an attitude that 'I am a dupe for doing the right thing when everyone else is cheating, and now I am being penalized for doing the best I can.' "
Still, other experts say Mr. Dole's proposal that the agency bear the burden of proof in challenging taxpayer returns seems unworkable. "The taxpayer has the information, the I.R.S. doesn't," said Donald Alexander, a Washington lawyer who was I.R.S. Commissioner from 1973 to 1977. "I fail to see why a taxpayer shouldn't stand behind his or her return."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
Citizenship Proposal Faces Obstacle in the Constitution

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
In proposing to deny United States citizenship to children born in this country to illegal immigrants, members of the Republican Platform Committee are challenging a pillar of constitutional law erected nearly 130 years ago.
On Monday, a subcommittee of the platform committee endorsed a proposal to abolish the guarantee of citizenship extended by the 14th Amendment to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States." The full committee is expected to endorse the proposal this week. 
 The proposal comes at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment appears to be growing. The welfare bill passed last week by Congress curtails a wide variety of Federal benefits for immigrants, even those legally present in the United States. A separate measure moving through Congress would crack down on illegal immigration and allow states to deny a free public education to children who are illegal aliens.
The Supreme Court has described citizenship as the most basic of all rights, a "priceless possession." But whether illegal immigrants come to this country to guarantee citizenship for their children is hotly debated.
Many Republicans say the fact that children born here to illegal immigrants are citizens makes it easier for their parents to obtain immigrant visas and citizenship at a later date. Hispanic groups and other advocates for immigrants say there is little evidence that "birthright citizenship" serves as a lure.
The Republican proposal is modeled on a recommendation from a panel created by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The panel, the Congressional Task Force on Immigration Reform, said in June 1995 that Congress should "end automatic birthright citizenship for children born within the borders of the United States to illegal immigrant parents." The task force was composed of 47 Republican lawmakers and 7 Democrats.
The Clinton Administration opposes this change. The Acting Solicitor General, Walter Dellinger, said it would undermine a bedrock principle of constitutional law and create "a permanent caste of aliens, generation after generation born in America but never to be among its citizens."
The task force was headed by Representative Elton Gallegly, Republican of California, who has been trying for five years to abolish the citizenship provided automatically to American-born children of illegal immigrants. Republicans say that 100,000 babies are born to illegal aliens each year in California alone.
Mr. Gallegly said the Republican proposal would deter illegal immigration.
"Our current law encourages widespread illegal immigration and costs American taxpayers billions of dollars a year," he said. The 14th Amendment was written to guarantee citizenship for freed slaves, he said, not for the children of immigrants.
To be sure, a primary purpose of the 14th Amendment was to overrule the Dred Scott decision, in which the Supreme Court had held that neither blacks who were "imported into this country and sold as slaves" nor their descendants could ever become citizens of the United States.
But when Congress was debating the 14th Amendment in 1866, it considered the likelihood that the words would apply to children of immigrants too. And some lawmakers approved of that idea.
During that debate, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania objected to the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. "Is the child of the Chinese immigrant in California a citizen?" he asked on the Senate floor.
Senator John Conness of California said the answer should be "yes."
"The children of all parentage whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens," Mr. Conness said.
The Constitution as written did not define who was a United States citizen. The Founding Fathers and their contemporaries were citizens of individual states, but there was no definition of United States citizenship in the Constitution until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. It was the Republican Party that pushed the 14th Amendment and other Reconstruction measures through Congress.
The meaning of the citizenship clause has been clear since 1898, when the Supreme Court held that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a United States citizen, even though the parents were prohibited by the Chinese Exclusion Act from ever becoming citizens.
The proposal drafted this week by the Platform Committee says that the Republican Party supports "a constitutional amendment or constitutionally valid legislation declaring that children born in the United States of parents illegally present are not automatically citizens." Constitutional scholars say that an amendment would almost certainly be needed, and that legislation would be inadequate to make such a profound change.
Hispanic groups and other critics of the Republican proposal say it punishes innocent children for the conduct of their parents.
In an interview today, Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization, said: "The immigration debate has reached a point where Republicans are apparently prepared to attack newborns. This proposal would create a class of stateless people in the United States. It would require hospitals to check the citizenship status of every woman giving birth. That's the only way you can determine which babies are going to be denied citizenship."
Mr. Gallegly said "a growing number of women illegally enter the United States for the sole purpose of giving birth to an American citizen." Ms. Munoz said she knew of no evidence to support that contention.
Barbara Jordan, a former chairwoman of the United States Commission on Immigration Reform, criticized the proposal a month before she died earlier this year.
"To deny birthright citizenship is to derail the engine of American liberty," Ms. Jordan told Congress in December.
Immigration has been a divisive issue for the Republican Party in the last few years. Some Republicans, like Representative Lamar Smith of Texas and Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, have pushed legislation to reduce legal immigration. But free-market conservatives like Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett oppose such restrictions, saying legal immigrants contribute to economic growth, start new businesses, create jobs and make good Americans.
Political scientists say that party platforms are often a reliable guide to how Presidential candidates will perform if elected. In many cases, they say, Presidents try to carry out the promises they made while running for office.

HEADLINE: Trading Little Loopholes for a Giant One

BYLINE: By Jonathan Chait; Jonathan Chait writes on economics for The New Republic and The American Prospect.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bob Dole's plan endorsing a big tax cut was as notable for what it left out as for what it left in. He did not come out in favor of a flat tax of the type recommended by his election rival, Steve Forbes. While the supply-siders did not get everything they wanted, however, Mr. Dole stated that his ultimate goal is a "fairer, flatter system that will allow Americans to file their tax returns without the help of a lawyer or an accountant." He also said he would "eliminate the I.R.S. as we know it," and declared his proposed cut "the opening salvo in a battle to repeal the current tax code."
With important Congressional Republicans lining up behind some sort of "fairer, flatter" tax, it's worth pointing out that the system several of them have in mind would be neither. They are exploiting popular discontent with tax code favoritism, for which they themselves are responsible, to impose a solution that would make it worse. 
 The pure flat-taxers invoke a lofty principle called tax neutrality, which holds that the tax code should treat all income the same. But this obscures one minor detail: the flat tax does not treat all income the same. It taxes only salaries and leaves investment income untouched. If a C.E.O. makes $300,000, she would get taxed at 20 percent, or whatever the flat rate happened to be. But if she happened to prefer that $300,000 in stock options, then it would not be taxed at all. It's like the loopholes Republicans have supported for years. Only it's one giant loophole for all of them, instead of countless small loopholes.
Not that this is surprising. Each time actual tax reformers have tried to eliminate special-interest loopholes, it has been the Congressional advocates of the "fairer, flatter" tax system who have stepped in to restore them.
As an example, take the history of one particularly polluted region of the tax code: the special rules for oil companies. When a normal business buys capital -- say, a new factory -- it can deduct the purchase cost from its income taxes over the course of several years until the total deductions equal the cost of the factory.
During World War I, when the Government wanted to encourage oil drilling, it allowed oil companies a more generous way to deduct the costs of buying a well. Instead of deducting from their taxes what they paid originally, they would take off a percentage of the value of the oil they pumped every year.
The problem is, that amount has nothing to do with the cost of buying a well. So oil companies end up deducting more -- often, several times more -- than they shelled out to acquire the well in the first place. The subsidy has survived, thanks to Congress, and now costs the Treasury about $600 million a year.
This tax break is championed by, among others, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation begins.
Hundreds of deductions like this have left the system at a point where wealthy individuals and corporations go for years paying no taxes at all. More than half of the 250 largest, wealthiest companies in the country paid no income tax for at least one year from 1981 to 1985, according to the Citizens for Tax Justice.
The tax subsidies had such powerful allies that eliminating them one by one would have proved impossible. So tax reformers did the next best thing by strengthening something called the alternative minimum tax in 1986. The idea behind it was that no matter how many loopholes you use, you still have to pay at least a minimal tax. The law sets up a separate tax structure with lower rates and fewer deductions, just what flat-taxers say they're after. Companies and individuals must calculate their taxes under both systems and pay whichever is higher. It embodies many features that flat-taxers claim to uphold: fewer deductions, no loopholes, lower rates.
In 1995, the Republican Congress -- the same one that's now promising to clean up the tax code -- voted to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. (Fortunately, President Clinton vetoed the bill.)
 It's not that a few of the Republicans' self-styled tax reformers have occasionally contradicted their principles. It's endemic to the movement: the most ardent flat-tax advocates are also the most egregious defenders of loopholes. Jack Kemp, for example, is a flat-tax crusader and also the nation's most fervent advocate of enterprise zones -- which are based on providing preferential tax rates on certain investments.
Or consider the capital gains tax. Income from capital gains is taxed at a lower rate than income from, say, interest. A real tax reformer would want to tax all that income the same. But cutting the capital gains tax is an obsession with Republicans. Mr. Dole wants to cut it in half.
Here we get to the heart of the matter: "Flattening" the tax system would simply replace preferences for selected capital with a preference for all capital. No wonder the Beltway special interests aren't quaking in terror at the prospect of Republican tax overhaul.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains as Fears Fade About Japanese Rate Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the yen yesterday after the head of the Bank of Japan eased concern that Japan would soon raise interest rates.
The governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said the bank would try to keep the country's interest rates at historic lows to foster an economic recovery. The comment reduced speculation that the central bank was prepared to raise rates, a move that would lift the yen by making bank deposits in the currency more attractive. 
 "The dollar rose against the yen because the B.O.J. said the economic recovery is not strong enough for them to tighten the reins on credit," said Ben Strauss, currency trader at Bank Julius Baer.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 107.90 yen, up from 106.79 on Tuesday. The dollar also rose to 1.4848 German marks from 1.4847. The British pound rose to $1.5430 from $1.5375.
The dollar received another lift after Eisuke Sakakibara, the Finance Ministry's top currency policy maker, suggested that the dollar might keep rising this year even after three weeks of declines. "I see no change in the dollar's trend from a month ago," said Mr. Sakakibara, who is director general of the ministry's international finance bureau.
"Mr. Sakakibara all but put the brakes on the dollar's move down" by suggesting that Japan was ready to prevent the currency from falling below 107 yen, said Steve Flanagan, trader with Credit Agricole in New York. "The market has a great deal of respect for this man."
Mr. Sakakibara won credit in the market last year for helping coordinate purchases of dollars with the United States and Germany to lift the dollar from postwar lows. The dollar has gained 34 percent since April 19, 1995, when it touched a postwar low of 79.75 yen.
In other currency trading, the French franc set a four-month low against the mark amid concern France would not cut its budget deficit enough to qualify for a single European currency. Comments by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, who said France would freeze public spending in 1997 at this year's levels, failed to prevent that decline.
The franc fell as low as 3.4160 to the mark, the weakest it has been since late March.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Up on Hope That Demand Will Absorb Flow From Iraq

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rebounded yesterday from an initial drop on the New York Mercantile Exchange, amid optimism that world markets were strong enough to absorb a sale of Iraqi oil.
On other markets, wheat rose and cotton fell. 
 The United States representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, said the Clinton Administration would approve procedures governing sales contracts for Iraqi oil exports after the United Nations agreed to increase the number of its people overseeing the sale.
That cleared the last big hurdle for Iraq to export oil under an agreement it reached with the world organization in May. The United States withheld approval, seeking to insure that revenue from the sale would not be used to strengthen the control of President Saddam Hussein.
While the sale would bring about 800,000 barrels of oil a day to world markets as early as next month, commodities analysts said demand was strong enough to keep prices from plunging. "The anticipation is that the market will be able to absorb the limited amount" of oil being sold by Iraq, said Holly Gustafson of NatWest Securities in Baltimore. "Demand is growing as economies of the world are doing very well."
In New York trading yesterday, crude oil for September delivery rose 29 cents, to $21.42 a barrel. "It tells you something about the character of this market," said John Saucer of Smith Barney in Houston. "The demand numbers reported this week were incredible, up 6.7 percent" from a year ago for refined products, according to an Energy Department report yesterday.
Wheat prices rose after Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that China was likely to resume importing from the United States
Since June 1, when the current crop year began, China has canceled agreements to buy 1.415 million metric tons of American wheat.
December wheat rose 7.25 cents, to $4.6025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Cotton fell, with prices for this year's crop reaching their lowest since the previous harvest, amid speculation that production was on the rise.

HEADLINE: Dow Tops 5,700 for First Time in a Month

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average ended above 5,700 for the first time in a month yesterday, as vigorous buying in semiconductor stocks spilled over to other high-technology issues and the broader market.
Buying of chip stocks was ignited by Merrill Lynch's upgrade of Micron Technology Inc., which rose 4, to 26, and was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 "The chip sector was sort of like a pile of leaves waiting for a match -- oversold, underbelieved," said Joseph Barthel of Fahnestock. "Much of the group suffered a decline of 50-60 percent."
The Dow rose 22.56 points, to 5,718.67, adding to Tuesday's 22-point gain. It is now a stone's throw from its closing high of 5,778.00 May 22.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outpaced declines, 1,415 to 981, on moderate volume of 394.3 million shares.
The blue-chip index last ended above 5,700 on July 3 at 5,703.02, before a shockingly strong June payrolls report on July 5 and subsequent earnings warnings from some blue-chip technology companies led to a Wall Street correction.
Blue chips have come storming back as subsequent earnings reports calmed investors, and recent economic data showed economic growth so moderate that many on Wall Street do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting on Aug. 20, a view reinforced by yesterday's beige book report by the Fed.
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index surged 12.24 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,141.11, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index soared 5.54 percent, to 179.
Intel, a bellwether chip stock that has been buoyed by a so-called flight to quality since Nasdaq's stiff July correction, rose 231/64 , to 8223/64 . Texas Instruments rose 3 1/8, to 48 1/2; LSI Logic added 1, to 23 5/8, and Motorola rose 1 3/4, to 57 1/4.
While the sector may move higher, analysts said the group might not recapture all its lost ground. "It was very, very oversold, and we had a temporary rebound," Phil Roth, the Dean Witter Reynolds chief technical analyst, said.
Mr. Barthel, chief investment strategist of Fahnestock, said the broader market could see a brief pullback soon.
"The market is short-term extremely overbought," he said. "In about three weeks we rose about 500 points on an intraday basis. We've come a long way and a pullback is certainly warranted."
Oil stocks weakened as crude oil prices fell on news the United States had approved procedures for monitoring the United Nations plan to allow Iraq to sell oil to pay for food and medical supplies. Mobil fell 2 1/2, to 110 5/8 and Chevron lost 1 1/8, to 58 3/8.
Among individual shares, First Union lost 1 3/8, to 64. Banco Santander sold a 3.6-million-share block of stock in First Union, reducing its stake to just under 10 percent.
Comshare slumped 6 7/8, to 11 5/8, after warning that results for the fourth quarter ended June 30 would fall short of expectations. Comshare is delaying the release of quarter and year-end results pending completion of an audit.
Amylin Pharmaceuticals surged 4 7/8, to 13 5/8, after news that second phase trials of its diabetes drug candidate pramlintide found the drug to be effective in lowering patients' glucose levels.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.78, to 664.16. The American Stock Exchange index edged up 1.50, to 550.24.
The Big Board composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.78, to 354.43. The average price per share rose 8 cents.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,490.226, up 24.75, or 0.38 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Nation's new welfare law is really reform on a shoestring

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
To Congressional Republicans, the new welfare law is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a 60-year-old system that does not work. To Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the new approach is "a social risk no sane person would take." So which is it? To many welfare experts outside the political rough and tumble, it appears to be both.
Americans are fed up with chronic welfare dependence, yet their elected representatives refused to come up with the money to assure a humane transition to a world in which nearly every able-bodied adult must work. The political resolution to that conflict is welfare reform on the cheap. "It's a big gamble," concludes Sheila Zedlewski, director of the Urban Institute's Income and Benefits Policy Center. 
 In the last few years, -- a decade after Ronald Reagan denounced "welfare queens" -- seemingly irreconcilable views about welfare began to converge. New-fashioned liberals, led by Senator Moynihan, distanced themselves from those on the traditional left who thought welfare ought to be a no-questions-asked minimum income for families. Meanwhile, conservatives softened their rhetoric about public assistance as a subsidy to what they saw as laziness and immoral behavior.
"Workfare" became the new mantra and policy specialists began to explore the practical ramifications of using real jobs as the lever to end dependence. Something like a centrist consensus developed, one concluding that many long-term welfare recipients need expensive training, child care, health insurance and even a job guarantee to break the cycle of circumstance and habit.
The closest thing to a serious proposal to match this informed view was probably the legislative package that President Clinton originally presented in 1994. It would have forced many young parents to work, and allotted an extra $2 billion a year to help the states pay for it. It was stillborn, a victim of the higher priority the Administration gave to its failed national health care initiative and the divided response among liberals to the workfare approach. Instead, the Administration encouraged states to try their own experiments.
Still, as Congress rushed to prove it was not gridlocked -- and the President rushed to deny the Republicans an explosive election issue -- welfare has been ended as we knew it. But rather than spending a little more money now to wean millions off welfare, the new law, according to estimates by the Urban Institute, will actually cut the budget for the major assistance programs by $15 billion annually (roughly one-fifth) when it is fully put into effect in 2002. Much of the savings will come from denying benefits to immigrants, trimming food stamps for childless, nonworking adults and cutting off welfare payments after five years.
There are escape valves, notably the states' option to extend benefits beyond five years for 20 percent of the caseload. An extra $5 billion will be available over the next five years to cover emergencies. And there will even be a modest cash windfall for many states in the first year, since Federal block grants will be based on 1994 caseloads, which were generally greater than those currently in place. Note, too, that states will also be required to maintain their own spending on welfare at at least three-quarters of the 1994 level.
But there is no escaping the fact that this is welfare reform on a shoestring. Ms. Zedlewski points out that disabled parents and children already constitute one-fifth of the welfare caseload, making it improbable that states will be able to use Federal dollars to extend monthly checks to other needy recipients after the five-year cutoff. And Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, scoffs at the value of the "maintenance of state effort" provisions, since the required outlays are not indexed to inflation and the law has plenty of loopholes in defining welfare services.
Conservatives are betting that when push comes to shove most welfare recipients will clean up their acts and earn a living. That, however, does not square with the findings of Sandra and Sheldon Danziger, researchers at the University of Michigan, who found that tough work requirements pushed just one-third of Michigan's welfare recipients into jobs. Nor does it seem plausible if the booming American economy heads south. "All bets are off during a recession," Mr. Danziger noted, when even dead-end minimum wage jobs become scarce.
Ms. Zedlewski of the Urban Institute expects huge variations from state to state and city to city. "Some will follow the Wisconsin example and spend more of their own money" to buffer the transition, she predicted. Others will look the other way, leaving the poor and jobless to lean on their extended families or on private charity.
Presumably, states and localities will respond to the most dolorous consequences -- Senator Moynihan's vision of "children sleeping on grates" -- with whatever it takes to avoid personal disaster. Or perhaps one presumes too much. "If you asked New Yorkers in 1975 whether people would tolerate thousands of homeless in the streets," Mr. Danziger reminds, "they would have laughed."

N.A.S.D. and Government
Are Seen in Deal on Abuses
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers are expected to announce a $100 million agreement today to end abuses on the Nasdaq stock market, people with knowledge of the deal said. The agreement came after marathon talks that included the chief executives of top Wall Street firms. [Page D2.]
 
Growth Slackens Slightly
A Federal Reserve survey found that economic growth slackened a bit in early summer as consumers spent cautiously for most big-ticket items. Wage pressures remained in check despite what appeared to be a further tightening of the job market.
This combination of less exuberant business activity and continued subdued inflation is just what policy makers and financial markets have been hoping for. [D4.]

New Approach to U.S. Auto Market
Daewoo, the South Korean manufacturer, plans to enter the United States auto market by opening 200 to 500 company-owned sales outlets. The plans by Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, go against current practice. First, most car makers sell their cars and trucks to independent dealers. And second, Daewoo plans to focus on students, professors and their families -- a novel approach. [D4.]

Dow Average Closes Above 5,700
The Dow Jones industrial average ended above 5,700 for the first time in a month, gaining 22.56 points, to 5,718.67, as vigorous buying in semiconductor stocks, inspired by Merrill Lynch's upgrading of Micron Technology, spilled over to the broader market. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 12.24 points, to 1,141.11. [D8.]
 
Disappointing demand at the Treasury's auction of new 10-year notes depressed prices in the credit markets and sent the yield on the 30-year bond up slightly to 6.77 percent. [D18.]
 
Apple Drops Plans for Upgrade
Apple Computer has scrapped plans for a major upgrade of its flagship Macintosh operating system software next year, jeopardizing what remains of its technological lead over Microsoft's Windows system. [D2.]

Roadblock Removed to Iraqi Oil Sale
The United States removed the last major roadblock to the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for civilian needs, but the oil was not expected to reach the market for another month. [A9.]
 
Freeport and Arcadian to Merge
Freeport-McMoran, the mining and mineral giant, announced plans for a complicated merger with Arcadian, a fertilizer producer, exchanging stock worth $1 billion. If the public owners of Freeport-McMoran's 51.6 percent owned fertilizer partnership decide to exchange their stakes, the new company would have a market value of $3 billion. [D4.]
 
401(k) Rules Are Tightened
The Labor Department, seeking to halt abuse of workers' retirement funds, required companies to invest employees' money in 401(k) plans promptly. [D8.]
 
F.D.A. Gets Tough With Pfizer
The Food and Drug Administration ordered Pfizer to stop making unauthorized claims for Zoloft, its widely used antidepressant. [D19.]
 
Profits Fall at Turner Broadcasting
Turner Broadcasting System said second-quarter earnings fell 47.9 percent because of weak results at its film unit. [D7.]

When They Call, People Tremble
When Fran and Barry Weissler, the producers of "Grease" on Broadway, call their ad agencies, the members of the creative teams tremble. The producers demand a lot from their agencies, and the success of "Grease" shows why. Advertising. [D7.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: SENATE RACES;
Abortion Opponents Prevail In 3 Republican Primaries

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 7

 BODY:
After campaigns that reinforced the Republican divide over abortion, voters in Georgia, Michigan and Kansas on Tuesday chose opponents of abortion rights over supporters of abortion rights in Republican primaries for the United States Senate.
Democrats said today that the very conservatism that appealed to voters in Republican primaries would handicap Tuesday's victors in the general election in November. That is especially true, they said, in a year when voters may be anxious about the conservative partisanship that was often a hallmark of the Republican-led Congress. 
 "I think it probably bodes well," said Steve J. Jarding, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "At some point you start to see where this ideological split has an impact."
But Republican strategists countered that history shows that abortion opponents are perfectly capable of winning general elections as long as they also demonstrate broad appeal with their positions on economic policy and on other social issues.
And even as Bob Dole's Presidential campaign is fighting the perception that the Republican Party is increasingly captive to anti-abortion activists, some strategists suggested that the results in Georgia, Michigan and Kansas were driven by factors other than abortion.
"Each of these races was determined by specific and unique circumstances that had little to do with the issue of abortion," said Gordon Hensley, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He pointed to advantages in fund raising and name recognition enjoyed by the winners, and to an exceedingly low turnout of voters in several states.
Tuesday's results were similar to those in other states that have selected conservative Republicans over more moderate challengers.
In the Illinois Senate primary this spring, for example, Republicans selected Al Salvi, a little-known state legislator who opposes gun control and abortion rights, over Lieut. Gov. Bob Kustra, a more moderate candidate who was backed by the party establishment. Mr. Salvi, who opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest, is now considered an underdog in his race against Representative Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat who supports abortion rights.
And in Oregon late last year, Republican voters chose Gordon Smith, the conservative president of the State Senate and a staunch abortion opponent, over primary challengers that included Norma Paulus, the state school superintendent who is a supporter of abortion rights. Mr. Smith then lost a general election in January to Representative Ron Wyden, a liberal who became the first Democrat to represent Oregon in the Senate in 34 years.
In Tuesday's voting, perhaps the most clear-cut referendum on the abortion issue came in Georgia, where Guy Millner, a business executive who opposes abortion, defeated Johnny Isakson, a former legislator who took unusual steps to advertise his support for abortion rights.
Mr. Millner and Mr. Isakson acknowledged that there were few other differences between them on substantive issues. And Mr. Isakson chose to accentuate that difference by broadcasting television commercials that cited his stand on abortion.
The two men faced each other in a runoff after neither won a majority in a six-man primary on July 16. With most of the campaign conducted while Georgia was preoccupied with the Summer Olympic Games, Tuesday's turnout was estimated at an exceedingly low 13 percent.
That apathy may have heightened the influence of Christian conservatives who consider abortion a litmus test issue. Mr. Millner, who won 53 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Mr. Isakson, will face Max Cleland, a Democrat who was head of the Veterans Administration under President Jimmy Carter. The winner will succeed Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat who is retiring.
Mr. Isakson said in an interview today that he believed his use of the abortion issue to position his campaign toward the political center had helped make the race close. And a University of Georgia political scientist, Charles S. Bullock, said Mr. Isakson's centrism would have made him a stronger general election candidate than Mr. Millner.
"Guy Millner's position on abortion means that he has at least one foot nailed to the floor," Mr. Bullock added. "He can't move on the abortion issue, and in Georgia in a general election that's a losing issue."
Abortion also played a significant role in the television advertising broadcast by Ronna Romney, a former Detroit radio talk show hostess and staunch abortion opponent who won the Republican primary in Michigan. She defeated Jim Nicholson, a businessman, by 52 percent to 48 percent, and will face Senator Carl Levin, a three-term Democrat.
In Kansas, Senator Sheila Frahm, a Republican who was appointed in June to replace Mr. Dole, lost to Representative Sam Brownback by 55 percent to 42 percent. Ms. Frahm, who began the campaign with a large lead in public opinion polls, is a supporter of abortion rights. Mr. Brownback, an abortion opponent, will face Jill Docking, a Democratic stockbroker who defeated former Gov. Joan Finney by a nearly 3-to-1 margin.
Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas easily defeated three opponents to win the Republican nomination to fill the seat being vacated by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. And Jim Ryun, the famed Olympic miler, finished ahead of two rivals to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Brownback's House seat.

HEADLINE: Fed Finds Growth Is in Check as Labor Supply Tightens

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Economic growth slackened a bit in early summer as consumers spent cautiously for most big-ticket items, a survey by the Federal Reserve of business people around the country found today.
Wage pressures, meanwhile, remained largely in check despite what appeared to be a further tightening of the job market, with some employers in nearly all areas now suffering from an inability to find workers.
This combination of less exuberant business activity and continued subdued inflation is just what policy makers and financial markets have been hoping for, and today's survey, known as the beige book, did not significantly alter the outlook, as it confirmed recent job figures and other data. 
 The findings "suggest the Fed will hold policy steady" at the Aug. 20 meeting for which the anecdotal soundings were taken, said Joseph Liro, an economist with CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York.
Nonetheless, the mounting labor scarcity is causing some uneasiness that what has so far been a modest uptick in compensation for workers, the main cost for most businesses, will at some point become sizable enough to demand a response in the form of higher short-term interest rates, perhaps at the Fed's Sept. 24 or Nov. 13 meetings.
Indeed, the Fed's San Francisco district reported today that "wage inflation pressures are evident" in parts of its seven-state territory, with service industries like computers and telecommunications particularly hard hit.
Besides shortages of programmers and systems engineers, the Fed reported that retailers, who employ many entry-level workers, in the Puget Sound area had had "difficulties in recruiting qualified employees at existing wages, given increased job availability in other industries."
Moreover, the Richmond district was told that producers of industrial machinery and equipment were finding themselves constrained by the lack of skilled labor.
In the Chicago area, some employers had to make benefits packages more generous to attract and keep workers, notably in the construction industry.
The Fed also reported that the amount of consumer installment debt grew at an 8.7 percent annual pace in June, as borrowing for automobiles boomed while credit-card, or revolving, debt grew at a markedly diminished pace.
The overall rise compared with 5.9 percent growth in May, but it was the third straight month in which the rate of increase was less than 10 percent after an extended period of increases in or near double digits.
Outstanding credit card debt advanced at a 7.6 percent clip, less than half the 15.6 percent jump in May and the first single-digit increase this year after five rises averaging 16.9 percent.
This indicator has proved a useful gauge of business conditions, even though it is reported with a significant time lag, does not isolate new borrowings or repayments and reflects an increasing tendency of consumers to use credit cards as convenient methods of payments and not necessarily because of a desire or need to borrow.
As for the beige book survey, named for the color of its cover, the Fed summarized the economy as having "continued to expand in June and July, though in some areas the pace of growth has moderated" since the previous survey, which was published on June 19.
On that occasion, the conclusion was that "economic activity continued to advance at a moderate pace" in May and the first 10 days of June.
Today's report, prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected through July 29, added: "A number of districts report tight labor markets, especially for entry-level workers; however, wage pressures remained subdued. Retail sales slowed in most districts, particularly for non-auto durables."
Among individual districts, Boston reported a strong rebound in commercial real estate, particularly in the Greater Boston area; New York continued to enjoy a boom in tourism that has pushed New York City rates of hotel occupancy to a 17-year high, and Richmond found heavy demand for secretarial help, skilled warehouse and production people and workers who know computers.
"We are scraping bottom for labor in our area," a South Carolina home builder told the Richmond bank.
The Atlanta district reported that heavy spending near Olympic sites adversely affected some traditional tourist destinations, though many Florida cities benefited from a surge in travel by Atlantans who left that city during the Games.
Chicago reported a late-spring rebound in factory employment to be "short-lived," while labor shortages among professional and technical workers persisted along with "particularly severe" shortages in construction.
And in the St. Louis district, there were reports of a tight labor market in "all parts," with high turnover rates even for those offering relatively high starting pay and benefits.
Scarcity of skilled and entry-level workers has spread in some cases to semiskilled labor, the bank added, and poultry processers in western Kentucky were relying increasingly on foreign labor.
The labor market appears to be tightest in the Upper Midwest, where the Minneapolis bank reported help-wanted signs "omnipresent in most urban areas."
Last week the Labor Department reported that South Dakota had the nation's lowest unemployment rate in June, 2.8 percent, followed by Nebraska, Iowa and North Dakota.
The lowest jobless rate for any of the 272 metropolitan areas was in Sioux Falls, S.D., at 1.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Vetoes a Bill to Make City Contractors Raise Wages

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday vetoed a bill that would have required some city contractors to pay higher minimum wages to their employees, calling the measure irresponsible because it would add to the city's costs while also hurting minimum-wage workers.
"This bill, while purporting to help low-wage employees, would in reality do little to provide long-term economic betterment even for the narrow class of workers covered by its provisions," Mr. Giuliani wrote in his veto message. 
 The City Council, which approved the bill with 41 votes earlier this month, is almost sure to override the veto, for which only 34 votes are needed. The veto is Mr. Giuliani's seventh since taking office in 1994. The Council has overridden him four times and negotiated new legislation in the two other cases.
The bill, which would have raised the city's contracting costs by $16 million a year, would have required city contractors in four areas -- security, cleaning, food service and temporary office work -- to pay workers what is known as the "prevailing wage," or the standard wage that private-sector workers receive for similar work. Council officials have estimated that the bill would have affected 3,500 workers, raising the wages of unarmed security guards to $7.25 an hour, food workers to $9 an hour, temporary office workers to $11.25 an hour and janitors to $14 an hour.
The Mayor contended that the higher wages would encourage companies to stop hiring the relatively unskilled workers they now use for city contracts. "The legislation could leave entry-level workers with fewer opportunities than ever before," Mr. Giuliani said. He also said the bill would increase costs for the city and "raises obstacles to firms wishing to do business with us."
Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the Council, called the Mayor's veto "a vote against common sense and fairness," and said an override was likely "unless we can resolve the differences we have."
Colleen A. Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said yesterday that if the Council overrode the veto, the administration would go to court to strike down the law.
Mr. Vallone said that the bill, which is far less sweeping than an earlier proposal to set a minimum wage of $12.10 an hour for all city contracts, sought to correct inequities in areas not covered by the state prevailing-wage law. The Mayor's philosophy, however, is to decrease the level of government involvement in the private sector.

HEADLINE: Questions Raised on Development Zones

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Nearly a decade ago, New York began an ambitious program to spur economic growth in distressed communities across the state by offering businesses tax breaks and other handsome incentives to move into those communities.
But a new audit released by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall raises questions about the state's handling of the program and whether the program has actually helped revive poor communities, including four in New York City. 
 The report, released Tuesday, provides the first significant analysis to bolster the arguments of critics who have long questioned the benefits of setting up special areas, called economic development zones, to lure businesses -- and new jobs -- to poor neighborhoods. The critics say the approach has simply transferred jobs from one community to another.
"It does not increase the size of the pie," said Frank J. Mauro, the director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-financed economic research group. "The state is basically subsidizing the relocation of businesses from one site to another, and the businesses aren't being held accountable to create jobs."
The audit found that the state agency administering the program had grossly overestimated the number of jobs created in a sampling of development zones. It also found that the agency, the Department of Economic Development, had virtually no way of determining what the state spent on the program or whether the state was reaping any benefits.
In one instance, state auditors found that only 163 jobs were created in a development zone in the Port Morris section of the Bronx in 1993, far fewer than the 4,421 jobs reported by the program's local administrators. In another case, in East New York, Brooklyn, program administrators claimed that 4,127 new jobs had been created in the same year, but state auditors identified only 147.
And in a third case, the administrators recorded 3,798 new jobs in a zone in South Jamaica, Queens; the auditors could account for only 423.
The Comptroller's office said that many of the inconsistencies resulted from poor record keeping, inadequate monitoring of hiring practices and a failure to remove companies from the program even after local officials had reported that the companies had failed to meet eligibility requirements. Mr. McCall also attributed some of the problem to arcane state and Federal labor laws that deny agency officials access to records like employment figures that businesses file with the state's Department of Labor each year.
Nevertheless, Mr. McCall said the development zones offered "an opportunity to reinvigorate communities," and he urged state officials to monitor the program more effectively. "Without a system to measure the program's benefits," he said, "this money and the opportunity to create jobs may be needlessly wasted."
But Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the State Commissioner for Economic Development, Charles A. Gargano, questioned the timing of the report, given that the agency this week is going to begin looking for an outside consultant to monitor the program. She also disputed some figures in the audit and said the audit had failed to look at some of the more effective development zones.
"This is a good economic development program," she said. "We're working on making it more efficient with better oversight."
New York has been running the economic development zone program since 1987. The zones generally cover a two-square-mile area, providing local businesses with investment tax credits, wage tax credits, reductions in utility rates and tax relief for construction materials. There are now 40 economic development zones throughout the state, including the 4 in New York City, all created under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. McCall's report did not deal with Federal empowerment zones like the one recently created to benefit distressed areas of upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
Supporters of the local enterprise zones contend that they are powerful tools for encouraging economic development in impoverished areas.
The program was expanded from 19 zones to 40 during the 1994 gubernatorial race, though Governor Cuomo denied that the expansion was timed to help his re-election effort. Still, Gov. George E. Pataki, who was then campaigning against Mr. Cuomo, accused him of using such programs for pork-barrel spending in Democratic districts.
In his report, Mr. McCall noted that the agency had yet to evaluate the program's effectiveness, even though state law required the administration to have done so. He also said that many businesses may have improperly received tax breaks because they failed to file certain reports required in the program.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Will Dole Fight?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Before Bob Dole could take on Bill Clinton, he first had to take control of the Republican Party in convention assembled.
His early attempt to reach a temperate compromise on abortion with the Buchananites he so decisively defeated in the primaries had failed. The one-issue extremists wouldn't take "Yes, but" for an answer; they demanded a convention victory that, as in 1992, would insure another election defeat. 
 If you cannot take charge of your convention, you will have a hard time taking charge of the country. When an intolerant faction tried to dictate the party platform, it was up to the nominee to make certain that the party's more inclusive rank and file was respected and its views officially recorded. Last night Dole prevailed on the platform chairman, Henry Hyde, to include inclusive views.
By calling the Buchanan bluff, Dole not only saved the party's soul but gained it electoral strength. But if Dole had been unwilling to lead, the irony would have been in the fire: a minority of pro-lifers who could not abide the word "tolerance" would have dragged along a reluctant Christian Coalition to again deliver the White House to Clinton's pro-choice extremists.
My hope that Dole would not weakly submit was based on a clue to an internal struggle revealed in his economic plan this week. He does not take humiliation kindly.
As Senate leader early this year, Dole showed lonely courage in going up against the media moguls' lobby. The broadcasters are eager to avoid costly free-enterprise auctions and instead want -- as a gift -- slices of the spectrum worth what may be $70 billion of the public's airwaves.
No sooner was Dole out the Senate door than the new majority leader, Trent Lott, in cahoots with Speaker Newt Gingrich, reversed Dole's instruction to the F.C.C. and arranged a whopping giveaway to the media lobby, unhindered by Clinton.
But in Dole's new tax-cut proposal, to offset revenue losses, is his conservative estimate of $34 billion from "spectrum auctions." That serves notice that a President Dole would fight the Media-Political Complex for the public's money.
Senator Lott denies providing welfare to station owners, assuring me "there will be spectrum auctions in the future," though he doubts they will generate the amount Dole envisions. But Dole's refusal to go along with the auction-delaying deal is just the sort of break-all-the-china scrap that should be the hallmark of his anti-establishment campaign.
He has also taken on the contingency-fee bar, Clinton's most lavish contributors, to curb the punitive lawsuits that bankrupt small companies and drive up consumer prices.
Such engagement -- scrappiness in good causes -- is the route to upset victory. As campaigners from the Roosevelts to Truman to Nixon proved, you gotta have villains.
Extremists on both ends of the abortion spectrum are villains.
Media plutocrats intimidating politicians to get a lucrative spot on the spectrum for nothing are villains.
Trial lawyers buying White House protection to maintain their stranglehold on the legal system are villains.
Complacent Pentagon bureaucrats who leave America defenseless against missiles from terrorist states are villains.
And a President who frightens old folks with false tales of "cuts" in their Medicare protection also callously plays the villain.
What running mate can best help the candidate carry the good fight against this fearsome farrago?
He ought to have a hard-driving partner who needs no introduction and presents no problem. The governors being bruited about are national strangers, and Colin Powell is posing as Ethelred the Unready. The names I hear are Senators John McCain and Connie Mack, former Illinois Congressman and Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld, and empower-players Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp.
Each is what Nixon used to call "un homme serieux." McCain, a prisoner-of-war hero gaining national stature on defense issues, is a big-tent pro-lifer, upbeat and attractive on television, and closest to Dole. His main political drawback is an unexpected candor, but as Dole told a friend recently, "You spend five years in a box and you're entitled to speak your mind."

NEW YORK
 
Plot to Divert Wealth Is Seen
When New York City's largest trash hauler was indicted last year on charges that it had Mafia ties, a monitor was appointed to make sure the owners did not divert the company's wealth before a trial. Now, prosecutors say that the company, V. Ponte & Sons, tried to sell the business and funnel the proceeds through subsidiaries to its chief owner, Angelo Ponte. But the Manhattan District Attorney's office has blocked the sale, which could be for as much as $70 million. [Page B1.]
 
Literary Edge of Web World
If San Francisco is home to techies who dream up the codes that make the World Wide Web work, New York City is becoming the new home for those who create the pictures, the stories, the advertising copy that makes someone actually want to call up a home page or buy a CD-ROM.

Fraud by Few May Hurt Many
The new welfare bill will reduce financing for a program that benefits handicapped children. While the cut reflects Congress's efforts to save money, it is also a response to fraud by parents who coached their children to feign mental disorders so they could collect payments under the program. Now the question is whether, in pursuit of fraud, the Government will deny help to those who really need it. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]

HEADLINE: U.S. Removes Bar on Sale Of Oil to Aid Iraqi Civilians

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The United States today removed the last major roadblock to the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for emergency civilian needs, and United Nations officials said they hoped to put the plan into effect within a few weeks.
But diplomats cautioned that it might be a month or more before oil actually reached the market and food, medicine and other goods began arriving in Iraq to relieve the hardships caused by six years of international sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
 After the Clinton Administration decision, some technical steps are still necessary -- and the experience of recent months shows that unexpected problems can arise. But if all goes according to plan, oil-contract overseers can now be named, monitors can be stationed at pumping and pipeline stations in Iraq and Turkey and a contract for surveillance of imports by a neutral company can be signed.
"We do believe that the important part here is to get humanitarian assistance to the people in Iraq," Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative, said today after informing the Security Council of Washington's decision.
Tono Eitel, Germany's representative and the chairman of the Council's Iraqi sanctions committee, called the announcement "a welcome development" and said he hoped to move the plan out of his committee within days. Last week Mr. Eitel expressed his frustration at what he saw as American stalling over demands that procedures be tightened.
Iraq's envoy at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said he foresaw no more obstacles. "This should have happened a couple of weeks ago," he said of Washington's decision.
Iraq was offered this plan in April 1995, but did not sign an agreement with the United Nations to proceed until May 20 this year.
The plan allows Iraq to sell up to $2 billion in oil every six months. But if the Secretary General finds that the agreement is being violated, this will be reported to the Security Council, which can call off the deal.
Most of the oil is expected to be exported through a Turkish pipeline to the Mediterranean, with the rest passing through the Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr on the Persian Gulf.
If in the next few days the sanctions committee approves the procedures and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali advises the Council that all details are in order, the sale of oil may begin at one minute after midnight the next morning.
The Administration had been holding up final approval of the oil sale, which all other 14 members of the Security Council had accepted last month, because Washington wanted stronger monitoring to prevent cheating by Baghdad and to insure that emergency supplies reached the civilians for whom they are intended.
"What we have wanted to do all along is assure ourselves that all the procedures that go along with this are appropriate, and we will make sure that they are carried out very vigorously to get the assistance to the right people and not in any way to abrogate the sanctions regime," Ms. Albright said today.
She called the remaining tasks "very technical aspects" and seemed to imply that these would cause no further problems. But some diplomats are concerned that disputes could arise over prices Iraq wants for its oil.
"The Secretariat still has to make sure that the right number of monitors have been hired and that they are in the right places," Ms. Albright said. Diplomats assume that United Nations officials are clear on what Washington wants.
Monitors from the United Nations would be stationed around central and southern Iraq, where emergency goods will be distributed by Iraqis. In the northern three provinces, controlled by Kurds under international protection, the United Nations will distribute food and medicine itself.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Public Favors The Democrats, New Poll Finds

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 7

 BODY:
For the first time in four years, the Democratic Party is viewed more favorably by voters than the Republican Party, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Underscoring the challenges facing the Republicans as they gather here to nominate Bob Dole for President next week, the poll showed that the concerns that contributed to voters' repudiation of the Democratic-controlled Congress in 1994 have substantially subsided. 
 On several policy fronts, from specifics like fairness in taxation to broader themes like helping people "achieve the American dream," registered voters said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans by wide margins.
Despite lingering qualms about President Clinton's character, voters found him far more appealing in several areas than Mr. Dole and were more inclined to favor Democratic candidates for Congress as well. Indeed, when asked how they would vote in their Congressional elections this fall, Americans gave Democrats a larger edge than the Republicans had in the 1994 election when they seized both houses of Congress.
The poll of 1,166 adults nationwide, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, was conducted by telephone from Saturday to Monday. It was completed before Mr. Dole announced his campaign's economic platform on Monday and could not reflect whatever boost he might have received from that effort.
The survey found that the nation was divided over the notion of a 15-percent across-the-board tax cut, which formed the core of his proposal.
But the poll highlighted untapped reservoirs of potential strength for Mr. Dole and his party, particularly the anxieties of middle-class people over the future of their children. Nearly half of registered voters said they thought that the next generation would be worse off than people today, and close to 6 out of 10 said the Clinton Administration should do more to help the middle class. And, as they have for more than a decade, Americans said they trusted Republicans more than Democrats to insure a sound economy.
In announcing his economic plan this week, Mr. Dole made explicit appeals to the unease of middle-class Americans, and his advisers hope he can capitalize on those issues as the nation's attention turns to the convention, which opens on Monday. "Let me suggest this simple test," Mr. Dole said in his speech. "Ask yourself, do you believe America is on the right track today, and do you believe that we are building a future that is better for our children?"
Still, in making the economy a centerpiece of his argument that people should favor him over Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole has a hard sell. Although they express long-term concerns, 63 percent of those polled judged the economy to be in good shape. Only 23 percent gave the economy such high marks in late October of 1992; it was those anxieties that helped set the stage for Mr. Clinton's defeat of President George Bush.
Beyond Mr. Dole's potential inroads on the economy, the poll showed that he maintained his advantage on character issues. Seven out of 10 voters said Mr. Dole shared the moral values most Americans try to live by; Mr. Clinton drew 58 percent on that count. But both Presidential contenders fared better on this than the collective members of Congress; only 39 percent said members of Congress shared those moral values.
Even with Mr. Clinton's vulnerabilities, the survey made clear that the party is in a more competitive position than Republicans as the convention phase of the campaign gets under way. The Democratic convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 26.
Over all, 55 percent of registered voters expressed a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, while 39 percent were unfavorable. By contrast, 46 percent held a favorable opinion of the Republican Party, and 47 percent unfavorable. That is a striking turnabout in the image of the Democrats. Not since before Mr. Clinton's election in 1992 have more than half the voters expressed such a positive image of the party.
Mr. Clinton's announcement last week that he would sign the welfare bill only solidified his support. Fifty-two percent of voters said he did the right thing; only 6 percent said it was the wrong thing to do and 40 percent said they did not know enough about the measure. Even so, voters were about evenly divided when asked if they would still back the President's decision if it meant that many more children would be living in households below the poverty line.
There was no sign of erosion in the President's months-long lead over Mr. Dole: Fifty-six percent of registered voters say they would vote for Mr. Clinton if they election were held today, while 34 percent would back Mr. Dole.
The picture may be even rosier for Mr. Clinton should Ross Perot, as expected, win the nomination of his Reform Party and run again for President.
When Mr. Perot is included in the trial heat, Mr. Clinton's support rises slightly to 58 percent; Mr. Dole's falls back to 28 percent, and Mr. Perot draws 10 percent. Mr. Perot seems to have lost some luster: only 15 percent of registered voters have favorable views of him and nearly half hold an unfavorable view.
Nearly 8 out of 10 voters said they did not know enough to make a judgment about Richard Lamm, the former Colorado Governor who is challenging Mr. Perot for the Reform Party nomination. The party is holding two conventions, one on the eve of the Republican gathering, and the other the day after that convention ends.
The Democrats' positive image is evident at the Congressional level as well. Democrats also had a significant edge, 46 percent to 39 percent, when voters were asked which party's candidate they would support in the House race in their Congressional district. If maintained, that margin could enable the Democrats to recapture the House.
Mr. Dole's advisers say that after four nights of prime time attention, they hope that their candidate will depart San Diego with a clear "bounce" in the polls to give him momentum in the 11-week sprint to Election Day.
But the first challenge may be for Republicans to turn around a wide impression among voters, including many Republicans, this early that Mr. Dole will never make it to the White House. Seventy-five percent of voters said they expected Mr. Clinton to win in November. Even nearly half of those who plan to vote for Mr. Dole said they expected the President to be re-elected.
As Mr. Dole nears a decision on his running mate, 9 out of 10 voters said that if he picked a woman it would not make a difference in whether they would support him. And half of the Republican voters said that the running mate's position on abortion does not matter.
The good and bad news for Republicans is that 68 percent of registered voters said Mr. Dole has not made it clear what he wants to accomplish in the next four years. That gives Mr. Dole an enormous opportunity to define himself here next week. But it also indicates that after more than a year of campaigning, Mr. Dole has failed to put forth a message that catches on.
Mr. Dole's advisers view the convention as a showcase to reintroduce the former Senate majority leader to the American people. The poll found that in advance of the convention, only 22 percent of registered voters held a favorable opinion of Mr. Dole, while 43 percent expressed a favorable view of Mr. Clinton. The President's job approval rating stands at a robust 58 percent. That ties Mr. Clinton's all-time high of 55 percent in March 1993, shortly after he was inaugurated.
Mr. Dole has said that his campaign's focus groups show that people do not know much about him, even that he was a war hero. But in the poll, 7 out of 10 voters said they knew that Mr. Dole had served in the military during World War II. An even larger proportion, nearly 9 out of 10, know that Mr. Clinton did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War.
Despite the searing debate at the Republican platform hearings this week over abortion, the poll showed that 7 out of 10 Americans do not think making abortion illegal is the kind of issue for which the Constitution should be changed. The Republican platform still calls for a Constitutional amendment against abortion.
The findings also suggest that it made good political sense for the Republicans to exclude Patrick J. Buchanan from a speaking role at the convention. Forty-six percent of voters have an unfavorable opinion of him; only 12 percent give him a favorable rating.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday through Monday with 1,166 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 900 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for either Democrats or Republicans or independents taken as a separate group. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Hernan Siles Zuazo, Ex-President of Bolivia, Is Dead at 83

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Hernan Siles Zuazo, the former President of Bolivia who was one of the chief engineers in moving the country toward political freedom, died on Tuesday night at a hospital in Montevideo, Uruguay, where he lived in retirement. He was 83.
The cause was an embolism in the lungs after a long illness, Guillermo Richter, Bolivia's Minister of Information, said yesterday. 
 Mr. Siles, the son of a former President, served as President of his small, landlocked Andean country from 1956 to 1960 and from 1982 to 1985. Although marred by uncontrollable inflation, his second presidency restored democracy to Bolivia after nearly 18 years of military rule.
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada declared 30 days of national mourning in Bolivia, and Congress dedicated yesterday's session to Mr. Siles, whom the President described as an anchor of democracy.
Trained as a lawyer, Mr. Siles was considered one of Bolivia's elder statesmen. His father led the country from 1926 to 1930.
In 1941 Mr. Siles, with Victor Paz Estenssoro, another former President, founded the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement. Mr. Siles was a leader of the 1952 revolution, which abolished a feudal system that had held the Indian population in poverty, nationalized major tin mines and brought universal suffrage.
Before his first term in office, Mr. Siles served as Vice President from 1952 to 1956 under Mr. Paz Estenssoro, but the two later split. He also worked for The Associated Press as a translator in Buenos Aires from November 1947 to September 1948.
During his first presidency, Mr. Siles focused on protecting the country's economic viability by acquiring loans from the International Monetary Fund and requesting aid from the United States.
He set up an austere spending plan, cut back on some recently introduced social services, froze wages and invited American oil companies back into Bolivia. He quashed incipient strikes by countering them with personal hunger strikes, a ploy he would use throughout his presidencies.
When Mr. Paz Estenssoro returned to the presidency in 1960, Mr. Siles served as Ambassador to Paraguay and to Spain. But he fled into exile in 1964 when Mr. Paz Estenssoro was deposed by a coup.
It was during that period when the two parted political views, with Mr. Paz Estenssoro moving to the right of center and Mr. Siles to the left. In 1971, Mr. Siles formed the Leftist Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, which was widely supported by peasants.
In 1980, Mr. Siles won the most votes in the general election, but a violent uprising forced him to leave the country again. He escaped to Peru by dressing as a peasant and crossing Lake Titicaca in a boat. Simmering pressures within the country and international threats forced the leaders to turn to democratic rule two years later, when Mr. Siles began his second term.
Mr. Siles was jubilant when he was inaugurated on Oct. 10, 1982.
"We are going to construct a democracy with absolute liberty," he said. "Those who do not believe in democracy and have interrupted it many times, depriving people of their liberties, should reflect and understand that their time has come to end."
But the term saw his political unraveling in a chaotic economic situation that threatened to bring the military out of the barracks again. Prices rose by more than 24,000 percent during his tenure because of a miscalculated austerity program, forcing his successor to impose rigorous economic controls.
And though Bolivia was once the most important tin producer in the world, the collapse of international tin prices in 1985, coupled with Bolivia's inefficient production methods, made it more expensive to operate the mines than to leave them idle.
But Mr. Siles saw some successes, including the capture and extradition of international terrorists and of Klaus Barbie, the Nazi war criminal.
He tried to cooperate with the United States in fighting the traffic of cocaine. It was a difficult issue mostly because he had to defend the state-monopolized cultivation of the coca plant, which, as Mr. Siles once explained, "from time immemorial has been chewed by our people to relieve pain."
Born in La Paz, Bolivia's capital, Mr. Siles was the illegitimate son of Hernando Siles Reyes, the last Republican President of Bolivia, who held office from 1926 to 1930, and Isabel Zuazo Cusicanqui. He was raised by his mother, and although he was not very close to his father, they maintained a cordial relationship.
A half-brother, Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas, also served as Bolivia's President for five months in 1969.
Mr. Siles died on Bolivia's Independence Day, exactly 11 years after he stepped down under fire as President. His body is expected to arrive in La Paz at noon today, with a funeral this afternoon.
Mr. Siles is survived by his wife, Maria Teresa Ormachea del Carpio, and three daughters, Marcela, Ana Maria and Isabel.

Treasury Prices End Down Slightly

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday, dragged down by disappointing demand at an auction of new 10-year notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 6/32 , to 907/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.77 percent, from 6.75 percent on Tuesday. 
 The Treasury sold $10 billion of new 10-year notes yesterday at an average yield of 6.535 percent, slightly above expectations of a yield of 6.52 to 6.53 percent.
The bid-to-cover ratio was below average at 2.22, indicating only tepid demand for the securities. The ratio is the total dollar amount bid divided by the size of the auction.
"This is what you have to expect when you have a set of auctions after such a tremendous rally last week," said Christopher Low, senior economist with HSBC Markets Inc.
Treasury prices jumped last week after fresh reports suggested the economy was slowing from the rapid 4.2 percent rate of growth posted in the second quarter.
The market, however, remains optimistic that the slowing economy will ease the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates when the central bank's policy makers meet on Aug. 20, analysts said.
Dealers -- investors who trade on the spreads between various Treasury securities' yields -- and portfolio managers were the most active bidders at the 10-year note auction, analysts said.
"Demand for the securities was somewhat disappointing. The auction was dominated mostly by dealers and some money managers," said one trader at a domestic investment bank.
The weak results followed sluggish demand at the first leg of the auction on Tuesday, when the Treasury sold $19 billion of three-year notes. The auction continues with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds today.
Analysts said market participants would be a bit nervous going into the last leg of the auction, but that the sluggishness in the first two legs did not signal a bear market for bonds.
"Investors might be nervous," said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc. "After having seen what happened today, people will be more careful going into the 30-year auction."
But "once these auctions are digested the market will be fine," he said.
The market had little reaction to the release of the Federal Reserve's periodic survey of business conditions around the country, known as the beige book, which pointed to a slowdown in economic growth and waning inflationary pressures that already had been factored into traders' strategies.
"That was the same message of all the data last week, so there wasn't a lot of news in the beige book," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities Inc.
Analysts said the market paid little attention to a jump in June consumer credit growth to $8.3 billion from a revised $5.6 billion rise in May.
In the corporate market, high-grade bonds edged higher, spurred by solid demand.
Ford Motor's $250 million 30-year debentures, originally priced to yield 79 basis points over Treasuries, closed at 80 bid. The deal did not trade higher after an aggressive pricing on Tuesday, a trader said.
The only deal to encounter trouble was Wells Fargo's $300 million in subordinated notes, issued at a 64- basis-point spread, which some secondary dealers said was too tight. The notes widened almost 10 basis points, to 73 basis points bid.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of 10-year notes yesterday:

HEADLINE: Dole's Tax-Cut Proposal Frightens Liberals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To judge from the reaction of the Clinton campaign, and the strident tone of your editorials, Bob Dole's tax proposals (front page, Aug. 6) have accomplished their purpose. At last, not only has he found a policy that Bill Clinton cannot steal; but it is also one that crystallizes the difference between the new Republicans and Mr. Clinton's old-line "big government" constituencies.
What makes the Dole tax reduction plan so scary to liberals is that, if he is elected, his spending cuts would be implemented by a Republican Congress that has shown itself both willing and able to legislate the drastic reductions he needs -- including shrinking the sacred cows of Social Security and Medicare that Mr. Dole himself exempts. 
 History has shown that lower tax rates produce higher tax revenues. But the tax "bonus" that Mr. Dole claims for his proposals would be helped by something else as well. As extracting more money from taxpayers became too politically hazardous, the Democrats in Congress switched to mandating, through new regulations, just how that money should be spent.
With Republicans in control of both the White House and Congress, we can begin to attack the network of burdensome regulations and mandates that impose such a massive indirect "tax" on this country's economic vigor.

Just More Voodoo

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 My understanding of supply-side theory is that lower taxes lead to higher levels of investment, resulting in bountiful economic growth that overcomes the budget deficit.
Every dollar in lost revenue from Bob Dole's proposals for reducing tax rates and offering tax credits for children needs to be replaced with a dollar from the proceeds of Government bond sales. The latter represents a dollar that very likely would otherwise have been earmarked for savings or investment in the private, productive side of the economy. The same can't be said about the increased take-home pay from the tax cuts -- leading to precisely the opposite of the intended result. 
 In leaving Social Security "off the table" -- in fact, proposing to lower taxes on Social Security -- Mr. Dole exhibits a profound level of cluelessness about the real long-term fiscal problem: the need for entitlement reform. So the end result is very little, or no increase in growth rate. Just more voodoo, and an even larger debt for the next generation to repay.

Governing Costs Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Perhaps it is a good thing that Bob Dole is proposing a massive tax cut, because the Republican-led Congress has just handed the states the biggest unfunded mandate in history in the welfare reform bill.
Those with memories longer than last week will recall that the slashes in Federal taxes in the Reagan revolution were inevitably followed by rises in state taxes as services formerly provided by the Federal Government were handed back (thanks a lot!) to the states. State governors and legislators who shouldered the burden found themselves out of office after the next election, the victims of voter rage. 
 Why, after so many rounds of tax cuts, are we still feeling so overtaxed? It is because sustaining the level of government services minimally necessary for a functioning modern society not permanently divided between the desperate poor and the apprehensive rich requires a certain level of expenditure. It is high time Americans displayed sufficient intelligence to grasp that simple fact.

The Two Bob Doles

 BODY:
To the Editor;
When considering Bob Dole's apparent change of attitude concerning supply-side economics, one can virtually see two competing Bob Doles on the Kansan's shoulders. Angel Bob Dole is pleading for the former Senator to stick to the principles he has espoused, virtually without variation since 1980, favoring deficit reduction over drastic tax cuts to spur economic growth. Devil Bob Dole is reminding Mr. Dole of his failed campaigns of 1980 and 1988, prodding him with a tiny pitchfork to disregard his principles so he may win the White House. 
 It is a shame that a man with such a long record of distinguished public service has sold his political soul to be President. Perhaps if he succeeds, President Dole could resign on Jan. 21, 1997, since his only objective and goal will have been accomplished.

HEADLINE: Dole Backs New Options For Auto Insurance

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
While Bob Dole's proposal of an across-the-board 15 percent tax cut has gotten all the attention, buried within his economic plan is a virtually unnoticed initiative to remake the nation's auto insurance system that could be worth billions of dollars to American drivers -- without requiring painful spending cuts or threatening to increase the budget deficit.
"Auto choice," as it has been dubbed by its proponents, would give car owners the option of buying less expensive injury coverage solely for medical bills and lost wages, letting them save hundreds of dollars a year by opting not to carry liability insurance against "pain and suffering." 
 The plan has already aroused organized opposition from trial lawyers, who have a big stake in the current system and a lot of influence among Democrats in Congress, and consumer groups with very different agendas for changing auto insurance.
But the potential saving -- as much as $40 billion a year by one estimate -- could make it a sleeper issue in Mr. Dole's attempts to stimulate his Presidential campaign by reaching out to skeptical voters. The nonpartisan Rand Institute for Civil Justice found that a nationwide auto choice program could reduce the average automobile liability insurance premium by 28 percent, for a saving of $221 a car.
The first two years of Mr. Dole's tax-cut plan would save Americans an estimated $70 billion; the auto choice program could be worth as much as $80 billion in the same period.
"Think of us as alchemists," said Michael Horowitz, a legal scholar at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, who, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia Law School, persuaded Mr. Dole to propose the radical change. "We're transforming dry legal reforms into a consumer cause -- broccoli into ice cream."
That's not the way opponents see it. Indeed, for all its apparent populist appeal, auto choice would not be an easy political sell. Trial lawyers, who would be cut out of the loop in a system that left little to fight about in court, are bitterly opposed.
"The so-called auto choice plan offers a phony choice," Howard Twiggs, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said. "The high cost of buying extra insurance to maintain your constitutional right to the courthouse would mean choice is of, by, and for the insurance industry, not the people."
Under current state laws, drivers buy insurance against their own negligence. If a motorist runs a stop light and injures someone in another car, he can generally count on being sued, leaving his insurer to either settle the claim or fight the case in court on his behalf.
Auto choice is somewhat different from current "no fault" insurance, which many states, including New York, rely on for minor damages.
With no fault, a driver's insurer pays out-of-pocket costs related to his injuries unless they exceed a certain expense threshold. This sometimes has the effect of giving injured parties an incentive to exaggerate damages to go to court. When Massachusetts raised the threshold from $500 to $2,000 in medical costs in 1988, for instance, the number of doctor's visits for the typical injury claim jumped from 13 to 30.
Nationwide, insurance premiums for bodily injury rose by 150 percent during the 1980's, the Rand Institute said, even as accident rates declined and insurance industry profits stagnated. One particularly unwelcome result was a rise in law-breaking: in California, about a quarter of all drivers are uninsured, largely because they cannot afford coverage.
Auto choice attacks the insurance cost problem by giving drivers the option of buying no-frills, loophole-resistant no-fault coverage.
Those willing to give up compensation for pain and suffering in all but the most extreme cases of negligence could buy "personal injury protection" from their insurers, which would compensate them for tangible losses even in one-car accidents.
Anyone who preferred the current approach could keep buying insurance against both economic losses and pain and suffering. In those cases, the current legal system would apply, but pain and suffering payments would come from one's own insurer rather than from the insurer representing the driver who caused the injury.
City dwellers would be the biggest beneficiaries of the new approach, a point not lost on the Dole campaign, which would like to broaden its voter base beyond traditional Republican suburban and rural strongholds. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress puts the potential average saving for New Yorkers who insured only against economic losses at $393, or 35 percent of the bodily injury part of their premiums.
"Auto choice would help low-income drivers in the inner city who often have to pay higher premiums," said Dennis Shea, a policy aide to Mr. Dole.
Any auto-choice plan faces a steep climb in Congress. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York are both supporters, which might make other Democrats more receptive to a proposal lodged in a Republican campaign document. But it would take a strong coalition to overcome the opposition of the trial-lawyer lobby; insurers, for all the presumed benefits they might receive, are ambivalent about the idea.
Insurers fear that accident victims who failed to buy the optional pain and suffering coverage might not be satisfied with their compensation, retaliating by filing lawsuits blaming their insurance agents for steering them in the wrong direction.
More important, supporters will not get help from consumer organizations, which largely supported no-fault auto insurance in the 1970's but have since drifted into opposition. Consumers Union fought a similar, but much tougher, initiative on the California ballot in March, arguing that it would deny injury victims their day in court.
And Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's group, is adamantly opposed, in part because it could pre-empt some state laws and might let some dangerous drivers escape the consequences of their actions. "Personal responsibility and states' rights are the first casualties of the plan," Joseph Belluck, a lawyer at Public Citizen in Washington, argued.
In the end, the issue boils down to a matter of who will get the lion's share of the dollars that course through the insurance and legal systems. "So much money that goes to legal expense and fraud," said Andrew Tobias, a financial writer who has campaigned for changes in the tort system, "could stay in victims' and consumers' pockets instead."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 20, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article in Business Day on Aug. 8 about a proposal by Bob Dole to change the nation's automobile insurance system referred incorrectly to the stance of the Consumers Union. The organization has not adopted a position on Mr. Dole's plan to give car owners the option of buying less expensive injury coverage solely for medical bills and lost wages. The Consumers Union opposed a related California state initiative, which would have limited the right of the injured to go to court.

New Life for a New Jersey Development

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A housing development that was begun on the site of a former quarry in West Orange, N.J., in the 1980's and later abandoned is being revived by new owners, but at a much smaller scale.
A hundred single-family condominium town houses are to rise on the site along Eagle Rock Avenue in this township in suburban Essex County. The new project replaces the original plan for two additional midrise structures with 281 apartments as well as 48 town houses. The original development had been halted after completion of a single eight-story condominium with 179 apartments. 
The new development, called the Villas at Crown View, has all its local approvals and most of its state approvals in place and is expected to be under construction by the end of the year, said Marshall Tycher, president of the Roseland Property Company of Roseland, N.J. Mr. Tycher's company is developing the $27.5 million project using its own equity and that of its partner, BNE Associates of Livingston, N.J.
Roseland is to close on the purchase of the undeveloped site, for which it will pay between $2.5 million and $3 million, when construction begins. The seller is the Marine Midland Bank in Manhattan, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings Inc. The bank took over the property, including the existing building, known as Crown View Manor, when the former developer went bankrupt several years ago. Since then the building has been completed and its apartments have been sold. But the undeveloped 34 acres of the 42-acre rocky tract, framed by a ridge climbing to 140 feet, has sat idle.
The site was part of the 60-acre Orange Quarry that for most of this century was mined for bluestone that was used for highway construction in the area. It closed in 1983.
Today West Orange, like other North Jersey communities, is seeing stagnant projects revive and new ones advance, underscoring the state's improving housing market. Often, the projects here, as elsewhere, are being scaled back, a response to the market and economic realities of the 1990's and communities' desires for lower-density development.
In the case of the Villas at Crown View, Mr. Tycher of Roseland said his company had scaled back the project for several reasons. Among them are that it felt town houses would be easier to sell in today's market, the township and existing residents would be supportive of a smaller project and the bank adjusted the purchase price of the land to reflect the lower density.
Nonetheless, Roseland spent the last year and a half negotiating with the township and the condominium board over how the project should proceed. Philip D. Neuer, a board member at the Crown View Manor I Condominium Association and a three-year resident, said homeowners wanted to insure that any new plan be for a quality development that was of an appropriate scale and provided open space.
To that end, Roseland lowered the number of units from 180 to 100 before an agreement was struck.
The new town houses will belong to a homeowners association, separate from that of the existing building. But both will be part of a joint association that manages common areas shared by the two communities, including the entrance drive, gatehouse and a five-acre lake on the site. Roseland has agreed to develop a walking path around the lake.
Susan Borg, planning director for West Orange, said that the original plan was something of an anomaly, adding that the revived project "is more in keeping with the character of West Orange."
The project is proceeding as the market for town houses in the West Orange area is strong, especially among empty-nest couples, said Richard DePiro, branch manager at the Caldwell-West Orange office of Weichert Realtors. The sales pace has increased and prices are slowly rebounding, he added, noting that town houses priced $200,000 or more are doing well.
The average price of the 39 town houses sold in West Orange from January through June was $215,000, up from an average of $199,250 for the 30 units sold in the similar period last year. Most of the sales this year, 28, were over $200,000, according to data from the Garden State Multiple Listing Service and the Suburban Essex Multiple Listing Service. The service recorded the average price of $205,500 for the 29 town houses sold in the western Essex County communities surrounding West Orange. The two- and three-level brick-faced town houses will be situated south and east of the existing building in a saucer-like valley at the base of the cliff. They will range in size from 1,900 to 2,350 square feet and in price from $247,000 to $300,000. All have two or three bedrooms, with the master bedroom on the first level in some models. They will also have two-car garages and about half will have basements.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher Against Yen; Pound Stages a Broad Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday for a third consecutive day on expectations that Japanese interest rates would remain low, but it mostly weakened against European currencies.
Traders said the market was more focused on the probability of rising interest rates in Britain, which incited a broad rally in the pound, and resilient doubts about the prospect for a single European currency by the end of the decade, which helped strengthen the mark. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 108.24 yen, up from 107.90 yen on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 1.4842 marks, down from 1.4848. The British pound rose to $1.5490 from $1.5430.
The yen's weakness was a spillover from statements by senior Japanese monetary officials on Wednesday that interest rates in Japan would stay low for the time being.
The remarks quelled speculation that the Bank of Japan might start raising rates as the economy shows more signs of strengthening.
The dollar rallied briefly in early European dealings on an unfounded rumor that Swiss National Bank might lower interest rates to suppress a rise in the Swiss franc.
Switzerland's central bank has said it believes the franc is overvalued, but when it took no action "the dollar came back down," said Frank Conte, chief trader at the Royal Bank of Canada. It ended marginally higher against the Swiss franc.
Traders said the big surprise in Europe was strength in the pound, whose broad gains were based on a Bank of England quarterly report that urged an increase in interest rates in order to forestall higher inflation. The news caught the market off guard because Britain's economy is not particularly strong, and rates were cut only last month.
"All of a sudden, people are starting to think about a rate hike out of the U.K. before year-end," said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York.
The mark's strength was a carry over from Wednesday, when traders sold other European currencies, particularly the French franc, on fears that France would not meet the strict criteria required for a single European currency by the 1999 target date. The mark, the dominant currency in Europe, tends to benefit from any skepticism about European monetary union.

Treasury Prices Down For 2d Day

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for a second consecutive session following a lukewarm reception for a sale of 30-year bonds, the last leg of the Government's quarterly auction of notes and bonds.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 , to 8929/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.79 percent, the highest level in almost a week, from 6.77 percent on Wednesday. 
 The Treasury sold $10 billion of 30-year bonds yesterday at an average yield of 6.768 percent, which was mostly in line with market expectations. But the bid-to-cover ratio came in at 2.26, slightly below average, indicating lukewarm demand for the bonds.
The ratio is the total dollar amount bid divided by the size of the auction. The sale of 30-year bonds was the third and last leg of the Treasury's quarterly auction, which raises funds to pay off maturing bonds and for general government operations.
The Treasury sold $19 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday and $10 billion of new 10-year notes on Wednesday, and demand was lackluster at each of those sales as well.
Most of the 30-year bonds were absorbed by professional Wall Street investors. Very little buying by small investors was detected, which indicates yields might have to rise over the next few days to attract fresh buyers.
Dealers -- investors who trade on the spreads between various Treasury securities' yields -- and money managers were seen as the most active bidders in all three auctions.
"My guess is that the Street owns the auctions," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank Corporation. "Retail doesn't seem to be terribly interested at these levels." The dealers often buy big quantities of bonds at Treasury auctions and then sell them to smaller, or retail, investors.
Despite the tepid reception received at each leg of the auction, investors and analysts were mostly optimistic about the market's long-term outlook.
They said that recent economic reports pointing to slowing economic growth and no buildup of inflationary pressures was likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest unchanged when its policy makers meet on Aug. 20.
Analysts said coming economic indicators -- including reports on producer prices and and retail sales for July -- are expected to confirm that trend.
The coming data "will confirm that the Fed will not move on Aug. 20," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist with Nationsbanc Capital Markets Inc.
Market particpants shrugged off comments by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Robert Parry, who said he expected inflation to pick up because the economy was running at a rapid clip.
Analysts said Mr. Parry has long been known as being overzealous about controlling inflation. Furthermore, they said, the San Francisco Fed chief is not currently a voting member of the central bank's policy-making committee.
In the corporate bond market, traders said prices fluctuated with Treasury securities to close unchanged to marginally lower as the market digested the new government bonds.
New issues priced yesterday included $300 million of notes from the Associates Corporation of North America, a unit of the Ford Motor company,
The notes were priced to yield 6.40 percent, or 25 basis points over comparable Treasuries. UBS Securities is the lead manager.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds yesterday:

For Indonesian Workers at Nike Plant: Just Do It

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: TANGERANG, Indonesia, Aug. 5

 BODY:
For the last seven hours, Suryami and Mimin, 21-year-old factory workers, had been sitting at their sewing machines, stitching Nike sneakers for export, and they were bored.
Like most of the thousands of other young women streaming from the factory gates at the end of their Sunday-morning shift, they had traveled here from rural villages seeking to escape poverty and make their way into Indonesia's growing middle class. 
 "I don't want to work here forever," said Suryami, who like many Indonesians, uses just one name. "I'm really bored sitting at a sewing machine all day. I want to earn money so I can open my own shop."
Mimin added, "It's boring but it's better than being unemployed at home."
Neither Suryami, the daughter of a farm laborer, nor Mimin, whose father is a village official, had ever heard of Michael Jordan, who is earning millions touting the brand of sneakers they make. Nor were they aware that a pair of those sneakers can sell in America for the equivalent of more than a month's pay at the factory.
And they were only vaguely aware of the controversy over celebrity endorsements of goods manufactured in harsh working conditions in Asia and Central America, like Mr. Jordan's commercials for Nike and the line of clothing manufactured under Kathie Lee Gifford's name by Wal-Mart in Honduras.
"I don't care about any of that," said Suryami, who wore a colorful blouse and neatly ironed slacks that she could not have afforded to buy at home. "What is important for us is that we came from here from our villages and got a job and and we get paid for it."
They are part of a demographic and economic migration that is turning the rice fields surrounding Jakarta into an industrial zone that is helping to fuel an economic transformation in what was recently a largely poor, rural nation.
And the pay is not all, Mimin said, voicing new social aspirations that are also changing the face of the country. "I want to be independent," she said. "If I stay at home I will be a farmer forever."
It may be a slow climb up the economic and social ladder. Like many other factory workers here, making everything from sneakers to tires to wire fences, Suryami and Mimin send a large part of their pay home to support their families.
This steadily spreading wealth is a significant element in the nation's overall stability, despite a recent eruption of violence that underscored a political malaise after 30 years of autocratic rule by President Suharto, said Dennis de Tray, director of the World Bank office here.
"This is not an Iran or a Peru," he said. "People have benefited from growth here. They do not want to destroy this machinery. They would like more freedom and they would like more democracy. But I think they would be unwilling to bring the economy down in order to achieve these other goals."
Since a riot on July 27, the Government has moved aggressively to stifle political opposition, and one of its targets has been unofficial labor groups that in recent months have led strikes at some factories for better pay and working conditions.
The Government -- and economists like Mr. de Tray -- argue that cheap labor is essential to the country's economic growth and they say it is unreasonable to apply Western standards to the labor market in developing countries.
On a sparkling Sunday afternoon, liberated from their work behind the high walls that surround their factory, many of the thousands of Nike workers headed to Tangerang's new malls and cinemas for a taste of urban life here on the northern outskirts of Jakarta.
The city is part of a fast-growing urban sprawl known as Jabotabek -- for Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi -- where the population has soared over the last five years from 17 million to more than 20 million and is expected to grow to 30 million by the year 2010. Jabotabek is now home to one-fourth of the urban population of this nation of 190 million.
The seizure of farmland for this rapid growth, here and around the crowded island of Java, is another source of discontent in Indonesia, where power is in the hands of a few and the government and judicial system offer little redress.
Much of the growth here comes from urban migration, another national problem that is straining resources and contributing to a social and economic imbalance between the cities and farming areas.
The city of Tangerang itself has grown by one-third over the last five years, to more than 1.2 million and is projected to reach 5.8 million over the next decade.
A taxi driver, visiting for the first time in three years, could not recognize downtown Tangerang, its badly paved roads now lined with shopping malls, new apartment complexes and, everywhere, more construction.
"I never saw any of this before," he said. "It's all new. The most surprising thing is all these shopping malls."
Though the malls were packed on a Sunday afternoon, many of the low-paid young factory workers seemed to be here for entertainment as much as for shopping.
Scores of young men sat on a low wall smoking cigarettes, watching the women from the factories and bobbing their heads in time to loud rock music coming from the open foyers of department stores with names like Borobudur, Mata Hari and Ramayana.
Inside, many better-heeled customers were doing more than window shopping.
Yayah Rokayah, a 23-year-old cosmetics saleswoman in a bright red jacket and matching lipstick, was selling facial cream to two women in Islamic headscarves and had only a moment to talk.
She said that she, too, was a migrant, a farmer's daughter who had come to the big city four years ago to "to get experience, to be independent and to see the world."
With her high-school education, she found a job first in a real estate office then here at the mall.
People are more modern here in the city, she said. In the evenings she likes to join her friends at one of the five nearby discos. And she is no longer poor. In a month, with bonuses, she can earn enough to buy a pair of Nike sneakers and have a bit left over.

HEADLINE: Sales Sputter And Retailers Cite Weather

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Sales fell sharply for many major retailers last month, a consequence at least in part of cooler temperatures cutting into sales of seasonal goods like summer clothing and air-conditioners.
Several retailers even pointed a finger at Atlanta, contending that the Summer Olympic Games, which held the nation's attention throughout the second half of July, had kept shoppers out of stores. 
 "We had severe tapering-off during the Olympics," said Floyd Hall, chief executive of the Kmart Corporation, which saw a drop of 3.8 percent in same-store sales, comparative sales for stores open at least one year. "So we pulled out prior Olympic years, and found that we had 3 to 6 percent decreases those years, too."
Even Sears, Roebuck & Company which has well outperformed most retailers all year, reported a half-percent decrease in its same-store sales, the first decrease the company has had since March 1993.
According to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index, which tracks sales data from about 60 retailers, the results were the worst performance for the month of July in the eight years the index has been tabulated. The index gained 1.9 percent last month. In July 1995, it rose 3.6 percent.
The overall results for July, which tends to be the weakest month in sales except for January, were the latest indication of an economy moderating from stronger levels of growth in the spring. Still, to some analysts, the decline in sales seemed out of sync with recent data indicating that while the economy was slowing a bit, consumers had taken steps to accommodate their discretionary spending.
"The weakness with retail sales in July is at odds with most of the broad economic fundamentals," said Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates. "Growth has been strong, consumer sentiment hit cyclical highs in July, and while there has been concern about consumer debt, that too is well below the late 80's."
Indeed, consumer installment debt grew at an 8.7 percent clip in June, the Federal Reserve said this week, the third straight month increases ran at less than 10 percent after a period of much larger increases. Also, outstanding credit card debt rose in June at a 7.6 percent rate, the first single-digit increase this year after five monthly rises averaging 16.9 percent.
Further, a Labor Department report last week showed wage increases, including benefits, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, which Mr. Crandall said was slightly milder than the first quarter but still faster than sustainable long-term trends.
Retailers love to blame weather for their travails -- if it's too hot in August, they argue, no one wants to buy clothes -- just as when it is freezing in February. If it's too warm in February, however, they complain that sweaters and coats don't sell, and when the temperature stays cool in July, air-conditioner and fan sales flop.
So it was this July, when cooler temperatures were said to hinder seasonal sales. Further, retailers complained, America's attention turned to the television, and the Atlanta Games.
But it may be the retailers' careful attention to inventory -- last year they were hurt when they were stuck with too much of it -- that may have contributed the most to weak sales.
"Inventories both going into July and coming out of spring and summer merchandise are about the cleanest that I have seen in several years," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman.
"If you are running inventories that are down 20 percent, it is very hard to have a positive sales comparisons."
As for the Games? "The Olympic telecasts were mostly at night," Mr. Baum noted. "I do think it impacted the weekend business, but retailers who did well did not cite the Olympics."
Poor showings could be found in all sectors of the industry. Department stores were generally weak: Dayton Hudson squeaked in with a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent, while Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a 1.7 percent loss. The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation saw a 9.8 percent decline, and the Limited Inc.'s sales were flat.
There were some winners. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, came in with a 3 percent increase. The Gap Inc., the specialty retailer, enjoyed a 7 percent increase, lifted perhaps by the easy comparison of a 6 percent decrease in July last year. Ross Stores Inc., an off-price merchant, reported a 9 percent increase, and was the only off-price store to rise above gains posted in the sales a year earlier.
Among consumer-electronics retailers, the Best Buy Company skated over its competition with an 8 percent increase. Circuit City Stores Inc. reported an 11 percent decrease, and the Tandy Corporation's same-store sales fell 3 percent.
So it may be that rain, chills and gymnasts really did kill sales. "All of this means that the technical excuses retailers are making are plausible," Mr. Crandall said. "Hurricanes are never terribly good for retailers."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs' New Public Face Is a Hard-Liner

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Since Radovan Karadzic was indicted on war crimes charges and was forced by the West to relinquish his position as Bosnian Serb leader, a philosophical soul mate and a close colleague has increasingly become the public face of the Bosnian Serbs.
For months now, American and European diplomats have driven up a hill from Sarajevo, the city the Bosnian Serbs bombarded from this village perch, to talk, often testily, with Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Parliament. 
 This week it was the new commander of NATO-led forces in Bosnia, Adm. Joseph Lopez, who stood beside Mr. Krajisnik, a self-confident figure in a blue suit and tie, on the steps of his headquarters at the run-down Panorama Hotel here.
During the war in Bosnia, Momcilo Krajisnik (pronounced MOHM-chee-loh CRY-shneek), 51, a hard-line nationalist, who was a senior executive of Yugoslavia's largest power company before the country disintegrated, was seen by many Serbs as a calculating political power behind the theatrical Dr. Karadzic.
Through control of key elements of the economy, his grip on the police and through arms deals with his brother, Mirko, Mr. Krajisnik was critical in keeping the Bosnian Serb war machine afloat, Serb officials in Belgrade said. He was also shrewd enough, they asserted, to leave few traces that would attract the attention of the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
He often sat silently alongside Dr. Karadzic at the diplomatic table, officials said.
Now, Mr. Krajisnik is doing the speaking as Washington tries to confront him over lapses in the Bosnian Serbs' commitment to the Dayton peace accords.
Foremost among the issues is the agreement Mr. Krajisnik signed under pressure from Washington last month that calls for Dr. Karadzic to leave the political scene before of the Sept. 14 national elections.
During an interview in his office at the hotel today, Mr. Krajisnik declined to say when he had last spoken with Dr. Karadzic, who was apparently holed up under heavy guard somewhere in the hills of Pale.
Dr. Karadzic no longer appears on Pale television, and while campaign posters with his face still decorate a few storefront windows, his presence has generally receded in his stronghold, the eastern part of Serb-held Bosnia.
Mr. Krajisnik said the Bosnian Serbs would adhere to the agreement negotiated with Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton Administration's envoy to the Balkans.
"We do respect danger," he said. "Whatever we agree on with someone, especially with a representative of the United States, especially Mr. Holbrooke, we wish to respect it. Mr. Holbrooke is a very strict person and a good politician."
But Mr. Krajisnik refused to discuss the possibility that Dr. Karadzic would be exiled to Montenegro, as American diplomats recently proposed. He has said on several occasions that authorities in Pale would not hand over any of the indicted Bosnian Serbs to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague.
Mr. Krajisnik derided the ideal of a multi-ethnic Bosnia, which is the declared goal of the Clinton Administration.
"Bosnia must be transformed into three entities with a thin roof over it," he said referring to the central government called for in the Dayton agreement. "I think in the international community there are a great number of capable people who have a clear-cut picture on Bosnia -- and they know bananas can't be grown in Bosnia. You can grow bananas in Africa. This solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina could function somewhere, but not here."
Bosnian Serb officials say the only advantages they expect from a Bosnian state are access to passports -- residents of Serb-held Bosnia are currently ineligible for passports -- and the prospect of financial help from international institutions like the World Bank.
Mr. Krajisnik is running as the candidate of the Serbian Democratic Party, which until last month was headed by Dr. Karadzic. He is seeking one position in the three-member national presidency, which is to consist of one Bosnian Serb, one Bosnian Croat and one Bosnian Muslim.
One of the fears of American diplomats is that Mr. Krajisnik could win the presidential election in the Serb part of Bosnia on Sept. 14 with enough votes to become the first president of the new federal structure.
Diplomats say his scorn for the new Bosnian state is so intense that in discussions he has seemed to envision that the new federation's government building would have separate entrances for Serb and non-Serb officials.
Unlike Dr. Karadzic, who was born in Montenegro and came to Sarajevo later in life, Mr. Krajisnik was born in Zabrdje, a small suburb of Sarajevo. His multi-storied house set in a large garden now appears looted, although the nearby home of his nephew, Slavko, is now being rented by a British Government aid agency.
During the Dayton talks, the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, excluded the Bosnian Serb delegation from any influence, leaving Mr. Krajisnik as a fairly forlorn figure in a world of big-time diplomacy. Only after the deal was done did Mr. Milosevic show Mr. Krajisnik the final map showing Sarajevo completely under the control of the Muslim Government.
Mr. Krajisnik had been a persistent advocate of the strategy to strangle Sarajevo during the war and the loss of the city enraged him, Serb officials said.
It was this fury, they said, that drove his campaign to insure that all Serbs evacuate the Sarajevo suburbs last winter as the city came under control of the predominantly Muslim government.

HEADLINE: Acapulco's Smut Ring: The Children Remember

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: ACAPULCO, Mexico

 BODY:
On any sultry Acapulco night, Mexican boys move among the partying crowds on the oceanside boulevard, doing whatever they can to make a small living.
For a dollar or so, the street boys will dive from a high rock into roaring surf. At busy street corners they become human flame throwers, spitting mouthfuls of lighted kerosene into arcs of fire, then passing the cup to motorists before the traffic signal turns green. 
 Some of the boys who roam the streets used to earn a meal and a place to sleep by following American men to their Acapulco hideaways and having sex with them or with one another in front of a video camera.
With a series of arrests that began in May, the United States Postal Service said, it closed down the biggest child pornography production and distribution ring American law enforcement had ever seen. The $500,000-a-year business was run by three Americans, investigators said, and was based in a high-priced hillside home overlooking Acapulco's world-famous bay.
In the thousands of videos and photographs seized from the business by Mexican and American police officers, investigators counted about 300 boys who appeared to be under-age Mexicans. Many were recruited on beaches, in public parks and on the doorsteps of bars in Acapulco, they say. The youngest children looked to be no more than 7 years old.
So far, 56 people across the United States have been arrested and charged with receiving by mail order videotapes showing sex involving under-age boys. Officials expect the number of arrests to exceed 100.
Postal investigators say the ringleader was Clair Anthony (Troy) Frank, a fugitive from American justice with a criminal record for molesting minors and selling child pornography that stretched from Colorado to the Netherlands. He made hundreds of videos in and around Acapulco, including many at poolside on his own front patio. In some of the films, sex with minors was accompanied by violent beatings.
The breakup of the operation, which has prompted Mexico's Attorney General to call for tighter laws, has exposed an underside of the global economy that is rarely seen. The explosion in travel and free trade between the United States and poorer countries like Mexico and the myriad new possibilities for cross-border electronic communications have made it harder to track the international flow of child pornography, investigators and child abuse experts said.
With enforcement more difficult, the market in the United States for child pornography is expanding, and with it the risk that foreign children will be used to meet the demand.
American officials said Mr. Frank's film business was finished. On Aug. 2, 1995, he was found dead at the age of 46 in his residence here with a gunshot wound to the head, in what the local police have so far described as a suicide. One man wanted in the United States and Mexico as a partner, John William Willets of Sunnyvale, Calif., is a fugitive. Another man accused of being a partner, James Leroy Kemmish, was arrested in San Diego in 1994 and pleaded guilty seven months ago to charges of distributing child pornography through the mail. He is serving a five-year sentence.
But many young people who inhabit Acapulco's central square, where the lush shade trees and the quaint gazebo serve as shelters and the stone benches serve as beds, still talk about the "gringos" -- the Americans who offered to pay them to perform on camera.
One boy who dwells on and off in the square is a spindly 11-year-old known on the street as Juanito G. After leaving home to escape the blows of his mother's boyfriend, he said, Juanito lived for months in the square and recently sought refuge in a public shelter for boys.
He recalled the evening when an American came to the square to invite more than a dozen boys to his home -- "a rich man's house," Juanito said -- to see some movies.
"He showed us the film, and then he asked us to help him make one," Juanito said.
Like several boys who spoke about the films, Juanito said he had not taken part himself but had known a friend who did. The rates started at 100 pesos, or about $15. After being paid, his friend was able to go grocery shopping at the supermarket, he said, a great luxury for a street child.
Counselors at the shelter say they found out about Juanito's knowledge of pornography one day when they put a cartoon on the video player for the boys to watch. Juanito objected brashly and demanded to see a movie with explicit sex.
But as he talked about his experience, his blase smile disappeared, his thin shoulders hunched, and he nervously shredded a paper cup.
"I never said a word to that gringo," he said fiercely. "I just watched. I'm only doing that with the girl I marry."
Another boy who said he was solicited to make a pornography film is a 9-year-old named Eaobedad J. who lived for a time in a cash machine booth in the main square. After he was hit by a car in May, he was taken to a home for boys sponsored in part by the Presbyterian Church. He told supervisors at the home he believed his parents were dead.
Some minors were paid in drugs to make films, he said, while others were not paid at all in order to pressure them to return for another session. Many Acapulco street children are drug users, prowling for pesos to buy paint thinner, glue or marijuana.
The boy expressed contempt for his friend who consented to be in a pornography film.
"My laws, my religion don't allow me to do that kind of thing," he insisted. But as with Juanito, the discussion dissolved his tough bluster into the ache and confusion of a lonely child.
"I miss my papa," he said, unable to stop tears from swelling in his eyes. "This talking makes me think about how much I miss my papa."
Of all the offenses young people endure on the streets, being sexually victimized can be the most damaging.
"Possibly they don't realize it now," said Ramon Ruedas Almazan, a psychologist who works with Acapulco street boys. "But when they get older and understand what happened to them, they will feel used. They will feel they lost part of their essential value."
The sexual abuse of minors has long been tolerated in Acapulco, a tropical beauty in decline that has become a prime destination in the global boom in sex tourism. The city draws many foreigners who are searching for a specific kind of sexual adventure, sometimes illicit.
"There is a huge increase in international travel, and some people travel with the attitude, well, nobody's going to know me if I go there," said John Rabun, who monitors sexual crimes involving children for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Arlington, Va.
When the Acapulco police first began to investigate Troy Frank's operation -- after he was found dead -- they did not open a case about pornography or abuse of minors. Instead, some police agents stole more than $100,000 in video equipment and stacks of pornography from Mr. Frank's house, Mexican detectives currently working on the case said.
But in the United States the Postal Service had received complaints from Americans who were sent advertisements from Mr. Frank's company -- Overseas Male -- clearly offering child pornography, which is illegal to possess, receive, mail or otherwise distribute under American law.
"We think Frank got a little greedy," said Raymond Smith, the inspector who coordinates child pornography investigations for the United States Postal Service. "He sent material to too many people."
The complaints led to the arrest of Mr. Kemmish, a courier for Mr. Frank. Using customer records captured from Mr. Kemmish, postal inspectors set up an undercover sting operation, which continued to run the business. Subscribers who ordered videos clearly identified as child pornography were selected for arrest.
Mexican justice officials were jolted by the arrests in the United States. In an anguished speech, Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia acknowledged Mexico's vulnerability to international pornographers and admitted that its laws needed revision.
Mr. Lozano set up Mexico's first federal task force for child pornography investigations and prepared proposals for the national Congress on tightening the laws, which now provide for a maximum sentence of only nine years. Task force prosecutors said they had discovered international child pornography operations in three other Mexican states.
On June 29, federal police officers arrested another American in Acapulco, Dennis Carl Greth of Los Angeles, charging him with corruption of minors, based on videos and photographs found in a hotel and a bar he owns here. Mr. Greth, through his lawyers, has denied the charge.
But for the Mexican boys who were caught up in Mr. Frank's operation, there is little help or protection. The public social welfare system, already collapsing under the burdens of a severe economic crisis, has no specific methods for reaching out to children in this kind of case.
At the same time, Mr. Frank left behind a veil of shame. Although hundreds of boys were involved, neither the social agencies nor the police received a single complaint against the pornographers from them or any of their families.
Leticia Castro Ortiz, Acapulco's chief detective for child abuse cases, said, "There is nothing out there but silence."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PLAYERS;
The President's Strategist Puts His Faith in Timing and Telephone Calls

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Dick Morris is so maniacal about not wasting time that on Monday mornings, when he makes his Washington shuttle flight for another week's work at strategizing over President Clinton's re-election effort, he takes his shoes off at the terminal shoeshine stand and pads off to the phone bank in his socks to make rapid-fire phone calls.
"There's no phone at the shoeshine stand, and I must work in my socks," Mr. Morris explains with much the same careful tone of rationale he uses in trying to justify the President's turnabout acceptance of the Republican-led Congress's severe welfare changes. "I leave a big tip, $5." 
 By the approach of last Monday's flight time, Mr. Morris, by his own accounting, had already completed 15 calls from his car phone, on his way down to the airport from his home in Connecticut, plus a dozen from a LaGuardia Airport phone booth while his shoes were buffed.
Of these calls, none were more important than the first, his check for the overnight polling numbers. These are the rolling estimates of shifting political fortunes, endless as a seismology watch, voter tests reduced to data that are to political consultants like Mr. Morris what chicken innards were to the shamans of an earlier eon.
After this bracer, he made the second call of his Monday routine, to George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President, one of a score of conversations between the two men in a typical day.
"We discussed what the day was going to look like," Mr. Morris said, speaking at the very end of what proved to be a typically frenetic and, by his partisan estimate, successful day when Bob Dole, the prospective Republican challenger, unveiled his economic plan.
"He threw a Hail Mary pass," Mr. Morris contended gleefully, using a football metaphor to criticize the Dole tax-cut promises as steeped in desperation. "And like most Hail Marys, it was intercepted and run back for long yardage."
Dick Morris is the Presidential campaign's most secretive and, thus far, singularly successful political operative, the man who prescribed the political resuscitation of Bill Clinton after the Republicans' 1994 Congressional rout. Even so, he is a standout loner in a city that normally lionizes winners, a master politician denounced as unprincipled by rivals who are themselves masters of expediency.
In the words of one Republican, Mr. Morris has accomplished "the Vulcan mind-meld" with the President and refashioned him into an ever-compromising, vapidly euphemizing centrist.
"I howl at night," Mr. Morris said in gentle mockery of his wizard's standing. A short, pompadoured, enormously self-confident man who seems rather merry amid all his detailed strategems, he sat talking, planning and celebrating politics in his elegant personal campaign bunker, a suite in the Jefferson Hotel, a few blocks from the White House.
He muses and telephones in shadowy solitude, as idiosyncratic in politics as Howard Hughes was in his Las Vegas hotel aerie. He talks with the President "5 to 15 times" a week, he estimates, and receives a half-dozen Clinton memorandums and queries a day.
A domineering strategist who has worked both parties and made visceral enemies in the process, Mr. Morris lightly dismissed the knocks in an interview. But he seriously disputed them, too, using phrases like "Hegelian synthesis" and "new paradigm" to argue that history will eventually understand a two-term Clinton Presidency as a new stage of Presidential leadership: not craven in the re-electioneering, but admirable in crafting a balance between the true Clinton agenda and the volatile limits of popular mandate.
"He has a great sense of waiting for forces to come to the point when action is possible," Mr. Morris contended. He conceded that the 1994 Republican victory was a startling prod to the President's current behavior. But he argued even more that the new Congress's "excesses" then enabled Mr. Clinton to renew his mandate and revive his agenda.
"Every hour of every day, I'm running the Dole campaign in my mind," he said, obviously joyful at the task. "It's a little bit like Jimmy Carter committing adultery in his heart," he added impishly.
His political enemies include more than a few within the White House. He is famous for career-long feuding with Harold M. Ickes, the President's deputy chief of staff.
"We each do different things and stay out of each other's way," Mr. Morris contended in the face of ongoing legend to the contrary.
His balm is that his trusting friends include, above all, Bill Clinton, who urgently summoned Mr. Morris a few days after the 1994 Democratic defeat.
"He asked me to come back -- he was very depressed," said Mr. Morris, a 48-year-old New Yorker who practiced insurgent clubhouse political intrigues as a Manhattan teen-ager and masterminded the comeback of Mr. Clinton from defeat in the 1980 Arkansas governor's race.
"I did it because I really wanted to save his Presidency," asserted the consultant, no stranger to proud talk. "I saw he was having trouble keeping his mandate and doing what he wanted to do. I decided, if we're both good enough we'll work our way out of it. If not, we're both sunk."
Morris enemies, in the White House and beyond, tempted to groan at his recounting, may also doubt the consultant's statement that this will probably be his last campaign ever, after three decades at the carpetbagger's arts of consulting.
"After Everest, you give up mountain climbing," he said, unapologetic for his career swervings between parties.
"While I've never been loyal to parties, I've always been loyal to people," he insisted, estimating he had devoted fully one-third of his career to the roller-coaster fortunes of Mr. Clinton.
In savoring the summons from the President, Mr. Morris conjured up a scene from the movie "Independence Day," when the scientist-savior's road to the President's side is deserted as lesser mortals flee in the opposite direction from the giant alien shadow engulfing the White House. "That's how I felt," he said.
His wife, Eileen McGann, a lawyer, smiled in disclosing that her husband shed tears at the movie's scene where the President delivers an all-time sound bite, rallying the nation from extinction, then ascending in his own fighter plane to defeat the aliens.
Tears aflow from Dick Morris, the chrome-steel pragmatist?
"Oh sure," his wife replied affectionately. "And he weeps every time we rewatch 'Ghost,' " one of the favorites of the now, perhaps, arguably soft-hearted eminence grise.
He grinned sheepishly at this, but only for an instant before plunging back into his confident ramblings on the campaign.
It turned out the most heartfelt effect of "Independence Day" was Mr. Morris's strategic pondering, with jottings into his ever present palm-top computer, of whether in the real world the film might trigger in voters some echo of the need for solidarity as the terrorism issue resurfaces once more. He declined to discuss how far he might go with this speculation, whether he might have his pollster, Mark Penn, search for some advantage in the interface between politics and fantasy, assuming they are separate realms.
Dick Morris, riding high in the morning numbers, once more vociferously denied the accusation that lingers about the campaign, as firm as the President's lead, that "I'm doing spin for some substance-less person."
"I was reintroduced to Bill Clinton's life at the most shattering experience of his Presidency," he said, insisting the critical fact of winning at politics is to understand that it is about far more than Election Day. "The most important thing I ever did was to go down that path to the White House."

HEADLINE: The Kitchen Sink and More;
A Franchiser Is Selling Homes and All the Trimmings

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:

The Time: Soon
The Place: Almost Anytown, U.S.A.
The Problem: House-hunting
John and Jane Jones are a young, two-income couple without much time to make the most important financial decision of their lives. Which is why they have come to Century 21. 
 Through the real estate company's America Online site, the Joneses take an electronic look at dozens of houses, sifting out the three they choose to visit with an agent. When they settle on the house of their dreams, the couple sit down at the agent's computer to select a mortgage and buy title insurance. And when they close, the Joneses sign up for a half-dozen extras from Century 21's portfolio: a satellite dish, a burglar alarm, new siding -- and a motel room to stay in while it's all installed.
The real estate transaction of the future? HFS Inc., Century 21's new owner, says it is remaking residential real estate in this image today, in hopes of winning more customers, raising its agents' incomes and wooing more franchisees into a system that makes HFS the nation's No. 1 seller of homes.
In less than a year, the Parsippany, N.J., company, America's biggest hotel franchiser, has bought not just the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation, but also Electronic Realty Associates and the Coldwell Banker Corporation. The purchases gave HFS 11,000 offices, 160,000 agents, a 21 percent share of the national market and unbeatable name recognition almost overnight.
But HFS is not content with being big. To make the returns it wants on its $1 billion investment in real estate , HFS needs to transform home buying.
With technology, the company hopes to compress the search process, cutting the average number of properties a buyer visits to eight from 12 and in turn raising agent productivity. With its program to offer house buyers home improvements and other housing-related products, HFS plans to tap a stream of fees from outside vendors and capitalize on the "synergies" among its various businesses, including the 5,200 hotels and motels it franchises under such brands as Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Ramada and Super 8.
"We will use our size and scale to do things that nobody else can," Robert W. Pittman, a managing partner and chief executive of Century 21, boasted.
Competing companies are at the very least nervous about the new giant in their midst. "They have made a big splash by spending a lot of money, and you are foolish if you don't take notice of it," said James Shapiro, chief executive of Windemere Services, a residential real estate franchiser with 147 offices in the Pacific Northwest.
"They are outsiders, and they are posing a high-profile threat," added John Tucillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.
But while HFS is riding high at the moment -- Wall Street has bid the company's stock up to $65.375 from $17 a little more than a year ago -- some of the people who are supposed to be turning the grand vision into a reality are unimpressed.
Real estate franchisees are grumbling about being asked to pitch ancillary products in return for small commissions and wondering aloud whether three competing chains can thrive under the same corporate roof. A handful of Century 21 franchisees has formed a dissident group to keep on eye on headquarters, and hundreds of Century 21 agents have defected to rival companies.
Competitors are seizing on the dissension as evidence that HFS -- which acknowledges that it knows more about franchising than selling houses -- is stumbling. And they argue that the company's investment in technology -- about $30 million this year -- will not give it much of an edge in a business that depends on the personal touch.
"So far, the technological revolution has only impacted the top producers" among agents, said Dave Linegar, chairman of RE/MAX International Inc., HFS's biggest rival. "The rest don't need technology. They need customers. That is a real challenge for Century 21."
Mr. Pittman acknowledges that the technology will not take shoe leather out of house-hunting, but he is betting it will speed it up.
"No one is going to click a mouse to buy a house, because too much money is involved," said the executive, who previously started MTV for Viacom Inc. and ran the Six Flags theme parks for Time Warner Inc. "But as a consumer, I am motivated by convenience. If we can get them to narrow down their choices, I have dramatically altered the business."
Initially, HFS's biggest selling job may be persuading its real estate agents to sign onto the "preferred vending program" that the company is beginning. Many cringe at the idea of peddling home improvements and even vacations at Disney resorts, saying it will distract them from their main job of closing sales.
William Eldridge, president and owner of Century 21 Associates in Rochester Hills, Mich., predicted that only 10 percent of Century 21 agents would actually promote such products. "Most see themselves selling real estate, and nothing else," he said. "They don't want to confuse either the seller or the buyer."
Peter M. Schultz, the owner of a Century 21 franchise in Medway, Mass., was emphatic about his distaste. "I am not in the siding or satellite business," he said.
And it isn't just the vending program that upsets Mr. Schultz. He and 55 other Century 21 franchisees -- many of them in the New York City area and New England -- started an association this spring to protest some changes HFS instituted shortly after taking over the real estate operator. They were particularly upset by an increase in renewal fees for their franchises, by HFS's attempt to lengthen their contracts from five years to seven years or more and by the elimination of regional offices and other support services.
The dissidents summarized their grievances in a letter they sent throughout the Century 21 network in June. "We do not expect to create a confrontational atmosphere with HFS," the letter says in part, "but we do expect that it will serve as an effective forum to formulate and present a unified position on issues critical to the operations and profitability of each franchisee." The group's Washington lawyer said it would have no further comment on the initiative until later this month.
Mr. Pittman brushes off the internal protests as a tempest in a teapot at a company with 90,000 agents.
HFS says it has already made changes that satisfied the vast majority of its franchisees, who pay fees of as much as 8 percent of sales in return for the Century 21 brand, national advertising and the parent company's marketing and management expertise.
Mr. Pittman, deriding the dissidents, said the company's existing National Broker Communication Council gives franchisees a forum to voice concerns. He said that 97 percent of the franchisees up for renewal this year have done so and that sales of new franchises have grown fivefold.
Still, some agents are voting with their feet. In RE/MAX's summer newsletter, Mr. Linegar, the chairman, listed more than 650 brokers and agents who had left Century 21 since October to join his company. One was Michael M. MacKillip, a franchisee in the Denver area who took 15 agents with him in May after receiving what he said was an onerous franchise renewal contract.
"Mr. Pittman is a very well-directed individual and has a strong vision of what he wants to do with the company," Mr. MacKillip said. "That vision is not shared by me."
Other critics say HFS is asking for trouble by trying to digest three real estate chains. Since they overlap in some regions, their agents often fight for the same clients. The infighting could get worse: Mr. Pittman is pushing Century 21 into areas like luxury real estate and relocation services where Coldwell Banker has a strong presence.
Even Century 21 loyalists are grumbling. "I renewed with Century 21 because of Bob Pittman -- he was the difference," said Mr. Eldridge, the franchisee in Rochester Hills, Mich. "But when HFS bought us, they didn't have ERA and Coldwell Banker, and there are now times when they bid for services we had. I have to watch that."
Competitors are watching, too -- and gloating, as much as they can in facing down so huge a rival.
They contrast the potential for disharmony at HFS with their own team spirit. "We work very hard to insure that people work together rather than against each other," said Mr. Shapiro, Windemere's chairman. Other rivals see potential for even more discord in HFS's new policy of placing resources behind its most productive agents.
Henry R. Silverman, the chairman and chief executive of HFS, says giving special treatment to the best real estate agents makes sense because they produce the most revenue. And he says he is not bothered by the thought of Century 21 bumping heads with ERA and Coldwell Banker. "The job of all our brand presidents is to compete, including with our sister brands," he said.
For all the flak, though, it has not paid to bet against HFS, which has seen revenue more than double since it went public in 1992 and earnings rise to $80 million in 1995 from $18 million three years earlier. For the first half of this year, HFS earned $61.5 million on sales of $304.2 million. Last month, it agreed to acquire Avis Inc. for about $800 million. The rental car company's employee owners, some of whom have criticized the deal, will vote on the proposed sale by the end of the month.
Indeed, many people in the real estate industry praise HFS -- and Mr. Pittman, in particular -- for energizing Century 21, which they say had become tired under its previous owner, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Met Life sold the unit to HFS last August.
Analysts say that even companies far from real estate may feel pressure from HFS's initiatives, such as on-line previews of homes for sale. "The threat to the newspaper industry from electronic delivery of what traditionally has been bread-and-butter classified advertising is real and it is here," said Peter A. Appert, a managing director at Alex. Brown & Sons in San Francisco.
But some say HFS may simply have made itself too big to be effective in a business that remains highly local. Roughly two-thirds of all agencies are independents, a figure that has not changed much for the last decade, according to the National Association of Realtors. A total of 580,000 agents are licensed in the United States, and they sold 3.8 million existing homes last year.
HFS's innovations need to produce returns for its franchisees if the parent company is to prosper, experts say. "If the profit streams are not what they foresee, the franchise system will not increase as they want," said the association's Mr. Tucillo. "And the franchise system has to grow in order to increase the value of their stock."
Robert Moles, president and chief executive of Contempo Realty Inc. in San Jose, Calif., and chairman of The Dozen Inc., a consortium of big independent regional real estate companies, doubts whether HFS has discovered the magic formula.
"The process needs to be streamlined, and it will happen, with or without real estate brokers," Mr. Moles added. "But does it have to be done under an HFS umbrella? My thought is, 'No.' "

GRAPHIC: Photo/Chart: "Closing the Deals"
The new owner of Century 21 Real Estate - a Parsippany, N.J. franchising company called HFS Inc. - is trying to turn the home sale into a multifaceted marketing opportunity. Here are some examples.
 
HOME SECURITY
Home buyers get discounts from ADT Security Systems. Century 21 brokers and agents get $50 for each referral that results in a sale.
 
AMERICA ONLINE
Potential home buyers can get data about communities and houses through a Century 21 site. Century 21 brokers get leads via the online service.
 
HOME IMPROVEMENT
Homeowners get "substantial" discounts on work by Amre Inc., which licenses the Century 21 name. Brokers get a 10% commission on referrals.
 
DISNEY VACATIONS
Brokers and agents get discounts on stays at Disney time-share resorts. Eventually Century 21 will market time-shares through its offices.
 
HOTEL DISCOUNTS
Employees of Century 21 get discounts for stays at motel chains franchised by HFS, including Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Ramada.
 
SATELLITE TV SYSTEMS
Brokers get discounts on Sony Satellite TV Dishes for their offices, a program that Century 21 plans to extend to home buyers.

HEADLINE: As Sugar Fades, Hawaii Seeks a New Cash Crop

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: KOLOA, Hawaii

 BODY:
Herbert Cambra's grandfather hacked the wrist-thick tentacles of cane with a machete for 50 cents a day. Mr. Cambra's father handled the machines that crushed the giant grass and boiled its juice. Mr. Cambra himself drives the monstrous trucks that move the tangled stalks to the mill.
Here on this moss-green island of Kauai, where the first successful Hawaiian sugar plantation started in 1835, he has spent his adult life working the cane. Now, with the McBryde Sugar Company closing down its sugar operations here, he is thinking about looking for a job as a hotel security guard. 
 "Sugar was a tradition where it would go down through fathers to sons in our family, and now it's ending," said Mr. Cambra, 62. "By September it should be all pao," the Hawaiian word for finished, done, over.
Mr. Cambra's family story reflects the decline and near-death of the premier crop that more than pineapples, more than tourism, more than the military made Hawaii what it is today, historians say. For decades, before foreign competition crippled it, the crop was known as King Sugar, the commodity that powered the politics, the wealth and the very peopling of what became the 50th state.
The sugar economy created the plantation system of Hawaii and imported Asian and other laborers just as cotton brought African slaves to the American South. It built Hawaii's railroads and ports. Its barons controlled these islands for more than a century with a grip so tight that by World War II, land in Hawaii was concentrated in fewer hands than anywhere else in the country. That legacy continues today, though the great fortunes and land holdings sugar created have metamorphosed into mammoth endowments and real-estate trusts.
"The land ownership continues even though the sugar declines," said Haunani-Kay Trask, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for Hawaiian Studies. "So instead of growing sugar, now they grow hotels."
As sugar has declined, tourism has taken its place -- and far surpassed it. Like many other societies, Hawaii has undergone a profound transformation from an agrarian to a service economy, becoming a vast tourism mill where 6.6 million visitors spent $11 billion last year.
The sugar industry itself, walloped by foreign competitors and squeezed by low prices that refuse to budge, has so withered over the decades that a recent Bank of Hawaii report predicted it could disappear altogether "in the not so distant future."
At the industry's peak in 1931, Hawaii's sugar plantations employed more than 50,000 workers and produced more than 1 million tons of sugar a year, the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center says. That plummeted to 492,000 tons in 1995, and will drop even faster when the Dole and McBryde concerns close after this growing season. Their closing will bring the number of plantations, once in the dozens, to a mere five.
This summer alone, the last sugar plantation on Oahu, a Dole-owned farm called the Waialua Sugar Company, is bringing in its final harvest, and the same is happening at the McBryde plantation here where Mr. Cambra works here on Kauai. The last sugar plantation on the Big Island of Hawaii stopped harvesting sugar last year. The decline has reached the point that the Hawaii Sugar Planters' Association, founded in 1892, recently changed its name to the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center, reflecting the search for other crops to grow on former sugar land.
At Dole's Waialua Sugar, that search is already intensively under way. Jerry D. Vriesenga, president of the Dole Food Company Hawaii and overseer of the sugar phaseout, is experimenting with forage grasses for cattle, papayas, coffee and Bird of Paradise. Others are testing tea, patchouli, spices and tree farming, because the warm, damp climate makes trees grow faster than just about anywhere else.
"It's all economics," Mr. Vriesenga said of the end of sugar. "The sugar price hasn't risen since 1981 and labor costs have gone way up. The production cost far exceeded what you could earn."
On its nearly 13,000 acres, Waialua Sugar produced 75,000 tons a year at its peak, and yields 60,000 now. But it has lost about $8 million a year, Mr. Vriesenga said.
Politics surely contributed to sugar's end as well. Sugar has long been used as a tool in United States foreign policy. Instead of giving foreign aid, Washington has offered sugar quotas, allowing a country to export a quantity of sugar to the United States, where it can be sold at a profit. Such deals -- and the sugar surplus they bolstered -- hurt domestic producers like those in Hawaii.
But Mr. Vriesenga and others also acknowledge that their sugar production simply fell victim to the world division of labor. They could not compete with places like the Philippines and Indonesia, where labor is cheaper. So managers like Mr. Vriesenga are selling machinery to foreign sugar enterprises and casting a creative eye around their plantations to find ways to re-employ hundreds of workers and re-use their resources.
Being rich in land and water, they still face a challenge of finding crops lucrative enough to bear the high cost of shipping to the mainland and still remain competitive. The sugar-growers have had few problems with power, because their mills burned bagasse, crushed cane fiber left after the juice has been removed, and can now burn grasses or wood chips to generate electricity and even produce a surplus to sell. "If they wait long enough, all the workers will be be employed again," Mr. Vriesenga said.
But for now, the mood at places like McBryde and Waialua is more one of finality than of transition. In the control room of the Waialua mill, packed with the dials and lights of the heavy machinery, stands a blackboard with this message from some workers: "A-planting we won't go. 96 years. Moral: do your complaining now."
"It's really tough," said Yoshiaki Tanabi, the mill's production manager. "There are people who've been working with me for a lifetime. Sugar -- that's where my career was. But you can't stop there, you have to keep going."
For mill workers thinking about restaurant work and field hands seeking construction jobs, there is a pervasive feeling of slipping slowly into the history books. Already, there is an educational sugar plantation village on Oahu and a preserved homestead on Kauai, where the way of life that bridged the old, precolonial Hawaii and the modern, tourism-dominated Hawaii is preserved.
Mr. Cambra, whose uncles, nephews and grandfathers worked in sugar, recalled his elders' tales of working 12 hours a day, loading the cane onto cane cars pulled by locomotives, and living in sugar camps provided by the company.
"It was hot, dusty work," Mr. Cambra said of his own early days hoeing, weeding and fumigating. "Cane was everything."
In all, as many as 385,000 contract workers, little better off than slaves, immigrated here to that kind of life. The first were Chinese who arrived in 1852, followed by Japanese, Portuguese, Polynesians, Filipinos, Russians and others, whose descendants now dominate the state's population. Plantations ran under strict rules, including set bedtimes and fines for lateness, and Chinese laborers earned as little as $5 a month in the mid-19th century.
The early plantation owners who employed and housed the multinational workers were mainly settlers of New England origin, including some from families of the missionaries who arrived in the early 19th century. Their hold on the islands was so strong that according to "Land and Power in Hawaii" (University of Hawaii Press, 1990) in the era before World War II, nearly half the land was held by fewer than 80 private owners.
That power stemmed originally from a crop so profitable that in 1866, when Mark Twain visited Hawaii -- then known as the Sandwich Islands -- he exulted at finding "a land which produces 6, 8, 10, 12, yea, even 13,000 pounds of sugar to the acre on unmanured soil!" Of all the wonders he had seen in the islands, he wrote, this one "in its importance to America, surpasses them all."

The closing of two sugar companies followed decades of decline for an industry that was once the largest employer in Hawaii and formed its patterns of politics and wealth. At one of the companies, Waialua Sugar, a search is under way to find other crops to grow on former sugar land. (Photographs by Jim Wilson/The New York Times)
