 BODY:

TOO LATE -- Today is the day General Motors ends its employee-discount promotion, so if you want to get a reduction from the sticker price, starting tomorrow you'll have to go back to old-fashioned haggling. It seems like the program was a smashing success: G.M. sales surged 42 percent in the first 15 days of July from a year earlier, and Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which joined the price-cutting fray, also enjoyed big rebounds. Look for record or near-record figures when vehicle sales are announced this week. (Tomorrow.)

OPEN WALLETS -- The big question is how wide consumers are opening them in places like Wal-Mart and Macy's. Everything else seems to be up these days -- car sales, stocks (the Nasdaq hit a four-year high last Thursday), real estate (aside from ever-surging prices, sales of existing homes hit a record annual rate in June), industrial output, business spending -- so why not store sales? Come on, shoppers, do your duty. (Thursday).

BACK TO THE 4'S? -- Well, not everything's going up. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent from its post-9/11 peak of 6.3 percent, and this week we'll find out whether the happy trend continued in June. Was Friday's announcement that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter a good omen? It was a shade below economists' expectations of 3.5 percent growth, but it might be enough to do the trick and certainly will do nothing to throw Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan off course of continuing to raise interest rates. (Friday)

TOP SECRET -- This week, the World Trade Organization is scheduled to produce a ruling -- planned to be a confidential one -- on the European Union's restrictions on genetically modified crops. European environmentalists and much of the European public support the bans, but industry says it violates fair-trade rules. It is just one of several trade disputes between the United States and Europe, including American protests over government subsidies to Airbus. (Friday)

MEDIA SHOW -- A big earnings week lies ahead for communications companies. Comcast, the nation's biggest cable provider, and Qwest Communications International, the smallest of the Bell companies, report results tomorrow, followed by Time Warner on Wednesday and Viacom, whose cable networks include MTV and Nickelodeon, on Thursday.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS -- Construction spending for June (today); June's factory orders and personal income (tomorrow); weekly jobless claims (Thursday); consumer borrowing in June (Friday).

Tom Zeller Jr., whose Link by Link column normally appears in this section, is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Recalling Careers That Struggled to Advance 2 Blocks at a Time

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: ROCKY MOUNT, N.C., July 31 

 BODY:
The cars started to fill the grassy yard again around 8:30 a.m. on Saturday. Cadillac after Cadillac had exited Interstate 95, less than a mile away, made a right turn after the Dollar General Store, and rolled past the tobacco fields next to James E. Carmon's ranch-style house. 
 By the time the chartered bus from Queens arrived, breakfast in Mr. Carmon's barn, behind his house, had begun. Grits were ladled onto plastic foam plates, next to bacon, sausage, muffins and scrambled eggs. An electric band played gospel melodies. The cook sang backup. 
The gathering of 300 retired men and women this weekend was not bound by family nor fond memories of college years. Yet their bond was no less strong. 
 They were former New York City bus workers, mostly drivers and some family members, who convened here this weekend, as they have every summer since 1996, to catch up with friends, talk about concerns like prescription-drug benefits and reminisce about the decades they spent working for the busiest transit system in the nation.
 The reunions started when two retired drivers, James S. Bowles and Sidney Bronson, decided to plan a gathering of their old friends from the East 100th Street Depot. 
 Mr. Bowles had retired to Charleston, S.C., and Mr. Bronson was living in Co-op City in the Bronx. The friends asked Mr. Carmon if they could use his house in Rocky Mount, about 45 miles east of Raleigh, N.C. 
 The first reunion was under a covered tent, but the number of people -- and mosquitoes -- quickly compelled Mr. Carmon to build an air-conditioned barn, which serves as the reunion headquarters. 
 ''We started out with just a little concrete slab, but then the insects just ran us out,'' said Mr. Bronson, 64, who has since moved to Charlotte, N.C. ''It's grown more elaborate each year. It's almost all out of proportion now.''
 This year's get-together officially started Friday afternoon with an indoor picnic and culminated Saturday evening with dinner followed by hip-swaying to a band playing rhythm and blues. 
 Many retirees came from the Tidewater coast of Virginia, from northern Florida and towns throughout the Carolinas. Parked in Mr. Carmon's yard was the bus from Queens and scores of sedans. (Many retired drivers like big cars, thus the large number of Cadillacs.)
 The reunion was remarkable not only for its size, but for the cohesion of the retirees, who repeatedly invoked a sense of family. 
 ''It was one of the few workplaces where we really did bond, in our friendships,'' said Aletha Ashby, 55, of Chesapeake, Va., who was a clerk and typist for the bus system from 1971 to 1999. She brought her 75-year-old mother and 16-year-old daughter to the reunion.
 Jasper L. Adams of Manhattan, who at 83 was one of the oldest retirees in attendance, is an Army veteran, a great-great-grandfather and still socially active. But he said his work as a bus driver, from 1954 to 1981, gave him a community for life. 
 ''I wanted to make it before I croak,'' Mr. Adams declared.
 The retirees are not a cross section of the transit work force. Almost all are black, and they worked for the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority, also called Mabstoa, which the Legislature created in 1962 to take over the routes operated by the bankrupt Fifth Avenue Coach Company. 
 Mabstoa was a publicly chartered company, separate from the Transit Authority, which ran the buses in the other three boroughs. Mabstoa, still legally distinct, is now for all practical purposes a part of New York City Transit. 
 While both agencies became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968, retirees at the reunion proudly wore ''Mabstoa Annual Reunion'' T-shirts and Mabstoa baseball caps with slogans like ''The Bus Stops Here.''
 Most retirees were either born in the South and became part of the great northward migration of blacks after World War II, or had parents who moved to the North as adults. They were among Mabstoa's first black employees.
 The sense of unity among the retirees is one legacy of their role as a vanguard in the civil rights era.
 Roosevelt Allen, 67, of Queens, who was the first black elected union chairman at a Mabstoa bus depot -- the Kingsbridge Depot in the Bronx -- recalled that when he started work in 1967, some Irish-American drivers refused to train him.
 ''I was working under an Irishman,'' he said. ''I was his vice chairman. He would only cater to the Irish from the old country. This alienated the young American whites, and they decided to vote for me instead of him. Without the young whites -- the young Irish -- I would not have been elected.''
 Whether because of discrimination or other reasons, black drivers were rarely promoted to dispatcher or superintendent, and maintenance workers and mechanics rarely became foremen.
 ''That was one of our goals, to make sure that people were trained or equipped for these positions,'' said Mr. Allen, who retired in 2000.
 Deborah D. Jacox, 53, who divides her time between New York and Virginia Beach, was a pioneer of another sort. In 1979, she became one of a handful of female bus drivers in Mabstoa. For years, she wore a man's uniform because the agency had not bothered to design one for women. ''If I had a penny for every time a rider looked at me and said, 'A woman?''' she said, ''I'd be rich.''
 Beyond sexist comments, Ms. Jacox said, ''I've been assaulted, had my transfers snatched, been hit in the face, cut on the arm and called everything you could think of.'' 
 On Sept. 11, 2001, Ms. Jacox was driving an M1 bus near Battery Park when she saw one of the planes hit the World Trade Center. She kept driving. 
 Stories like hers were a mainstay of the reunion, along with updates on health. Suffering from back and leg pain, Ms. Jacox retired on disability in 2003. She receives Social Security benefits and uses a cane. 
 ''I can't step on the bus, never mind drive it,'' she said. 
 For many of these retirees, a return to the South was particularly poignant, because, they said, they had been driven north by a lack of economic opportunity and by racial discrimination. Now, family roots and a lower cost of living have brought them back.
 Mr. Carmon, 69, the host of the reunion, had a ninth-grade education and a mother who needed help when he moved to New York in 1957. 
 He returned home after he retired in 1989. ''This is my home,'' he said. ''I went up there to work.'' 
 Mr. Bowles, 73, the chairman of the reunion, said his greatest challenge was to keep the event going. ''We haven't had a year yet that was free of death,'' he said, adding that he was worried about the new retirees. 
 ''They're not as interested in these kinds of social events,'' he said. ''But where else can you get a picnic, two breakfasts and a dinner banquet, all for $65?''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 1 about a reunion of retired New York City bus drivers in Rocky Mount, N.C., misstated the location of the Kingsbridge Depot. It is in Manhattan, not the Bronx, although its buses run there almost exclusively.

HEADLINE: The Mexican Evolution

BYLINE: By Matthew Dowd. 
Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign, is the senior adviser to the Republican National Committee.

DATELINE: Austin, Tex. 

 BODY:
WITH nearly six million Mexicans living illegally in the United States, some Americans, particularly those in border states, are greatly worried about the costs of illegal immigration and have demanded that more be done to stem it. Modern-day ''minutemen'' patrol the border. Voters pass measures limiting the rights of illegal immigrants, and senators debate legislation to establish guest-worker programs. Certain elected officials and pundits focus on the perils of illegal immigration to score political points. 
 But chances are that there will be a substantial decrease in illegal immigration from Mexico in the next 20 years, and it won't be because of civilian border patrols, laws being passed, pronouncements by politicians, or as some would like, ''building a wall on the border.'' Instead, the cause will be demographic trends within Mexico itself, trends that have been largely ignored in the debate over immigration. 
Mexico's population growth rate has dropped by more than 50 percent during the last five decades, according to the United Nations. The annual growth rate has declined from approximately 3 percent in 1960 to 1.3 percent today. And it is expected to continue to fall in the first decades of the 21st century; by 2050, the United Nations predicts, the rate will be negative. The fertility rate in Mexico has had a corresponding significant drop, from 6.9 children per woman in 1955 to 2.5 today. 
 The population growth rate of Mexico is now only slightly higher than that of Canada, where recent data shows it to be 1 percent. Twenty-five years ago, Mexico had a growth rate more than twice that of Canada. 
 So what is the significance of all this? The aging of the population in Mexico coupled with Mexico's economic expansion mean that jobs in Mexico will be more plentiful, thereby prompting fewer young people to come to the United States in search of work. Studies have shown that as the population growth rate in countries worldwide slows, migration drops. This is especially true for an expanding economy like Mexico -- in one telling statistic, youth unemployment there dropped to 4.1 percent in 2001 from 9.6 percent in 1995. 
 A recent Pew Hispanic Center study highlights some of the change in immigration to the United States from the south. Pew predicts that the share of first-generation immigrants in the total Hispanic population in the United States will drop from about 40 percent in 2000 to closer to a third by 2020. Thus first-generation immigrants will decline by almost 20 percent as a share of the total Hispanic population in the United States.
 If the trend continues, it could be that we've already seen the high-water mark of illegal Mexican immigration -- put simply, the issue may be resolving itself.
 What would be the practical effect of all this? It suggests that any long-term project to close off the United States-Mexico border may use up money that could be more useful elsewhere. What's more, businesses that depend on a steady supply of low-paid illegal immigrants to keep costs down -- restaurants, farms, construction companies -- will most likely need to adapt by increasing salaries and benefits so they can attract legal immigrants or citizens as workers. 
 And as these trends become more apparent to the public, politicians running on an anti-Mexican-immigrant platform will be seen as out of step. While these politicians may seem successful in the short term, by the next decade the facts will definitely get in their way. 
 Does the United States need to continue to worry about border security and terrorism? Absolutely. Do we as a society need to figure out how to handle illegal immigrants and their families already living and working in the United States? Of course. 
 But legislators and government agencies should spend more time and resources addressing the problems of immigrants already here and our direct security needs, and much less time on prescriptive laws aimed at stemming illegal immigration from Mexico. We should be aware of the historic transformations occurring in Mexican society so that we aren't fighting a war that is already ending.

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Will Resume Uranium Enrichment, Jeopardizing Nuclear Talks With Europe

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and ALAN COWELL; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran for this article, and Alan Cowell from London.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, July 31 

 BODY:
Iran said Sunday that it would resume activities at one of its nuclear sites, but said it would keep its freeze on a more advanced process needed to make fuel or weapons.
 The European Union, which has been seeking to negotiate an exit to the Iranian nuclear impasse, responded by saying Iran would jeopardize future talks if it carried through on its threat, risking a significant worsening of the dispute over its nuclear facilities.
Hamidreza Assefi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Iran planned to tell the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in a letter of its decision to restart work at the Uranium Conversion Facility in Isfahan.
 The Iranian news agency quoted Mr. Assefi as saying Iran had taken the step because the European Union had failed to meet a deadline to produce new proposals to end the impasse. 
 The European Union denies that it agreed to a Sunday deadline and said in a statement issued by the British Foreign Office on Sunday that it would give ''full and detailed proposals'' to Iran in a week. The proposals are expected to include economic incentives intended to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear activities.
 Some experts said the Iranian threat was largely symbolic because it related to producing uranium gas rather than taking the next step of enriching the gas to turn it into fuel for reactors or weapons.
 Under international pressure, Iran suspended its nuclear programs in November 2004 but has frequently threatened to restart them, insisting that it has a sovereign right to do so. The United States believes Iran wants to build nuclear weapons but Iran says its programs are for civilian purposes. Since last November, Iran and the European Union -- represented by Britain, France and Germany -- have been negotiating over Iran's demands for an independent nuclear program. 
 The British statement said that if Iran resumed nuclear activities, it would be taking an ''unnecessary and damaging'' step that would make negotiations ''very difficult to continue.'' In that case, the statement said, the European Union would take the issue to the International Atomic Energy in Vienna. 
 In Tehran, Mr. Assefi said, ''We were waiting for the Europeans to offer us their proposal.''
 The European negotiators had said they plan to offer Iran a package of economic, political, security, and technological incentives by Monday. But Iran has warned that no incentive could persuade it to quit its uranium enrichment program.
 The Uranium Conversion Facility turns uranium ore, known as yellowcake, into gas. The gas can later be fed into centrifuges and enriched to be used as fuel in nuclear plants or, if highly enriched, in nuclear weapons. Iran said operations at its nuclear site in Natanz, where the centrifuges are kept, would remain suspended.
 The head of Iran's negotiating team, Hassan Rowhani, in a progress report on Sunday to President Mohammad Khatami, said he believed the Europeans were planning to delay offering their final proposal in order to see what the policies of the incoming president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, would be. Mr. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to take office on Aug. 6.
 Mr. Assefi said the decision to restart work at Isfahan was final and its activities would resume under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, but it was not clear if the agency had agreed to that step.
 ''We do not want to do any work without the supervision of agency,'' Mr. Assefi said. The agency's seals would be removed in the presence of the agency's inspectors, who are currently in Iran, he added.
 Mr. Assefi said Iran had no interest in interrupting its negotiations with Europe, ''but we can no longer postpone our people's demand for peaceful use of nuclear technology.''

HEADLINE: Triumph of the Machine

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The campaign for Social Security privatization has degenerated into farce. The ''global war on terrorism'' has been downgraded to the ''global struggle against violent extremism'' (pronounced gee-save), which is just embarrassing. Baghdad is a nightmare, Basra is a militia-run theocracy, and officials are talking about withdrawing troops from Iraq next year (just in time for the U.S. midterm elections).
 On the other hand, the administration is crowing about its success in passing the long-stalled energy bill, the highway bill and Cafta, the free-trade agreement with Central America. So is the Bush agenda stalled, or is it progressing? 
The answer is that the administration is getting nowhere on its grand policy agenda. But it never took policy, as opposed to politics, very seriously anyway. The agenda it has always taken with utmost seriousness -- consolidating one-party rule, and rewarding its friends -- is moving forward quite nicely.
 One of President Bush's great political talents is his ability to convince people who do care passionately about policy that he is one of them. Foreign-policy neoconservatives believe he shares their vision of a world transformed by American power. Economic conservatives believe he shares their dedication to dismantling the welfare state.
 But a serious effort either to transform the world or to dismantle the welfare state would require sacrifices Mr. Bush hasn't been willing to make. 
 On the foreign policy front, the ''Bush doctrine'' of pre-emption and unilateralism sounded very impressive at first. But Mr. Bush's tough-guy attitude wasn't matched by his willingness to commit resources. His administration sought global dominance on the cheap, with an undermanned, underplanned invasion of Iraq that has, indeed, transformed the balance of power in the Middle East -- in favor of Iran.
 On the domestic policy front, talk of an ''ownership society'' appealed to conservatives who dreamed of rolling back the New Deal. But Mr. Bush has expanded, not reduced, middle-class entitlements. Only the poor and powerless have faced cuts. (I don't think those middle-class entitlements should be cut. But Mr. Bush claims to be against big government.) 
 Social Security privatization was to the crusade against the welfare state what the invasion of Iraq was to G-Save: an attempt to achieve radical goals on the cheap. Rather than openly propose reductions in entitlement spending, the administration tried to sell a phaseout of traditional Social Security benefits in return for the magic of investing. But the public didn't buy it.
 So what about those legislative successes? Roy Blunt, the House Republican whip, called the victories ''verification that this is a governing party.'' But governing means more than handing out goodies.
 Let's start with the energy bill. Even the bill's supporters barely pretend that it will do anything to reduce America's dependence on imported oil. It's simply an exercise in corporate welfare, full of subsidies and targeted tax breaks. 
 Then there's the pork-stuffed highway bill. I guess we'll have to stop making fun of Japanese public works spending: now America, too, is building bridges to islands that have almost no inhabitants, but lie in the districts of influential legislators.
 Finally, Cafta contains ''free trade'' in its title, but that's misleading. The administration rammed the bill through the House by, among other things, promising to limit imports of clothing from China; over all, the effect may well be to reduce, not increase, international trade. But pharmaceutical companies got measures that protect and extend their monopoly rights in Central America.
 These bills don't have anything to do with governing, if governing means trying to achieve actual policy goals like energy independence or expanded trade. They're just machine politics at work, favors granted in return for favors received. 
 In fact, you can argue that the administration does a bad job at governing in part because its highest priority is always to reward its friends. Most notably, the Iraq venture would have had a better chance of succeeding if cronyism and corruption hadn't undermined reconstruction.
 Still, Republicans should feel good. Those legislative successes show that the political machine can still deliver the goods, even at a time when a majority of Americans disapprove of Mr. Bush's leadership and believe that his administration deliberately misled us into war.

HEADLINE: Constitutional Countdown in Iraq 

 BODY:
Zalmay Khalilzad, America's new ambassador to Baghdad, is off to a refreshingly candid start, frankly acknowledging that unless Iraq's constitution writers start compromising, the country risks sliding toward open civil war. To head off such a catastrophe, Mr. Khalilzad has publicly criticized Shiite and Kurdish politicians who seem far more interested in advancing their sectarian and separatist agendas than in promoting national unity. 
 Mr. Khalilzad speaks from experience, having helped guide a warlord-torn Afghanistan toward constitutional compromise and successful presidential elections. That is reason enough for Shiite and Kurdish leaders to heed his sound advice. They should also recognize that American troops are not in Iraq to underwrite the subordination of Iraqi women to clerical authority or to carve the country up into destabilizing ethnic and religious enclaves.
In recent days, there have been a few modest signs of progress. Repeated protests by Iraqi women, a temporary constitutional boycott by aggrieved Sunni Arabs and steady pressure from Washington seem to have brought a partial rollback of some of the most offensive provisions of an earlier constitutional draft. But it is not nearly enough. In the latest version, for example, family law would still be subordinated to clerical authority, with each family permitted to choose which religious sect's teachings governed their female members' lives. The new constitution should not be inventing new ways to entrench Iraq's religious divisions through different systems of law. The right solution is to maintain all women's access to the civil law in these matters, as has been the practice in Iraq since 1959. 
 The threat of ethnic and religious separatism is also unresolved and poses fundamental issues, for both Iraq and the future of America's military role there. The Sunni Arab west and north of Iraq is already a zone unto itself, racked by insurgency, patrolled by Americans and effectively beyond the reach of the central government. 
 Formalizing this split, as most Kurds and an increasing number of Shiites now advocate, would be a prescription for disaster. Nor is this any time to expand the borders of the Kurdish region at Sunni Arab expense. With almost all of Iraq's oil in Shiite and Kurdish regions, the Sunni rump would be left landlocked, seething and economically hopeless, a regional magnet for terrorists and a fount of instability along the borders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria. And as a no-go zone for the new Iraqi Army, it could also turn into a deadly quagmire for American troops. A unified Iraq is the only viable path to national reconstruction, regional stability and an honorable American exit.
 Washington's heavy pressure to settle all these issues by Aug. 15 -- two weeks from today -- isn't helpful. Arbitrary deadlines are less important than writing a constitution that defends the rights of all Iraqis and allows them to live together in peace.

PERSON: John Michael Montias

HEADLINE: John Montias, 76, Scholar Of Economics and of Art

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
John Michael Montias, an economist who became one of the foremost scholars on the painter Johannes Vermeer and a pioneer in the economics of art, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 76 and lived in New Haven.
 The cause was complications from melanoma, said his son, John-Luke Montias.
Part of the Annales school of economists and historians, Mr. Montias was among those who, in the early and mid-20th century, promoted a new form of history by replacing the examination of major leaders and events with the microstudy of ordinary people and occurrences. 
 Through the scrupulous analysis of common documents ranging from notes and letters to receipts and legal papers, Mr. Montias peeled back the layers in the life of Vermeer, one of his favorite artists -- and one of the world's most enigmatic. His work opened the door for a new genre of art history in which artists were analyzed in the context of their societal and economic surroundings and not merely their works.
 ''I think he was important for all of us,'' said Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann, the John Langeloth Loeb professor emeritus at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. ''When he started this in the 1960's and 70's, there was no one who approached the history of art from that point of view. His work was pioneering -- accurate, extremely convincing, with many novel insights. What was not considered to be relevant to the work of art in the past, we all have subsequently used.''
 Mr. Montias's research was a primary source for Tracy Chevalier's 2000 novel ''Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' about Vermeer's relationship with the model for his iconic work, and for the 2003 film adaptation.
 Mr. Montias began teaching at Yale University in the late 50's, where he specialized in the economic systems of the Soviet bloc during the 1960's and 70's and served as a consultant to high-ranking government officials. His analysis of the economies of Eastern European countries at times drew suspicion, perhaps never more so than during his visits to Czechoslovakia and Hungary from 1963 to 1965; he was shadowed and eventually expelled from Hungary on suspicion of espionage. But if his work was economics, his passion was art, particularly that of the 16th- and 17th-century Netherlands.
 ''I came to Vermeer 'sideways,''' he said in a 2003 interview for the Essential Vermeer Web site (www.essentialvermeer.20m.com), explaining the genesis of his second career. Having won a summer grant in 1975 to write a comparative study of Dutch art guilds, he traveled to Delft, where he discovered that no in-depth study of a guild existed.
 ''In the course of this research, I realized that, contrary to my expectations, previous scholarship on Vermeer's life had not exhausted the subject,'' he said. 
 And so began his quest to uncover the life of one of the world's most mysterious artists, with Mr. Montias unearthing and poring over 454 documents related to Vermeer and his family that lay, long undisturbed, in the archives of no fewer than 17 Dutch and Belgian cities. 
 In 1989 he published ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'' (Princeton University Press), in which he revealed secrets of Vermeer's life: that Vermeer's grandfather was a convicted counterfeiter; that his grandmother ran illegal lotteries; and that the artist himself fathered 13 children and died at the age of 43, destitute.
 Reviewing the book in The New York Times, the art critic John Russell wrote that Mr. Montias had previously ''proved that there is a great deal more to art history than shuffling slides in a library.''
 ''His new book does not crack the code of Vermeer's personality, let alone the code of his inner experience,'' the review continued. ''But as detective work, and as a portrait of an era, it ranks high.''
 In fact, Mr. Montias's midlife obsession had adolescent roots. Born on Oct. 3, 1928, in Paris, he was sent in 1940, alone and by ship, by his Jewish parents to the safety of the United States -- and an Episcopalian baptism -- just as the Germans were preparing to invade France. He boarded at the Nichols School in Buffalo, where as a 14-year-old volunteer in the small library of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, he came across Wilhelm Bode's gilt-edged folio volume of Rembrandt and was immediately captivated.
 Mr. Montias's curiosity resurfaced in 1954 when, as a Ph.D. candidate in the economics department at Columbia University, he considered writing his dissertation on the prices of Dutch paintings at auction. He failed to get financial support for his project, perhaps thought frivolous during the cold war.
 Things changed when Mr. Montias met Mr. Begemann in the mid-1960's, when they were both at Yale. A specialist in Dutch and Flemish art, Mr. Begemann gave Mr. Montias his first lessons in connoisseurship, and soon after he began to study the genre's history methodically. His first project in the field -- the 1975 summer grant -- required Mr. Montias, already a gifted linguist, not only to learn modern Dutch but also to read 17th-century manuscript sources in old Gothic script. 
 ''He decided to attack the archives in Delft, knowing that they had been scoured for information on Vermeer,'' recalled Otto Naumann, a Manhattan art dealer who studied under Mr. Montias. ''With the confidence that only a true genius can posses, he decided that he could do better, without first learning Dutch.'' 
 It took Mr. Montias one week to find an unpublished document that mentioned Vermeer and but another to decipher it, Mr. Naumann said.
 Mr. Montias published three more books about the 17th-century Dutch art market: ''Artists, Dealers, Consumers: On the Social World of Art'' (Hilversum: Verloren, 1994); ''Public and Private Spaces: Works of Art in 17th-Century Dutch Houses'' (Zwolle, 2000), with John Loughman; and ''Art at Auction in 17th-Century Amsterdam'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2003).
 In addition to his son, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Marie, of New Haven, and his mother, Giselle de la Maisoneuve, of Paris.

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
IT'S summertime, and odds are that at some point during your day you'll reach for a nice cold bottle of water. But before you do, you might want to consider the results of an experiment I conducted with some friends one summer evening last year. On the table were 10 bottles of water, several rows of glasses and some paper for recording our impressions. We were to evaluate samples from each bottle for appearance, odor, flavor, mouth, feel and aftertaste -- and our aim was to identify the interloper among the famous names. One of our bottles had been filled from the tap. Would we spot it?
 We worked our way through the samples, writing scores for each one. None of us could detect any odor, even when swilling water around in large wine glasses, but other differences between the waters were instantly apparent. Between sips, we cleansed our palates with wine. (It seemed only fair, since water serves the same function at a wine tasting.) 
The variation between waters was wide, yet the water from the tap did not stand out: only one of us correctly identified it. This simple experiment seemed to confirm that most people cannot tell the difference between tap water and bottled water. Yet they buy it anyway -- and in enormous quantities.
 In 2004, Americans, on average, drank 24 gallons of bottled water, making it second only to carbonated soft drinks in popularity. Furthermore, consumption of bottled water is growing more quickly than that of soft drinks and has more than doubled in the past decade. This year, Americans will spend around $9.8 billion on bottled water, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation. 
 Ounce for ounce, it costs more than gasoline, even at today's high gasoline prices; depending on the brand, it costs 250 to 10,000 times more than tap water. Globally, bottled water is now a $46 billion industry. Why has it become so popular?
 It cannot be the taste, since most people cannot tell the difference in a blind tasting. Much bottled water is, in any case, derived from municipal water supplies, though it is sometimes filtered, or has additional minerals added to it. 
 Nor is there any health or nutritional benefit to drinking bottled water over tap water. In one study, published in The Archives of Family Medicine, researchers compared bottled water with tap water from Cleveland, and found that nearly a quarter of the samples of bottled water had significantly higher levels of bacteria. The scientists concluded that ''use of bottled water on the assumption of purity can be misguided.'' Another study carried out at the University of Geneva found that bottled water was no better from a nutritional point of view than ordinary tap water.
 Admittedly, both kinds of water suffer from occasional contamination problems, but tap water is more stringently monitored and tightly regulated than bottled water. New York City tap water, for example, was tested 430,600 times during 2004 alone.
 What of the idea that drinking bottled water allows you to avoid the chemicals that are sometimes added to tap water? Alas, some bottled waters contain the same chemicals anyway -- and they are, in any case, unavoidable. 
 Researchers at the University of Texas found that showers and dishwashers liberate trace amounts of chemicals from municipal water supplies into the air. Squirting hot water through a nozzle, to produce a fine spray, increases the surface area of water in contact with the air, liberating dissolved substances in a process known as ''stripping.'' So if you want to avoid those chemicals for some reason, drinking bottled water is not enough. You will also have to wear a gas mask in the shower, and when unloading the dishwasher.
 Bottled water is undeniably more fashionable and portable than tap water. The practice of carrying a small bottle, pioneered by supermodels, has become commonplace. But despite its association with purity and cleanliness, bottled water is bad for the environment. It is shipped at vast expense from one part of the world to another, is then kept refrigerated before sale, and causes huge numbers of plastic bottles to go into landfills. 
 Of course, tap water is not so abundant in the developing world. And that is ultimately why I find the illogical enthusiasm for bottled water not simply peculiar, but distasteful. For those of us in the developed world, safe water is now so abundant that we can afford to shun the tap water under our noses, and drink bottled water instead: our choice of water has become a lifestyle option. For many people in the developing world, however, access to water remains a matter of life or death.
 More than 2.6 billion people, or more than 40 percent of the world's population, lack basic sanitation, and more than one billion people lack reliable access to safe drinking water. The World Health Organization estimates that 80 percent of all illness in the world is due to water-borne diseases, and that at any given time, around half of the people in the developing world are suffering from diseases associated with inadequate water or sanitation, which kill around five million people a year. 
 Widespread illness also makes countries less productive, more dependent on outside aid, and less able to lift themselves out of poverty. One of the main reasons girls do not go to school in many parts of the developing world is that they have to spend so much time fetching water from distant wells.
 Clean water could be provided to everyone on earth for an outlay of $1.7 billion a year beyond current spending on water projects, according to the International Water Management Institute. Improving sanitation, which is just as important, would cost a further $9.3 billion per year. This is less than a quarter of global annual spending on bottled water.
 I have no objections to people drinking bottled water in the developing world; it is often the only safe supply. But it would surely be better if they had access to safe tap water instead. The logical response, for those of us in the developed world, is to stop spending money on bottled water and to give the money to water charities.
 If you don't believe me about the taste, then set up a tasting, and see if you really can tell the difference. A water tasting is fun, and you may be surprised by the results. There is no danger of a hangover. But you may well conclude, as I have, that bottled water has an unacceptably bitter taste.

To the Editor:
 Re ''French Family Values,'' by Paul Krugman (column, July 29):
 As an 88-year-old French-American, I was happily surprised to see an Op-Ed page article finding something to admire in the French way of life!
 Still, Paul Krugman missed important differences between the American and French economic situations: French education is free from kindergarten to universities and higher special schools. My young relatives are Ph.D.'s at the cost of a yearly $500 registration fee and the price of books.
 Social security and health insurance cover the entire family from birth to death. The long vacations created a tourism business that did not exist 40 years ago, attracting people from all over Europe who travel in comfortable high-speed trains at reasonable cost.
 All these benefits are paid with high taxation, but no one complains since it is really based on income rather than on no tax for the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Giants May Have Found Barber's Future Backup

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 31 

 BODY:
Tiki Barber has seen much in the Giants' futile search for a reliable backup for him at running back. The team has all but installed a revolving door.
 In his eight seasons, Barber has lived through the on-again-off-again Ron Dayne experiments, which finally ended in the off-season. And he has seen a trail of players, like Dorsey Levens, Delvin Joyce and Joe Montgomery, come and go. 
But Barber has seen nothing like the Giants' newest addition, the fourth-round draft pick Brandon Jacobs. At 6 feet 4 inches and 265 pounds, he can rest his chin on top of Barber's head.
 ''He is a monster of a man,'' said Barber, who is generously listed at 5-10 to go with his 200 pounds.
 During an early blocking drill here at training camp, with just the running backs, they lined up across from each other and Jacobs nearly lifted Barber off the ground.
 ''You like that?'' Barber said, laughing. ''I told him I was going to make him a star.''
 Jacobs would fit in seamlessly along the defensive line, a thought many coaches have entertained, to no avail, during his career. He has stubbornly stuck with the idea of being a running back, becoming the latest eye-popping example of the inflation of the skill-position player.
 Minnesota's Daunte Culpepper became the N.F.L.'s first linebacker-sized quarterback. Now the Giants have a defensive-end-sized tailback.
 ''He's the type of running back, when you're playing Madden football and you can create your own back, that's the guy that you want to have,'' running back Mike Cloud said, referring to the video games that the television analyst and former coach John Madden helped develop. ''You can say, 'I want him this tall and to have this much strength and speed.' That's what you do in those games. He's brought it to life.''
 Jacobs's college career carried him from junior college to Auburn to Southern Illinois. He spent two years at Coffeyville Community College in Kansas, rushing for a total of 3,248 yards and 37 touchdowns and earning junior college all-American honors in 2002.
 At Auburn in 2003, he shared backfield time with Ronnie Brown and Carnell Williams, who were selected second and fifth over all in the draft in April. Jacobs then transferred to Southern Illinois, where he rushed for 922 yards and 19 touchdowns last season.
 Along the way, coaches have broached the topic of changing his position. At Auburn, he tried tight end and linebacker when he realized he was not the top running back.
 ''None of it worked,'' he said. ''None of it was me. I tried, but I had to do what was best for me.''
 He parlayed that into a chance with the Giants, a team with an annual vacancy for a backup running back.
 Barber said he thought Cloud would fill the role admirably this year and that Jacobs and Derrick Ward, a second-year player, represented the future. In recent seasons, it has been far too easy for Giants coaches to leave Barber on the field for nearly every play. He has been increasingly productive; he rushed for a career-high and franchise-record 1,518 yards last season, despite playing behind a leaky offensive line. He is the franchise leader in rushing yards (6,927) and receptions (474 catches).
 Despite his age, 30, and his high-mileage body, Barber says he believes he has several seasons of success ahead.
 ''I think it's a myth that's being disproved as the years go on by, guys like myself and Curtis Martin and Corey Dillon who's 30 as well,'' Barber said. ''It's all a function of how much work you put in, how you take care of your body, how you keep yourself healthy.
 ''I've been able to do that the last few years. As long as you still have the desire, you can play this game as long as you want. Eventually you'll slow down.''
 But Barber is eager for a reliable backup. He said he would be happy to trot to the sideline more, particularly on short-yardage downs. He wants younger, fresher legs to earn those yards.
 Cloud, also 30, is not any younger but he is fresher. In his six N.F.L. seasons, he has 169 carries; Barber had 322 last season.
 But the 5-10, 205-pound Cloud knows he is seeing the future in Jacobs.
 ''I don't know too many guys in the league who are going to want to tackle a guy who's that big and can run that fast,'' Cloud said. ''They might get him one or two times but he's going to be dishing out a lot of punishment.''
 The question for Jacobs is how he will do against an N.F.L. defense. His size also gives defenders more surface area to tackle. He inherited Dayne's No. 27 jersey, but unlike Dayne, he said he was not bothered by the idea of starting out as a short-yardage back.
 ''I'm just practicing and doing my best for whatever they do decide to use me for,'' Jacobs said. ''That's what I want to get done first is short yardage. I'm a big back and big backs are used for that. I'll be whatever back they want.''
 Useful would be a good start.

EXTRA POINTS
 Giants second-round draft pick Corey Webster, a cornerback out of Louisiana State, has still not signed. Receiver Plaxico Burress said the knee he injured Saturday was stiff when he woke up Sunday morning, but he participated in Sunday's practices with no limitations.

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's positive comments about French workers' tradeoffs between income and family time and benefits are well put.
 While Americans would be wise to learn from the French in the ways he outlined, France could definitely learn a few things from the United States as well.
 French unemployment is very high partly because it is extremely difficult to lay off workers and because generous unemployment benefits discourage some from seeking work. 
 Failing French entrepreneurs are hounded by a legal system that presupposes foul play in all bankruptcies, raising significant barriers to the creation of new enterprises and jobs.
 For these aspects at least, incorporating elements of American flexibility could certainly help spark growth in France's economy. We all have something to learn from each other.

HEADLINE: Chinese Company Ponders Raising Its Bid for Unocal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The board of Cnooc, the Chinese oil company, is planning to decide early this week whether to raise its bid for Unocal or abandon its takeover effort, executives close to the company said over the weekend. 
 Several members of Cnooc's board and management have expressed doubts in recent days about the wisdom of continuing to pursue the bid in the face of mounting opposition in Washington, but it remained unclear yesterday which way the board would vote.
If Cnooc does decide to raise its bid, the company and its advisers have determined that to win approval from Unocal's board, the bid would have to go to about $72 a share, from the current $67 a share. 
 Unocal has already accepted an offer from Chevron worth about $17 billion, or $64 a share, dismissing Cnooc's higher offer as too politically risky. 
 Unocal and Cnooc were close to an agreement earlier this month, according to filings made last week by Unocal. Unocal's board was willing to accept the ''considerably greater'' risk of Cnooc's offer compared with Chevron's bid if Cnooc raised its offer, according to the filings. Talks broke down when Cnooc refused to raise its bid further and Chevron came up with an offer that was larger than its first proposal, originally valued at $16.8 billion.
 The timing of Cnooc's decision is being driven, in part, by a vote by Unocal's shareholders scheduled for Aug. 10. If Chevron adjusts its bid anytime after this Thursday, then that date would change. Cnooc could raise its offer and play a high-stakes game of brinkmanship, forcing Chevron to change its bid and resetting the clock on a vote. 
 But Cnooc is sensitive about raising its bid beyond $70 because it worries that such a high offer would give more ammunition to politicians in Washington who say its efforts are being driven by national interests and not by economics.
 For more than a month, the fate of Unocal has been a focal point of trade relations between the United States and China. Cnooc's proposal to buy an American company with roots dating to 1890 is part of China's increasingly visible efforts to build global oil and gas companies and compete with other oil importers, including the United States, to secure its energy supplies.
 Foreigners seeking to buy American companies with assets that raise national security concerns are subject to the government's scrutiny. Cnooc, 70 percent owned by the government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corporation, needs the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a multiagency government group headed by the secretary of the treasury. That review, which can last as long as 90 days, ultimately gives the president the option to block a takeover. Usually, however, Cfius designates specific assets that cannot be part of the transaction. 
 A draft agreement between Cnooc and Unocal, which was made public as part of Unocal's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, shows that Cnooc was ready to sell all of Unocal's domestic assets if Cfius required it to do so. 
 That willingness to appease regulators may have come too late to deflect stiff political opposition in Washington. This week, Congress formally stepped in by proposing a four-month study of how China's energy demands affect the United States, in light of Cnooc's bid. The proposal was specifically intended to stall Cnooc by lengthening the review process. 
 The assets that Cnooc is proposing to spin off are Unocal's production assets in the United States, which are small compared with most of its rivals and mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico. The United States accounts for a third of Unocal's oil and gas reserves. Outside the United States, the company does business mostly in Asia, where it produces mostly natural gas in Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Azerbaijan.

HEADLINE: Salut! The French Way, and Ours

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right that contemporary French and American societies are about different trade-offs between work and family.
 Yet as a French scholar in the United States, I am slightly amused by his wide-eyed idealization of the French choice. 
 The trade-off is far from perfect, even beyond the obvious high unemployment: unequal access to education, lack of investment in the future, and racial discrimination are also daily realities in France. 
 And the divisive referendum on the European constitution revealed deep worries that such a trade-off would no longer be possible in a globalized, Europeanized world.
 Still, Mr. Krugman must be lauded for breaking away from the overwhelming French-bashing tone of the American media and for daring to say that the United States might have a thing or two to learn from France.

HEADLINE: Making Immigration Work

 BODY:
For five years, President Bush has said that he really wants to reform immigration, but when the Senate finally took up the issue last week, the White House went missing. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao backed out of the hearing at the last minute, a gap that was noted with understandable irritation by Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
 With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, immigration is too big for the White House to ignore. If there is debate within the Bush administration about where immigration reform should go, there are several proposals that deserve consideration. 
 The best comprehensive bill so far comes from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, among others. The bill finds ways for the nation to deal with border security, a large underground society and the need for more unskilled labor in this country. It would set up a guest worker program and begin the process of making the illegal immigrants legal, by making participants pay back taxes and fines, then go to the end of the line to get a green card.
 Two Republican senators, Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas, propose drastically beefing up border patrol. This would be a good thing if the proposal also offered a more realistic solution to the illegal population. It does not. Those in the country illegally would have to return home to apply for a green card -- an invitation, it would seem, for most of them to stay hidden.
 As Washington circles this tough issue, problems with immigration only grow. Almost 500,000 immigrants a year pour over the border to take backbreaking unskilled jobs that Americans don't want. The United States offers about one legal visa for every 100 workers who sneak into the country. But without that work force -- over 4 percent of the country's workers by some estimates -- the economy would sour. So we are left with an inhumane system, with jobs available to whoever can break into the country to get them.
 Tamar Jacoby of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research summed up the goal at the Senate hearing last week: ''to remain a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.'' Mr. Specter has finally started the hard work required to reach that goal. Now the White House needs to put in some thought and muscle as well.

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Pastime Is Out of Bounds in Danbury

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., July 28 

 BODY:
Six weeks after more than 1,000 immigrants marched down Main Street to demand respect from the mayor, he is taking steps to stop their sometimes raucous volleyball games, which officials say are occasions for illegal enterprise.
 The evening games, a passion among Danbury's growing population of Ecuadorean immigrants, sometimes draw more than 100 people to backyards in otherwise quiet residential neighborhoods. After a nighttime sweep by code enforcement officers on July 23, city workers issued cease-and-desist orders for seven properties.
''What we shut down was seven illegal businesses that happened to have volleyball as their draw for selling food and alcohol,'' Sean P. Hearty, the city's permit officer, said of the backyard games. 
 Mr. Hearty and other city officials said they also found overcrowded apartments, cars parked illegally on neighboring yards and fire and building code violations, including nets rising more than 20 feet over backyard fences -- to keep the volleyball in the yard -- and extension cords buried below ground to power lights for night games.
 While the sweeps that Saturday night were a first, they reflected persistent tension in a city that has become a battleground in the national debate over illegal immigration in smaller cities and suburbs. 
 In April, Mayor Mark D. Boughton asked the state to seek federal permission to deputize state police officers to enforce federal immigration laws in the city. On June 12, a coalition of Ecuadorean immigrants led a mile-long march on a stretch of Main Street whose storefronts, once empty, have been transformed with new Hispanic and Brazilian businesses. 
 The goal, march organizers said, was to demand respect for the way immigrants have helped revitalize the downtown area. Many immigrant workers live in the city, often in houses that have been converted into apartments, and work during the day in construction jobs in the suburbs of Fairfield County.
 The week before the march, Leonard C. Boyle, commissioner of the State Department of Public Safety, denied the mayor's request to deputize the state police, saying the city and state had other means of enforcement.
 Even before Mr. Boyle rejected the request, Mayor Boughton said the city would find other ways to deal with overcrowded housing, day laborers looking for work in the streets and, in particular, the volleyball games that spill across neighborhoods and draw complaints.
 Critics, including some marchers, have said Mr. Boughton is biased against immigrants and using the issue for political gain. In an interview on Thursday at City Hall, the mayor, a Republican who announced his candidacy for a third term on July 25, rejected the claims and said he wanted to make sure ''the issue doesn't get driven down to a racial issue.''
 As he has in the past, he blamed a ''failed federal policy'' that leaves local officials with few tools to deal with the pressures of immigration at the neighborhood level. Mr. Boughton said he had spoken with officials in other states, including California and New York, and that he hoped to create a coalition of mayors who would work toward immigration reform.
 For now, Danbury has responded with stricter code enforcement.
 The city's Common Council is considering adopting an ordinance that would give the police greater power to control ''repetitive outdoor activities.''
 The mayor said the volleyball sweeps were ''an interim measure'' conducted by a new unified neighborhood inspection team he had formed.
 Working with Danbury police officers, the team, which includes enforcement officers from the city's fire, building, zoning and health and housing divisions, cited seven private homes and apartment houses. City officials said they visited properties during the games, identified themselves, asked homeowners if they could enter the properties, then spoke casually with people who, for example, told them they had paid 50 cents for a beer and $5 for a plate of chicken or pork.
 ''We're not targeting a certain demographic,'' said Timothy J. Bunting, the assistant zoning enforcement officer. ''We're targeting problem areas.''
 Mr. Hearty, the permit officer, said no arrests were made, nor were fines issued. City officials have said in the past that backyard volleyball games have involved gambling and drugs, though no such activities were cited in the recent sweep. 
 ''Our whole thing was, 'Did you realize this was a violation?''' Mr. Hearty said. ''They were so misinformed that they came in the next day and asked me for an alcohol license.'' 
 One property cited belongs to Efrain Romero, an Ecuadorean immigrant who works in pool construction during the day. In the evening, his large lot is often filled with young men drinking beer and playing volleyball on two courts, with nets and balls ordered from Ecuador. 
 In an interview in May, Mr. Romero said most of the men were probably illegal immigrants, but that he was legal. He said his house was divided into four apartment units and that he had done some of the construction himself.
 On July 23, the city cited him for ''change of site plan without approval,'' for having an unregistered truck stored illegally, for having fencing that is too high and for selling food and liquor on the property during volleyball games.
 In a telephone interview after the sweep, Mr. Romero said he told a city official he was not selling food or alcohol.
 ''He said I can play volleyball a little bit, but don't make it too noisy and don't sell any stuff,'' he said. ''I told him I used to sell juice. We're not going to do it no more.''
 His next-door neighbor, Richard Erhardt, said he was relieved that the city had cited the property. 
 Mr. Erhardt, who is 71 and lives with his ailing wife, said that they have not sat on their sun porch in three years because of the volleyball games and that the balls often bounced against their house.
 ''If it snows this deep, they shovel off the snow and they're out there playing volleyball,'' he said. ''Rain, thunder and lightning, they're playing volleyball -- until this weekend.''

HEADLINE: As Their Use Soars, Heart Implants Raise Questions 

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
A little-known heart device, an implantable defibrillator, has been under a spotlight after the recent disclosure that a producer, the Guidant Corporation, did not tell doctors for years that one of its models had a defect that could render it useless. But well before that, medical experts had been increasingly debating other aspects of the device, namely its benefits and its costs.
 No one disputes that many heart patients need a defibrillator, a device that sends out an electrical jolt to interrupt a chaotic heart rhythm that can cause sudden cardiac arrest, which is often fatal. But some doctors say the units, which are fast becoming one of the most costly medical devices in use today, are being implanted in many other patients who may not need them because they are either too well or too sick.
 Both the medical and financial consequences of that debate have been growing as use of the device has soared. Last year, an estimated 135,000 devices were implanted in patients in the United States alone, a near tripling of the number in 2000. Meanwhile, the three major device producers, Guidant, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, have reaped a financial bonanza as domestic sales rose during that same period to $3.5 billion, from $1.3 billion, according to Harris Nesbitt, an investment firm. 
 The overuse or inappropriate use of medical treatments is a familiar theme. But defibrillators pose unique issues because they are increasingly being used as a standard piece of safety equipment, like an air bag in an automobile, in an ever-growing number of heart patients whose individual need for the device is not clear. Defibrillator prices are also like those found on a new car, ranging from about $20,000 to $35,000 each.
 ''They are expensive and in theory almost anyone in the country could benefit,'' said Dr. Mark Hlatky, a professor of health research and policy at Stanford University School of Medicine. ''So where do you draw the line?''
 The dilemma reflects a growing medical conundrum. Defibrillators were first used in the 1980's only in patients who had survived an episode of sudden cardiac arrest. But since then, studies largely funded by the industry have resulted in a steady expansion of the device's use to ever-broader pools of heart patients with varying degrees of risk of cardiac arrest.
 The problem, however, is that medical researchers have not figured out how to tell which patients in these broader groups are at high risk and which ones are at low risk. The result: they all qualify for a unit. 
 The problem is no small matter. Experts agree that many, if not the majority, of defibrillator candidates are at a low risk of cardiac arrest. ''We can identify groups at risk, but we cannot really identify the individuals in those groups who are at higher risk,'' said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a cardiology professor at Indiana University School of Medicine.
 Meanwhile, physicians like Dr. Zipes and health policy experts say that manufacturers have used a variety of strategies to increase profits by keeping device prices high. For example, rather than offering a low-cost unit that does the basic job of stopping a bad heart rhythm, defibrillator makers are engaged in a sort of medical arms race in which producers turn over models by adding new features like different ways to measure heart rhythms. Some of these additions are valuable, while others are just ''bells and whistles,'' experts say.
 ''These companies don't compete on price, they compete on features,'' Dr. Hlatky said.
 Doctors and patients also have no reason not to go for a top of the line model, said experts like Dr. Hlatky. Many physicians acknowledge that they do not consider product prices when deciding which model of defibrillator is best for their patient. And patients have little reason to care about cost because insurers like Medicare cover the cost of an implant procedure, which includes the device, regardless of its cost.
 As in other areas of medicine, there have been claims that device makers retain the loyalty of physicians by providing them with consulting arrangements and other financial incentives. The companies insist that they have done nothing wrong and that their prices are fair. They also say they are responding to doctors' suggestions by producing the devices they want.
 In January, both the financial and public policy stakes involving defibrillators were heightened when Medicare dramatically expanded the types of heart patients who qualify to receive a unit. The agency's ruling means that hundreds of thousands of heart patients each year will likely get a unit, compared with 135,000 last year.
 The Medicare decision followed a clinical trial, sponsored by Medtronic and a division of the National Institutes of Health, which showed that patients with heart failure who got both a defibrillator and heart drugs had a 7 percent higher survival rate than patients who were treated with just drugs. Heart failure is a progressive weakening of the heart caused by coronary disease or other factors.
 However, that study also raised the troubling possibility that the sickest heart patients might not be helped by a defibrillator and might even be harmed if a device, as happens, misreads a rhythm and emits an unneeded shock. That possibility is currently just a theory, but Dr. Gust H. Bardy, who led the study, said he hoped to further research the issue. 
 A defibrillator is implanted under the skin near the collarbone in a procedure that takes about an hour. The device, which is about the size of a pager, sends out an electrical charge when it senses a chaotic heart rhythm known as a ventricular fibrillation. That rhythm can cause sudden cardiac arrest by effectively shutting off blood flow from the heart.
 Most defibrillators can also treat an abnormally fast heart rhythm, known as ventricular tachycardia, which can deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. No one is suggesting that anyone be denied a device without better ways of selecting which patients face little risk. And there are many heart patients who could benefit from a defibrillator who have not gotten one.
 But the steady broadening of the device's use -- from high-risk groups like patients who survived a cardiac arrest to those at relatively lower risk like heart attack patients or patients with heart failure -- has also led to a situation where more patients are receiving devices to find the one who will benefit. ''We have gone from six, to seven, to eight, to ten, to twelve people'' needing to have device implanted to save one patient's life, said Dr. Zipes of Indiana University. 
 In just two years, defibrillator-related costs to both Medicare and private insurers are expected to reach $10 billion, with Medicare covering about a half of that expense, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, an investment firm. That would make defibrillators one of Medicare's biggest surgery-related costs.
 With costs soaring, there is an increased urgency to find a way of both discriminating between high-risk patients and low-risk ones and hold down, or even reduce, the price of a device. 
 In an unusual move, Medicare is requiring doctors and hospitals to submit detailed information about both the health condition of patients with defibrillators and the type of device they received. Agency officials say the goal is to create a database that will make sure the right patients are getting units as well as potentially serve as a way of identifying the types of patients who do not need them. 
 ''We want to see if we can better define who is not benefiting so that in the future we may be able to change the criteria,'' Dr. Steve Phurrough, the director of the coverage and analysis group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a recent interview.
 Medicare officials are also reviewing one method of assessing a patient's risk of cardiac arrest using a kind of stress test. Two heart device makers, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, said they were conducting clinical trials to look at this same method as well as other markers that might help better detect patient risk. Guidant declined to respond to written questions. 
 For now, however, experts have not agreed on a method. ''It is an exciting area potentially, but there may be a limit to what we can do,'' said Dr. Michael Domanski, the head of the clinical trial group at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health.
 The price of a defibrillator, like other medical devices, follows its own unique economics, experts say. For example, while the prices of other high-technology devices like computers and digital cameras have plunged, the price of a standard defibrillator has remained steady or declined slowly, industry analysts said. 
 ''You can get a lot of high-end stuff in a low-cost digital camera today,'' said Dr. Charles D. Swerdlow, a cardiologist in Los Angeles.
 Many cardiologists like Dr. Swerdlow say they have long lobbied major producers, without success, to make a less-costly defibrillator that performs the device's basic function of saving a life.
 Daniel Schaber, a vice president at Medtronic, said it was unfair to compare defibrillators with consumer products like computers because the market for heart devices was tiny relative to computer sales. And both he and Dr. Eric Fain, an executive at St. Jude Medical, said that the technological features added to the devices might be costly but were in response to what doctors wanted. 
 ''We have said to our advisers, 'What would you be willing to go back to in terms of functionality?''' said Dr. Fain, referring to doctors who serve as St. Jude consultants. And those consultants, he said, have routinely rejected changes that would result in loss of certain features.
 Two years ago, the American division of a German defibrillator maker, Biotronik, offered a basic defibrillator for $10,000, about $6,000 less expensive than the least costly units offered by the three major producers. There was so little interest, the company dropped it.
 Some doctors insisted that if one of the big producers, rather than Biotronik, offered such a device, they might use it. But while one producer, Medtronic, said in response to an inquiry that it does market such a product -- a unit called the Onyx -- the company has not widely publicized it. Dr. Zipes of Indiana University, who has consulted for Medtronic for three decades, said he had never heard of it. 
 Separately, a hospital consulting firm, Aspen Healthcare Metrics of Englewood, Colo., said last year in court papers as part of a lawsuit initiated by Guidant that the device maker kept doctors loyal to its brand by giving them ''clinical research grants, consulting arrangements and other gratuities.''
 The charges came in counterclaims to a lawsuit filed by Guidant against Aspen in which Guidant charged that the consulting firm had, among other things, illegally gathered confidential Guidant price data. Under federal law, providing such inducements to doctors can be illegal. Aspen has denied Guidant's claims and Guidant has denied Aspen's charges.

HEADLINE: Online Classes Offer Virtual Dissection, but Gym Still Takes Sweat 

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
The nation's public schools are rushing to reconfigure scores of traditional courses from basic composition to calculus so students can take them via the Internet. One of the unlikely new offerings in this vast experiment is online gym. 
 Sound like an oxymoron? Not in Minneapolis, where a physical education course joined the school district's growing online catalog in the spring and already has a waiting list.
''I've never seen a response like this to any course,'' said Frank Goodrich, a veteran football coach who is one of two instructors teaching online physical education this summer to about 60 high school students. 
 The course allows students to meet requirements by exercising how they want, when they want. They are required to work out hard for 30 minutes four times a week and report to their teachers by e-mail. Parents must certify that the students did the workouts. 
 One recent day, after Dustin McEvoy lifted weights, Sasha Hulsey swam in a lake and Marc Sylvestre played hockey, they sent in reports with details on their warm-ups, cool-downs and how fast their hearts had beat. Mr. Goodrich, reviewing their e-mail messages on his laptop the next morning, said that although most students were sticking to their required routines, a few slackers were headed toward F's. 
 Physical education is one of 27 online courses now offered by the Minneapolis Public Schools, which had none four years ago. Thousands of other districts nationwide are adding online courses, said Susan Patrick, director of educational technology at the federal Department of Education. 
 ''We're seeing just tremendous growth,'' Ms. Patrick said, ''in enrollments and in the kinds of courses offered.'' 
 In a survey, the department estimated that there were 328,000 student enrollments in online courses offered by public schools during the 2002-3 year. Ms. Patrick said enrollments had probably doubled since then. 
 Many districts, including Minneapolis, are writing their own Internet courses, and more than a dozen states have established virtual schools to supply courses to brick-and-mortar schools. Some schools are buying online courses from commercial vendors, the survey showed.
 Districts providing specialized courses -- macroeconomics, say, or astrophysics -- are choosing to offer the courses online instead of hiring on-site instructors to teach handfuls of students. Offering online versions of basic courses required for graduation is also a way to make room for electives in crowded classroom schedules. 
 The Illinois Virtual School offers 90 online courses, including about 16 Advanced Placement offerings. One of the most popular online courses is consumer education, which teaches checkbook management. The course is required by the state for graduation, but many students have had trouble fitting it into their schedules, Matthew Wicks, the school's director, said. 
 Physical education is not the only course that seems an odd fit for Internet study. Take Advanced Placement biology. The College Board's recommended syllabus for the course includes 12 rigorous laboratory exercises, known among educators as the dirty dozen. 
 Virtual High School, a cooperative based in Massachusetts that offers online courses to more than 300 member schools in 28 states, offers an online Advanced Placement biology course that covers laboratory lessons through computer simulations, including a virtual dissection of a pig, said Liz Pape, who runs the school. 
 ''It's so neat that you can learn everything you need to know about dissection without the formaldehyde smell,'' Ms. Pape said.
 Still, some committed online educators remain unconvinced. Tim Snyder, the executive director of Colorado Online Learning, which offers more than 50 online courses to Colorado schools, included physical education with studio art, marching band and the laboratory sciences as subjects best left to brick-and-mortar schools. 
 ''These are still better experienced in a hands-on setting,'' Dr. Snyder said. 
 But online gym has prospered. That has been possible in part because physical education itself has evolved. Once a highly regimented class centered on team sports and competition, physical education now emphasizes healthy living and personal fitness, topics some see as eminently suited for independent Internet study. 
 One of the first schools to offer physical education online, in 1997, was Florida Virtual School. It is now the nation's largest public online school, with 21,000 students taking at least one course. Personal fitness, the online version of the state's physical education requirement, was the school's most popular course last year, attracting 4,500 students. (Second-most popular was economics, with 2,400 students.) 
 Some students, including a blind teenager in Miami and a student in Melbourne, Fla., who was recovering from a kidney transplant, signed up because their health problems prevented their taking regular gym classes, said Jo Wagner, one of Florida Virtual's lead instructors. But Ms. Wagner said most students took the course to free their schedules for foreign languages and other electives at their traditional schools. 
 The same pattern holds in Minneapolis, where Abbie Modaff, a sophomore, is taking her second semester of online gym this summer. The daughter of self-described ''strugglingly middle-class'' parents, she signed up last spring to open time in a schedule snarled with English, Latin, biology, world studies and advanced mathematics classes, not to mention horseback lessons, soccer games and concert band. 
 This summer, Abbie has been training for a triathlon, so she has e-mailed reports on swimming, biking and jogging workouts to her instructor, Tamara Cowan, who is teaching online gym to 31 Minneapolis students this summer from a friend's home in Sacramento. 
 ''When I'm not feeling like I'm about to die, running can be incredibly good,'' Ms. Modaff wrote to Ms. Cowan in one workout journal in July.
 Last spring, when Ms. Modaff sought to use her horseback rides to fulfill some workout requirements, Mr. Goodrich balked. But using a heart monitor, Ms. Modaff documented that her pulse frequently surged to a pounding 170 beats per minute as she flexed her legs and torso to guide her horse through a dressage course. Mr. Goodrich assented.
 ''She showed us that her heart rate was elevated, and her muscle strength was improving,'' he said. 
 Because the class has faced much questioning, the district issues heart monitors, requiring that students send pulse data to teachers and that parents sign the workout reports. 
 Mr. Goodrich and Ms. Cowan are also on the lookout for cheats. Mr. Goodrich recently sat on his couch in sweat pants and a T-shirt, and, peering into the screen of his Macintosh, signed on to the school district's Web site. He found 31 student e-mail messages documenting recent workouts. There was also a message from a student who pleaded the equivalent of ''my dog ate my homework.''
 ''I have just got back in town for three days and then I will be gone for three days,'' the student wrote to Mr. Goodrich. ''I am trying to get as much work done as possible. Thanks.''
 Mr. Goodrich checked the student's preliminary grades and found she was hopelessly behind with her assignments. He would send her a warning, he said, and predicted she would fail the course.
 About 20 percent of the students dropped out of online gym in the spring, said Jan Braaten, the district's lead physical education instructor.
 ''Even though we told them it would be as hard as or harder than traditional P.E., some thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' Ms. Braaten said. 
 Even the course's author, Brenda Corbin, who writes curriculums for the Minneapolis district, was dismissive at first. 
 ''I refused to be a part of it,'' Ms. Corbin said of her initial reaction a year ago, when Ms. Braaten and district administrators approached her about writing the physical education course. 
 ''How do you know they're really working out?'' Ms. Corbin said she asked. 
 But she later changed her mind. ''I was uninformed about what you can do over the computer,'' she said.
 Renee Jesness, the district's online learning coordinator, said she frequently encountered skepticism about proposals to recast traditional courses for study online. But critics often reconsider when they learn how creative the online courses can be, Ms. Jesness said. 
 Even at a time of budget cuts, the Minneapolis district is adding online courses about as fast as curriculum writers can create them, Ms. Jesness said.
 ''We're in think-tank mode, while the rest of public education is in triage,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Will Break U.N. Seals Placed at a Nuclear Plant 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Berlin for this article, and Graham Bowley from London.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Defying the warning of European leaders, Iran said Monday that it was removing the seals placed by the United Nations nuclear agency at one of its nuclear sites to restart activities there.
 European diplomats said that if Iran did go ahead and resume the nuclear activities, then they would have little choice but to ask for the agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to place the issue before the United Nations Security Council for possible political and economic sanctions.
A senior Iranian official, Ali Aghamohammadi, said technicians were going to break the seals to the uranium ore conversion plant in Isfahan on Monday afternoon in the presence of the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are currently in Iran, the IRNA news agency reported. 
 By the end of the day, however, it could not be determined whether Iran had actually broken the seals. 
 In Berlin, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a news briefing that the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, had warned that the decision was a miscalculation by Iran. 
 In a strongly worded statement, the British Foreign Office said that if Iran were to act on its threat and resume nuclear activities, negotiations between Iran and Europe would probably be halted. 
 Iran agreed nine months ago to freeze all its enrichment-related activities for as long as talks with Germany, France, Britain and the European Union continued. The United States maintains, and the European countries had come to agree, that Iran intends to make nuclear weapons. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes. 
 Mr. Aghamohammadi said Iran's decision to restart a nuclear facility was made after the European foreign ministers notified Iran in a letter that a proposal to Iran concerning incentives for it to permanently dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons program, possibly including nuclear fuel and a trade package, would be made in Paris on Aug. 30, although Iran said its deadline had been the end of July.
 European diplomats said Monday that they had wanted to wait to present a proposal until after the new Iranian president is sworn in on Wednesday, and the French Foreign Ministry said in a briefing on Monday that the proposals would be presented before Sunday. 
 Iran says it is keeping its freeze on another, more advanced, process in the program to enrich uranium, which can lead to making nuclear fuel for power plants, or if enriched to high levels, for making nuclear weapons.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency had urged Iran not to remove the agency's seals from any nuclear equipment at Isfahan until it dispatches more inspectors and installs additional surveillance equipment. An agency spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, said Monday that the process could take a week to 10 days.
 ''We would want to account for every gram of nuclear material,'' she said. ''We would want to be certain that no material is being diverted.''
 Ms. Fleming denied a statement by an Iranian government spokesman that the agency's director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, had agreed to make the inspectors and equipment available in two days. ''There's been no such shortening of the time period the I.A.E.A. would need,'' she said.
 While the agency's response to Iran was cautiously written focusing mostly on technical matters, Ms. Fleming said the agency considered Iran's voluntary suspension of uranium activities to be ''essential'' in its effort to solve the riddles in Iran's past nuclear activity. Suspending enrichment freezes a nuclear site, she said, and makes it easier to investigate. Monitoring the process would also use up the time of inspectors, who could focus on other elements of the nuclear program.
 In Tehran, Mr. Aghamohammadi said the decision to resume work was made in a meeting by Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; the departing president, Mohammad Khatami; the president-elect, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; and other senior leaders.
 At the conversion plant in Isfahan, the uranium ore known as yellowcake is turned into UF6, or uranium hexafluoride gas, which can later be fed into centrifuges to be enriched. 
 Mr. Aghamohammadi said Monday that the UF6 gas produced at the plant in Isfahan would be stored under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The products made of UF6 will be given to a third country in return for yellowcake, he added.
 ''We will keep the suspension on enrichment and we hope we can continue our negotiations with Europe,'' Mr. Aghamohammadi said. 
 ''We hope our decision would be interpreted with good will,'' he said, adding that the country's national pride had been hurt after its nuclear work was stopped under pressure for two years.

HEADLINE: With Casino Poised to Grow, Some Fear Impact on City

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., July 27 

 BODY:
At 71, Patricia VanEgmond knows it is not the walls and mortar that make a home, but the memories.
 Nearly 50 years ago, she and her husband moved into his parents' duplex just a short walk from the Niagara River. They had four children, the younger two raised by Mrs. VanEgmond after her husband died in 1982. 
She could have left then and made a new life elsewhere. But she had a part-time secretarial job at Catholic Charities that she could walk to, a neighbor she trusted with a spare key and an upstairs tenant whose friendship was even more valuable than her rent. ''You get to know all the noises in your home,'' she said. 
 Mrs. VanEgmond thought she would live the rest of her life in her duplex. Instead, she has been left wondering about her future because of a state proceeding to seize 26 acres of city land -- including the VanEgmond property, 25 other houses, two hotels and a water park under eminent domain as part of an agreement with the Seneca Nation of Indians that would allow the tribe to expand a nearby casino.
 ''We're very worried,'' said Mrs. VanEgmond's daughter, Patricia Villani, 44. ''It's all an unknown for her.''
 In August 2002 the state reached an accord with the Seneca Nation, allowing the tribe to acquire 50 acres of sovereign land in Niagara Falls for a casino. The Senecas purchased half the land from willing sellers including the city, which sold its convention center for the casino itself. Adjacent land was turned into parking facilities.
 The casino opened that December. It was considered a bright spot for a city that has had little success persuading the 10 million tourists who come to Niagara Falls each year to spend time visiting its attractions instead of making a beeline for the more spectacular falls across the Canadian border.
 In the first two years, the Seneca Nation's two casinos -- one here and one in Salamanca -- have generated nearly $100 million in revenue for New York State, which shares in slot machine proceeds. The state returns some of that money to the host cities, meaning $21 million in revenue for Niagara Falls, said Philip J. Pantano, a spokesman for the Seneca Gaming Corporation.
 Richard Dorado, a lawyer for the Empire State Development Corporation who took comments at a public hearing this month as eminent domain proceedings began, said that at a time of high local unemployment, the casino had created 1,000 jobs. He also assured property owners that they would be fairly compensated. 
 That was of little comfort to John P. Bartolomei, a lawyer and part owner of Fallsville Splash water park. The park, which reopened on July 21 after two years of renovations, could be seized under eminent domain. ''The more they expand, the more it will kill the city,'' Mr. Bartolomei said.
 ''Casinos are designed to have everyone stay inside,'' he said. ''Since they've opened, restaurants have closed, hotel patronage has dropped off. It's like a parasite killing the host.''
 Mr. Bartolomei said he would take his arguments to court and was confident he would win. Though a recent United States Supreme Court ruling said that municipalities had broad power to use eminent domain if it fostered economic development, he said that he believed his case was strong. ''There's no economic benefit to Niagara Falls,'' he said. ''It's laughable what they're doing.''
 Gennaro Villella, 56, also plans to fight the proceedings. Decades ago, he came to the United States from Italy to visit his sister, and decided to stay. He started renovating a small hotel in the Niagara Falls region and later built a Ramada Inn downtown.
 ''It was intended not only for me but for my kids, and if they take that away, I don't know what I'll do,'' he said. ''But I'll have to establish something else and find a way to feed my family.'' 
 If the Senecas obtain the land, they might use the hotels to provide lodging for casino patrons or workers. The tribe has not decided what it will do with all 26 acres, Mr. Pantano said. But it was always part of the plan to acquire the rest of the agreed-upon land in Niagara Falls, he said, adding that ''Everyone's known this has been coming for the last three years.''

HEADLINE: Saudi News Drives Up Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The announcement of King Fahd's death sent oil prices to a record above $62 a barrel yesterday, a sign that oil traders and analysts remain nervous about any potential sign of instability in Saudi Arabia despite the smooth transition to the long-planned succession by Crown Prince Abdullah. 
 For oil markets concerned about the hold of the Saudi dynasty over the destiny of the world's top oil-exporting country, the news of King Fahd's death provoked a knee-jerk reaction, said Thomas Bentz, a senior oil analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. But Saudi Arabia's energy policy is not expected to change under the new sovereign, who for the last decade as Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler has shaped the kingdom's oil and gas strategy.
''For years, oil markets have reacted bullishly at every rumor of King Fahd's death,'' Mr. Bentz said. ''The king finally died and markets reacted.'' 
 Crude oil futures in New York closed at $61.57 a barrel yesterday, up $1, after rising 2.9 percent, to $62.30 a barrel. In two years, prices have more than doubled, and are up 42 percent this year.
 But other factors, mostly in the United States, also significantly contributed to the jump in oil prices. Shutdowns at a number of major refineries owned by Exxon Mobil, BP and Valero, in Texas and Louisiana, renewed worries in the market that tight supplies of products like gasoline, diesel and heating oil would fail to keep up with growing demand.
 Also, news that Iran, OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, might resume its uranium-enrichment program led to renewed concerns that it was set on a collision course with the United States and the rest of the international community over its nuclear program.
 Saudi officials were quick to reassure the markets that the succession would have no impact on oil production. The kingdom's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki al-Faisal, told reporters in London that Saudi Arabia would stick to its present energy policies. 
 Similar assurances that producers would keep oil markets well supplied also came from officials with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 In recent years, foreign oil workers have been targets of attackers in Riyadh and Dhahran. With global oil operations running at full capacity, traders and analysts fear that an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil operations could send oil prices above $100 a barrel.
 Crown Prince Abdullah has been the kingdom's effective ruler since 1995 when his half-brother suffered a debilitating stroke. Since then, the prince has steered a limited opening of the country's gas sector to foreign investors while maintaining Saudi Aramco's strict state monopoly over oil production. 
 ''Abdullah has been actively involved in the core activities of Saudi Arabian energy,'' said Anthony Cordesman, an expert on Saudi energy policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It's hard to see that the death of King Fahd would produce much change there.''
 Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York, said he expected Ali al-Naimi, the country's oil minister since 1995 and the public face of Saudi oil policy, to keep his job.
 ''Saudi Arabia has a leadership role within OPEC and Mr. Naimi represents that,'' Mr. Bremmer said. ''One area where you can expect to see consistency is Saudi energy policy.'' 
 The cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's energy policy is its self-appointed role as the world's swing producer, the only country that kept up to two million barrels a day of idle capacity that could be cranked up when needed to make up for shortfalls in supplies. For example, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, in 1990, Saudi Arabia made up for the loss in production from both countries by increasing its output.
 That capacity has been stretched in recent years as the growth in demand for oil outstripped the rise in output around the world, catching producers flat-footed. Over the last two years, OPEC's producers have been pumping at their maximum capacity in an attempt to bring prices down.
 Saudi Arabia, which currently has a production capacity of about 10.5 million barrels a day, plans to bolster its supplies to 12.5 million barrels a day by 2009.
 The crown prince's stewardship over the last decade also included a period when oil prices collapsed to less than $10 a barrel in 1998, bringing many producers to the brink of bankruptcy. Thanks to Saudi Arabia's leadership within OPEC, which for the most part focused on persuading other producers to curb their production, oil prices eventually recovered. 
 Given that experience, some analysts said, the kingdom now has little incentive to seek lower prices. Income from the country's oil sales account for about 80 percent of the government's revenue. 
 ''Saudi Arabia has come to enjoy these high prices,'' said Muhammad-Ali Zainy, the senior energy economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies, based in London. ''Saudi Arabia remains totally dependent on oil and has not succeeded, in the past 30 years, in diversifying its economy. I am worried that, as prices are up and their revenues grow, it will push them to complacency.''

HEADLINE: The Kingdom and the Power

BYLINE: By Gerald Posner. 
Gerald Posner is the author of ''Secrets of the Kingdom: The Inside Story of the Secret Saudi-U.S. Connection.''

 BODY:
THE news yesterday that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had died sent only minor ripples through Wall Street, and caused few jitters in the already nervous energy markets. That is largely because the death of the octogenarian king -- incapacitated since a 1995 stroke -- had been largely expected since he was hospitalized in May. Washington policymakers had been preparing for his death so as not to be surprised by unpleasant changes as power transferred inside the House of Saud. 
 Yet, while the death of King Fahd will not cause major changes in the desert kingdom, a dramatic shakeup is on the horizon -- and Washington must act quickly if it wants events to unfold to its advantage. 
Saudi Arabia has no constitution and no formal procedure is established for succession. In 1975, when a disgruntled nephew assassinated King Faisal, the crown went to one of Faisal's half-brothers, Khalid, even though Khalid's older brother, Muhammad, was the senior family member. Little wonder that the deaths of Saudi kings have been tinged with some uncertainty.
 This time, however, there was little doubt. Crown Prince Abdullah, one of Fahd's 25 half-brothers, has effectively run the day-to-day operations of the government for the past decade. King Fahd's death merely formalizes Abdullah's powers. And, as expected, Prince Sultan, the longtime defense minister and a brother of King Fahd, has been elevated to the title of crown prince.
 Yet this successor government will almost certainly be a brief one. Abdullah is over 80. Sultan is in his late 70's. Thus the potential crisis comes not with the post-Fahd succession, but upon Abdullah's death. The prospect of a crippling tribal feud within the House of Saud, or of a nationwide movement of discontent among average Saudis who are left out of the royals' enormous circle of influence and wealth, are real possibilities. 
 Despite sitting on the world's largest pool of oil, the kingdom is in bad shape. It has run a budget deficit for 21 of the last 22 years. More than 20 percent of the annual budget goes to the military, while the share spent on education and health steadily declines. The demands of the ever-expanding royal family on the national finances are crippling. 
 The country's youth population has soared and the once unshakable Saudi social network that provided cradle-to-grave education, medical care and even housing has retrenched under growing financial constraints. Unemployment for those under 30 has reached 25 percent. The kingdom's per capita income is less than $7,000, having peaked in 1981 at the equivalent of $25,000. 
 And all the while, support for radical fundamentalism seems to be growing, if judged by the crowds at mosques on Fridays and the number of Saudi suicide bombers who have joined Al Qaeda or gone to Iraq.
 So the real question is whether petrodollars and the Wahhabi sect of Islam can keep the country glued together after leadership passes to a new generation of men including Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who recently retired as ambassador to the United States, and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the kingdom's wealthiest businessmen. 
 So far, efforts at democratization have been little more than window dressing. This year the House of Saud had its first experiment in democracy, a three-stage nationwide election for municipal councils. The royals heralded it as a significant step toward participatory democracy. But the election actually revealed how far they have to go: while half the council members were elected, the king appointed the other half; women were banned from voting; the councils can make recommendations to the government but have no real power; turnout was low; and many of the winners were conservative Islamists backed by religious authorities. 
 The regime has also been backsliding in political freedoms. In May, Ali al-Domeini, a leading poet, and two scholars were given long prison sentences for having circulated a letter they had written to Crown Prince Abdullah calling for political, economic and social reforms. Other advocates who endorsed the letter were kept in custody until they signed an agreement to stop their public campaign. 
 These are not the actions of a strong government or a confident ruling family. It would be in the Saudis' service, then, as well as our own, if the United States were to use its influence to bring about advances in democracy and moderation in repression. For too long the United States has failed to push the kingdom to change, largely out of fears of upsetting the royals and the effect that might have on the supply and price of oil.
 Things may be changing for the better, however. In June the State Department took the rare step of listing Saudi Arabia as one of 14 countries that could face sanctions if it did not adequately address the international trafficking of prostitutes and of migrant workers who are forced into indentured servitude.
 The United States should be equally firm when it comes to other important issues like the continuing Saudi crackdown on dissidents; the imprisonment -- and sometimes execution -- of homosexuals; failures to expand women's rights; and the kingdom's inconsistent role in the war on terrorism. 
 The recent appointment of Prince Turki al-Faisal as ambassador to the United States affords an opportunity for blunt diplomacy. The prince, who ran Saudi intelligence for a quarter-century, knows far more than his predecessor, Prince Bandar, about the labyrinth of Islamic extremism; he even negotiated with Osama bin Laden and Taliban officials in his intelligence role. He may not become the social fixture in Washington that Prince Bandar was, but he is a pragmatist who will understand, and convey to Riyadh, straight talk from Washington. 
 If the United States can make clear that it condemns the regressive practices of the House of Saud, it might help the younger princes find the personal courage to relinquish enough power that the Saudi public can feel it has a government that is responsive to modern needs and desires. The future of the House of Saud, not to mention that of the United States' role in the Middle East, depend on our doing what we can to shape the next generation of royals.

HEADLINE: Shares Mixed as Oil Prices Set Another Record High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed at the end of an uninspired session yesterday as a new high in oil prices was partly offset by a better-than-expected reading of the nation's industrial activity and strong sales at Wal-Mart Stores. 
 The stock market remained resilient in the face of record intraday and closing prices for oil. A barrel of light crude reached an intraday high of $62.30 before closing at $61.57, up $1, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The death of Saudi King Fahd was cited as creating uncertainty in the oil market. 
 The surge in oil prices was mitigated by upbeat July sales at Wal-Mart as well as a bullish reading of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, showing that both the consumer and industrial sectors have adapted well to high energy costs. 
 The strong growth in the economy, however, raised concerns about the Federal Reserve and its policy of gradually raising the nation's benchmark interest rate. 
 The economic data ''is telling investors that the Fed is not done as quickly as people were thinking two months ago,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments in San Francisco. ''That's creating a little bit of headwind for stocks.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,623.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,235.35, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 10.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,195.38. 
 Investors were encouraged by a surprising gain in the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for July. The index rose to 56.6, better than the 54.5 economists had forecast and higher than June's 53.8 reading. 
 Yet while the figures showed a robust growth rate for the industrial sector, the breadth and depth of July's rally had many investors hedging their bets on whether it could continue through August. The Dow gained 3.56 percent for the month, while the S.&P. rose 3.6 percent and the Nasdaq surged 6.22 percent. 
 ''Any time you have runs like these, people are always going to get jittery,'' said Bill Groenveld, head trader at vFinance Investments. ''But to take healthy pauses here and there, there's nothing wrong with it.'' 
 Wal-Mart rose 18 cents, to $49.53, as the retailer reported a 4.4 percent increase in sales from stores open at least a year, another strong sign of consumer spending. 
 The technology sector received a lift from eBay, which climbed $1.83, to $43.61, after it received an upgrade to buy from neutral at Citigroup Smith Barney. Analysts there said that the company's earnings were solid and that trends looked positive. 
 Oil stocks climbed. Exxon Mobil rose 48 cents, to $59.23, while Chevron was up 42 cents, to $58.43. 
 Procter & Gamble reported a 9 percent rise in profits and beat Wall Street's earnings forecasts by a penny a share. Shares of P.&G., nonetheless, fell 31 cents, to $55.32, as the company lowered its forecast for the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Will Ask China to Agree to Broad Limits on Clothing Exports 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration announced plans Monday to seek a broad agreement with China to limit its clothing exports to the United States.
 The announcement was a partial payoff of promises that the administration made last week to House Republicans from Alabama and North Carolina to win approval of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. But some trade experts said the announcement was broader than they had expected and could lead to higher prices for socks, shirts, skirts, trousers, swimwear and many other categories of clothing.
Carlos M. Gutierrez, the Secretary of Commerce, announced the plan, saying that the administration would consult with American textile companies about seeking a broader agreement with China on nearly a dozen categories of clothing. The administration was already weighing restrictions for many of those products, but it made additional promises last week to two Republicans who abandoned their opposition to the Central American trade pact at the last minute. 
 The House approved the Central American trade pact by a two-vote margin shortly after midnight Wednesday night. 
 Representative Robin Hayes, Republican of North Carolina and a staunch opponent of the trade pact, switched his vote after House Republican leaders promised that new safeguard quotas would be approved for products like men's trousers, knit fabrics and brassieres. 
 Representative Robert B. Aderhol, Republican of Alabama, abandoned his opposition a few hours before the vote when the administration promised to seek new protection against imported socks. Mr. Aderholt represents Fort Payne, Ala., which, with nearly 100 local sock mills, has called itself the sock capital of the world. 
 Chinese exports of socks and many other products have skyrocketed this year, ever since the expiration of global trade quotas for a wide variety of textile products. Imports of Chinese socks soared 1,859 percent in the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2004, according to the Commerce Department. Imports of Chinese skirts were up 1,100 percent and imports of sweaters were up about 898 percent. 
 ''Today's decision will allow us time to engage in substantive discussions with our domestic textile and apparel industries and members of Congress on whether there is interest in a broader textile agreement with China,'' Mr. Gutierrez said in a statement on Monday. 
 But Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said the administration was in danger of paying too high a price for a victory on the Central American trade pact. 
 ''This is truly a payoff for Cafta, and it is potentially a bigger payoff than I had expected,'' Mr. Hufbauer said, noting that the Bush administration had long made it clear it did not want to create a new version of the textile trade restrictions that had just expired. 
 ''I suspect we are on the edge of creating a new kind of quota system that is pretty comprehensive for China,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''Certainly from the standpoint of someone who favors trade liberalization, which is me, it's a setback.''
 But several questions remain. The first is how severely Mr. Bush will try to limit the growth in Chinese exports. The second is how much Chinese leaders will agree on.
 China reached an agreement earlier this summer with the European Union that restricted the growth of many clothing categories to an annual pace of about 10 percent.
 But within the United States, there are likely to be sharply differing views between clothing producers and clothing retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Gap.
 Erik O. Autor, vice president and international trade counsel for the National Retail Federation, said retailers would not be happy about restrictions but could benefit simply from having less uncertainty about the volumes of imports allowed.
 Mr. Autor declined to say whether his association would support restrictions similar to those that China worked out with Europe. ''We would have to see the entire package,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Forrester Denies Charges Of Seeking No-Bid Contracts

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican candidate for governor, angrily defended himself on Monday from Democratic charges that he had used campaign contributions to help his pharmacy benefits company win contracts from New Jersey school boards and local governments.
 Two Democratic members of New Jersey's Congressional delegation raised the issue after The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on Friday that 80 percent of the $200 million in annual revenues generated by Mr. Forrester's company, BeneCard Services, came from public-sector contracts that did not require competitive bidding. 
Mr. Forrester has pledged to end New Jersey's ''pay to play'' culture of companies seeking no-bid government contracts by making political donations to the party in power. 
 Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Camden Democrat, fired first, holding a news conference at the State House on Friday to call Mr. Forrester's stance ''the World Series of hypocrisy, even by New Jersey standards.''
 Then, on Monday, Representative Frank Pallone, a Monmouth Democrat, charged that in at least three instances -- in Burlington and Bergen Counties and in Toms River -- BeneCard received contracts after Mr. Forrester made donations totaling almost $75,000 to Republicans. Mr. Pallone suggested that Mr. Forrester was all but running a vanity campaign, in order to boost BeneCard's business profile, and his own wallet.
 ''This is almost as much as a gubernatorial campaign as it is a campaign for marketing BeneCard, particularly if you think he's not going to win, and I don't think he's going to win,'' said Mr. Pallone, who is considered one of the top prospects to replace Senator Jon S. Corzine, should Mr. Corzine defeat Mr. Forrester for governor.
 ''Here's your opportunity as a candidate to go around and exercise your influence, to get all these contracts.''
 A few hours later, at his own hastily arranged news conference, Mr. Forrester lashed out, describing the accusations as ''outrageous,'' ''egregious,'' ''absurd'' and even ''goofy.'' 
 ''Shame on the Corzine campaign,'' he said.
 Mr. Forrester said that most of the contracts predated any contributions that he had made as a private citizen or through a political action committee. He found it puzzling, as well, that some of the contracts flagged by Democrats were in areas like Bergen County controlled by Democrats.
 Mr. Forrester also rejected Democratic suggestions that the contracts were ''no-bid contracts.'' In fact, he said, the contracts were awarded only after a competitive screening process in which they were evaluated each year by private-sector consultants hired by the local governments. Those governments retain the right to opt out of a BeneCard plan if they do not get the best price.
 But Mr. Forrester did offer a theory as to why Democrats had latched on to the BeneCard story.
 ''There has to be some contest going on where Jon Corzine has offered a prize -- perhaps it's this ephemeral prize that I don't think he'll ever be able to award, namely a replacement of his seat in the Senate to individuals who can come up with the most outrageous suggestion about Doug Forrester,'' he said. ''The idea that there's some economic advantage that I gain by running for office is foolish and demonstrably false.''

HEADLINE: Insurers Want Their Say In Social Security Debate

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Congress is not expected to adopt deep changes to Social Security this year. But regardless of the outcome of Republican proposals to add private accounts to the system, the nation's huge life insurance industry stands to benefit from the debate over Social Security's future. 
 Already, the debate has called attention to retirement concerns. Insurers have been increasingly focusing on selling investments for retirement and they are doing their best to capitalize on the attention. Moreover, if Congress does end up changing Social Security, there is a good chance any new law would favor the kind of investments called annuities that insurers love to sell. 
''The whole subject of retirement security is ripe,'' said Jim Morrill, the chief Washington lobbyist for the Lincoln Financial Group, one of the biggest life insurance companies. 
 To make the most of the Social Security debate and other issues over the long run, the insurers have strengthened their main trade association and lobbying arm, the American Council of Life Insurers, and many individual companies are working independently to win advantages for their products. Last year, the trade group alone reported spending $9.1 million on lobbying, up 54 percent from the previous year.
 The insurers learned the hard way two years ago that they have to fight for whatever they get in Washington, after Congress reduced taxes on dividends and capital gains for stocks but not on insurance-related investments.
 In making their pitch now, the insurers emphasize that their annuities can contribute to national savings and provide ''a paycheck for life'' similar to Social Security. They also contend that a flexible savings plan advocated by President Bush, which would probably take money away from them, would probably not increase long-term savings. And the insurers are trying to prevent the elimination of the estate tax, which many wealthy Americans now pay with the proceeds of life insurance policies. 
 Besides one-on-one meetings with members of Congress and the Bush administration, other ways the insurers have taken aim at policy makers are drive-time radio spots, advertisements in Capitol Hill publications and advertisements on television. 
 ''With or without a Social Security fix, Americans don't have enough assets to retire on,'' said Frank Keating, the former Oklahoma governor who is chief executive of the American Council of Life Insurers. ''There has to be a much larger debate.''
 Mr. Keating, an old Washington hand who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, has hired other Washington insiders for the trade group since taking charge in early 2003.
 He promoted Kimberly Olson Dorgan, the wife of Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, to be the council's chief lobbyist. In February, he recruited Pamela F. Olson, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, as a consultant. 
 In June, another Treasury official, Gregory F. Jenner, who had been a deputy to Ms. Olson, joined the council's staff. Ms. Olson had a powerful appeal to the trade group: she had helped develop the Bush administration's flexible savings plan known as the lifetime savings account and could advise the insurers as they worked to defeat it. 
 J. Barry Griswell, the chief executive of the Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, was one of the members of the council who pushed to strengthen the industry's Washington operations. ''We needed to ramp up our efforts,'' he said. ''We needed to be recognized as more of a player in Washington.''
 The lobbying campaign may already be paying off. Some of the most powerful Washington leaders have been picking up on the broader issue of retirement and the woeful inadequacy of savings by most Americans.
 ''We're very concerned with retirement savings'' beyond Social Security, said Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, at a recent hearing. ''Clearly,'' he said, ''an annuity is a concept that's effective.''
 He also spoke of providing tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care or nursing home insurance and of making enrollment automatic in 401(k) plans, many of which are run by insurance companies.
 Mr. Keating has been carefully pressing into the debate without staking out a position on the details of Social Security. That contrasts with the combative stance taken by health insurers in the early 1990's when President Bill Clinton tried to change the nation's health care system. 
 ''The life insurers are offering products that are very complementary to any of the possible future scenarios for Social Security,'' said Daniel W. Lathrop, an analyst at the Center for Public Integrity in Washington. ''Everything from the very small amount of tinkering favored by the Democrats to the structural changes proposed by the president.''
 In the tax debate in 2003 Congress objected to providing additional tax advantages for annuities, the insurers said, partly because only about 2 percent of investors in variable annuities -- a combination of mutual funds and insurance -- currently choose at retirement to receive regular payments. Most simply ignore the retirement feature and take their money in a lump sum.
 But some members of Congress suggested a way to solve the problem. ''They said, 'We want you to come up here with a proposal that really does what you say the product is supposed to do,''' said Mr. Morrill of Lincoln Financial. ''Don't just be an investment vehicle, but be a retirement vehicle. So that's what we've done.''
 The pending bill introduced by Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican from Connecticut, would require investors to commit savings to an annuity with regular payments for life and enable them to withdraw up to $40,000 a year, paying taxes on only half.
 Peter R. Orszag, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said the legislation could run into opposition as ''an unwarranted subsidy or giveaway to high-income people.'' Industry actuaries say that an investor would have to have about $1 million in an annuity to get $40,000 in annual earnings. To produce earnings of $10,000 a year, the actuaries said, an investor would need a nest egg of about $250,000 to $300,000.
 But the insurers are not betting everything on one piece of legislation. If they can get the focus right, they figure, good things will follow. ''The main priority,'' Mr. Keating said, ''is to sensitize the nation and the nation's leaders to the crisis in long-term savings. This is the long-term savings debate being joined.''

HEADLINE: Reducing the Deficit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Deficit Disorder'' (editorial, July 24), about President Bush's deficit reduction policy:
 President Bush's tax cuts stimulated our economy. Evidence of growth -- from the creation of more than 3.7 million jobs to advances in gross domestic product and increased Treasury receipts -- is irrefutable. The recent revenue increases are broad-based, coming from rising wages, salaries and profits.

Increased tax receipts are a big help in achieving deficit reduction, but tight controls, as called for in the budget, are also essential.
 The Bush administration is committed to both the continued economic growth and the budget restraint that will keep us on this solid path of deficit reduction.

PERSON: King Fahd

HEADLINE: King Fahd, 82, Who Guided the Saudis Between Tradition and Modernization

BYLINE: BY DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
King Fahd, the absolutist monarch of Saudi Arabia who died yesterday after 23 years on the throne, guided his desert kingdom through sharp upheavals in the oil market, sweeping regional wars and the incessant, high-stakes scrimmage between Islamic tradition and breakneck modernization.
 The king, whose reign began in 1982, was hospitalized with acute pneumonia in May, according to news agency reports, and the daily affairs of state had been handled by the crown prince, Abdullah, since the king suffered the first of a series of strokes in 1995. According to the monarch's Web site, he was 82.
King Fahd's years leading the kingdom were bracketed by strident challenges to the rule of the Saud dynasty, starting with the takeover of the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, in 1979 by an extremist named Juhayman to a series of violent bombings in the kingdom that started in May 2003. 
 Although King Fahd was incapacitated by a stroke and by what was rumored in the diplomatic community to be Alzheimer's by the time Osama bin Laden's followers began their bloody bombing campaign, his response to the earlier violent challenges set the tone for the way the royal tribe responded to the accusations that it was insufficiently devout to maintain its control over the two holiest mosques in Islam. 
 King Fahd assumed the title Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and although Juhayman and his followers were executed, the agenda pushed by the most conservative Islamic factions in the kingdom, ranging from vastly expanding the amount of theology taught in all schools to curbing the expanding role of women, was quietly adopted. Overseas, Saudi Arabia under his watch poured millions into financing the construction of schools, mosques and charitable organizations to spread conservative Wahhabi doctrine, which in its most radical form considers non-Muslims the enemy. 
 Starting with the realization that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States were Saudi followers of Mr. bin Laden, but particularly after the bombings against targets started in the kingdom, members of the ruling family grudgingly acknowledged that some of what they had financed was fomenting the very extremism seeking to undermine their rule. Coming under increasing pressure from the United States, the family began putting charitable and other organizations under its direct supervision and sought to root out terrorist cells within the country.
 King Fahd bin Abdel Aziz al-Saud, the fifth Saudi sovereign, transcended his early reputation as the playboy prince to become a leader of Arab states in the Persian Gulf region, a friend to the United States when that was not always easy. King Fahd was overweight and diabetic, and had arthritis, gallbladder surgery and a blood clot in his eye. He used a cane or wheelchair. His brother, Prince Abdullah, the crown prince, ultimately assumed virtually all executive responsibilities.
 Over all, King Fahd's reign, which in effect began with the long illness of his predecessor, King Khalid, was characterized by immense change.
 He oversaw the exploitation of the kingdom's oil wealth and the expansion of its private sector, and he sent a generation of Saudis to be educated in the West. He let hundreds of thousands of American troops be based in Saudi Arabia during the first war against Iraq despite heated criticism from other Arab countries.
 The king's influence was wide-ranging. He helped the Reagan administration orchestrate and finance its complicated, illegal operation to sell arms to Iran while aiding Nicaraguan rebels. He gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Palestinians fighting Israel and established religious schools, some of which have been described as breeders of terrorists, throughout the Islamic world. 
 The power and prestige of controlling the world's biggest supply of oil, a quarter of the planet's reserves, spoke for itself. But depressed petroleum prices during much of King Fahd's reign engendered economic pressures unthinkable during the high-flying 1970's. As population surged and employment opportunities dwindled, per capita income sank to a third of what it had been at King Fahd's coronation.
 The king nonetheless used his ability to pump more oil almost at will as a damper on oil prices so as not to damage the world economy. But he worried when prices fell too low to pay the kingdom's bills, and in 1986 he fired his oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, for allowing crude prices to fall to $10 a barrel from $30. 
 King Fahd in 1986 boldly declared his other source of power by appointing himself Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, referring to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina. But it was exactly this religious role that was most challenged during the latter part of his reign as Islamic conservatives derided the royal family as corrupt and the government's closeness to the United States as near satanic.
 King Fahd's Saud family has ruled since 1932, when his father, King Abdel Aziz al-Saud, formed what was actually the family's third kingdom on the Arabian Peninsula.
 Each time, beginning in the mid-18th century, the Sauds claimed religious authority as legitimacy for their rule. This derived from their alliance with the Wahhabi sect of Muslims, led by the al-Sheik family. In return for the endorsement of the ultrastrict Wahhabis, the Sauds act as their protectors and enforcers. 
 But the resultant stability had a price. King Fahd could pursue modernization goals, like educating more women, only to the extent that they did not provoke his religious base.
 Moreover, he owed clerics policies they truly liked. Those included the development of universities that taught little beyond Islamic doctrine and ended up spewing thousands of theology students into a cramped labor market. The conservatives applauded his support of Muslims fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, but the policy ended up fostering development of a radical current close to Mr. bin Laden's positions. 
 The challenge has been to create farms and skyscrapers in the desert, while still allowing Wahhabi enforcers to wander in public places with sticks to enforce Islamic law in matters like women's dress. Even as Saudi Arabia became a regional superpower on the strength of billions of dollars in arms purchases from the United States, conservatives criticized that dependency.
 The State Department, the British Foreign Office and nongovernmental human rights monitors, meanwhile, persistently criticized Saudi Arabia's treatment of non-Muslims, women and prisoners.
 Where once there were only Bedouin, the desert wanderers, King Fahd had to balance powerful constituencies. Those included a new technocratic middle class, about 7,000 princes, a legion of foreign workers and some Bedouin.
 It sometimes added up to contradictory policies: Fahd was a champion of educating women from the time he was selected as the kingdom's first education minister in 1953, but only in his last years, under considerable Western pressures, did he make serious efforts to get them jobs.
 Beginning in 1992, King Fahd instituted reforms in government to create a consultative council to advise royalty, decentralize some powers and widen the pool of candidates eligible to become king. But his absolute powers remained absolute, and he took pains to emphasize that the reforms were in no way a move toward Western-style democracy, but rather a reflection of the Koran.
 He made no attempt to hide his status as one of the world's richest men. Even when following the traditional Arab passion of visiting the desert, he made the trip in a fleet of 18-wheel Mercedes trucks. In ''The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom'' (Norton, 1987), Sandra Mackey said he had ''built one elaborate palace after another,'' including an exact replica of the White House. (He never moved in to avoid the political repercussions of a Saudi king imitating an American president.)
 In ''The Arabs'' (Random House, 1987), David Lamb reported that King Fahd employed the Washington artist who designed the floating space city in ''Star Trek'' to refurbish his Boeing 707 with gold-plated hardware, a three-story elevator and plastic chandeliers. His yacht was the size of a luxury liner.
 Fahd bin Abdel Aziz al-Saud was born in Riyadh in 1923, according to his official Web site (www.kingfahdbinabdulaziz.com). His mother, Hassa bint Ahmed al-Sudairi, was the most favored of his father's many wives and came from the powerful Sudairi clan. King Abdel Aziz married at least three Sudairi women, including Hassa, as well as 14 women from other clans. He consolidated his kingdom through such intertribal marriages.
 King Fahd and his six younger full brothers were often called the Sudairi Seven, and became the strongest force in Saudi economic and political life, from oil to defense to national security. The seven were a close-knit group and met weekly, often at the home of Lulu, their eldest full sister.
 Fahd, whose name means jaguar or leopard, was a favorite among King Abdel Aziz's 45 sons. The father called the son a ''fox, rather than a jaguar,'' and taught him to ride, shoot straight and speak the truth.
 Dr. Rashad Pharaon, once personal physician to King Abdel Aziz, compared Fahd with his brothers, saying he came ''nearest to his father in outlook and general qualities -- wisdom, ambition and the willpower to achieve those objectives for which the Saudi house stands.''
 Still, King Abdel Aziz was strict. In an interview in the early 1970's, then Prince Fahd recalled the time his father locked him in a room for more than two hours because he had had a fight with a neighbor's son. The king knew the other boy had provoked the quarrel, but wanted to show impartiality, Fahd said.
 Prince Fahd attended what was called the palace school with other princes and studied Islamic history and religion, traditional politics, the Arabic language and desert lore. As a teenager, he liked waiting outside his father's office so he could slip inside when advisers were summoned. Eventually, at his mother's urging, the king made Fahd a member of his advisory board.
 In 1945, his father sent him to the founding convention of the United Nations in San Francisco, where he became enamored with America. His first governmental post was as a regional governor. 
 When King Abdel Aziz died in 1953, his eldest surviving son, Saud, became king, and his second son, Faisal, was declared heir apparent. The new king appointed Fahd education minister. Fahd used the new gusher of oil revenues to build hundreds of secondary schools and numerous universities. In 1962, he was promoted to interior minister.
 In 1964, King Saud was deposed and Prince Faisal became king. In 1967, King Faisal made Fahd second deputy prime minister, greatly increasing his powers.
 Prince Fahd began to develop a reputation for moderation, and was reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post to have initially opposed the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
 In 1975, King Faisal was assassinated by a nephew, and another half brother, Khalid, came to the throne. The new king quickly appointed Fahd crown prince, putting him next in the line of succession. The royal family chose him despite his reputation for high living.
 Whether reality or rumor, many press accounts claimed that then Prince Fahd drank alcohol, enjoyed the company of European women and once lost $6 million gambling in Monte Carlo. In 1974, he spent the holy month of Ramadan in Europe, offending conservative Muslims.
 In their book, ''The House of Saud,'' (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1982) David Holden and Richard Johns said the Saudis tried to pass off these stories as a product of Zionist malice. They were insufficient to stop Prince Fahd's accession. They wrote, ''It was difficult to dispute that by experience, capacity and stature Fahd was the best man to become chief executive under the new king, who, it was assumed, would be little more than a figurehead.''
 Still, Ms. Mackey in her book wrote that King Fahd's rakish reputation ''all but fatally tarnished'' him. She said many Saudis regarded him as ''a high-living captive of the West.''
 But he was capable of bouts of furious work. Reuters reported in 1998 that his ministers complained of being summoned to sudden meetings with midnight phone calls.
 After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, King Fahd joined with the United States to aid Afghans fighting the Russians. Hume Horan, a former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia, wrote in a 2004 article for the American Enterprise Institute that William J. Casey, then director of central intelligence, visited the king in 1987.
 The American brought a shiny, detailed Kalashnikov rifle. Its stock featured a brass plaque saying that the weapon had been taken from the body of a Russian officer.
 ''Mr. Casey might as well have been giving the keys to the Kingdom of God itself,'' Mr. Horan wrote. ''The king rose, flourished the weapon, and struck a martial pose.''
 King Fahd often showed agility in dealing with complex issues. For example, several times in the 1980's and 1990's he suggested that he might recognize Israel if it made sufficient territorial concessions. Other Arab countries, and Saudi conservatives, were sharply dismissive.
 When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, King Fahd faced a difficult problem. During the war between Iraq and Iran in the 1980's, Saudi Arabia had given Iraq $25 billion in aid. The king first urged negotiations to encourage Iraq to retreat.
 Dick Cheney, the defense secretary at the time, visited the king to make the case that Saudi Arabia stood a good chance of being Iraq's next victim. He displayed satellite photos of Iraqi missiles aimed at Saudi Arabia and described other threats.
 The king huddled with his advisers, speaking in Arabic, Michael R. Gordon, a Times correspondent, and Bernard E. Trainor, who has worked as a military analyst for The Times, wrote in their book, ''The Generals' War: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf'' (Little, Brown, 1995). The authors said the king won over his doubters by pointing out that the Kuwaitis who had fled had been put up in luxury hotels in Saudi Arabia. He asked what country would put up the Saudis in their hotels. 
 Saudi Arabia allowed the United States to station troops in the kingdom. Judith Miller, in her book ''God Has 99 Names'' (Simon & Schuster, 1996), said the king built a consensus for the controversial action partly by persuading one of the country's most respected religious scholars, Sheik Bin Baz, to issue an edict to approve the use of force to evict Iraq.
 But Ms. Miller, who is a reporter for The New York Times, wrote that the king was disappointed that the United States ended hostilities before Saddam Hussein was destroyed. She said the disgruntled Saudis briefly prolonged the war by delaying translation of the surrender document.

HEADLINE: California Air Is Cleaner, but Troubles Remain

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: TOPANGA STATE PARK, Calif. 

 BODY:
On many days, a hiker on the Temescal Ridge trail above the Pacific Ocean, 30 to 50 miles west of the San Gabriel Mountains, can trace the snowy ridges and the thin, brown lines of canyons with the naked eye. Three decades ago, an entire summer could pass before homeowners just five miles from the mountains could see the peaks.
 Kyle Eden, a varsity tennis player in Glendora High School below the San Gabriels, has never had a match called for smog, as his father, Rudy, did in the 1970's.
Bob Wyman, a lawyer, no longer pants for air after running as he did in his childhood.
 Visitors like Leon Billings, who shaped the Clean Air Act as a senior Senate staff member, do not have to pull off the freeways and wait for their eyes to stop tearing. 
 ''Smog had a palpable impact on our daily lives,'' Mr. Wyman said. ''I'm 51. I'm not sure how conscious most people are of this.'' 
 In the last half-century, the urgent need to scrub clean the filthiest air in the country has reshaped the region's politics, turned obscure agencies into regulatory behemoths and made Los Angeles an international leader in its hard-won expertise. 
 But for all this achievement, success -- consistently healthy air for all 16 million Southern Californians -- remains out of reach. 
 The ozone pollution is improving but the region remains, along with Houston and the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, one of the worst three in the nation. 
 And the authorities have far less power to control another type of air pollution, one just as harmful as ozone, if not more so.
 Hidden from hikers in Topanga State Park by the low hills of the Palos Verdes Peninsula are the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The hub of a ravenous American appetite for cheap Asian goods, the ports are also a concentrated source of diesel pollutants spewing from the ships, locomotives and lines of idling trucks. 
 The tiny exhaust particles, just one twenty-eighth the width of the average human hair, get deep inside lungs and have been newly linked to cancer and cardiovascular disease.
 Much of what Los Angeles has achieved has been accomplished by strict state regulations in tandem with the federal mandates of the Clean Air Act of 1970. With continuing pressure from the Bush administration for changes in the act, this place whose name was once synonymous with filthy air is perhaps the best place to measure what the Clean Air Act has accomplished -- and what remains undone. 
 The Los Angeles narrative has parallels around the country. In the Ohio River Valley, the steel industry has shriveled, but electric utilities have become a dominant polluter. Along the western shores of the Gulf of Mexico, the chemical industry stands in the forefront. In California, the biggest issue is emissions from cars, trucks, trains and ships.
 The four counties usually visible from the ocean-hugging slopes above Santa Monica have been to the clean air struggle what the Deep South was to the civil rights movement. 
 It was not a folk-song-ready revolution. Its epic figures are biochemists and engineers, known for precision, not charisma. Its battlefields, the insides of engines. Its foot soldiers, bureaucracies with forgettable names but memorable accomplishments, like setting emission standards that put catalytic converters in California cars in 1975, two years ahead of the rest of the nation.
 California's problem today, however, is that the state has little clear legal authority at the ports, where cargo volume is projected to triple by 2030. ''A great deal of work still needs to be done,'' said Michael H. Scheible, deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board. ''And we don't have another automobile out there, something that has big emissions and that we have full authority to control.''

Pollution Fight Begins
 In 1955, downtown Los Angeles experienced the nation's worst-ever prolonged ozone pollution: on one day the hourly average levels of choking ozone were six times the maximum allowable rate under current federal standards.
 The source had been pinpointed a couple of years earlier, by Arie Haagen-Smit, a scientist at the California Institute of Technology. A plant biologist, Dr. Haagen-Smit had been studying the organic basis of pineapples' scent, using ozone as a tool, when, as his wife later told a Caltech historian, a scientist heading the area's first air pollution control agency asked him to try to figure out where smog came from.
 In a study quickly ridiculed by scientists financed by the auto industry, Dr. Haagen-Smit laid out the method by which hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, rising from car tailpipes into Southern California's persistent sunlight, were cooked into photochemical smog. The major component is ozone created through this chemical reaction.
 Dr. Haagen-Smit intended to return to his pineapples, but after he heard his work disparaged in a Caltech lecture hall, he devoted himself to pollution science, eventually becoming the first head of the statewide Air Resources Board.
 In laying out the formula for what ailed Los Angeles, Dr. Haagen-Smit had fingered its principal sources: cars and oil refineries. And as more became known about these and other causes of pollution, lawmakers began to focus on controlling them.
 Fifteen years after Los Angeles's most breathless summer, Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which took many of its core concepts from California. 
 The law set standards for air quality, and like California's regulations, it established deadlines for government action. It embraced the idea that if you tell an industry it must reduce emissions, its engineers will figure out how -- a route called ''technology forcing.'' 
 By terms of the 1970 Clean Air Act, California was the only state that retained its freedom to regulate as it saw fit. By the mid-1970's, the state's regulations, which held sway over 10 percent of Detroit's market, forced the installation of catalytic converters in cars, and later eliminated from gasoline the lead that was poisoning the converters. The federal government followed.
 Southern Californians ''just assume that air pollution is something you can make go away,'' said Mary Nichols, a former state official and the chief of the air division of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration. ''We don't feel we have to settle for it.'' 
 Since 1980, Southern California's population has increased by 60 percent and cars are tracing twice as many miles across the region -- 337 million a year. But the number of days when ozone levels over an eight-hour period violated the federal standard has dropped to 88 from 186; emissions of nitrogen oxide have dropped by two-thirds and those of carbon monoxide by more than 80 percent.
 An expanding bureaucracy, led by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, also took on other sources of pollution; measuring, monitoring and regulating emissions from nearly every corner of daily life, including backyard incinerators, oil-based paints, street sweepers, dry cleaners and barbecue lighter fluid. 
 ''We've always been pushing the limits to find out where we can go,'' the chairman of the South Coast district, William Burke, said in a recent interview. ''Does that aggravate people? Yes. Does it get things done? Yes.''
 A little after 7 most mornings, Mike Brewer, 53, drives his orange 1988 Kenworth truck, with its 350 horsepower Cummins engine, up to the offices of a freight business in Rancho Dominguez. There he finds out each day what he is picking up at the ports -- office chairs? art? fireworks? shoes? cars? -- and which warehouse is expecting the cargo. From Rancho Dominguez he gets on the 710 Freeway and heads for one of the ports.
 From a dog-walking park above one corner of the Port of Los Angeles, the scale of the industrial landscape is staggering. The cranes and gantries around the 270 ship berths look like dozens of monster erector sets. 
 The acreage of the two ports would cover Manhattan from the Battery to 34th Street.
 Mr. Brewer has been hauling cargo from the twin ports since 1988, making two to four trips a day. Now, he said, ''The air is way thicker because you have your older trucks and all the different machinery.'' The port averages 35,000 truck trips a day, its Web site reports.
 From the elevated park, the orange cab of Mr. Brewer's truck comes into view, snaking through containers to the place where a smaller crane, called a heister, picks up a 20- or 40-foot container from a stack three high and swings it onto the chassis that has been given to Mr. Brewer for the trip. 
 Each trip means separate waits to pick up the chassis and the container; he could wait in as many as four lines. As these lines lengthen during the summer, the pollution builds up.
 Last weekend, the two ports began all-night cargo-moving operations as part of an effort to minimize truck lines and accelerate the flow of goods. But it is unclear if the surrounding neighborhoods, where nighttime truck noise is unwelcome at best, will consider this an improvement. 

Problem at the Ports
 In 2004, some 40 percent of national seaborne imports, 235.7 million metric tons, came through the two ports. In 2001, diesel engines of all types -- trucks, ships, locomotives, heisters -- that carried them through the Port of Los Angeles alone directly pumped out 2.3 tons of tiny soot a day into the region, a study by port officials showed. Recent scientific studies have linked these particles to cancer and cardiovascular disease, the country's most pervasive killers.
 A major study sponsored by the South Coast district in 1998 showed that the cancer risk for residents of Long Beach, to the immediate northeast of the ports, was twice as great as the risk for people in west-central Los Angeles and four times as high as the risk for those near Topanga Canyon. Diesel particulates from trucks, ships and locomotives, the study said, accounted for 70 percent of the risk. 
 While California has been successful in regulating cars and gasoline, it faces daunting obstacles with trains and container ships. Since 1990, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has had the sole authority to regulate locomotives. Container ships are the province of the International Maritime Organization. Federal rules put into effect in 2000 and last year will reduce sulfur, a building block of the toxic tiny soot, in diesel fuel used in trucks. But the standards apply only to fuel used in new engines, and small-business men like Mr. Brewer keep their trucks, which are a major capital investment, as long as possible.
 Last year, the E.P.A. announced a plan to cut the sulfur content of locomotive fuel over five years beginning in 2007. Some California regulators say the limits were too long in coming. But Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality at the environmental agency, said the agency followed a logical progression, first tackling the most easily achievable emissions cuts, mandating changes in internal engine dynamics in 1997. Then it moved to regulate fuel.
 On the container ships, most engines use a so-called bunker fuel that contains as much as 30,000 parts per million of sulfur, 10 times the amount in diesel fuel used in older trucks and 2,000 times as much as American diesel fuel will contain in 2010.
 Under an international agreement that took effect in May, countries can create zones where ship fuel can have no more than 15,000 parts per million of sulfur. But it has no effect in the United States because the Senate has not ratified the treaty; it has been preoccupied with another maritime treaty, the Law of the Sea.
 The notion that the biggest contributor of toxic soot is so difficult to regulate has incensed community leaders in the San Pedro section of Los Angeles, the ports' nearest neighbor. 
 ''I'd go over these two bridges,'' said Noel Park, the head of the San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners United, referring to the bridges that pass over the ports, ''and I'd be above the line of old beat-up trucks. I'd wonder how long I could hold my breath.'' 
 While neighbors fear the ports' growth, they have also used it as an opening. The Natural Resources Defense Council, acting on homeowners' behalf, sued to block one company, China Shipping, from expanding its terminal at the Port of Los Angeles until the environmental effect could be studied. 
 China Shipping agreed to a settlement that transformed its docking and unloading operations. Instead of using diesel power to keep equipment running, the ships would plug into electric power offered by the terminal. And the port agreed to contribute $55 million to this and other mitigation measures, including $10 million to help drivers like Mr. Brewer buy new, cleaner rigs.
 The success of the suit has spurred Southern Californians in the State Legislature to redouble their efforts to put through legislation controlling the ports. A proposal to require whatever steps necessary to keep port pollution in the South Coast from increasing has passed the Senate and is being considered in the Assembly.
 In recent years, shippers and their landlords in the twin ports have made adjustments, though their representatives say they had already been working on cooperative solutions. 
 Incentive programs, which promote emissions cleanup by, for instance, giving ships with cleaner-burning fuels the right to jump to the head of the line, were under way before the China Shipping settlement, said T.L. Garrett, the vice president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association in Long Beach. 
 ''It's one thing to be part of the solution when you're doing it for all the right reasons,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''It's another when you're being told: 'You're a bad guy and you have to do this.'''
 And Mr. Garrett, a former port official, said shippers were wary of offering voluntary reductions, fearing that ''eventually someone is going to turn that into a mandatory requirement.'' 
 ''In the absence of a regulatory framework,'' he said, ''the industry has stepped forward to reduce emissions beyond what they are required to.'' 

The Cost of Cleaning Up
 Though Bob Wyman, a lifelong resident of Los Angeles, can remember when it was painful to breathe, he says government edicts on emissions, while ''highly successful'' in the past, could pose problems in more parlous economic times. Mr. Wyman, a lawyer who represents the Port of Long Beach and several goods-movement companies, says that because of the port's economic importance, regulation has to be leavened with market incentives to keep its costs down.
 ''We have to get this one right,'' he said, ''so we need to be careful to select control strategies that can deliver air quality objectives at an affordable cost.'' 
 The Bush administration has sought to amend the Clean Air Act to give industry more flexibility while still reducing emissions over time. The measure is stalled in Congress, but changes in regulations this year could accomplish much of what the administration wants. They stretch out cleanup deadlines facing refineries, factories and power plants and adopt a market-based approach to cleaning the air by letting plants that exceed pollution limits buy ''pollution allowances'' from cleaner plants. 
 The changes are likely to have most impact east of the Mississippi River and a limited effect in California, largely because of the state's regulatory independence. 
 ''We act even if the feds don't exist,'' said V. John White, who has worked on clean air programs for 30 years and is now a consultant and environmental lobbyist in Sacramento.
 But California's progress is not constant. Ozone levels actually rose in 2002 and 2003 before falling again last year. In 2004, a 10-year study of a group of children growing up in the Los Angeles basin showed that the lungs of active children growing up in the areas of the thickest ozone had 10 percent to 20 percent less capacity than those of their counterparts in cleaner areas.
 ''The statistics would show that you're going to die younger and be more likely to have more heart and lung disease,'' said John Peters, the professor who headed the study for the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.
 And port traffic will only increase.
 ''This is the damage being done now,'' Professor Peters said. ''It doesn't make sense to add more pollution.''

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators for June Show U.S. on Sound Footing 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Consumer spending increased by 0.8 percent in June as shoppers took advantage of sales incentives from auto manufacturers, a government report showed on Tuesday. 
 Separately, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 1 percent in June on strong demand for computers and electronics. The June gain matched Wall Street expectations and came after an upwardly revised 3.6 percent increase in May. 
 In its report on June spending, the Commerce Department said income in June rose 0.5 percent, slightly more than analysts had expected. 
 The June consumer spending increase was a rebound from May, when inflation-adjusted spending declined 0.1 percent. 
 ''The June gains in personal spending and income point to a pretty firm close to the second quarter, which puts the economy in a good position at the start of the third quarter. The underlying trend of growth is fairly solid,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. 
 An inflation index contained in the report showed prices were steady, excluding food and energy costs. 
 The factory orders report and strong July car sales offered the latest evidence of a pickup in manufacturing activity. 
 Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a main gauge of business confidence, rose 3.9 percent in June.
 Economists said factories were probably increasing production after strong demand helped them cut inventories in the second quarter. 
 ''The manufacturing sector has worked through its inventory overhang and it's receiving a good stream of orders,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management. 
 The extension of employee discounts to the car-buying public, which helped Ford post its first year-over-year sales gain in 13 months, are squeezing automaker profit margins. But they have helped move out unsold 2005 models. 
 ''The employee discount programs have been a huge success,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ''It appears that unit auto sales for July will exceed the 20 million (annual rate) mark for only the third time in history.'' 
 Inflation-adjusted spending on durable goods -- products expected to last three or more years -- shot up 3.3 percent in June, reflecting in part sales spurred by General Motor's introduction of the employee discount program. Spending on nondurable items rose 0.9 percent.

PERSON: Jay Hammond

HEADLINE: Jay Hammond, 83, Governor Of Alaska Who Paid Dividends

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Jay Hammond, who went from bush pilot, trapper and professional hunter to become the fourth governor of Alaska, earning Alaskans' gratitude by giving them annual dividends from gushing new oil revenues, died on Tuesday at his home at Lake Clark, in southwest Alaska. He was 83.
 The National Park Service alerted state troopers that Mr. Hammond's body had been found, according to The Associated Press. Greg Wilkinson, a spokesman for the troopers, told A.P. that the cause of death had not been determined. 
As governor from 1975 to 1982, Mr. Hammond was in office during the two-year construction, ending in 1977, of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline. Mr. Hammond, a Republican, persuaded voters to approve the establishment of a permanent fund to handle the state's petroleum royalties. 
 The fund, which today totals about $30 billion, is used to help cover state expenditures, while interest from it pays the annual dividends. Payments peaked in 2000, with $1,963.86 paid to each person with at least a year's residency in the state; last year's payment was $919.84.
 During Mr. Hammond's term, federal land reserves in Alaska grew sharply, fishery stocks revived and a broad-based tourism industry was established. 
 Mr. Hammond became known for balancing his strong advocacy of environmental conservation with political conservatism.
 He insisted in an interview with The New York Times in 1980 that even the dividend given to every Alaskan of every age and income since 1976 had ''a conservative political purpose.'' He said it put a brake on government spending by encouraging politicians to hold down expenditures so there would be more to distribute to people.
 An article by Sean Butler in Dissent magazine this year called the Alaskan dividend the world's only guaranteed income paid by the government to its citizens. Vernon Smith, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, called the fund ''a model governments all over the world would be wise to copy,'' according to the article.
 In Alaska, Mr. Hammond was a local hero. Barrel-chested, bearded and boisterous, he was compared to a Kodiak bear, though few Kodiaks habitually wear a flannel shirt and black beret, as he often did.
 Jay S. Hammond was born in 1922 in Troy, N.Y., and, as the son of a Methodist minister, grew up in a series of small towns, some in Vermont. He spent two years at Pennsylvania State University studying petroleum engineering, then left to enlist in the Marines and became a pilot in the South Pacific in World War II. A fellow pilot, a Texan, captured his imagination with tales of his work as a bush pilot in Alaska.
 Mr. Hammond arrived in 1946 in what was then a United States territory in a rickety amphibious biplane. He spent his first two years in Alaska traveling by dog team to trap animals for furs, then worked as a laborer. After suffering a severe back injury lifting a barrel of tar, he enrolled at the University of Alaska, graduating in 1949 with a degree in biology. He then worked as a professional hunter for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
 In 1952, he married Bella Gardiner, the daughter of an Eskimo mother and a man of Scottish descent who came to the state seeking gold. They had two daughters, Dana and Heidi. 
 After leaving the governorship, Mr. Hammond returned to flying fishing parties into the wilderness, among other pursuits.

HEADLINE: Fund Managers Increase the Ante In Philanthropy

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Jamie Niven, the vice chairman of Sotheby's auction house, was having an unusual problem. He could not give away a new car. 
 Mr. Niven was responsible for dispensing with a Ford Mustang that was a door prize at the Robin Hood Ball, a charity event in New York that is dominated by wealthy hedge fund managers. But the accountant who initially won it in a raffle immediately donated it back. When Mr. Niven tried to auction it, those winners did the same. Finally, Mr. Niven insisted on giving the Mustang to the next bidder for $50,000. The car brought in a total of $390,000.
''Normally the car is the most important thing you are selling,'' said Mr. Niven, who aside from his regular work runs about 30 charity auctions a year. ''At Robin Hood, it's the door prize.'' 
 As hedge fund wealth makes itself felt in real estate prices and rare art auctions, it is also reverberating through New York's philanthropic organizations. To the delight of fund-raisers, the success of hedge funds is creating a new pool of rich donors worth tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 The Robin Hood Foundation, which puts its money toward fighting poverty in New York, has long been in a category of its own when it comes to star-studded, big-dollar charity galas: the crowd of 4,000 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in May raised an eye-popping $32 million. But the tightly knit and rich hedge fund community that helped build Robin Hood is no longer so small, and it has more money to put to work behind a wider range of causes. 
 Managers of hedge funds -- private pools of managed capital that have historically produced outsize returns while charging unusually high fees -- can take home as much as 20 percent of the profits. The amount that hedge funds manage has soared from $40 billion 15 years ago to $1 trillion today, meaning billions in profits for investors and managers. 
 ''The explosion of the hedge fund community makes it extremely attractive'' to charities, said Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, which just raised $1.4 million with its first Hedge Fund Council gala. Because fund managers tend to be young and not yet wedded to a cause, boards of nonprofits see them as a natural target. ''We thought it could be a major breakthrough, and we think it was,'' Mr. Levy said of the event. 
 Of course, these donations are not entirely altruistic. The benefits include tax deductions, the chance to hobnob with competitors, colleagues and even stars, and a shot at becoming part of the fabric of New York society. Alongside the Who's Who of hedge funds at the Robin Hood ball were media moguls, corporate titans and Gwyneth Paltrow.
 On their own and through industry groups like Hedge Fund Cares, which combats child abuse, and 100 Women in Hedge Funds, which is focused on issues like education and women's health, managers are involved in a wide range of causes. No organization tracks the amount of donations involved, but interviews with charity directors, development offices and hedge fund groups indicate that hedge fund money is making its way, sometimes quietly, into organizations across New York and the country. 
 ''Whatever is evident from Robin Hood and Hedge Fund Cares and 100 Women in Hedge Funds is only a fraction of what they do,'' said Rob Davis, founder of Hedge Fund Cares, which has donated more than $15 million since 1998 to organizations fighting child abuse. ''Most hedge managers are quiet and private. There are a lot of people who have private foundations and they send checks and ask not to have their names in the program.''
 Robin Hood supports the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society, a program focused on getting parents involved at a Crown Heights day care center as well as Abraham House Providing, which offers educational and support services to the families of individuals incarcerated in the Bronx.
 To be sure, charitable giving by hedge fund titans is hardly new. George Soros has given away $5 billion through the Open Society Institute, and Julian Robertson, formerly of Tiger Asset Management, is involved in everything from environmental issues to New York City charter schools.
 But the growth in the hedge fund industry has many rich money managers looking for investment ideas in the nonprofit world. And just as they do in their work, they demand a lot from those investments.
 ''This group is focused on outcomes,'' said Geoffrey Canada, executive director of the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit group in New York that has grown with the help of donations from hedge fund managers. ''They want to be sure that when there are problems we have a plan to deal with it.''
 Growth in the industry -- and its profitability -- have been staggering. At the end of 2004 there were 3,307 hedge funds, up 74 percent since 1999, according to Hedge Fund Research, based in Chicago. The average hedge fund manager on a Top 25 list published by the trade magazine Alpha made $251 million from fees and profits on investments in 2004, up from nearly $136 million three years ago. 
 ''Successful money managers are used to examining companies and figuring out what makes a strong operation,'' said David Saltzman, executive director of Robin Hood. ''They apply that know-how to nonprofits and extraordinary things happen.''
 As newly mega-rich managers look for causes, many are attracted to local organizations where they can have a real impact. ''They want to be hands-on and use their skills set and commitment and smarts to be making a difference -- they don't want to just be giving money,'' said Phoebe C. Boyer, executive director of the Tiger Foundation, one of the organizations Mr. Robertson uses to direct funds to charities, which works to fight poverty and trains its trustees to be effective philanthropists. ''That may for some individuals translate to more community-based activities.'' (Mr. Robertson's foundation has donated $63 million since 1990.) 
 Mr. Davis of Hedge Fund Cares is more blunt: ''If you live in San Francisco and you participate, don't you want to know that the Bay Area will be served by that?''
 Hedge fund charity events are not limited to New York, nor are they limited to traditional balls. Last November, more than 500 people gathered at Marriott Grosvenor Square in London for the first annual Hedge Fund Fight Nite, a white-collar boxing event in which eight pairs of hedge fund managers took to the ring while their colleagues, in black tie, watched them beat each other up.
 ''There was no better way to get at the deep pockets of hedge funds to give to some charities than to challenge their inner ego and their aggressive nature,'' said Justin Dew, a 31-year-old senior hedge fund specialist at Standard & Poor's. The event raised $500,000 for a few popular British charities.
 The organizers decided not to declare winners in an effort to encourage people to return, but Mr. Dew said that when his timed bout was over, it was clear he had not won. ''There were a bunch of bloody noses, no permanent scars, no broken bones,'' he said. ''Smelling salts were involved.'' 
 For 10 years, the Tomorrows Children's Fund, a charity in Hackensack, N.J., that helps families whose children have terminal illnesses, has been the host of an annual investment research conference. Several money managers, many of them hedge fund managers, are invited to share an investment idea with the audience, like a stock to buy or to bet against, or a trend in the economy. Managers attend to support the cause -- but they also want to know what Carl C. Icahn, the famed corporate raider, is thinking about. This year's event attracted 700 people and raised $2.5 million. 
 While most fund managers are not yet emblazoning their names on hospital pavilions, they have great influence over the charities they choose. 
 Hedge fund money has been the driving force behind the growth of Harlem Children's Zone, which offers social services and education programs for children and families in Harlem. When Stanley Druckenmiller, who once ran the famous Soros Quantum Fund and now runs Duquesne Capital, joined the board, he rebuilt it and led the organization's efforts to transform what it did, how it was financed and how it would be run, Mr. Canada said. Now its board is packed with hedge fund luminaries. In 1998, it had an $8 million operating budget; this year that figure is $35 million. 
 Mr. Canada said he believed that many hedge fund managers had been accustomed to giving their money to their colleges and universities and to the arts, but Robin Hood changed that. ''The thought of organizations helping homeless people or organizations trying to rehabilitate people, it wasn't sexy; they didn't get it,'' he said. ''These guys have become the leaders in bringing real money to the tough issues.''
 The hedge fund world has another draw for charities: while secretive to outsiders, it's tightly woven on the inside. That creates a competitive cycle in virtue. One manager gets involved and pulls in his friends; they outgive one another and the charity raises record amounts. 
 Mr. Levy of Lincoln Center wanted to capitalize on this phenomenon, so he brainstormed with Dan Stern, who runs Reservoir Capital, and Eric Mindich, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who recently began his own hedge fund. They decided to organize an event to show off different sides of Lincoln Center in a way that would capture hedge fund managers' attention (and plumb their deep pockets). 
 The April event for the Hedge Fund Council, which was modeled on the center's Real Estate Council, featured Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central, and Lincoln Center stars like Audra McDonald and Savion Glover. It attracted big names in the industry and raised $1.4 million after expenses.
 ''The hedge fund community is an important economic engine in the city -- as industries ebb and flow, this one's in a good position,'' Mr. Stern said. 
 ''It's also an important demographic for Lincoln Center,'' he said, pointing out that many arts organizations are eager to expand their donor base to include younger people. 
 Hedge fund managers are not likely to replace New York's established money -- the patrons of the arts, hospitals and other charities that pepper the city's society pages. It would be hard for them to top Sanford I. Weill, the Citigroup chairman, whose $100 million donation to Cornell University prompted it to rename its medical school after him. But as Robin Hood shows, the industry can produce lucrative results for nonprofits. 
 Apart from the Mustang problem, Mr. Niven, the auctioneer, had a good night. He was asked to sell ''investments'' in the city's public school libraries, and he thought he would sell five. In 30 seconds he sold 21 to people who raised their hands to indicate pledges of $250,000 each. 
 Mr. Saltzman of Robin Hood has even greater ambitions. ''We're in the business of saving lives, so I would like Robin Hood to raise more money than any other nonprofit organization,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Europe Threatens to Punish Iran if Nuclear Work Restarts 

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting for this article from Tehran.

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
France, Britain and Germany formally warned Iran on Tuesday that they would end their two-year negotiations over the country's nuclear program and pursue punitive action if Iran carried out its threat to resume sensitive nuclear work.
 But underscoring their determination to keep the talks going, the Europeans also asked Iran to wait until they presented it with a package of incentives before breaking its freeze on uranium conversion and enrichment activities.
''Were Iran to resume currently suspended activities, our negotiations would be brought to an end, and we would have no other option but to pursue other courses of action,'' the foreign ministers of the three countries said in a letter to Hassan Rowhani, the head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. ''We therefore call upon Iran not to resume suspended activities or take other unilateral steps.'' 
 The letter, which is backed by the 25-nation European Union, comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, has agreed to Iran's request to install surveillance cameras at its nuclear facility in Isfahan to enable Iran to resume its uranium enrichment activities under international safeguards.
 Once the cameras are functioning, which will take about a week, Iran could resume activities and legally still be in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, two senior I.A.E.A. officials said.
 But if it did so, Iran would be breaking its voluntary agreement with the Europeans to indefinitely suspend such activities as long as negotiations continued. 
 In Iran on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, rejected the Europeans' warning, vowing that his country would never abandon its ''legitimate rights'' to peaceful nuclear technology under international law. ''The time for threats and intimidation is over,'' Mr. Asefi was quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA as saying.
 But one of the senior I.A.E.A. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under agency rules, said that agency inspectors had visited the Isfahan site Tuesday and that Iran had not yet broken protective seals and started the machines working again.
 The verbal battle is the latest -- and potentially most serious -- contest between Iran and the three European countries acting under the umbrella of the European Union. If Iran carries out its threat to resume nuclear work, the Europeans, with the prodding of the Bush administration, will have no choice but to seek to have Iran punished in some way by the United Nations Security Council, even if only with a resolution of concern or disapproval.
 Unless Iran is in clear violation of its international obligations, it will be difficult to persuade the Security Council to impose punitive economic measures. 
 The Bush administration is convinced that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons facility and is moving forward to make bombs. The Europeans also believe that Iran wants nuclear weapons, but is determined to at least stall the process through negotiations.
 Indeed, in their letter today, the Europeans also informed Iran that they intended to call a special session of the Vienna-based I.A.E.A. ''in the next few days'' to decide what to do next about Iran's nuclear activities.
 The Iranian threat may be part of a larger strategy to keep its options open as its new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, takes over on Wednesday, officials involved in the negotiations said. Iran may be trying to wrest more concessions from the Europeans in exchange for continuing the suspension of uranium conversion and enrichment activities, as laid out in an agreement with the Europeans last November.
 Or Iran may be gambling that it can restart its activities under 24-hour international inspection in order to split the international community and avoid any punishment.
 In Paris, France's foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, told reporters that the Iranian threat might spark ''a major international crisis.''
 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, a former foreign minister of France, told Europe 1 radio that the issue would be sent to the Security Council ''if Iran doesn't back off.''
 The Europeans are putting the final touches on detailed, step-by-step proposals that include economic, security, political and technological incentives for Iran, which will be presented as early as this weekend.
 But officials say that the proposal does not allow Iran to resume the uranium-related activities that it believes it is entitled to under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The treaty allows signers to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
 At the conversion plant in Isfahan, uranium ore known as yellowcake is turned into UF6, or uranium hexafluoride gas, which can later be fed into centrifuges to be enriched. Enriched uranium can be used for peaceful energy purposes or in a bomb-making program.
 Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes, a position that Mr. Asefi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, reiterated. He also told the IRNA news agency that the work ''will be under the supervision of the U.N. nuclear agency.''
 A bomb exploded Tuesday morning on the 10th floor of a commercial building in northern Tehran, where British Petroleum, British Airways and DaimlerChrysler have offices. There were no injuries, and there was no evidence to link the explosion to the current standoff between Iran and the European countries.

HEADLINE: Talks on North Korea's Nuclear Program May Be on Verge of Suspension

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY; Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programs may be suspended or even break off altogether if the participants cannot settle on a summary of principles for future disarmament talks, the chief American negotiator said Tuesday. 
 ''Whether we have a draft that everyone agrees on, whether we have a recess of some kind, I don't know yet,'' the negotiator, Christopher Hill, told reporters here after an eighth day of the talks, which include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia.
''I think the issue is how one winds this up,'' he added. ''That is, does it wind up with an agreement, does it wind up with parties saying, 'Well, we have to do some more substantial consultation in capitals,' or does it wind up in a flat-out disagreement.'' 
 The negotiators considered the third draft of a proposed joint statement on North Korean nuclear disarmament on Tuesday, and the host country, China, then issued a fourth version for them to consider overnight, Mr. Hill said.
 ''The Chinese side is really trying to push to resolution,'' Mr. Hill said.
 But some envoys showed growing frustration and uncertainty about the progress of the talks. The chief Japanese negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, told reporters on Tuesday that the ''basic points of disagreement have not been resolved.'' He said exchanges were ''very tough, strong and serious.'' 
 Mr. Hill said the countries were by no means sure of agreeing on even broad principles. ''There are a lot of differences between the North Korean side on one hand and everyone else on the other hand,'' he said.
 The United States and North Korea appear to remain at loggerheads over Washington's insistence that Pyongyang end all its nuclear programs, including ostensibly civilian power generation projects, if it wants to receive economic aid and greater government contact.
 On Tuesday, the chief North Korean negotiator, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, sought to play down differences between the two nations in his first public comments since the talks began. 
 ''Although North Korea and the United States have differing views, we hope we can reduce the differences as far as possible and achieve a result,'' the official New China News Agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying. He said North Korea would give up nuclear weapons, ''if the U.S. abandons its nuclear threat against us and establishes mutual trust.''

HEADLINE: From Giant Leaps to Baby Steps

BYLINE: By Eugene F. Kranz. 
Eugene F. Kranz, author of ''Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control From Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond,'' is a former Apollo flight director.

DATELINE: Houston 

 BODY:
TO read and listen to the coverage about the space shuttle, you would think NASA's mission team has taken careless risks with the lives of the seven astronauts who went into space on the Discovery last Tuesday. During the launching, foam fell off the external tank. For the risk-averse, the only acceptable thing to do now is retire the shuttle program immediately and wait for the divine arrival of the next generation of spacecraft. I am disgusted at the lack of courage and common sense this attitude shows. 
 All progress involves risk. Risk is essential to fuel the economic engine of our nation. And risk is essential to renew American's fundamental spirit of discovery so we remain competitive with the rest of the world. 
My take on the current mission is very straightforward. The shuttle is in orbit. To a great extent mission managers have given the spacecraft a clean bill of health. Let us remember that this is a test flight. I consider it a remarkably successful test so far. 
 The technical response to the Columbia accident led to a significant reduction in the amount of debris striking this shuttle during launching. Mission managers have said that the external tank shed 80 percent less foam this time than on previous launchings. Only in the news media, apparently, is an 80 percent improvement considered a failure. Rather than quit, we must now try to reduce even more the amount of foam that comes off the tank. 
 The instruments and video equipment developed to assess the launching and monitor debris falling from the tank worked superbly. For the first time, the mission team knows what is happening, when it is happening and the flight conditions under which it occurred. This was a major mission objective, and it is an impressive achievement. 
 Having spent more than three decades working in the space program, I know that all of the flights of the early days involved some levels of risk. Some of those risks, in hindsight, seem incomprehensible by today's timid standards. If we had quit when we had our first difficulties in Project Mercury, we would have never put John Glenn on the Atlas rocket Friendship 7 in 1961. Two of the previous five Atlas rockets test-fired before Friendship 7 had exploded on liftoff. 
 On Gemini 9, 10 and 11, all in 1966, we had complications with planned spacewalks that placed the astronauts at risk. Rather than cancel the walks, we faced the risks and solved the problems. These set the stage for Gemini 12 later that year, during which Buzz Aldrin spent more than five hours outside the capsule and confirmed to NASA that spacewalks could be considered an operational capability. 
 Eventually, this ability enabled astronauts to retrieve satellites and repair and maintain the Hubble space telescope; and during the current mission, spacewalks were used to repair a gyroscope on the International Space Station and will allow the crew to fix some of the damage that occurred during the launching. These are the rewards for the risks we took on those early Gemini flights.
 I understand the tragedy inherent in risk-taking; I witnessed the fire aboard Apollo 1 in 1967 that killed three crew members. It filled us with anger at ourselves and with the resolve to make it right. After the fire we didn't quit; we redesigned the Apollo command module. During the Apollo missions that followed, we were never perfect. But we were determined and competent and that made these missions successful. 
 I see the same combination of anger, resolve and determination in the space shuttle program today. These people are professionals who understand risk, how to reduce it and how to make that which remains acceptable. Most important, the current mission has demonstrated the maturity of the shuttle team that endured the Columbia disaster and had the guts to persevere. This is the most important aspect of the recovery from the Columbia accident, and is a credit to the great team NASA now has in place, headed by its administrator, Michael Griffin. 
 There are many nations that wish to surpass us in space. Does the ''quit now'' crowd really believe that abandoning the shuttle and International Space Station is the way to keep America the pre-eminent space-faring nation? Do they really believe that a new spacecraft will come without an engineering challenge or a human toll? The path the naysayers suggest is so out of touch with the American character of perseverance, hard work and discovery that they don't even realize the danger in which they are putting future astronauts -- not to mention our nation.

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article yesterday about the need to take risks in space exploration misstated the year of John Glenn's flight in the Friendship 7 capsule. It was 1962, not 1961.

HEADLINE: Amid Sudan Riots, a Fighter Takes the Role of Peacemaker 

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NEW SITE, Sudan, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Salva Kiir Mayardit, the newly installed chairman of the Sudan People's Liberation Army who is expected to be selected as vice president of Sudan, is a fierce fighter with traditional Dinka tribal scarring on his forehead and eyes that betray little.
 Mr. Kiir -- who takes over for John Garang, the Sudanese-rebel-leader-turned-vice-president who died in a helicopter crash over the weekend -- has fought shoulder to shoulder and occasionally face to face with Mr. Garang for two decades. 
He now finds himself fighting for peace. A deal aimed at ending Africa's longest civil war, which pits Sudan's Arab Islamist government against southern rebels, was at a critical stage when Mr. Garang died. 
 For the second straight day, southerners rioted Tuesday in Khartoum, the capital, out of fury that the government might have had a hand in Mr. Garang's death. After 36 deaths on Monday, the scene was tense with riot police officers in the streets and a dusk-to-dawn curfew in place.
 It is now up to Mr. Kiir, the consensus choice to replace Mr. Garang, to settle the violence and keep the peace agreement on track.
 His heroics at a battle in which the rebels briefly seized the town of Pashala, near Sudan's border with Ethiopia, are still remembered 21 years later. The rebel movement was young then, and Mr. Kiir's surprise victory over the Sudanese government forces prompted many more people to join.
 ''It has been a very long time,'' Mr. Kiir, 54, said wistfully on Tuesday of his long career as a guerrilla fighter, stretching back to the early 1970's. Mr. Kiir spent years with the Sudanese Army, but defected to the rebel side in 1983. 
 Mr. Kiir is as tall and imposing as his predecessor, but he lacks much of the flair of Mr. Garang, who studied at Grinnell College, held a doctorate in economics from Iowa State University and received military training in the United States.
 Still, Mr. Kiir speaks English, Arabic and his native Dinka, as did Mr. Garang, and is steeped in the history of the armed struggle that has consumed his life.
 Mr. Kiir sits quietly most of the time at the political meetings he has presided over nonstop since Mr. Garang's death, colleagues say, stroking his bushy beard and surveying the room. But when he speaks, he does so bluntly, like the career military man that he is.
 ''I hope you have no ammunition in these things,'' he said of the microphones set before him in his first interview with reporters on Tuesday afternoon at this command center in a southeastern corner of Sudan.
 Mr. Kiir speaks glowingly of Mr. Garang these days and pledges to push forward his predecessor's vision of modernizing the neglected south of Sudan.
 But Mr. Kiir was chastising Mr. Garang just months ago for his autocratic leadership style.
 Mr. Kiir's protests prompted Mr. Garang to convene a crisis meeting last fall in the interim southern capital, Rumbek. In that session Mr. Kiir won strong support for his critique of the rebel commander, but ultimately his concerns were pushed aside. The peace talks were in a crucial phase at the time, and others in the movement believed that Mr. Garang required their full support.
 In the months after that confrontation, there was a widespread expectation that Mr. Garang would sideline his deputy. In fact, some people seen as close to Mr. Kiir lost out on important assignments in the government that Mr. Garang was putting together.
 But just weeks ago, Mr. Garang appointed Mr. Kiir as his deputy, which rebel leaders saw as a signal from Mr. Garang that he had become more inclusive. 
 In the 21 years he ruled the S.P.L.A., as the rebel force is known, Mr. Garang was long criticized as an autocrat. In but one example, he summarily disbanded the rebel movement's National Liberation Council earlier this year, saying the cadre of rebel elders had served its purpose during wartime. Mr. Garang appointed many of the elders to top leadership posts, but that did not stop members from crying foul.
 ''I went to him in Khartoum and said, 'Why did you disband the council?''' said Lual Diing Woll, 71, a member of Mr. Garang's inner circle. ''He said, 'I decided.' Then I left.''
 That was frequently the response Mr. Garang gave critics. ''The problem was he made decisions by himself, and if he made a mistake he'd never go back,'' Mr. Diing said. ''He made decisions alone.''
 Mr. Kiir glossed over their disagreements on Tuesday. ''Whether his style was good or not good is no longer relevant,'' he said, adding that his concerns were never meant to torpedo the peace accord, signed in January after years of struggle.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Skyways and Tunnels 

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
Like many failed ideas, the skywalks in Cincinnati were built with only the best intentions. 
 They were dreamed up in a fit of 1960's urban renewal -- a development guru's idea for making downtown Cincinnati easier to navigate and easier to enjoy. The city erected a small network of second-story bridges that spanned the streets and linked offices and hotels, allowing people to stroll through downtown without stepping onto the sidewalk.
Two dozen cities across the country pursued similar plans over the last 30 years, building skywalks and underground retail catacombs to keep businesses and stores from fleeing to suburbs and shopping malls. They ensconced shoppers and office workers in well-lighted, climate-controlled environments and insulated them from crime, cold and urban blight. 
 But now, many of these cities are gripped with builders' remorse. They say the skyways and tunnels have choked off pedestrian traffic, hurt street-level retailers and limited development in the city core.
 ''The skywalks were not the best-developed scheme in recent history and have not served us all that well,'' said Jim Tarbell, a Cincinnati councilman.
 And now, as cities try to draw residents downtown with loft conversions and tax incentives, several are trying to divert pedestrians back to the street and do away with the walkways. Critics say the walkways are too antiseptic and too controlled and have transformed cities into places to pass through, not live in.
 ''If I could take a cement mixer and pour cement in and clog up the tunnels, I would do it today,'' said Laura Miller, the mayor of Dallas, referring to the city's tunnels. ''It was the worst urban planning decision that Dallas has ever made. They thought it was hip and groovy to create an underground community, but it was a death knell.''
 This attitude shift shows that city planners and officials now see the pulse of their downtown not in its office towers and 9-to-5 workers, but in street cafes and restaurants, sidewalks and pedestrian traffic during the day, after work and on weekends.
 ''At the time they were built, they were seen as a way of competing with the suburbs,'' said Dave Feehan, director of the International Downtown Association, a collection of city-center groups. ''Remember the fear of crime people had 20 years ago? Downtowns were seen as unsafe places and places people didn't want to be.''
 But now?
 ''People are saying, if we had it to do all over again, we wouldn't do it,'' Mr. Feehan said.
 Dallas has considered offering retailers $2.5 million in incentives if they relocate from the tunnels to the street. Des Moines has limited the expansion of its skywalks. Cincinnati has gone the furthest and approved a plan to tear down pieces of its 30-year-old skywalk system.
 Still, skywalks and tunnels have become crucial arteries of city life in cold-weather places like Fargo, N.D., and Minneapolis, St. Paul and Rochester in Minnesota. 
 Other cities and downtown associations that have soured on their skywalks have no choice but to live with them. Many were built with a mix of public and private money and are now owned, maintained and guarded by the office towers through which they run.
 In Hartford, plans to demolish the Asylum Street skybridge, widely ridiculed as a civic embarrassment, stalled last year over objections from the tenants and leaseholder in the office building on one end of the bridge. Developers who are building a huge residential tower across Asylum Street still hope to tear down the skywalk, but legal disputes could keep it intact for another two years.
 Not so in Cincinnati. In the 1960's, the city asked its director of development, Peter Kory, to build skybridges that would join commercial towers to hotels to a convention center downtown. 
 Mr. Tarbell, the Cincinnati councilman, said the city modeled its skywalks after those in Minneapolis. 
 The skywalks loom over Fountain Square, Cincinnati's central civic plaza, cutting off views and strangling retailers and restaurants on the ground floor. One office building on Vine Street with a skywalk link does not even have a lobby on the street level.
 ''The skywalk -- it's ugly, and the space underneath it is dark and yucky,'' said Charlie Luken, the mayor of Cincinnati. ''The whole area is dead too much of the day.''
 The skywalks deteriorated over the years and were used mostly by office workers looking for cigarette breaks, city officials said. The city paid to build the skywalks, and now pays to maintain them.
 And so, the City Council in June approved a $42 million plan to renovate Fountain Square, which would finance destruction of several pieces of the skywalk, keeping one leg that connects to the Cincinnati Convention Center. Demolition is set to start in August, but not everyone is happy.
 ''It's a very controversial issue because people are used to the thing,'' Mr. Luken said. ''When it rains or snows, they're used to using it.''
 But for what? Exceptions abide, but the businesses that fill skywalks and tunnels mainly serve office workers on lunch breaks, small-bore shoppers and residents seeking relief from the heat, cold or rain. There are copy centers, office-suppliers, diners, candy and coffee shops and a smattering of salons and gift stores, but few high-end restaurants or retailers.
 ''If you come here, people would think we have no retail at all,'' said Cheryl Myers, a senior vice president of Charlotte Center City Planners in North Carolina. 
 In the 1970's, the city began building its Overstreet Mall, a series of retail shops on the second floor of office buildings, connected by skywalks. Today, the skywalks connect 30 downtown blocks, Ms. Myers said. ''Everyone knows it's a mistake,'' she said.
 When walkways bloomed from Dallas to Des Moines, Minneapolis to Tampa, in the 1970's and early 80's, it appeared that White Plains in Westchester County would join the party. The White Plains Mall had sucked retailers and clothing stores from downtown, and vacancy rates were at 30 percent.
 But after planning to build the system, the city cooled on the idea, finally abandoning it in 1998, said Paul Wood, the executive officer for White Plains. It instead supported projects like a sculpture walk, plazas and a farmer's market designed to keep people on the streets.
 ''The skyways really didn't work,'' Mr. Wood said. ''If you're up in a skywalk, you might as well be driving your car.''
 Des Moines began building its three miles of skywalks in 1982, arguing at the time that the $10 million program would save the city. Twenty-three years later, city officials blame the skywalks for the ghostly still sidewalks and ground-floor vacancy rates of 60 percent.
 The city has no plans to rip down its skywalks, but the City Council has passed resolutions limiting their presence to a central Skywalk District downtown. Two years ago, a $50 million entertainment development proposed by AMC Theaters fell apart because the city refused to allow a skywalk to be built over Court Avenue, city officials said.
 ''We negotiated a million ways, but we said, 'You're not going to get it,''' said Chris Coleman, a Des Moines councilman.
 Inside the Dallas Underground, a two-mile tunnel system that supports 90 businesses, the corridors are sometimes bustling, but sometimes deserted and melancholy. Despite the mayor's desire to plug the tunnels and lure businesses away, owners say they are happy to be down below, ready to serve the thousands of people who work above. 
 Others miss the urban rush. One afternoon, George Baum sat in a half-empty dining corridor in the basement of the Renaissance Towers, finishing lunch before he returned to the 19th floor and his job at Nieman Marcus.
 ''There's stuff going on all around downtown, but you don't see it here,'' Mr. Baum said. ''I should get out more.''

HEADLINE: The Imperfect Storm

 BODY:
When trying to explain United Airlines' recent pension default, various analysts and assorted lawmakers often use the phrase ''perfect storm,'' suggesting that an unstoppable combination of impersonal economic forces blindsided the carrier. It's a faulty metaphor. Some of United's problems may have been due to avoidable waste and human greed. Congress should take heed, for the sake of the 44 million American workers who are covered by pensions similar to United's. 
 A recent report by The Times's Mary Williams Walsh documents the likelihood that the United employees who collectively lost $3.4 billion in benefits in the default weren't simply the victims of a bad stock market and low interest rates. From 1999 through 2003, Labor Department records show, some 30 money managers, consultants and other professionals that handled United's pensions earned at least $125 million, paid out of plan assets. During that same period, a huge gap opened between the value of the pensions' assets and the amount owed to present and future retirees -- from a surplus of about $2 billion to a deficit of nearly $7 billion. The record is silent on how individual money managers performed, making it impossible to determine who may have acted in a way that contributed to the pensions' failures.
Even though the federal government is the ultimate insurer for failed pensions, the world of pension investing is largely unregulated. In United's case, that system allowed money managers to make risky bets that included junk bonds, dot-com stocks and, apparently, an Albanian energy venture. A pension auditor told Ms. Walsh that many pension money managers favor actively traded equities, in part because they generate fees and commissions that can be shared with pension consultants who steer business their way. The auditor's observation is supported by a report released last May by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It found that more than half of the consultants who helped pension funds invest their money had outside business relationships that could taint their advice. 
 Congress and the Labor Department, which oversees the federal pension agency, should swiftly investigate the allegations of conflicts of interest and, if warranted, seek redress for bilked workers and retirees. So far, Congress hasn't broached the topic, and the Labor Department has been unresponsive to a written request from one of United's unions, sent in June, for an audit of United's pensions. There's no excuse for foot-dragging. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal pension insurer, is straining under the weight of $63 billion in liabilities. If it should ever collapse, American taxpayers would be the payers of last resort.
 Congress should also impose rules to limit aggressive pension investments and to charge higher pension-insurance premiums to companies that engage in risky investing. Lawmakers have long resisted such interventions, mainly on the grounds that they would distort the free market. That's backward. Government regulation is less distorting than investors' misbehavior, that dreaded ''moral hazard'' -- which is unleashed when investors take undue risks because they are protected by insurance and, in the case of pensions, shielded from having to disclose their performance. And charging higher insurance premiums to high-risk clients is simply common sense.
 Rather than a perfect storm, the United pension debacle may be the tip of an iceberg.

HEADLINE: No Good From Cafta

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Applauding the Cafta 15'' (editorial, July 29), in recommending a pat on the back for the 15 Democrats who broke with the party line to vote in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, claims that Cafta will lift the economies of the six countries into the 21st century by helping job growth in that region.
 You then go on to mention how Cafta will benefit low-income American consumers, who might get to pay 50 cents less for their T-shirts.
 What you are really talking about is Cafta's ushering in a dark, 19th-century Dickens era into these countries, where young children and women will labor in sweatshops making T-shirts that cost 50 cents less and therefore appeal to the pockets of the displaced American workers, especially in the textile industry.

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi on Tuesday settled their differences over a plan to refinance $2.9 billion worth of transportation bonds that the comptroller had canceled, calling it a ''fiscal gimmick.''
 Their agreement calls for the refinancing to go forward, but in a way that both sides now say would save taxpayers $4 million over the life of the bonds instead of costing them an extra $460 million, as Mr. Hevesi had contended when he rejected the plan nearly two weeks ago. 
As a practical matter, the agreement appeared to erase any of the doubts Mr. Hevesi's move had cast on part of a multibillion-dollar plan for transportation projects across the state, according to a statement issued late Tuesday by the Pataki administration.
 ''These funds are an important part of our five-year capital plan, which will help meet New York's transportation needs, create new jobs and keep our economy growing in the future,'' Mr. Pataki said in a joint statement with Mr. Hevesi. The comptroller said that while the new refinancing arrangement would save $1.2 billion, just as the old one did, it did so ''without future additional costs'' to taxpayers.
 The issue was at the core of an increasingly personal argument between the governor, a Republican, and the comptroller, a Democrat, with each side calling into question the other's methods of counting.
 The governor said Mr. Hevesi's decision had led his administration to stop awarding contracts for new transportation projects, though the governor's aides now say those projects will go forward. Mr. Hevesi said the structure of the original deal was unacceptable: it deferred payments of principal for five years and would have added huge costs in future years in exchange for limited savings now.
 To bridge the difference, both sides agreed to use $300 million in debt service reserve funds, which have already been collected from taxpayers, to provide more upfront payments for projects and thereby require less borrowing. In addition, roughly $160 million more will be saved by restructuring the bonds and reducing the length of some, officials said, so that debt service payments will be less costly.
 Under the refinancing, which could go forward on Wall Street as early as this month, payments of principal will still be deferred in the early years, which is anathema to Mr. Hevesi. But in compromising, an aide to the comptroller said, Mr. Hevesi will not cease his overall fight to curb the state's expensive borrowing habits. 
 Edmund J. McMahon Jr., the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, part of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research group, said the agreement appeared to be a ''marginal improvement'' over the one Mr. Hevesi had rejected.
 ''One way or another, they've got to pay for this capital plan, and they've got to do it with taxpayers' money,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''If this agreement means they will use less debt, that's good. If some of the debt they are using will now be less expensive, that's good, too.''

HEADLINE: Little-Noticed Crisis at Black Colleges

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
IN a classroom of white walls and black students, an air-conditioned sanctuary from a sweltering July morning, Devon Moore walked toward the front table with his homework. He had clipped out a newspaper article and now gave a one-sentence synopsis of its subject, safety problems in pickup trucks. He identified a word new to him, ''adjacent,'' and a word that used a prefix or suffix, ''faulty.'' He was less than four weeks from starting his freshman year of college.
 Devon had passed up a senior-class trip to Atlanta to enroll in the Summer Academy at Texas Southern University here, and at the outset of the eight-week session, he had wondered why. Having graduated from high school, he figured, ''I already knew everything there was to learn.'' That illusion crashed and burned on Day 1, when the math instructor taught a lesson on slope and even gave an overnight assignment.
For some 185 incoming freshmen like him, and indeed for Texas Southern as an institution, the summer courses in reading, writing, and math form one front in a battle to reverse a disturbingly low graduation rate. Of the students who received diplomas last May, only 6 percent had earned their degree in the normal four years, and only 21 percent in six years. Those numbers, incredibly, reflected improvement from prior rates. 
 In its problem and its challenge, Texas Southern has plenty of company. Nationally, the historically black colleges and universities have a six-year graduation rate of 38 percent, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. That is slightly lower than the figure for black students at all other institutions, and roughly 40 percentage points lower than for blacks at elite schools. The situation amounts to a little-noticed crisis in the very institutions that, for their size, play a disproportionate role in educating African-Americans.
 A half-century after Brown v. Board of Education, 40 years after Lyndon Johnson's speech endorsing the concept of affirmative action, and two years after the Supreme Court upheld racial diversity as a factor in admissions, the approximately 80 historically black colleges and universities still enroll more than 10 percent of the African-American students in higher education and award close to 20 percent of degrees.
 These black institutions have produced leaders from Thurgood Marshall to Jesse Jackson to Spike Lee. Their step shows, marching bands, and fraternities and sororities have become integral elements of African-American culture. It is a commonplace in black churches and neighborhoods for parents to believe that their children will have better outcomes in black colleges than in mostly white ones, because the black schools provide a more nurturing, supportive environment, free of white presumptions that blacks are intellectual inferiors or expectations they should portray the role of hip-hop gangsta.
 But what happens when the truism appears less and less true? What happens when an education emergency is ignored except by those enduring it? 
 These are precisely the questions Texas Southern has dealt with, particularly since Priscilla D. Slade became president in 1999. The university has its roots in the civil rights struggle, because it was created by the State of Texas in reaction to the lawsuit of a black man who had been denied admission to the state's all-white law schools. 
 From that rather cynical genesis, Texas Southern has gone on to educate such political figures as the Congressional members Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland. With about 11,000 students, 85 percent of them black, it teaches five times as many African-Americans as does the flagship campus of the University of Texas in Austin.
 What pushed the six-year graduation rate nearly into single digits earlier this decade were factors, both educational and financial, that affect scores of black institutions nationwide. With the desegregation of colleges and universities in the South and the increased recruiting of black students by top universities, what W.E.B. DuBois famously called the ''talented tenth'' no longer heads to places like Texas Southern by default. In fact, the top 10 percent of graduates from any Texas high school are guaranteed admission to the state university system. 
 As a result, the students who come to Texas Southern arrive less prepared and sometimes less committed than their forebears. Roughly one-third of them require remedial classes before they can enter college-level courses. More than 100 of the available spaces in the Summer Academy went unclaimed, even though the program charges no tuition and provides a stipend for books that is worth several hundred dollars.
 ''WHY don't they attend? That's the question of the decade,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Fleming, the director of Texas Southern's academic center. ''The single biggest factor is a lack of motivation. Their world is BET, ghetto rap, going to school dressed like you're going to a club. They're here because their grandmother said to be here, or because their parole officer said it was this or jail.''
 Having taught at Barnard College, Dr. Fleming has seen plenty of anti-intellectualism in more rarefied settings, too. But those students came from families with means and with multigenerational legacies of college education. More than 40 percent of Texas Southern's students represent the first generation in their families to attend college and more than one-quarter have annual household incomes below $20,000.
 The economic impact hobbles black colleges and institutions themselves. For in higher education, the prevailing rule of fund-raising is that the rich get richer. Texas Southern has an endowment of $6 million; across town, Rice University has $3 billion. The best endowed historically black institution, Howard University in Washington, ranks 132nd in the nation with $371 million, according to a survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
 The interest from a large endowment means money for scholarships, research grants and support services, among other things, and all are vital for institutions dealing primarily with students from the working class or below. The gap between the money available from federal Pell grants and even the modest costs here -- about $7,200 yearly for tuition, room and board for Texas residents -- has widened substantially over the past decade. Classes compete with jobs for priority. Dr. Bobbie Henderson, director of a center providing social services to students and their families, recently had to find housing for a dean's list student, already working at McDonald's, who had been reduced to living with her 16-month-old daughter in a car.
 Against these obstacles, President Slade has undertaken a variety of efforts, from a partnership with a nearby high school to the Summer Academy to on-campus day care for students' children to several fund-raising drives. The radio and television host Tavis Smiley has given $1 million of a projected $10 million over 10 years to the journalism school, which now bears his name. Former President George H.W. Bush, a Houston resident, leads a capital campaign with a goal of $50 million. Some $15 million has already come in, and a new science building is under construction.
 Without an array of wealthy alumni, Dr. Slade has turned to corporate leaders and private philanthropists in the city in a separate attempt to build up the paltry endowment. ''This is my hit list,'' she said in her office in late July, brandishing a roster of prominent people to call. A professor of accounting and dean of the business school before being named president, she makesher sales pitch based not on pity or compassion but on bottom-line competitiveness.
 ''You live in the city of Houston,'' she said, recalling a recent appeal to an executive. ''You have a business in the city of Houston. I'd venture that 10 percent of the people who work for you went to Texas Southern. We prepare individuals to work for you. You should want them to be as well prepared as possible. And you know who educates the largest number of those students.''

HEADLINE: China Retreats Now, But It Will Be Back 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Just as a tactical retreat is sometimes useful in winning broader battles, as Sun Tzu wrote 2,500 years ago, the withdrawal of Cnooc Ltd.'s bid for Unocal seems unlikely to derail China Inc.'s economic expansion overseas, and may even hold a few lessons.
 The sight of a Chinese company trying to buy a business once known for the Union 76 brand of gasoline made the proposed deal a lightning rod for American worries about everything from manufacturing job losses to high oil prices to the security of energy supplies. But while Congressional resistance appears to have torpedoed the Chinese bid, the economic fundamentals behind that bid remain in place, from China's vast foreign currency reserves to its ravenous appetite for imported oil.
The most immediate effect from the failed bid may be on Chinese public opinion toward the United States. 
 China's state-controlled media had devoted extensive coverage to the Cnooc bid, presenting it to the public as an exclusively commercial arrangement. 
 ''This is a very symbolic deal that made Chinese people proud of themselves,'' said Jin Canrong, the associate dean of the School of International Studies at People's University. ''Definitely, they will feel some kind of disappointment.'' 
 Chinese officials face the challenge of managing carefully any potential fallout at home from the deal's collapse. It is unlikely, however, to prompt the kind of public criticism directed against Japan this spring for whitewashing sections of history textbooks describing Japanese atrocities in China during World War II. 
 One worry outside China is that the failed bid could encourage Chinese oil companies to step up investing in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, whose leaderships are in poor favor with the White House and yet are eager for any investment they can get. Chinese companies also could buy more oil and gas from Russia and Iran. 
 But Mr. Jin and other specialists said on Tuesday that in any case, Chinese policy makers were likely to react pragmatically, with no effort to dump the central government's huge holdings of American securities and with little deviation from a long-term effort to acquire foreign brands, technology and energy assets. Christopher H. Stephens, a senior partner at Coudert Brothers specializing in mergers and acquisitions in China, said that China's leadership was most likely to opt for a narrowly commercial retaliation against the United States. ''You may see a large aircraft order go to Airbus, or a large oil concession go to BP or Shell,'' he said.
 The withdrawal of the Cnooc bid may even help less politicized deals move forward, like the agreement last Friday by Nanjing Automobile of China to buy an engine factory and other assets from the bankrupt MG Rover Group of Britain. Nanjing Automobile will box up the engine factory equipment and ship it to east-central China for use in engine production there.
 That deal represented an important step by the auto industry of China to address one of its biggest weaknesses, the design and manufacture of reliable engines. China's ability to become an internationally competitive auto manufacturer may be more important to the country's economic success in the long run than its ability to buy oil and gas reserves overseas.
 Many experts question whether China even needs to own more such energy assets. Japanese companies bought overseas oil fields in the 1970's only to conclude that they could more efficiently meet the country's import needs by buying on world markets.
 William C. Ramsay, the deputy executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in an interview three weeks ago in Paris that the purchase of a large overseas oil company by a Chinese company with deep pockets might be good for global energy markets, by providing extra investment in oil fields that might otherwise be neglected. But he questioned whether bids like Cnooc's to own barrels of oil under the ground in foreign countries would increase China's energy security.
 ''It isn't necessarily about barrels but about price,'' he said.
 Philip Andrews-Speed, an expert on China's oil industry at the University of Dundee in Scotland, said that Chinese oil companies were likely to continue the same slow, steady purchase of small oil fields that they have pursued for the last decade, while remaining on the lookout for bigger deals.
 ''You've got a range of possibilities -- they buy whole companies, they buy parts of companies, or they go asset by asset,'' he said. 
 The Chinese government still has $711 billion in foreign currency reserves that need to be invested. The reserves are mostly parked in Treasuries, American mortgage-backed securities and a mishmash of other financial instruments earning single-digit interest rates, a meager return that has become controversial within China.
 A Cnooc deal could have provided another investment opportunity; the government announced in late spring that it would inject $15 billion into a big state-owned bank, which in turn agreed to lend $6 billion for the Cnooc bid. Mr. Jin said that the State Administration of Foreign Exchange would continue managing the country's foreign exchange reserves with an eye to maximizing the return on them. 
 Cnooc's withdrawal comes after Haier, a Chinese manufacturer of appliances and electronics, pulled out of efforts to buy heavily unionized Maytag, a bid that also faced political hurdles, although smaller ones. But a less politicized deal, Lenovo's purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business, went through over the winter with less controversy despite some warnings that important American technology might end up in the hands of a potentially hostile power.
 One lesson may be that Chinese companies are likely to complete deals that do not directly antagonize any large economic interest in the United States. The Haier proposal was a potential challenge to the United Automobile Workers, one of the largest and most politically influential unions in the United States and easily the wealthiest. The Unocal bid upset Chevron, which had submitted what now appears to be the winning bid for Unocal and which lobbied Congress heavily against the Cnooc bid.
 Mr. Stephens said that Chinese companies might show a broader wariness of investing in energy deals in the United States, because of the sector's strategic importance. Chinese companies may also become more cautious about purchases of labor-intensive companies, even including nonunion businesses, for fear of antagonizing politicians who fear that the buyer would move production home to China.
 Cnooc has learned the hard way the importance of paying attention not just to the executive branch in Washington but also to Congress. That may be a difficult point to grasp for Communist officials raised in a country where the National People's Congress has long done little more than rubber-stamp decisions by the leadership, although this has started to change in China as well. 
 Cnooc's advisers checked with administration officials before starting the bid and encountered no strong opposition, but did not try the more arduous -- and less leakproof -- approach of sounding out a spectrum of members of Congress, a person involved with Cnooc's bid said.
 Japanese companies responded to protectionism in the United States in the 1980's by hiring hundreds of lobbyists in Washington, including many former government officials. But Chinese companies like Cnooc have barely begun trying to influence the American political process in this way.
 ''The lesson is when you move into the huge takeover game, there's a huge amount of due diligence you need to do before you announce anything,'' Mr. Andrews-Speed said, adding that in the Cnooc deal, ''they clearly didn't do that on the political side.''

 BODY:
NOWADAYS, mighty Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., must feel less like a hotbed of retailing than like a war room. The company faces a groundswell of criticism, largely focused on its treatment of workers. From low wages to limited health care coverage, Wal-Mart has some issues to tackle, and it has mostly responded with feel-good television advertisements and denial. But to chalk up Wal-Mart's success simply to the exploitation of its work force, as many of the company's most ferocious critics do, is simply wrong, for two reasons.
 First, Wal-Mart hasn't just sliced up the economic pie in a way that favors one group over another. Rather, it has made the total pie bigger. Consider, for example, the conclusions of the McKinsey Global Institute's study of United States labor productivity growth from 1995 to 2000. Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics and an adviser on the study, noted that the most important factor in the growth of productivity was Wal-Mart. And because the study measured productivity per man hour rather than per payroll dollar, low hourly wages cannot explain the increase. 
Second, most of the value created by the company is actually pocketed by its customers in the form of lower prices. According to one recent academic study, when Wal-Mart enters a market, prices decrease by 8 percent in rural areas and 5 percent in urban areas. With two-thirds of Wal-Mart stores in rural areas, this means that Wal-Mart saves its consumers something like $16 billion a year. And because Wal-Mart's presence forces the store's competitors to charge lower prices as well, this $16 billion figure understates the company's real impact by at least half.
 These kinds of savings to customers far exceed the costs that Wal-Mart supposedly imposes on society by securing subsidies, destroying jobs in competing stores, driving employees toward public welfare systems and creating urban sprawl. Even if these offenses could all be ascribed to Wal-Mart, their costs wouldn't add up to anything like $16 billion. 
 Similarly, the savings to customers also exceed the total surplus the company generates for its shareholders-- a surplus that would be wiped out if Wal-Mart's million-plus employees were to receive a $2-per-hour pay increase, modest though that sounds. Such a possibility would be unacceptable to Wal-Mart's shareholders, who include not only Sam Walton's heirs but also the millions of Americans who invest in mutual funds and pension plans. Instead, the more than 100 million Americans who shop at Wal-Mart would most likely just end up paying higher prices.
 This last point suggests that the debate around Wal-Mart isn't really about a Marxist conflict between capital and labor. Instead, it is a conflict pitting consumers and efficiency-oriented intermediaries like Wal-Mart against a combination of labor unions, traditional retailers and community groups. Particularly in retailing, American policies favor consumers and offer fewer protections to other interests than is typical elsewhere in the world. Is such pro-consumerism a good thing?
 The answer depends on who these consumers are, and Wal-Mart's customers tend to be the Americans who need the most help. Our research shows that Wal-Mart operates two-and-a-half times as much selling space per inhabitant in the poorest third of states as in the richest third. And within that poorest third of states, 80 percent of Wal-Mart's square footage is in the 25 percent of ZIP codes with the greatest number of poor households. Without the much-maligned Wal-Mart, the rural poor, in particular, would pay several percentage points more for the food and other merchandise that after housing is their largest household expense.
 So in thinking about Wal-Mart, let's keep in mind who's reaping the benefits of those ''everyday low prices'' -- and, by extension, where the real conflict lies.

HEADLINE: Strong Consumer Spending Drives Share Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after a government report showed strong consumer spending in June, while a favorable industry outlook from a chip maker, Maxim Integrated Products, helped drive the Nasdaq to a four-year high. 
 Higher earnings from the cable operator Comcast Corporation and a rise in shares of the software maker Microsoft also supported technology shares.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.59 points, or 0.57 percent, to 10,683.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.77 points, or 0.71 percent, to finish at 1,244.12. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 22.77 points, or 1.04 percent, to end at 2,218.15. 
 Before the opening bell, the Commerce Department said consumer spending advanced 0.8 percent in June, fueled by an increase in auto sales. 
 ''You had good spending numbers, combined with the fact that the market has momentum,'' said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management. ''The economy is strong, inflation is low and earnings are great. That is a perfect cocktail for a bull market.'' 
 The second quarter is on track for being the 13th in a row with double-digit earnings growth. 
 Maxim Integrated rose $3.49, or 8.3 percent, to $45.50 a share, after it posted a 1 percent rise in quarterly profit, in line with its month-old target, and said an industry recovery could be near. 
 Comcast rose 39 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $31 a share, after it reported a 64 percent increase in second-quarter net income, helped by new digital video products such as digital video recorders. 
 Microsoft climbed 89 cents, to $26.81 a share, on speculation that it is likely to raise its annual dividend. 
 The Dow component Alcoa rose 85 cents, to $28.76 a share, lifted by higher aluminum prices. 
 Shares of steel companies climbed after Morgan Stanley raised its outlook for the sector. 
 The Nucor Corporation advanced $2.76, or 5 percent, to $58.43 a share and the US Steel Corporation rose $1.28, to $44.01.
 Transocean, an offshore driller, rose $1.76, to $59.65 after it said second-quarter earnings soared. 
 Tyco International fell $2.96, or 9.6 percent, to $27.86 after cutting its outlook for the year. 
 Shares of the Chevron Corporation climbed $1.13, to $59.56 a share, after its rival bidder, Cnooc, withdrew its offer for the Unocal Corporation. Unocal's shares rose 16 cents, to $64.53 a share. 
 The General Motors Corporation fell 33 cents, to $36.53 a share, after G.M.'s employee discount program led to a 19.1 percent gain in July sales in the United States, following a hefty 41 percent increase in June. 
 Ford Motor Company's shares rose 3 cents, to $10.88 a share, and DaimlerChrysler climbed $1.37, to $50.74 a share, after reporting better-than-expected sales for July.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 98 11/32 and the yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 4.34 percent, from 4.31 percent on Monday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.744
High Rate: 3.285
Coupon Yield: 3.339
Low Rate: 3.270
Median Rate: 3.275
Total applied for: $46,412,706

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The board of Cnooc, the Chinese oil company, had one thing right: its bid to buy an American oil company was killed by political opposition.
 Lawmakers in Congress, with tacit support from the Bush administration, managed to raise enough objections to Cnooc's bid for Unocal to make most investors doubt that the deal would ever pass muster in Washington.
 But now that Cnooc has decided to abandon its bid, policy analysts and lawmakers said, the tensions between the United States and China that it reflected are not expected to diminish. Indeed, they may well intensify in the months ahead. 
 ''I think a very serious economic clash is probably in the offing this fall,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics, a policy research organization here.
 Byron Dorgan, a Democratic senator from North Dakota who was one of the sharpest critics of the Chinese attempt to buy Unocal, argued that the withdrawal ''does not change the fact that there are policy questions that have to be answered. When a Chinese government-controlled company tries to buy an American oil company, is it a free-market transaction? The answer is no.''
 Many economists, while not necessarily disputing that claim, would still say that the political reaction was far out of proportion to the case.
 They are particularly dubious about arguments that Cnooc's bid would have jeopardized national security, noting that oil is a globally traded commodity and that Unocal's reserves contributed only about 1 percent of American oil consumption.
 But the political acrimony in the United States toward China has been rising on several fronts, and the uproar over Cnooc may have been a way to vent other grudges.
 ''There was nothing wrong with Cnooc taking over Unocal, and for that reason I didn't oppose the merger,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a leading critic of China's currency and trade practices. ''But the furor over China treating American companies and workers unfairly up and down the line is real. And while it led to an incorrect result in this case, it must be dealt with.''
 Industry analysts and executives predicted on Tuesday that the uproar over Cnooc was unlikely to be the last of its type.
 ''I don't think this is a one-time deal,'' said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. Mr. Vargo noted that political leaders became anxious about similar spending sprees by oil-exporting countries in the early 1970's and by Japan in the 1980's.
 ''China is sitting on $700 billion in foreign reserves and has a lot of money,'' he said. ''They're going to start buying things around the world.''
 Economic tensions with China are escalating on a number of fronts.
 Less than two weeks ago, China attempted to relieve one major source of conflict by announcing that it would stop fixing its currency to the dollar at a rate that had been set in concrete for years. That was welcome news to American officials, who had complained for two years that China's currency was artificially undervalued and created an unfair trade advantage for Chinese exports.
 But the tensions on that issue are already reviving. When Chinese leaders announced last week that they were not necessarily raising the value of their currency by more than 2.1 percent, Mr. Schumer and his allies warned that China would have to do more or they would threaten the country with steep tariffs. 
 By withdrawing on Unocal, Mr. Bergsten said, Cnooc may have removed one source of major conflict that could have dragged on for months. 
 But the tensions over Chinese corporate takeovers are likely to persist.
 Patrick Mulloy, a member of the U.S-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan advisory panel created by Congress, said Cnooc's withdrawal would force American policy makers to look at issues posed by government-owned companies. 
 ''This is good news,'' Mr. Mulloy said of Cnooc's decision. ''Don't call this a commercial transaction when it's not a commercial transaction. This is a government-controlled company. There was no ability for an American company to buy Cnooc; there was no reciprocity.''
 The political uproar began almost immediately. On June 30, the House passed two contradictory resolutions -- one that demanded a ''thorough review'' of the potential dangers to national security, and a second that would have flatly prohibited the Treasury Department from recommending approval.
 Those did not become law. But last week, House and Senate conferees added an amendment to the energy bill, which did pass both chambers, that ordered the Energy Department to conduct a four-month review of the deal before reaching a decision.
 The amendment would have delayed any government decision by about seven weeks, increasing shareholder uncertainty over whether a Cnooc takeover would win approval.
 The prospect of political hostility toward Chinese corporate takeovers worries many trade specialists, who fear it would encourage China and other countries to discriminate against American investors.
 ''The United States has argued persistently over the course of two decades that governments should not interfere with the ability of companies to invest,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, who served as United States trade representative under President Bill Clinton. ''The concern I have is not only about the severe damage this does to the strength of our position abroad, but about the taking of mirror actions by other countries -- and not only China.''
 Philip Swagel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former chief of staff on President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said Americans were in danger of losing perspective, thinking that the economic competition between nations should somehow be seen in military terms.
 Mr. Swagel pointed out that two American banks were interested in buying stakes in state-owned banks in China. While those bids have been encouraged by Beijing, it is doubtful that Washington would be so inviting of similar deals, particularly if they involved changes in control.
 ''Imagine if a Chinese company tried to take over Citigroup,'' Mr. Swagel said. ''It would go to Defcon 5 here.''

HEADLINE: CHINESE COMPANY DROPS BID TO BUY U.S. OIL CONCERN

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; David Barboza reported from Shanghai for this article and Andrew Ross Sorkin from New York. Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
A Chinese oil company said on Tuesday that it was withdrawing its $18.5 billion offer for Unocal, the American oil company that had been at the center of a takeover struggle that will end with its staying in American hands. 
 The pullback underscores the resentment and bitterness that has formed in China and the United States over the effort to buy what some consider a strategic asset.
The bid awakened broad tensions in the United States over economic security and economic competition with China that apparently led Cnooc, which is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, to conclude it had no chance. The tensions, analysts said, are not expected to disappear along with the bid. As Chinese companies increasingly try to buy major international companies, the experience is likely to push them to become more attuned to the political sensitivities of deals. [Page C1.] 
 The withdrawal of the Cnooc bid, which was made in late June, lets the Bush administration avoid having to make a sensitive decision about whether to formally block the transaction. But the political firestorm in Washington that pushed the Chinese company to drop its bid may have revived a prickly sentiment in Congress that is expected to spill over into other facets of the financial and economic relationship between China and the United States.
 The decision ends the hotly contested takeover battle for Unocal, the American oil company, and clears the way for Chevron to seal its acquisition of Unocal for about $17 billion in cash and stock. The failure of Cnooc's takeover attempt -- code-named Operation Treasure Ship -- may be most galling to the Chinese because Cnooc's offer was higher than Chevron's bid.
 Still, the withdrawal leaves China Inc. with some hard-learned lessons. As Chinese companies endeavor to expand their global reach, Cnooc's bid is likely to become a case study in tactical and political miscalculations. Even though the company had hired an army of high-price brand-name firms -- Wall Street advisers like Goldman Sachs and Washington lobbyists like Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld -- it still failed to navigate the political minefields and negotiate a superior offer.
 In the end, officers of the Chinese company said they were reluctant to increase their bid closer to $20 billion because Washington seemed unlikely to approve the deal anyway, and had even adopted legislation that would have slowed or mired the approval process. 
 In a statement issued late Tuesday in Hong Kong, Cnooc explained its decision to withdraw by saying: ''This political environment has made it very difficult for us to accurately assess our chance of success, creating a level of uncertainty that presents an unacceptable risk to our ability to secure this transaction.''
 Some Chinese businessmen said the failed bid could broadly affect trade relations between China and the Unites States far beyond mergers and acquisitions.
 ''The way the U.S. government has treated Cnooc and politicized the deal will largely frustrate Chinese companies,'' said Han Xiaoping, the chief information officer at Falcon Power, an energy consulting firm based in Beijing. ''The companies not only in oil but all other industries will not want to play the game by the U.S. rules.''
 Even so, Chinese oil companies are expected to continue their acquisition hunt, as China's appetite for energy grows to feed its expanding economy. 
 Cnooc's bid for Unocal -- the largest takeover bid ever attempted by a Chinese company -- was plagued with problems long before it even started in late June. Indeed, in March, when Unocal was up for auction, Cnooc's independent directors voted against pursuing a bid during a heated board meeting, just 15 hours before the bidding deadline, according to several executives who recounted the decision-making process within Cnooc.
 The most outspoken skeptic was Erwin Schurtenberger, the former Swiss ambassador to China, but pointed questions also came from Kenneth S. Courtis, the vice chairman for Goldman Sachs in Asia, who was particularly upset by the hasty nature of the offer. 
 Six days after the contentious board meeting, on April 4, Mr. Schurtenberger resigned from the board; a company statement said he was doing so for health reasons. He has had prostate cancer for years.
 Several days later, Chevron struck a $16 billion deal for Unocal. Still, Cnooc's ambitious chairman, Fu Chengyu, was undeterred. The independent directors had pledged to revisit making a bid after hiring an independent adviser, N.M. Rothschild & Sons, and an energy consulting firm to do a separate assessment of the planned bid.
 With Mr. Schurtenberger no longer on the board and a positive assessment from the outside energy consultant, Cnooc's board voted in late June to make an unsolicited offer worth $67 a share, or $18.5 billion. During that board meeting, the American advisers suggested there was some regulatory risk, but they dismissed the prospect of opposition to the deal from politicians as ''no more than the usual noise.'' One recent precedent for a high-profile acquisition had been Lenovo's purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business, a deal that went through relatively smoothly.
 Of course, the day Cnooc announced its offer, the reaction began. Chevron's lobbyists worked their political base in California. Two Republican representatives, Richard W. Pombo and Duncan Hunter, had written a letter to President Bush in anticipation of the offer urging that the transaction be scrutinized on the grounds of national security, and they went into overdrive. Other politicians accused Cnooc of acting as a proxy for the Chinese government and seeking to secure strategic energy assets that were arguably valuable to the United States.
 Investors were sent into a tizzy, gambling in the stock market on the chance that a bidding war would erupt. Within about a week of Cnooc's first offer, word spread that it was preparing to raise its bid to $69 a share. To ease worries that it could renege on the deal, the company also took steps to set aside $2.5 billion in escrow in case of lawsuits. Cnooc officials said they were even willing to dispose of most of Unocal's assets in the United States if that was necessary to obtain approval of the United States government.
 The Chinese government and Cnooc officials also insisted that the takeover bid was solely a commercial deal and had nothing to do with politics. Cnooc pleaded with officials in Washington that it was simply attempting a ''friendly'' takeover of Unocal with a higher bid and would even pay the $500 million breakup fee if Unocal agreed to abandon its earlier agreement with Chevron.
 But by mid-July, the opposition in Washington had reached a critical mass. Inside Cnooc, there was a feeling that its offer was ''really foundering,'' according to a person involved in the discussions. The depth of the political opposition to the Cnooc bid was clear. 
 Not only had several bills and resolutions been presented in Congress, but it was also the day after high-profile hearings before the House Armed Services Committee in which witnesses including R. James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, criticized the proposed purchase as a threat to America's energy security.
 In China, the Internet chatter on pro-government Web sites, which had originally applauded the Cnooc offer, fell silent. The tone of the commentary in Chinese news agencies and in the press changed markedly. Besides chastising the political meddling in the United States, local analysts and commentators said China should only try friendly deals in the future and that the Cnooc move probably did not make economic sense at any higher price.
 ''Up to then, the view of the company's foreign advisers was that all you had to do was put more money on the table,'' said a person involved in the takeover discussions, who insisted on anonymity because of the confidential nature of the discussions. ''They really underestimated how powerful Chevron is -- a company 10 times Cnooc's size -- and how much influence it has in Washington. It was a complete misreading of political risk.''
 There was some discussion in the last couple of weeks of trying to bring in an American partner to defuse the political controversy in the United States, the person said..
 But instead Cnooc blinked. Unocal was ready to accept Cnooc's new offer of $69 a share, but on July 16, Mr. Fu called Unocal's chairman, Charles R. Williamson, ''and informed him that, although Cnooc's board had authorized an increase in the Cnooc proposal to $69 per share in cash, Cnooc was not prepared to raise the proposed per share consideration beyond $67 per share,'' according to a filing by Unocal.
 Had Cnooc made the higher offer and Unocal accepted it, Chevron's chances of winning the takeover contest would have been much dimmer. But without a higher offer from Cnooc, Chevron made its move: It raised its bid to $64 a share. Unocal's board accepted it.
 Soon afterward, things got much worse for Cnooc. 
 Congressional negotiators working to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the energy bill added a provision that requires a four-month-long study of China's energy needs before the government could approve Cnooc's bid. The bill was virtually a fatal blow for any bid by Cnooc.
 With a shareholder meeting to vote on Unocal's deal with Chevron set for Aug. 10, Cnooc had to decide whether to raise its bid or fold.
 For Mr. Fu, the situation was particularly painful, and perhaps ironic. For years he had argued in company meetings that Cnooc ought to avoid countries in Africa and the Middle East because of the political risks associated with some countries there, according to an adviser to the company. 
 That was one of the reasons Mr. Fu had pushed to make an acquisition in the United States.
 ''This is a pretty rude awakening,'' the adviser said. ''The political risk turned out to be higher in America.''

HEADLINE: Estimate Revised on When Iran Could Make Nuclear Bomb 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Completing their first full-scale assessment of Iran in four years, American intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran is ''determined to build nuclear weapons'' but is not expected to possess such weapons until the early or middle years of the next decade, administration officials said Tuesday.
 The assessment, produced in May, differs from a timetable cited earlier this year by senior Defense and State Department officials, who estimated that Iran would probably be able to produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade -- or at least a few years sooner.
An American official who has read the report said it asserted with ''high confidence'' that Iran was determined to develop a nuclear weapon and that intelligence agencies were ''moderately confident'' that Iran was unlikely to make a weapon before the beginning to the middle of the next decade. 
 Despite the classified assessment, which was not issued publicly but discussed by officials speaking anonymously because of its secrecy, administration officials said Tuesday that they remained certain of Iran's intentions and of the need to confront its government urgently. 
 ''We've made clear for a long time, and the international community has been in agreement for some time, that we have very serious concerns about Iran's intentions to acquire nuclear weapons,'' said Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman, responding to a news article in The Washington Post, which first reported the intelligence assessment on Tuesday.
 Mr. Casey said that the ''whole basis'' for the current effort to work with European countries to get Iran to dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons program was the shared American and European conclusion that Iran's activities posed ''a threat for the entire international community.''
 American intelligence officials have said for years that Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian nuclear energy program, but there has long been disagreement about how quickly Iran could actually produce a weapon. According to intelligence estimates over the past 10 years, Iran could be within five years of making nuclear weapons.
 Since the agencies were found to have badly overstated the extent of Iraq's weapons programs before the 2003 invasion, they have become more cautious in their analysis, according to intelligence officials. A report issued by a presidential commission in March warned that the agencies have insufficient evidence about Iran's programs. Israeli experts are said by intelligence officials to believe that Iran could reach a ''point of no return,'' that is acquire the knowledge, materials and equipment to make the weapons, in a year or a year and a half.
 At the time of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's visit to President Bush's ranch in Texas in April, American officials said he laid out ''the worst-case scenario.'' American officials, however, said they found Mr. Sharon's claims overly alarmist.
 Iran denies that it is seeking nuclear weapons and insists on being able to resume its conversion and enrichment of uranium, now temporarily suspended, for energy purposes.
 The conclusion about the pace of Iran's nuclear arms program was part of a memorandum attached to a formal National Intelligence Estimate, a consensus document reporting the views of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and others, regarding political, economic and social trends in Iran, particularly on issues relating to the stability of its government. The last formal estimate about Iran was produced in 2001.
 Portions of those classified estimates often end up being discussed by administration officials, sometimes to buttress a particular point of view within the government bureaucracy, which in this case has been debating what to do about Iran since Mr. Bush took office.
 An administration official, asking not to be identified because administration officials are not authorized to discuss intelligence matters, said that, intentionally or not, the new assessment appeared to play into the hands of those who argue that there is some time to try to persuade Iran to change its ways, and no need for a confrontation right now.
 Officially, administration officials continue to say that Iran must recognize the need to make a deal now. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said a number of times that the United States cannot wait forever for diplomacy to do the job.
 Administration officials argue, in effect, that when Iran might have a bomb is beside the point. What is important, they say, is evidence that Iran is trying to make a bomb and hiding its activities from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear energy programs.
 The United States charges that Iran has tried to hide its uranium enrichment program, carried out undeclared plutonium experiments and failed to report its use of imported uranium for testing in centrifuges at various undisclosed sites. Last year, in addition, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he had seen information that Iran was trying to marry its nuclear weapons technology to the technology of missiles that could deliver a bomb.
 American and Western diplomats, speaking cautiously because they said they had no direct access to intelligence about Iran, suggested Tuesday that the newest assessment appeared consistent with the administration's attempt to be cautious about reaching sweeping conclusions based on limited information.
 They said, however, that Israeli intelligence officials approach Iran differently, by taking ''worst-case scenarios'' more seriously perhaps than other countries do, because of a general assumption that Israel would be a target.
 Top administration officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and John R. Bolton, the newly appointed United Nations ambassador, have urged immediate action against Iran and suggested that there is little time to waste.
 But they appear to have avoided predictions on exactly when Iran would get the bomb, concentrating instead on what they say is a multitude of bits of evidence that Iran is trying to make one.
 The most recent declarations of Iran's capability came earlier this year from Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who testified before Congress that ''unless constrained by a nuclear nonproliferation agreement, Tehran probably will have the ability to produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade.''

HEADLINE: Looking for Daylight in Iran

 BODY:
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Tehran mayor who won a landslide victory in Iran's presidential elections in June, will begin his term today. The rest of the world will be watching his performance with interest, to say the least.
 Iran has been escalating tensions on the nuclear front. This week a senior Iranian official announced plans to resume the country's nuclear program by removing the seals placed by the United Nations' nuclear agency at a site where uranium is converted into a gas for enrichment. Europe, which has taken the lead in dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions, responded with incoherence. 
 First, European officials threatened to end negotiations and take the matter to the United Nations Security Council -- presumably to bring up the issue of sanctions. But since China dislikes sanctions, any such proposal would probably run into a veto. France, Germany and Britain then followed up with pleas to Tehran not to do anything because they are just days away from delivering a package of incentives as part of their effort to bribe Iran to keep it from enriching its uranium.
 Given all this floundering, it was a welcome piece of news when a new United States intelligence assessment projected that Iran was farther away from a nuclear weapons capability than had been thought. The most likely time frame would be the early or middle years of the next decade, it said. 
 Meanwhile in Tehran, Mr. Ahmadinejad has other disturbing issues awaiting his attention. For one, there's the failing health of Akbar Ganji, a jailed journalist who is now on a hunger strike. And, even though assassinations are rare in Iran, the judge in Mr. Ganji's trial was killed yesterday. Then there's the recent arrest of Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer who defended Mr. Ganji and also worked with Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner. Ms. Ebadi has been successful enough as a champion of human rights that she is now being accused in government-controlled news media reports of a slew of absurd charges, including burglary. 
 Untangling all of this will determine whether Mr. Ahmadinejad is the independent populist he claimed to be during the campaign, or just another pawn of the clerical power brokers who backed him. No Iranian president to date has ever been able to defy the wishes of the unelected ayatollahs who rule Iran, and it is highly unlikely that Mr. Ahmadinejad will prove to be any different. Still, he ran on an economic platform that implicitly challenged the cronyism and corruption of clerical rule. It would be a welcome surprise if a radical conservative like Mr. Ahmadinejad could cut a nuclear deal, just as the fiercely anti-Communist Richard Nixon was able to reach out to Communist China.

HEADLINE: $100 Million For a Tunnel. What Tunnel? 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Hours after the House of Representatives approved a big transportation bill on Friday morning, Representative Jerrold L. Nadler informed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that it would get a $100 million federal grant to design and engineer a freight tunnel under New York Harbor.
 Usually, news of such largesse would be cause for celebration. But the Port Authority did not ask for the $100 million, says it did not know about the grant, and is not very interested in the project.
 ''For us to say that we're committed at this point in time and can commit any funds to it would be premature,'' the authority's executive director, Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., said this week. 
 The unusual circumstances surrounding the $100 million grant -- which dwarfs all other individual appropriations for New York -- reveal much about the peculiarities of federal transportation spending, in which huge appropriations are approved every few years in a manner that some deride as a pork opportunity for individual lawmakers.
 In contrast to other projects in the $286.4 billion transportation spending bill, the cross-harbor tunnel is viewed by many planners as a worthy endeavor that could sharply reduce traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and improve the movement of goods throughout the region. 
 But no agency has agreed to build the tunnel, which could cost $4.8 billion to $7.4 billion, depending on its width. Under the most optimistic estimates, construction would begin in 2009 and last at least four years. 
 To complicate matters, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a sharp reversal, has come out against the project, citing the objections of residents in and around Maspeth, Queens, where a freight terminal would be built. 
 The tunnel has been the dream of Mr. Nadler, one of the most prominent Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and it would run from Jersey City, N.J., to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. From there, trains would continue on to Queens using existing tracks that connect with the Long Island Rail Road and CSX, the giant freight railroad.
 A cross-harbor freight tunnel was discussed as early as 1893, and building it was an early goal of the Port Authority. Indeed, the authority was created in 1921 to reduce the cost and uncertainty of freight shipments, said Prof. Jameson W. Doig, a political scientist at Princeton University who has written extensively about the Port Authority; a cross-harbor tunnel was identified as an important solution.
 Lack of cooperation from the railroads, which were fiercely competing with each other, crippled the plan, Professor Doig said, and by 1940 the Port Authority had abandoned the project. 
 It was Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who gave it new momentum. Under Mr. Giuliani, the city's Economic Development Corporation, working with the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration, began a major study of the need for the tunnel in 1998. That study, and an environmental study completed last year, endorsed the project.
 But Mr. Bloomberg, speaking at a community meeting in March, abruptly withdrew support for the project and the Economic Development Corporation, which has worked on the project for seven years, does not plan to complete the environmental impact statement, which would be required for the project to proceed. 
 ''The administration has said numerous times that we do not support the cross-harbor tunnel because it would have adverse effects on many neighborhoods throughout the city,'' said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the corporation. The completion of the draft study ''ends our role in the project,'' she said.
 Perhaps the biggest barrier to the project is its low place on the agendas of the two people who control the Port Authority: Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey of New Jersey. 
 Mr. Codey wants the authority to focus on a new passenger-train tunnel under the Hudson River, to be used by New Jersey Transit. Mr. Pataki has called on the authority to build a different tunnel -- one that would allow a ''one seat'' train ride from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport.
 ''There are competing priorities for limited resources,'' Mr. Ringler of the Port Authority said in a telephone interview. ''We have to figure out and determine which projects we should be investing in. That said, the governors of our two states have been very clear where they feel our priorities should be.'' 
 Mr. Ringler said he appreciated Mr. Nadler's dedication to the project, but added that there was a gap of billions of dollars ''between what Congress appropriated and what this project is going to cost.'' 
 Meanwhile, the project has been in a state of limbo and will probably remain so until the Port Authority begins the planning and engineering work. A coalition of business, labor and environmental groups has created a Web site -- www.moveny.org -- to support the tunnel, but its opponents also have been speaking out.
 ''We're going to make central Queens the truck capital of North America if this occurs,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. 
 The $100 million is one of dozens of appropriations for New York City in the spending bill, some with seemingly tenuous connections to New York's transportation needs. Other projects include $15 million to begin ferry service between the Rockaways and Lower Manhattan; $3 million each for improvements around the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and $1 million to build a greenway on the Manhattan waterfront between East River Park and the Brooklyn Bridge.
 Mr. Nadler maintained that the $100 million grant was a major accomplishment. ''It's a great step forward in the long-term fight for this absolutely necessary project,'' he said. ''It represents a recognition by Congress that this is indeed a project of national significance.''
 However, he conceded that it would probably take the election of new governors -- in New Jersey this year and in New York next year -- before the Port Authority would commit to realizing the project. 
 ''Politicians change, priorities change, governors change,'' Mr. Nadler said. ''This project is very long term.''

Cnooc Withdraws Its $18.5 Billion Unocal Bid, Blocked by Both Resentment and Bitterness
Cnooc, the Chinese oil company, said it was withdrawing its $18.5 billion offer to buy Unocal, an oil company that is likely now to be acquired by Chevron and remain in American hands. The pullback underscores the resentment and bitterness that has formed in China and the United States over the effort to buy what some consider a strategic asset: extensive oil reserves in Asia. [Page A1.]

The board of Cnooc had one thing right: its bid to buy an American oil company was killed by political opposition. [C1.]

The withdrawal of Cnooc's bid for Unocal seems unlikely to derail China Inc.'s economic expansion overseas, and may even hold a few lessons. [C1.]

Air France Jet Crashes in Toronto but Passengers Escape
An Air France passenger jet from Paris with 309 people on board skidded off a runway and within minutes burst into flames while landing in stormy weather in Toronto. But all the passengers and crew members were able to scurry to escape chutes just before fire spread through much of the aircraft, and no one was seriously hurt. [A1.]

Adidas in Talks to Acquire Reebok for $4.3 Billion

U.S. Automobile Sales Hit Record High in July
Automobile sales in the United States hit a high in July, bolstered by promotions from American car makers that give many buyers discounts normally available only to employees. [C3.]

Eckhard Cordes, the head of the Mercedes car group who was passed over for the top job at DaimlerChrysler last week, sold 3.66 million euros ($4.46 million) in company stock, the clearest sign yet that he is likely to leave the automaker, analysts said. [C6.]

Russia Bars Journalists From ABC News
Russia barred journalists from ABC News from working in the country, effectively expelling a foreign news organization for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union. [A3.]

Nearly three decades after first buying The New York Post and taking over as publisher, Rupert Murdoch said that he was resuming the mantle of publisher after the resignation of his son, Lachlan. [C7.]

Marsh & McLennan's Profit Falls 57 Percent
The Marsh & McLennan Companies, the world's largest insurance broker, reported a 57 percent decline in profit in its second quarter as it struggled to reorganize after a confrontation with regulators over accusations of rigging bids and steering clients to the highest-paying insurers. The company's earnings have fallen sharply since it stopped accepting incentive payments from insurance companies last fall. Marsh's chief executive, Michael G. Cherkasky, above, said the company was having difficulty attracting customers and had delayed plans to raise prices. [C10.]

Drug Industry to Issue Guidelines on Advertising
A pharmaceutical industry trade group plans to establish advertising guidelines that will include restrictions on when certain ads can run to make sure that the audience is appropriate for the subject matter, a measure that means drugs intended to affect sexual performance should not be advertised during programs watched by children.

HEADLINE: For London's Police Chief, Plaudits, and Barbs, in Bombings' Wake

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Shortly before bombers struck London on July 7, Sir Ian Blair, the city's police chief, gave a radio interview commending the force he had commanded for just five months as the ''envy of the policing world in relation to counterterrorism.''
 Four hours later, Sir Ian was appealing for Londoners to stay calm after an attack on three subway trains and a red double-decker bus that killed 56 people, including four bombers. From the calm of a radio studio, Sir Ian had been plunged into a mayhem of bloodshed and sirens in a stricken city. His boast of a few hours earlier seemed hollow. His mien was ashen.
Indeed, when look-alike bombers struck again on July 21, the idea of anybody envying London's reputation for warding off terror seemed ludicrous. And worse was yet to come. 
 One day after the second bombing, police officers pumped eight bullets into an innocent 27-year-old Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, whom they say they mistook for a suicide bomber.
 Yet, by some estimations, Sir Ian, 52, has survived the shocks with aplomb.
 ''In my view his reputation has been hugely enhanced,'' said Tim Newburn, a professor of criminology at the London School of Economics. ''He is held in high regard for the way he has reacted and handled himself in very difficult circumstances. And my sense is that his reputation within the police has also been enhanced.''
 Not everyone thinks that way. 
 Last Thursday, Sir Ian appeared in his hallmark dark uniform, laden with silver braid, on a television talk show. Some members of the audience reviled him and his officers to his face for what they called the ''execution'' of Mr. Menezes -- a term he rejected.
 People who have followed the police inquiry into the bombings, moreover, have noted that Sir Ian has had to revise crucial statements about the first attacks and the events leading to Mr. Menezes's death. He has squabbled publicly with police forces in the United States -- holding the F.B.I. responsible for leaks of shared information -- and with his British colleagues in Birmingham, who subdued a potential suicide bomber with a nonlethal Taser stun gun rather than with shots to the head.
 And, as Professor Newburn pointed out, ''the way his reputation is assessed depends on what happens next as much as what has happened.''
 But Sir Ian has also benefited from arrests of suspects in the July 21 attacks last Wednesday and Friday with raids in Birmingham, London and Rome. In European and American intelligence and counterterrorism circles, the near simultaneous arrests last Friday were seen as a coup reflecting remarkable police work. 
 Sir Ian's appearance -- vaguely avuncular, authoritative and soft-spoken; good cop rather than bad cop -- has helped reassure a nervous city. 
 When he came to the job last February, he was faintly mocked for being too politically correct as a police constable -- a P.C. P.C., some dubbed him, accusing him of putting his political connections to Prime Minister Tony Blair ahead of his commitment to officers in trouble. 
 Sir Ian drew barbs from some newspapers for promising a crackdown on cocaine abuse among London's chattering classes and the dinner-party set of Islington or Hampstead. He dwelt on promoting ethnic diversity in the police force even as a labor tribunal found that he ''hung out to dry'' three white officers in a police racism inquiry. 
 Despite the complaints, his policing has won endorsements. ''Dreadful errors will still happen, from which lessons must be learned,'' Martin Kettle, a columnist, wrote on July 26 in The Guardian, a few days after Mr. Menezes was killed. ''The police are not magicians. But the public has learned to trust the police, errors and all, and I think they are right to do so.''
 When he took over from Sir John Stevens -- one of Scotland Yard's most popular commanders -- Sir Ian was seen as a departure, a managerial college boy rather than a beat-cop. Catriona Marchant, editor of Jane's Police Review, called him ''a terrier chewing a bone thoughtfully,'' while his predecessor had been a ''Labrador bounding into meetings.''
 ''He's very much a thinking man who's very good at strategy and very good at winning over politicians,'' she was quoted as saying. ''But now he's got to win over the hearts and minds of the community, who perhaps don't know him, and perhaps the hearts and minds of his officers.'' 
 The son of middle-class parents, Sir Ian was schooled almost as a carbon copy of Prime Minister Blair, with a private-school education and a spell at Oxford University, where they were contemporaries but apparently did not meet. Like Prime Minister Blair, Sir Ian made his name as a proponent of reform -- in his case attacking the ''canteen culture'' of police bigotry described in a 1999 official report as institutionalized racism. At present, 93 percent of the 30,000-plus Metropolitan Police Force is white, but the proportion of nonwhite officers in training is 17 percent. 
 Also like the prime minister, Sir Ian displays an unflappable media-savvy in his handling of Britain's terrorism crisis -- possibly a result of his thwarted ambition as a teenager to be an actor. (His father, a company manager, always had him figured as a doctor, according to published accounts.) 
 His first police job was as a uniformed constable on the streets of Soho, London's red-light and theater district, but he also served as a plainclothes officer in the hardscrabble Kentish Town district of north London. In 1985, he published a book on police techniques for rape investigations. 
 He rose through important positions in the London police, the Home Office and police forces in Thames Valley and Surrey. When he became deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, he was widely expected to succeed Sir John Stevens as head of Scotland Yard.
 Some of his remarks when he took over now seem ominous omens of what was to come. ''It is inevitable that terrorists connected to Al Qaeda will attempt to carry out a terrorist atrocity in London,'' he said in a published interview last February. ''It is difficult to calculate whether it is inevitable they will get through.'' 
 A link between Al Qaeda and the July 7 bombings has yet to be borne out, and Sir Ian declined to be interviewed for this article. ''Police and the security services don't defeat terrorism,'' he said in another interview during the same period. ''Communities defeat terrorism. There is nothing wrong with being a fundamentalist Muslim, any more than there is anything wrong with being a fundamentalist Christian. But we have to partner Muslims in helping them identify and remove the causes that entice vulnerable young men and women toward violent extremism.''
 After the July 7 bombings, that is precisely what Sir Ian tried to persuade the elders of Britain's mainstream Muslim organizations to do.
 Sir Ian was equally determined, however, to support the officers who shot Mr. Menezes. ''Whatever else they were doing, they clearly thought they were faced with a suicide bomber,'' he said in the television encounter with his critics. 
 ''Had that person been a suicide bomber, and had the officers not fired and the tube doors closed, and 25 yards up the track the bomb had exploded with terrible loss of life, the officers would be in a worse situation than they are now.''

HEADLINE: Trading Cricket for Jihad

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Nothing has changed during the war on terror as much as our definition of the enemy.
 In the days after Sept. 11, it was commonly believed that the conflict between the jihadists and the West was a conflict between medievalism and modernism. Terrorists, it was said, emerge from cultures that are isolated from the Enlightenment ideas of the West. They feel disoriented by the pluralism of the modern age and humiliated by the relative backwardness of the Arab world. They are trapped in stagnant, dysfunctional regimes, amid mass unemployment, with little hope of leading productive lives. 
 Humiliated and oppressed, they lash out against America, the symbol of threatening modernity. Off they go to seek martyrdom, dreaming of virgins who await them in the afterlife.
 Now we know that story line doesn't fit the facts.
 We have learned a lot about the jihadists, from Osama bin Laden down to the Europeans who attacked the London subways last month. We know, thanks to a database gathered by Marc Sageman, formerly of the C.I.A., that about 75 percent of anti-Western terrorists come from middle-class or upper-middle-class homes. An amazing 65 percent have gone to college, and three-quarters have professional or semiprofessional jobs, particularly in engineering and science.
 Whether they have moved to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, England or France, these men are, far from being medieval, drawn from the ranks of the educated, the mobile and the multilingual. 
 The jihadists are modern psychologically as well as demographically because they are self-made men (in traditional societies there are no self-made men). Rather than deferring to custom, many of them have rebelled against local authority figures, rejecting their parents' bourgeois striving and moderate versions of Islam, and their comfortable lives. 
 They have sought instead some utopian cause to give them an identity and their lives meaning. They find that cause in a brand of Salafism that is not traditional Islam but a modern fantasy version of it, an invented tradition. They give up cricket and medical school and take up jihad.
 In other words, the conflict between the jihadists and the West is a conflict within the modern, globalized world. The extremists are the sort of utopian rebels modern societies have long produced. 
 In his book ''Globalized Islam,'' the French scholar Olivier Roy points out that today's jihadists have a lot in common with the left-wing extremists of the 1930's and 1960's. Ideologically, Islamic neofundamentalism occupies the same militant space that was once occupied by Marxism. It draws the same sorts of recruits (educated second-generation immigrants, for example), uses some of the same symbols and vilifies some of the same enemies (imperialism and capitalism).
 Roy emphasizes that the jihadists are the products of globalization, and its enemies. They are detached from any specific country or culture, he says, and take up jihad because it attaches them to something. They are generally not politically active before they take up jihad. They are looking to strike a vague blow against the system and so give their lives (and deaths) shape and meaning. 
 In short, the Arab world is maintaining its nearly perfect record of absorbing every bad idea coming from the West. Western ideas infuse the radicals who flood into Iraq to blow up Muslims and Americans alike.
 This new definition of the enemy has seeped into popular culture (in ''Over There,'' the FX show about the Iraq war, the insurgent leaders are shown as educated, multilingual radicals), but its implications have only slowly dawned on the policy world. 
 The first implication, clearly, is that democratizing the Middle East, while worthy in itself, may not stem terrorism. Terrorists are bred in London and Paris as much as anywhere else. 
 Second, the jihadists' weakness is that they do not spring organically from the Arab or Muslim world. They claim to speak for the Muslim masses, as earlier radicals claimed to speak for the proletariat. But they don't. Surely a key goal for U.S. policy should be to isolate the nationalists from the jihadists.
 Third, terrorism is an immigration problem. Terrorists are spawned when educated, successful Muslims still have trouble sinking roots into their adopted homelands. Countries that do not encourage assimilation are not only causing themselves trouble, but endangering others around the world as well.

HEADLINE: Harvard Agrees to Settlement In Complaint Over Investments 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Harvard University has agreed to pay $26.5 million to settle a civil complaint about investments that an economics professor and a former staff member made while working on a federal contract to help privatize Russia's post-Soviet economy, prosecutors said Wednesday. 
 The agreement also calls for both the professor, Andrei Shleifer, and the former project manager, Jonathan Hay, to pay up to $2 million to settle claims that they used their influence over Russian officials to make money for themselves.
 Mr. Shleifer, who remains on the faculty, and Mr. Hay, a Harvard law school graduate now working as a lawyer in London, were top officials at the law reform project of the Harvard Institute for International Development, which is defunct. 
 Judge Douglas P. Woodlock of Federal District Court in Boston said the two men conspired to defraud the government by making personal investments in Russia while working on a contract to help in that country's transition to capitalism. 
 Judge Woodlock ruled last year that Harvard had breached its contract with the Agency for International Development by allowing the two men to profit from the government program, but he dismissed a charge that the university knowingly deceived the government. 
 Robert Iuliano, Harvard's vice president and general counsel, called the settlement a ''mutually acceptable resolution'' to the five-year-old case. Harvard could have been liable for up to $120 million in damages if the case had gone to trial. 
 ''We welcome having this matter behind us,'' Mr. Iuliano said in a statement. ''We take very seriously our responsibilities to manage federal projects and funds appropriately.''
 Mr. Shleifer said in a statement that he believed he would have prevailed had the case gone to trial, but that legal fees would have exceeded the amount he was paying the government. 
 Farallon Fixed Income Associates, a company owned by Mr. Shleifer's wife, Nancy Zimmerman, has already paid the government $1.5 million as part of the settlement.

HEADLINE: Housing Boom Echoes in All Corners of the City 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
It may not replace the Empire State Building or the MetroCard, but the most fitting symbol of New York City today could be the knotty plywood wall enclosing a housing construction site. 
 From Bensonhurst to Morrisania to Flushing, new homes are going up faster now than they have in more than 30 years. In 2004, the city approved the construction of 25,208 housing units, more than in any year since 1972, and that number is expected to be surpassed this year. Already, officials have authorized 15,870 permits.
Looked at another way, the city has 38 percent of the region's population but accounts for half of its new housing starts. Much of that development is being fueled by private money, a phenomenon not seen since the 1970's. 
 The mushrooming of housing development is an outgrowth of the city's decade-long population boom, low interest rates, government programs and a slide in crime, housing experts and city officials say. It has affected every borough and most neighborhoods, reshaping their physical form, ethnic makeup and collective memories. 
 Throughout Brooklyn, in areas where single- and two-family homes have dominated for generations, six-story buildings are rising on every other block along some stretches, and their apartments are quickly being sold, often to first-time buyers. Large tracts of Queens, once home to factories and power plants, are being readied for apartment complexes to keep pace with the growth in immigration. In East New York, Brooklyn, once known for its crack trade and killings, single-family homes are rising for the first time in a generation. 
 On Washington Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, where chop shops and abandoned lots of rubble and weeds once stood alone, a concrete mixer rumbles daily in front of a new eight-story building, complete with a limestone facade. ''Development is a beautiful thing,'' said Gertrude Sowell, who mulled the housing rising around her from her stoop in the South Bronx, where she has lived for 45 years. ''The Bronx had to be revived. The soul was just dead, and everywhere you walked there were abandoned buildings and despair.'' 
 This new generation of homeowners has had a tremendous impact on the city's economy. In the fiscal year ended July 1, New York City took in $2.2 billion in real estate transfer taxes, generated in large part from the sale of existing real estate but also from new homes. By comparison, in the 2000 fiscal year, the city took in a $875 million. Those taxes, as well as other revenue that comes with new construction, have been a key element of the city's recovery from a fiscal crisis. While Manhattan's new buildings may get the ink, the real action is in the city's four other boroughs. 
 ''This is my first apartment in New York,'' said Grigoriy Goldfedib, who arrived in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, from Russia six years ago and now is president of a two-year-old condominium building on 65th Street. He is one of the increasing number of immigrants who have been buying up condos around the neighborhood. Streets once cluttered with Italian delis and pastry shops now feature sushi outposts and Russian videos stores.
 The city's foreign-born population increased to 2.9 million in 2000 from 2.1 million in 1990, accelerating the housing boom. Newcomers and native New Yorkers are settling into neighborhoods that the city and developers had written off a decade ago as unworthy of investment. 
 ''Housing is being built where 20 years ago people would not live,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a telephone interview. ''Other cities in other states have just not enjoyed this kind of boom. Each block is much more diverse than people realize. There is a cooperation and a spirit that we are here together and we're going to live together.''
 In many cases, complaints about a lack of housing have been replaced with fears of overdevelopment. Neighbors from Bay Ridge to Throgs Neck have flooded the Bloomberg administration with requests to limit the number of apartment buildings being built in their midst, saying that they intrude on the indigenous look of blocks, create overcrowded schools and subway stations and even lower water pressure. 
 And the Bloomberg administration has undertaken the largest rezoning program since 1961, prohibiting new apartment buildings on blocks where they look out of character and rezoning former manufacturing areas to allow for residential development.
 ''We needed to channel growth directed to areas that can handle it,'' said Amanda M. Burden, head of the Department of City Planning, noting that the city had rezoned areas with extensive public transportation and infrastructure for more housing, such as downtown Brooklyn and Flushing and Jamaica in Queens. ''At the same time,'' she said, ''we have to preserve our neighborhoods, because they are the city's crown jewels.'' So far, 30 neighborhoods have been rezoned -- some ''up,'' to accommodate new housing, and others ''down'' and many more areas will be similarly rezoned soon.
 At the same time, people charge that developers are cutting corners on safety to get buildings up fast. This battle came into focus last month when the wall of a supermarket that was being demolished to make way for a luxury high-rise apartment building collapsed on the Upper West Side, injuring several people, including a baby.
 But fights over what neighborhoods should look and feel like at times feel like grace notes in the cacophonous symphony of churning concrete mixers, whirling backhoes and asphalt trucks that signal the rise of yet another dozen units of housing. 
 ''You can go anywhere in the city and lots are being developed and there is housing construction on them,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division. ''These are life-changing events for many neighborhoods.''

Crime Falls, Demand Rises
 During the 1990's, as the city's population began to rise, the need for housing became more acute. At the same time, the plummeting crime rate made neighborhoods where there had been little or no investment for years appear more attractive. 
 When Mayor Bloomberg took office in 2002, he sought to entice private developers with low-interest loans and tax abatements, and by streamlining the processes within the Department of Buildings to make it easier to build. But coupled with the rezoning movement, market-rate buildings began to follow the government subsidized buildings in neighborhoods where such development would have been inconceivable 10 years ago. The high demand pushed up housing prices in the city's best neighborhoods. 
 Further, as Wall Street profits have boomed, many families that once would have fled the city have stayed put. And people who could no longer afford the Upper West Side and Park Slope were willing to move to Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg and parts of the South Bronx.
 ''We think there is a demand for people not making six figures,'' said Ron Moelis, a principal of L&M Equity Participants who develops housing around the city. ''There is a big gap of people who want to get into homeownership and have incomes too high for low-income and have nothing to buy.'' 
 With trepidation, his company developed a large apartment building on Madison Avenue between 117th Street and 118th Streets that began selling co-ops in 2002. The opening prices were $140,000 to $300,000; they now sell for more than double those prices, Mr. Moelis said.

New Units in South Bronx
 On a recent steaming hot day, a steady stream of women pulling laundry baskets and toddlers walked into Taino Plaza, a new seven-story apartment building on 164th Street in the Melrose section of the Bronx complete with security cameras and attractive red awnings. 
 The building, put up by L&M, is one of a handful of low-price rental apartment buildings rising in the area. Poor New Yorkers, many looking to get out of housing projects and dilapidated apartment buildings, were quick to move in, paying $750 to $975 a month for a two-bedroom unit. ''I like it here a lot,'' said Alicia Baptiste, who moved in seven months ago after years on White Plains Road, where she used to fend off petty criminals and drug dealers. ''It's really quiet, you don't hear loud noises, you don't see people hanging around the lobby.'' On East 165th Street, Gertrude Sowell and Mary Logan sat on folding chairs in front of their own buildings, for years the only residential spot for blocks. They have regarded the two large apartment buildings that have risen around the corner on Washington Avenue with anticipation and suspicion. 
 ''I have mixed feelings,'' said Ms. Sowell, who hopes that new residents will result in desperately needed services, like supermarkets. ''We hope the people who go into those apartments are good neighbors.''
 In Morrisania, which not long ago remained a stubborn symbol of the Bronx that once burned, new housing has brought hope. ''People tend to be happier when the community they live in is improving,'' said John Dudley, the district manager for the community board there for 15 years. ''People are assuming a new level of responsibility for the community.'' 
 Like dozens of other neighborhoods in the city, Flushing has seen its ethnic fabric rewoven as new housing has gone up to accommodate a surge of Asian newcomers. Since 2000, 1,746 new housing permits have been issued. 
 At the far end of Main Street, right near the Queens Botanical Garden, one-bedroom units are for sale at $290,000 in a building that went up last month, and two-bedroom units will be offered for $420,000. 
 At College Point Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, adjacent to the Flushing River and the Van Wyck Expressway, on the site of 14-acre brownfield, a developer has plans to build a 3.2 million-square-foot center, with retail stores and 1,000 apartments. A municipal parking lot on Union Street will be rezoned, too, to accommodate more housing, someof it for older New Yorkers. 
 Some of the newest apartments are quickly inhabited by people from other parts of New York, but in other cases illegal occupancy underlies some of the buying. 
 ''We have many cases of three families in a one-family house,'' said Chuck Apelian, vice chairman of Community Board 7 in Flushing. ''People pool their money, hold six jobs, work extensive hours and with 40-year mortgages and low interest rates, it is almost like paying rent. I tell people: 'Save your money. There will be foreclosures in the future.'''

A New Start in Bensonhurst
 At Montes Deli and Catering on Avenue O in Bensonhurst, Chinese businessmen line up behind Italian-American housewives and teenagers with rosary beads tattooed on their ankles, all in search of the same thing: ''Eggplant parm.'' The neighborhood, which has become increasingly Chinese and Russian, has shed much of its racial and ethnic tensions, it seems, perhaps in large part because newcomers have no sense of the area's troubled past. 
 Mr. Goldfedib, who is 39, was unfamiliar with the story of Yusuf K. Hawkins, the black teenager gunned down in the streets of Bensonhurst by white teenagers in 1989. ''I never heard about that,'' he said. 
 But racial tensions have been replaced by conflicts between developers and residents, who chafe at the new buildings that appear to be going up on nearly every block. Roughly 1,000 new permits have been issued in Bensonhurst and Gravesend since 2000, accounting for more than 30 percent of new permits in Brooklyn.
 ''Everything that can be bad about this is bad,'' said George Gifford, who has been fighting development on his block on West Fifth Street in Bensonhurst. The shortage of parking makes him loath to drive his relatives anywhere anymore. ''I have told my daughter she may have to give up her job in Marine Park because I can't give up my parking space on a Saturday night,'' he said.
 Mr. Gifford and others argue that many of the developers are playing fast and loose with the city's building laws, have damaged property and taken safety risks. 
 And as soon as new housing goes up, people move in. Lucy Lee, 35, lived in Chinatown after immigrating a decade ago and recently settled in Bensonhurst. ''In Chinatown, you can speak your own language and get around all right,'' she said. ''But this is a better lifestyle and you can -- what's that word? -- assimilate.'' Her main complaint? ''It's becoming too crowded with condos.''

PERSON: Dame Cicely Saunders

HEADLINE: Cicely Saunders Dies at 87; Reshaped End-of-Life Care 

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Dame Cicely Saunders, a founder of the modern hospice movement, died July 14 in the prototype she had built in Britain 38 years ago, St. Christopher's in Sydenham, south London. She was 87. 
 Her death was reported on the hospice's Web site. 
European hospices go back to the Middle Ages, when they sheltered, comforted and entertained wayfarers -- pilgrims, minstrels, crusading knights. Dame Cicely, a medical doctor, played a major role in reinventing them as last way stations for the terminally ill, offering palliative care and, if possible, peace of mind before a death without needless pain.
 She founded the hospice at St. Christopher's in 1967 and made it the kernel of a movement that she helped spread in the United States and worldwide. Its purpose was to complement pain and symptom control with compassionate care.
 Now caring for more than 2,000 patients and their families a year, St. Christopher's has inspired about 240 other hospices in Britain alone and many others around the world. It supports hospice care in developing countries and shares expertise through international partnerships and extensive education, training and research programs. Over the years it has trained some 50,000 doctors, nurses and other professionals and helped establish palliative care for those with terminal illnesses as a medical discipline. 
 Dame Cicely was St. Christopher's medical director from its founding in 1967 until 1985, then served as chairwoman till 2000, when she took the title of president. 
 Her travels in the United States greatly encouraged the movement here, said Patricia Farrington, director of the Pax Christi Hospice program at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers in New York. 
 ''She came to us in the early 60's and met with people here who became hospice founders and pioneers,'' she said. ''She came to New York, Los Angeles and Boston and Yale, and met with people who had corresponded with her and were impressed with her passion, that it was the obligation of health-care providers to relieve suffering.''
 Dame Cicely's first book, ''Care of the Dying,'' was published in 1960. She wrote and edited textbooks and guides for laymen bracing for a death in the family. Among the titles were ''Living with Dying'' (1983) ; ''Management of Terminal Malignant Disease'' (Oxford, third edition, 1993), written with Nigel Sykes; and ''Living With Dying: A Guide to Palliative Care'' (third edition, 1995), to which she contributed.
 She received more than a score of honorary degrees and was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1980. She was awarded Britain's Order of Merit in 1989. 
 Cicely Mary Strode Saunders was born into a well-to-do family on June 22, 1918, in Barnet, in north London. She set out to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but with the war she turned to tending to the ill and wounded. She graduated as a Red Cross war nurse from the Nightingale Training School in 1944 and worked in many hospital departments. 
 Returning to St. Anne's College at Oxford, she studied to become a medical social worker, or what the British then called a lady almoner. She trained at a cancer hospital and, having joined the staff, developed a rapport with patients. Talking with them, she saw the need for better-rounded care of those near the end.
 She entered St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School, became a doctor in 1957 and, as a researcher in pharmacology, worked on handling pain. She sought a way to avoid large dosages of medications like morphine by giving low dosages regularly, allowing the patient to stay alert.
 As early as 1959 she presented her ideas for a holistic hospice in a paper titled ''The Need'' that drew contrasts with prevailing treatments of the terminally ill. In another paper, ''The Scheme,'' she outlined a plan for a 100-bed home. 
 Dame Cicely, a Christian, included a chapel and provided for prayer time but made it clear that religion, even when proffered tactfully, was no substitute for clean, well-lighted rooms, a comfortable day room, a homelike setting and a caring staff. 
 The home within a hospital that she had envisioned, St. Christopher's Hospice, finally opened in 1967 after she led a fund-raising campaign for it. 
 ''I didn't set out to change the world, I set out to do something about pain,'' Dame Cicely said in a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph of London. ''It wasn't long before I realized that pain wasn't only physical, but it was psychological and spiritual.'' 
 In 1980, Dame Cicely married Marian Bohusz-Szyszko, a Polish artist. He died in her care at St. Christopher's in 1995.

HEADLINE: Riot Toll Mounts in Sudan After Rebel Leader's Death 

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NEW SITE, Sudan, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Rioting and tit-for-tat killings continued in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, on Wednesday, as southerners upset with the death of the rebel leader John Garang clashed with northern Arabs and government security forces struggling to restore order.
 The death toll from three days of unrest in Khartoum and its suburbs approached 100, according to local authorities and relief agencies. There were reports of gangs of people, some carrying clubs, knives and guns, marauding through the streets, even well after a government-imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew.
 The imam of a mosque outside of Khartoum was killed, the United Nations reported. Northern Muslims, crying ''God is great!'' in Arabic, were seen setting upon black African southerners. 
 The ugly scenes represented the worst fears after Vice President Garang's death on Saturday night in a helicopter crash, which the authorities have insisted was an accident caused by foul weather, not an act of sabotage as some southerners claim. 
 Officials tried to soothe riled tempers in broadcasts urging Sudanese not to allow the collapse of the peace agreement between the Islamist government of the north and Mr. Garang's southern rebel movement.
 ''I urge all the good people among you to bury the strife,'' President Omar al-Bashir said in an address over state television.
 Mr. Garang's replacement as chairman of the rebel movement, Salva Kiir Mayardit, made a similar plea from the southern town of New Site, where he received a steady stream of international visitors making condolence calls.
 ''We want this situation to be stopped as soon as possible,'' said Mr. Kiir, calling the rioters ''enemies of peace'' who were tarnishing Mr. Garang's legacy. 
 The violence stood in marked contrast to the spirit of peace that seemed so prevalent in much of Sudan just days ago. In January, a peace agreement that halted the two-decade civil war and made Mr. Garang vice president also brought hopes for a solution to the country's other long-running conflict, in the western Darfur region.
 The upsurge in violence seemed to tear at those people involved in the long negotiations to quell the north-south war, which was the longest-running civil conflict in Africa.
 ''To fail in Dr. John's vision is to fail Dr. John,'' Roger Winter, the American government's top envoy to Sudan said during a visit here, using Mr. Garang's nickname. Mr. Garang was educated in the United States and earned a doctorate in economics at Iowa State University in 1981. 
 An emotional Mr. Winter gave Mr. Garang's widow, Rebecca, a tight hug in the tent where she is mourning with relatives and friends. Mr. Winter and Constance Newman, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, also embraced Mr. Kiir.
 ''He was special,'' Mr. Winter said of Mr. Garang, a man he first met in the late 1980's, well before the Sudanese rebel movement gained significant support in the United States. ''We came to love each other in this manly way that comes when you have mutual respect and common vision.''
 The sudden death of such a significant American ally has raised worries in Washington, and not just because the outbreak of violence raised the possibility of the unraveling of the historic peace deal that Mr. Garang struck with Khartoum in January.
 The Bush administration had long counted on Mr. Garang to play a crucial part in resolving another rebel insurgency, the crisis in Darfur. 
 With his death has come concerns that the Darfur conflict would slip down on the agenda, according to several diplomats who spoke without attribution to avoid stoking the tense situation.
 In his new role, Mr. Kiir tried to address concerns about Darfur after a closed-door meeting with Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa.
 ''There can be no peace in Sudan when there is fighting going on in Darfur and eastern Sudan,'' Mr. Kiir said, repeating one of Mr. Garang's frequent refrains. ''Our commitment is that guns must be silenced in the whole country.''
 At the same time, Mr. Kiir, who has spent most of his 54 years as a rebel, expressed clear sympathies with other Sudanese who have taken up arms against their government.
 ''People fight to address the grievances that are not being addressed on the table like the one we are sitting,'' he said. ''When you claim your rights and are not given them, you resort to violence as a way of expressing your discomfort.''

HEADLINE: No Way to Treat a Dragon

 BODY:
Facing crippling delays imposed by Congress, Cnooc, a state-controlled Chinese oil company, has now withdrawn its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal, conceding the prize to Chevron. That's a victory for Congressional China bashers, who continually blame China for economic woes that are largely of America's making. They successfully raised the specter of national security to justify their interference in the takeover contest. 
 But their victory is a loss for the United States' global interests, and it sets a dangerous precedent of dealing with China by demonizing the Chinese. That approach, in turn, risks turning China, an emerging superpower, into an aggressive opponent rather than simply a global competitor.
Losing Unocal, an oil company based in California, won't stop China from slaking its oil thirst somewhere else, any more than keeping the company under American ownership will quench ours. Unocal is small potatoes as oil companies go. But thwarting China may drive it even further in the direction of securing its energy from countries that really do pose a threat to America, like Iran, and from repressive regimes like the ones in Sudan and Myanmar. The United States would prefer that China cooperate with America's policy goals in such places, rather than striking oil deals that could strengthen the current rulers. 
 Denying China a shot at Unocal also invites retaliation. Analysts expect any blowback to be narrowly focused -- for instance, an airplane order might be directed to Airbus, the European consortium, rather than to Boeing. But, of course, Boeing would not be likely to think that a lost sale was a legitimate price to pay for keeping Cnooc away from Unocal, and angry politicians from the affected region would probably demand action against China.
 So the way has been paved for tit-for-tat retaliation. That could be a precursor to escalation, which, in turn, could be the catalyst for a serious economic clash. Congress has already spent the summer considering half a dozen proposals for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports. The Bush administration is also trying to forcibly stem the flow of Chinese textiles into the United States. 
 Because China and the United States are co-dependent -- Americans buy the exports to keep the Chinese economy humming, and China buys Treasury debt to finance American deficits -- it's generally assumed that government and business leaders in each country will always, in the end, act rationally to avoid self-destruction. But an ongoing policy of brinksmanship is itself irrational. 
 The Congressional hysteria over the Cnooc bid demonstrates that only too well. It is a sad example of self-interested pandering for votes and contributions -- with little regard for the dangerous dynamic it could set in motion.

HEADLINE: London Sees Political Force In Global Art

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
It was purely coincidental, but between the London bombings of July 7 and the failed bombings of July 21, a Commission on African and Asian Heritage appointed by London's mayor issued its first report, ''Delivering Shared Heritage,'' which recommended ways of recognizing and integrating the contribution of black and Asian minorities to the life, culture and history of the city.
 Two years in the making, the report evidently made no mention of terrorism. The only nod to the crisis was when the report was officially presented at the Victoria and Albert Museum on July 18. Standing before a diverse audience in understandably somber mood, the mayor, Ken Livingstone, asked for one minute's silence to remember those killed or wounded on July 7. 
Yet the fact that three British-born Asian Muslims and one Jamaican-born Muslim convert were identified as last month's terrorist bombers has given an urgency to the report and to the continuing debate about the place of minorities in British society. It is a question increasingly faced throughout Europe, most critically in France, Germany and the Netherlands. 
 This is where questions of history and heritage are interwoven with those of identity. A significant African and Asian population has lived in London since the late 18th century. And for two centuries, blacks and Asians have been present in politics, law, culture and the armed forces. But until recently, their contribution, like that of African-Americans, was not acknowledged in school textbooks or museums.
 The report highlights the perils of this lack. When a community's heritage is denied, ignored or overshadowed, it warned, ''the outcome can be debilitating, leading to disaffection and disillusionment, a sense of disenfranchisement and contributing to socio-economic decline.'' And it added: ''In London, this has been the untold part of the story that urgently needs to be addressed.''
 Until the mid-1960's, Britain viewed much of the world through the prism of empire. While institutions like the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert boast remarkable collections of African and Asian art, much of these are the fruits of the colonial era. Today, these two museums go out of their way to link their shows to minorities living in Britain, but the commission says that more must be done. 
 In a statement quoted by the report, Jack Lohman, director of the Museum of London Group, took a radical stance. ''Many museums were born out of the pain of conquest,'' he said. ''I feel that there is a need for the museum community to acknowledge that pain. Museums that present the culture of the world need to acknowledge the story by which those collections were acquired. An apology for this pain is necessary.''
 The report dwelled on more practical suggestions. It proposed that museums hire more African and Asian staff and use minority experts to interpret collections. It noted that, instead of being ''showhorned'' into festivals like Black History Month, African and Asian programming should be sustained year round. It also said that museums should explore their collections for long-buried material related to African and Asian heritage. To oversee these and other changes, it recommended creation of a Heritage Diversity Task Force.
 In this, Mr. Livingstone has found an unlikely ally in the Arts Council England, a government-financed body, which earlier this year announced that performing arts groups would have to introduce affirmative action programs if they were to continue to receive subsidies.
 Immigration to Western Europe rose rapidly from the 1960's on, so that the original immigrants now have children and grandchildren born in Europe. And while the first wave of immigrants came from former colonies, they now also come from everywhere in the third world. In all cases, then, the fundamental issue is how European societies adjust to them and how they adjust to the European way of life.
 Britain's laissez-faire tradition led to multiculturalism; that is, immigrants and their children were reconstituted as largely self-contained communities. At one level, they were accepted as ''different Britons'' and, as such, were represented in politics and culture. But social inclusion was not a priority.
 But even that has now changed. Partly as a result of 9/11, partly because of right-wing newspaper campaigns against ''welfare-abusing'' asylum seekers, attitudes in Britain have hardened. And even at a government level, the new philosophy is that if immigrants want to settle in Britain, they should become ''real Britons,'' that is, speak the language, accept the values and swear loyalty.
 The Mayor's Commission on African and Asian Heritage, however, represents a third -- arguably more realistic -- position: if minorities are to feel British, they must also see themselves mirrored in British society. In Mr. Livingstone's words, they must ''see their achievements, contributions and historical presence reflected in our museums, archives, galleries and school textbooks.''
 In London, they are certainly highly visible. At present, 29 percent of the city's population comes from African, Caribbean, Asian and other minority groups. They are also the fastest-growing sector of the population: by 2015, city officials have calculated, they will account for 80 percent of the increase in the working-age population. And, logically, these ''new Londoners'' must be made to feel at home. 
 For some Britons, it is true, this all represents political correctness gone mad. Yet, while it may do nothing to dismantle terrorist cells, ''soft power'' of this kind may help change attitudes -- among white Britons as well as minorities, whether British-born or immigrant. Indeed, it could be argued that political differences become more manageable if a cultural dialogue is under way. In an intensely cosmopolitan city like London, it is one key to coexistence.

HEADLINE: Audit Shows City Diverted Tax Payments

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration improperly diverted millions of dollars in special tax payments from developers to pet programs instead of putting the money into the city treasury, according to an audit released yesterday by the city comptroller.
 The city also failed to collect $2.5 million in real estate payments because of ineffective oversight of a program that grants tax exemptions to developers and companies for real estate projects, the report said.
The audit found that the administration had violated city law by transferring $22 million in special payments over three years to a city agency that spent the funds on a variety of mayoral programs. The expenditures included $700,000 for the police museum, $8.4 million for an aborted effort to build a new headquarters for the New York Stock Exchange, $7 million for cancer research and $673,818 for consultants who were part of the failed effort to build a stadium for the Jets on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. said that the city should have put the money in the treasury within 30 days of getting it, which would have made it subject to the normal City Council budget process.
 ''We were surprised to find that this amount of money had been diverted without any oversight,'' Mr. Thompson said yesterday.
 The use of the tax payments was an issue earlier this year when Council leaders objected to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to divert some of the money to finance a $300 million city subsidy for the Jets stadium. The leaders said the mayor treated the money like a ''slush fund.''
 The Council recently approved a law explicitly prohibiting any diversion of special tax payments without legislative approval. After initially opposing the measure, the mayor agreed in June to support it.
 From the 2002 fiscal year through the 2004 fiscal year, the comptroller's audit said, the city put $150 million in what are known as payments in lieu of taxes, or Pilots, into the city treasury. The payments are the result of negotiations between the city and developers or companies that are erecting new towers or expanding their businesses, sometimes as part of deals to keep them from leaving the city. Instead of paying property taxes, developers or companies pay an annual sum often substantially lower than what they would pay in taxes.
 Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, said the administration continued to disagree with the comptroller's contention that the use of the payments violated the law.
 ''However,'' Mr. Skyler added, ''that disagreement over the interpretation of the law is now academic in light of the legislation the mayor recently signed.''
 The audit also found that the Bloomberg administration did not collect at least $2.5 million in payments from dozens of companies over the three-year audit period because it miscalculated the amount due to the city by a property owner or neglected to put a property back on the tax rolls after the program expired. The comptroller estimated, for instance, that CBS was undercharged by an estimated $228,111.
 In the case of Spears, Leeds & Kellogg, a financial firm in Lower Manhattan, the city did not return the company to the tax rolls in April 2004, when its Pilot expired, and as a result failed to collect an estimated $91,286 in property taxes.
 The city's Department of Finance, which acknowledged that it had made some errors in calculating Pilot payments, said that it was now pursuing payments from any companies that owe the city money.
 In response to the audit, the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Industrial Development Agency, which oversee the Pilot program, said their use of the Pilot funds was ''appropriate and in accordance with the law.''
 Still, the comptroller's office recommended that $59.4 million be transferred immediately to the city treasury, as well as $601,381 now in a development corporation account. 
 Mr. Thompson said that the city is changing the way it is using the payments, in part, as a result of the new legislation passed by the City Council. 
 ''At least now, dollars will not be diverted without the approval and oversight of the Council,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Now there is transparency and openness. That clearly did not exist before.''

HEADLINE: New Theater on Broadway To Have a Rock 'n' Roll Heart

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
Betting $21 million that New York City needs a performance hall that's bigger than a ballroom but smaller than a music hall, a corporate concert promoter, A.E.G. Live, is opening a new, midsize theater in Times Square devoted to rock, comedy and wonders of cellphone technology. 
 The schedule for the hall, the Nokia Theater Times Square at 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, was announced yesterday. It includes an eclectic roster of performers, among them the creepy hardcore band Slipknot, the cross-generational star Steve Winwood, the brotherly teenage pop trio Hanson and the sarcastic comedian Norm Macdonald. The theater's official opening is scheduled for mid-September, with the first confirmed act -- the punk band Social Distortion -- doing four nights starting Oct. 1. 
Designed by David Rockwell, the architect and Broadway designer, the Nokia will hold 1,500 to 2,100 people depending on the show, with both stadium-style fixed seating and general admission standing room. Situated in the space formerly occupied the famed Loews Astor Plaza movie theater, where blockbusters like ''Superman'' were first screened in New York, the subterranean theater will also feature state-of-the-art sound and lights, V.I.P. balconies and a few bars, all decorated with photographs of seminal rock joints like CBGB and Studio 54. 
 Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of A.E.G. Live, the live entertainment division of the Los Angeles-based promoter A.E.G., said yesterday that the Nokia theater was intended to fill a gap between large, established multi-use theaters like Radio City Music Hall (seating capacity 5,900) and smaller, grittier downtown clubs like the Bowery Ballroom and Webster Hall. 
 ''You don't have anything in this 2,100 range,'' Mr. Phillips said from his home in Los Angeles. ''And with the location and the fact that MTV is in the building, it just seemed like a natural place for a world-class music venue.''
 It also, no doubt, seemed like a good opportunity to challenge Clear Channel Entertainment, the nation's largest concert and promotion company, which holds the leases at three small to midsize concert halls -- the Roseland Ballroom, Irving Plaza and the Hammerstein Ballroom -- and is a major competitor of A.E.G. 
 ''In order for the New York office to work, we needed to give them real estate to operate with,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''And we fell in love with this space as soon as we saw it.'' 
 Others in the concert business said that the Nokia would probably thrive, especially at the beginning, but that its long-term success would rely more on its booking and flexibility than on its size. 
 ''This is an industry which always likes new, and if it sounds good and there are good sight lines, I think they will start off in a very positive way,'' said John Scher, co-chief executive of Metropolitan Entertainment and a veteran concert promoter in New York. ''But the economics necessitate that you book things other than concerts,'' like private and corporate events, as well as the type of acts -- and audiences -- that fit well in a midsize theater.
 ''My very strong feeling is that we're in an industry that attaches 'hip' to stand-up rooms,'' he said, referring to concert halls without fixed seats. ''And I think part of the industry's downturn is not responding to an audience that doesn't like stand-up rooms.'' 
 The theater's location in Times Square may also have its advantages (tourists, foot traffic, mass transit) and drawbacks (parking, competition, parking). ''It's a blessing and a curse,'' Mr. Scher said. 
 But Mr. Phillips said that the Nokia would change its look almost nightly, adding and subtracting seats and tables to fit the act, and that it didn't expect to program the same kind of acts as the Hard Rock Cafe, soon to open a block away, or Town Hall, nearby on West 43rd Street. 
 Mr. Philips did say he expected that Clear Channel would try to book many of the same acts for its theaters. ''The war is going to be in the booking,'' he said.
 Jim Steen, a spokesman for Ron Delsner Presents, a Clear Channel booking company based in New York, said that his company wished A.E.G. well but that it was a very competitive market. ''It's not an easy road,'' he said. ''The club business is a long haul. The day to day is not a big payday for anyone.'' 
 Mr. Phillips said, however, that the Nokia deal would undoubtedly help the space's bottom line. The cellphone company owns the naming rights to the space for more than a decade and has added numerous gadgets to its design, including a lounge where fans will be able to recharge cellphones and a Nokia Theater sign that will light up when the decibel level hits a certain threshold.

HEADLINE: Trade Missions That Do More Than Just Visit the Great Wall

BYLINE: By REGAN MORRIS

 BODY:
Like many entrepreneurs in the United States, Charlie Mello dreamed of selling his wares in China. And like most, he once viewed the challenges as somewhere between daunting and insurmountable. How could a company like his American Custom Coach, with 22 employees and sales in the single-digit millions, master all the trade regulations and other red tape, overcome the language barriers and navigate an unfamiliar legal system and cultural environment?
 But Mr. Mello discovered that breaking into the vast Chinese market was not just for General Electric and Goldman Sachs. 
It helps if you have an unusual product, and American Custom Coach, based in Ontario, Calif., does. It makes mobile clinics, emergency-response trucks, mobile command centers and other custom vehicles. But the key to making inroads into China is exploiting all the help that is yours for the asking, courtesy of federal, state and local governments in the United States eager to promote exports and economic growth.
 On a trade mission to China in November organized by the City of Ontario and the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, Mr. Mello met numerous contacts and is now manufacturing a mobile crime-scene laboratory for the Hong Kong Police Department. The vehicle's price tag is $115,000. He is also negotiating two other contracts in China, worth a potential $700,000. 
 While many dismiss government trade missions as costly excuses to visit the Great Wall of China and other tourist sites, without them many small businesses with promising products might never have the resources to expand into international markets. Although Mr. Mello made contact with the Hong Kong Police Department independently, he said he would not have sealed the deal there or discovered further opportunities in China if it had not been for the trade mission.
 ''I'd been contacting Chinese businesses and Chinese officials for quite some time,'' he said. ''And I've been contacted by Chinese companies. But there was never enough strong incentive to take the time away from my business to go there and I was hoping that I could just make a deal over the phone.'' He couldn't. In China, as in most countries, relationships need to be cultivated.
 With China's trade surplus with the United States ballooning to $162 billion last year, government officials are doing what they can to promote exports to China, especially by the small-business sector, which lacks the resources to handle the job alone. The Commerce Department has 115 staff members in five China cities, its largest overseas mission, said Scott Dunaway, a department spokesman. Both the Commerce Department and the Small Business Administration offer advice and potential opportunities for small businesses on their Web sites. 
 On the local level, most states and many cities have their own programs to promote trade with China. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has scheduled a six-day trade mission to China later this year, for example. In New York, groups like the New York State Small Business Development Center offer information for expanding into China. In New York City, the office of the mayor lists seminars about China and other countries on its Web site. 
 Brian McGowan, Ontario's economic development manager, said the November trade mission had resulted in more than 100 meetings leading to more than $20 million in contracts under negotiation. Both the American entrepreneurs and the Chinese business executives and government officials with whom they met were asked by the organizers of the mission to fill out detailed questionnaires beforehand to make sure the right people connected. ''It's like online dating, but only for business,'' Mr. McGowan said.
 Mr. Mello is a mechanical engineer with a degree in international marketing. He started American Custom Coach out of frustration at the reluctance of his previous employer, a bus manufacturer, to expand abroad. While working at his former job, he helped a friend on nights and weekends to design and build the bus used in the movie ''Speed.'' That experience inspired him to break out on his own to build custom-made buses and other vehicles for a world market. He started the business in 1997, selling just four vehicles the first year. Last year, he sold 32 at prices ranging from $120,000 to $500,000,
 While the Brazilian-born Mr. Mello is fluent in five languages, Chinese is not one of them. But he has learned a few words in Chinese and hopes to study the language to help him communicate with potential customers in China. 
 ''China's a very big market, and in my line of business we create opportunities, we don't wait for it to happen,'' he said, adding that the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing could lead to new sales. ''Millions of people will be traveling during the Olympics and the government will need to have their hands on security. So that's why I'm looking ahead.''
 Mr. Mello said there had been interest from China in both his security vehicles and the mobile clinics, which he hoped the government would use to serve rural areas with no hospitals. Even so, he doesn't underestimate the obstacles he faces.
 ''In China, it is difficult,'' he said. ''It's a very unique culture and it's very closed. You really have to gain their confidence first.'' 
 Even then, he said, Chinese businesses sometimes inflate numbers and overstate their intentions. Chinese entrepreneurs, he said, tend to put on exaggerated displays of enthusiasm and say they plan to buy 10 or 20 vehicles, when really they might buy one or none. ''I don't know, maybe the Chinese are too optimistic,'' he said.
 But some experts say they think American entrepreneurs are the ones that are too optimistic about China. Tarun Khanna, an international business specialist from Harvard Business School, said a herd mentality sometimes developed among American businesses when it came to China.
 ''There's an element of 'everybody's doing this so we should do it,''' Mr. Khanna said. ''I think that degree of enthusiasm is laudable but unwarranted.'' At the very least, small businesses should explore opportunities in other booming economies, like Brazil or India, he said, which are less likely to show favoritism toward big multinationals the way China does. 
 Small companies often don't have the resources to roll with the punches if something goes wrong in China, he said. And much can go wrong. Chinese companies follow dismal accounting standards, disclose little about their finances, have few if any built-in controls over the way they are managed and are not bound by a Western-style legal system, he said.
 None of that discourages Mr. Mello. He plans to return to China in September, timing his trip with the delivery of the crime-scene laboratory to the Hong Kong police. He hopes the vehicle will attract other clients.

HEADLINE: Shares Are Mixed, as Is the Underlying Economic News 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index held at a four-year high as oil prices fell from a record, helping the market recover from a weaker-than-expected report on the service economy.
 Microsoft led a modest rebound in the Dow average in the last hour of trading on speculation that new products would lift revenue and earnings growth. But disappointing results from Time Warner tempered optimism generated by generally robust second-quarter corporate profits.
The world price of oil, which has often been the force behind market movements in recent weeks, had a benign effect yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September delivery fell 1.7 percent, to $60.86 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $62.50. 
 A gauge of energy companies was the biggest drag on the S.&P. 500 among 10 industry groups after the Energy Department reported an unexpected increase in inventories.
 The Institute for Supply Management's measure of financial services, retail trade and other nonmanufacturing business declined to 60.5 in July, from 62.2 the previous month, as fewer companies reported that business improved. Economists had expected a reading of 61.5; measures of 50 or more signify growth.
 The Dow Jones industrials rose 13.85 points, or 0.13 percent, to 10,697.59. The S.&P. 500 closed up 0.92 point, less than 0.1 percent, at 1,245.04. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.34 points, also less than 0.1 percent, to 2,216.81. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks dropped 5.13 points, or 0.75 percent, closing at 683.38. 
 Market breadth was narrowly negative. Eight stocks advanced for every nine that fell on the Big Board. Some 1.52 billion shares changed hands, down from 1.56 billion yesterday.
 Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, gained 44 cents, to $27.25, buoying the Dow average. The stock has had its biggest three-day rally since April 2004 amid investor optimism that new products will push revenue and profit growth over 10 percent.
 Time Warner, the largest media company, slipped 15 cents, to $17.27. The company reported a loss in its fiscal second quarter, reflecting a large charge to earnings it took to settle lawsuits related to its America Online unit. 
 Profit generally has surpassed analysts' expectations. ''On both absolute and growth of earnings, and relative to expectations, it's been a very positive earnings season,'' said Doug Ralston, chief investment officer at Trustmark National Bank in Jackson, Miss. ''When you get this type of a broad, impressive rally, it generally bodes well'' for the market.
 Reebok International, the No. 2 maker of athletic shoes, jumped $13.19, or 30 percent, to $57.14. Adidas-Salomon of Germany agreed to acquire Reebok for $3.8 billion in an effort to narrow the competitive gap with Nike, the largest maker of outdoor and athletic shoes. Nike added $1.09, to $86.92.
 A drop in energy companies was led by Exxon Mobil, which fell 81 cents, to $59. ConocoPhillips declined 48 cents, to $63.90.
 Delta Air Lines shares reached the lowest level in four decades amid concern that the carrier was closer to filing for bankruptcy protection. Its chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, told employees in a memo last week that ''more must be done and be done quickly'' to restore profitability. Delta is seeking to avoid a bankruptcy filing. The stock touched $2.12 before closing at $2.32, down 21 cents.
 Brocade Communications Systems and Analog Devices fell after reporting quarterly results that were less than expected. 
 Brocade dropped 53 cents, to $3.96. The company, the largest maker of switches for data-storage networks, had an unexpected fiscal third-quarter net loss. 
 Analog Devices fell $2.14, or 5.3 percent, to $38.58. Analog, a maker of digital signal processors that run mobile phones, said its quarterly sales and profit fell short of its highest forecasts on weaker-than-expected demand from Asian customers.
 Calpine, owner of power plants in 21 states, lost 56 cents, to $3.32. Its quarterly per-share loss widened to 66 cents from 7 cents a year earlier. 
 The insurers Aon and Cigna gained as their results exceeded estimates. Aon jumped $4.32, or nearly 17 percent, to $29.88. Profit last quarter rose to 57 cents a share Cigna, a big health insurance provider, said operating profit, excluding some items, was $1.98 a share, more than the $1.55 analysts forecast. Its shares surged $7.17, or 6.6 percent, to $115.57.

HEADLINE: Testimony at Vioxx Trial Turns Emotional

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

DATELINE: ANGLETON, Tex, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The Vioxx trial took an emotional turn Wednesday when Shawna Sherrill, the daughter of Carol Ernst, told the jury that Ms. Ernst had been distraught since the death of her husband, Robert, four years ago.
 ''The night Bob died, we lost my mom too,'' Ms. Sherrill told the Texas jury of seven men and five women. ''She's very depressed.'' 
Ms. Sherrill cried repeatedly during her testimony, which lasted about an hour. Some people in the courtroom audience also cried, and the jury appeared to be paying close attention to her. Ms. Ernst is expected to take the stand on Thursday. 
 Mr. Ernst died in his bed at age 59 in May 2001, after taking the painkiller Vioxx for eight months. His family has sued Merck, the maker of Vioxx, charging that Vioxx caused his death. Merck stopped selling Vioxx in 2004 after a clinical trial linked the drug to heart attacks and strokes. 
 In the first Vioxx lawsuit to go to trial, lawyers for Merck say that the drug did not cause Mr. Ernst's death.
 Ms. Sherrill said that her mother had endured a difficult life before meeting Mr. Ernst in 1997. After divorcing her first husband about 16 years before, Ms. Ernst raised her four children as a single mother, Ms. Sherrill said. During that period, Ms. Ernst rarely dated, devoting her life to her children, and later earning a college degree. 
 But when she met Mr. Ernst on a date arranged by another of her daughters, they fell in love almost immediately, Ms. Sherrill said. They married three years later. ''She was happy, very happy,'' Ms. Sherrill said.
 ''Had you ever seen her this happy your entire life?'' asked Lisa Blue, a lawyer for plaintiffs.
 ''No,'' Ms. Sherrill said. ''They were together all the time, doing stuff all the time.'' 
 She added, ''He embraced our family and we embraced him,'' and then began to cry. Mr. Ernst's death devastated Ms. Ernst and she remains severely depressed, Ms. Sherrill said. ''It's just hard. Every day is hard.''
 When Ms. Blue asked, ''How do you think the death of Bob has changed your mother?'' Ms. Sherrill sobbed for several seconds.
 Under cross-examination by Gerry Lowry, a lawyer for Merck, Ms. Sherrill said that Ms. Ernst still enjoyed playing with her grandchildren and had a close relationship with her children. But she said those activities had not helped Ms. Ernst recover.
 In other testimony, both sides played portions of a videotaped deposition of Dr. Brent Wallace, Mr. Ernst's doctor. Under defense questioning, Dr. Wallace said that many Americans die every year from arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, caused by coronary artery disease.
 Mr. Ernst's death certificate lists an arrhythmia as his cause of death. Lawyers for Merck say that Vioxx has never been shown to cause arrhythmias, and so Vioxx cannot have caused Mr. Ernst's death.
 But W. Mark Lanier , a lawyer for Mr. Ernst's family, has told the jury that a blood clot caused by Vioxx led to the arrhythmia that killed Mr. Ernst. Even though the autopsy showed no evidence of a blood clot, several witnesses for plaintiffs, including Dr. Maria M. Araneta, the coroner who conducted the autopsy, have backed Mr. Lanier's theory and said that it was more likely than not that Vioxx caused Mr. Ernst's death.
 Dr. Wallace said he could not offer an opinion on the theory.
 In portions of the deposition played by Mr. Lanier, Dr. Wallace said that he was surprised that Merck appeared to have monitored his prescribing patterns very closely and had put him on a ''hit list'' of doctors who might be persuaded to prescribe more Vioxx. 
 ''They've told me they keep track of my prescriptions,'' he said. ''They didn't tell me I was on a hit list.''
 Dr. Wallace also said he had not known that Merck had paid another doctor $2,500 to give a presentation to him and other doctors about Vioxx and other new painkillers.
 The day concluded with testimony from Ken McCoin, a Houston economist who said that Mr. Ernst, who worked at Wal-Mart, was on pace to make $22,000 in 2001, the year he died. Based on Mr. Ernst's expected future earnings, his prior earnings history and the value of his household chores, Mr. McCoin estimated that the lost economic value of Mr. Ernst's life was $213,000 to $328,000.

HEADLINE: Toyota Develops Hybrids With an Eye on the Future 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JAMES BROOKE; Danny Hakim reported from Traverse City, Mich., for this article, and James Brooke from Tokyo.

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Toyota is developing 10 hybrid electric models for sale worldwide by early in the next decade, the company's top North American executive said on Wednesday. 
 The company expects that a quarter of its sales in the United States will use the technology by then as it tries to sell one million hybrid vehicles a year worldwide. That would put it far ahead of projections for hybrid sales across the industry.
''At our current rate of sales, that's about 600,000 hybrids in the U.S.,'' said Jim Press, president and chief operating officer of Toyota Motor Sales USA, in comments at a conference in northern Michigan. ''To achieve that goal, we will have to look at offering hybrid power systems in virtually all of our vehicles, including trucks.'' 
 Mr. Press dismissed concerns by some consumers and reviewers that Toyota and Honda were using the technology to increase horsepower in newer hybrid models, eroding fuel economy benefits. And he said that the proliferation of technology in modern cars had led to what he called an epidemic of recalls. 
 ''It caught up with all of us in 2004 when the industry recalled 30.6 million vehicles, nearly twice the number we sold last year,'' he said.
 In Japan, Toyota announced its results for the quarter on Wednesday, recording an unexpected 6.9 percent drop in profit as it expanded investment in plants and technologies.
 The company had profit of $2.4 billion for the quarter, ahead of the $286 million loss reported by General Motors and the $946 million reported by Ford.
 A strong yen, high steel prices and investment in hybrid technology lowered profit for a second quarter. Kurt Sanger, Japan automotive analyst from Macquarie Securities, expected Toyota's profits to start rising in the second half of the year. 
 With worldwide sales up 8.8 percent this quarter, Toyota increased its sales estimate for this year to nearly eight million cars, trucks, and vans. G.M., which has been discounting heavily this summer, sells about 8.9 million vehicles a year.
 Toyota has also embarked on a four-year program to open or expand 10 overseas plants, adding production capacity of 1.2 million vehicles by 2008. 
 With United States and Canada sales forecast at 2.5 million, the company may sell more cars in North America this year than in Japan. 
 ''We are spending a lot of money now so that Toyota can reach our next level of growth,'' Takeshi Suzuki, the senior managing director, said in Tokyo. ''We want to aim for an increase in sales and profits.''
 The hybrid push is a goal of Toyota's strategy as it looks to increase its share of the world's auto market to 15 percent, which would probably vault it past General Motors as the world's largest automaker. Mr. Press and other Toyota executives have said that the volatility of gas prices, political instability and environmental issues make the development of the technology a priority. 
 Toyota sells three hybrid models in the United States -- the Toyota Prius, the Lexus RX 400h and a hybrid version of its Toyota Highlander sports utility vehicle. The company has previously announced two of the 10 new hybrid models, versions of its Lexus GS sedan and Toyota Camry. 
 The announcement will keep the pressure on other automakers to develop fuel economy strategies to compete with Toyota, as well as Honda, the two companies that brought the first hybrids to market. So far, only Ford has responded with hybrids comparable to Toyota's popular Prius, though most other automakers have models in the works. Nissan plans to sell a version of its Altima sedan that uses Toyota's technology, and G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, companies long skeptical of the technology, have said more recently they are jointly developing a hybrid system for trucks. 
 Automakers have for years been exploring technological approaches to improving fuel economy. G.M. has been a proponent of hydrogen fuel cells, a promising technology but one with an uncertain future. Automakers are also putting new fuel-saving technologies on gasoline engines.
 That said, the fuel economy of the average new vehicle sold in the United States is below where it was in the late 1980's as rising sales of S.U.V.'s and an emphasis on horsepower have trumped mileage gains, according to E.P.A. data. 
 ''It's a big high-stakes craps game we're in and the outcome is very much unknown,'' said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, the consulting and research group that is one of the hosts of this week's conference. He was referring to the race among fuel-saving technologies and Toyota's decision to push forward with hybrids. 
 Toyota does not appear to be betting on gas prices returning to $1.50 a gallon. At the same time, Toyota and Honda have been criticized for the diminishing fuel economy returns of newer hybrids like the Lexus RX 400h, as the advanced technology is used to enhance horsepower. 
 ''A lot of that's software,'' Mr. Press said. ''I think at some point you'll even have a button you can pick, mileage versus performance, because you're managing the system. And the other part of that is, it really depends on driving habits.''

HEADLINE: Charge Hurts Credit Suisse Profit 

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT

DATELINE: LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Profit tumbled 37 percent at the Credit Suisse Group as the bank set aside just under $500 million to cover any possible payouts related to Enron litigation and other cases, the bank said Wednesday.
 Net profit at the company, Switzerland's second-largest bank after UBS, fell to 919 million Swiss francs ($720 million) in the second quarter after the company took a 624 million franc ($489 million) charge at Credit Suisse First Boston, its investment banking arm based in New York, against potential legal settlements.
Excluding the charge, the group would have had a quarterly net profit of 1.54 billion francs, up from 1.46 billion francs a year ago. 
 The reserves would buffer the bank in the event of a judgment or settlement for investors who lost billions of dollars in the collapse of Enron. Banks and other defendants have thus far agreed to pay $7.1 billion to investors who claim several Wall Street institutions helped Enron achieve the accounting deceptions that preceded its collapse in 2001.
 The reserves to cover the litigation led to a 408 million franc loss at Credit Suisse First Boston, compared with a 129 million franc profit in 2004. Excluding the charge, the unit would have had a 216 million franc profit.
 Citigroup recently agreed to pay $2 billion and J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to pay $2.2 billion to settle Enron claims. On Tuesday, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it would pay $2.4 billion. That has put pressure on other banks to settle.
 Credit Suisse said Wednesday that it now has a war chest of 1.4 billion francs to fight the various cases, which, besides the Enron case, include allegations that its United States bankers gave biased investment advice and unfairly doled out coveted new stock at initial offerings during the 1990's technology boom.

HEADLINE: The Message Thing

BYLINE: By Jim Wallis. 
Jim Wallis, the editor of Sojourners magazine, is the author of ''God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It.''

 BODY:
SINCE the 2004 election, there has been much soul-searching and hand-wringing, especially among Democrats, about how to ''frame'' political messages. The loss to George W. Bush was painful enough, but the Republicans' post-election claims of mandate, and their triumphal promises to relegate the Democrats to permanent minority status, left political liberals in a state of panic. 
 So the minority party has been searching, some would say desperately, for the right ''narrative'': the best story line, metaphors, even magic words to bring back electoral success. The operative term among Democratic politicians and strategists has become ''framing.'' How to tell the story has become more important than the story itself. And that could be a bigger mistake for the Democrats than the ones they made during the election. 
Language is clearly important in politics, but the message remains more important than the messaging. In the interests of full disclosure, let me note that I have been talking to the Democrats about both. But I believe that first, you must get your message straight. What are your best ideas, and what are you for--as opposed to what you're against in the other party's message? Only when you answer those questions can you figure out how to present your message to the American people. 
 Because the Republicans, with the help of the religious right, have captured the language of values and religion (narrowly conceived as only abortion and gay marriage), the Democrats have also been asking how to ''take back the faith.'' But that means far more than throwing a few Bible verses into policy discussions, offering candidates some good lines from famous hymns, or teaching them how to clap at the right times in black churches. Democrats need to focus on the content of religious convictions and the values that underlie them. 
 The discussion that shapes our political future should be one about moral values, but the questions to ask are these: Whose values? Which values? And how broadly and deeply will our political values be defined? Democrats must offer new ideas and a fresh agenda, rather than linguistic strategies to sell an old set of ideologies and interest group demands.
 To be specific, I offer five areas in which the Democrats should change their message and then their messaging. 
 First, somebody must lead on the issue of poverty, and right now neither party is doing so. The Democrats assume the poverty issue belongs to them, but with the exception of John Edwards in his 2004 campaign, they haven't mustered the gumption to oppose a government that habitually favors the wealthy over everyone else. Democrats need new policies to offer the 36 million Americans, including 13 million children, who live below the poverty line, as well as the 9.8 million families one recent study identified as ''working hard but falling short.'' 
 In fact, the Democrats should draw a line in the sand when it comes to wartime tax cuts for the wealthy, rising deficits, and the slashing of programs for low-income families and children. They need proposals that combine to create a ''living family income'' for wage-earners, as well as a platform of ''fair trade,'' as opposed to just free trade, in the global economy. Such proposals would cause a break with many of the Democrats' powerful corporate sponsors, but they would open the way for a truly progressive economic agenda. Many Americans, including religious voters who see poverty as a compelling issue of conscience, desire such a platform. 
 Similarly, a growing number of American Christians speak of the environment as a religious concern -- one of stewardship of God's creation. The National Association of Evangelicals recently called global warming a faith issue. But Republicans consistently choose oil and gas interests over a cleaner world. The Democrats need to call for the reversal of these priorities. They must insist that private interests should never obstruct our country's path to a cleaner and more efficient energy future, let alone hold our foreign policy hostage to the dictates of repressive regimes in the Middle East.
 On the issues that Republicans have turned into election-winning ''wedges,'' Democrats will win back ''values voters'' only with fresh ideas. Abortion is one such case. Democrats need to think past catchphrases, like ''a woman's right to choose,'' or the alternative, ''safe, legal and rare.'' More than 1 million abortions are performed every year in this country. The Democrats should set forth proposals that aim to reduce that number by at least half. Such a campaign could emphasize adoption reform, health care, and child care; combating teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse; improving poor and working women's incomes; and supporting reasonable restrictions on abortion, like parental notification for minors (with necessary legal protections against parental abuse). Such a program could help create some much-needed common ground.
 As for ''family values,'' the Democrats can become the truly pro-family party by supporting parents in doing the most important and difficult job in America: raising children. They need to adopt serious pro-family policies, including some that defend children against Hollywood sleaze and Internet pornography. That's an issue that has come to be identified with the religious right. But when I say in public lectures that being a parent is now a countercultural activity, I've found that liberal and conservative parents agree. Rather than fighting over gay marriage, the Democrats must show that it is indeed possible to be ''pro-family'' and in favor of gay civil rights at the same time.
 Finally, on national security, Democrats should argue that the safety of the United States depends on the credibility of its international leadership. We can secure that credibility in Iraq only when we renounce any claim to oil or future military bases -- something Democrats should advocate as the first step toward bringing other countries to our side. While Republicans have argued that international institutions are too weak to be relied upon in the age of terrorism, Democrats should suggest reforming them, creating a real International Criminal Court with an enforcement body, for example, as well as an international force capable of intervening in places like Darfur. Stronger American leadership in reducing global poverty would also go a long way toward improving the country's image around the world.
 Until Democrats are willing to be honest about the need for new social policy and compelling political vision, they will never get the message right. Find the vision first, and the language will follow.

And Cameron Diaz As Nehru
 We were navigating the cocktail party at BETTINA ZILKHA's rented house in Southampton. KATHY HILTON was sitting outside on the lawn, an overflowing ashtray smoldering in front of her. RICK HILTON, cocktail in hand, seemed to be enjoying himself. 
 We came upon TINSLEY MORTIMER, who was there with her dog, not because she takes her dog everywhere but because she's sharing the house with Ms. Zilkha. 
 You a fan of reality TV shows, we asked Ms. Mortimer.
 ''I get hooked on all of them,'' she said.
 Is it odd, seeing the Hiltons, friends of yours, in a television show?
 ''I think everybody's on television,'' Ms. Mortimer said. ''It's rare to find someone who's not on TV. You live in New York, you kind of expect to see your friends on TV.''
 So true!
 And exactly what we were looking for: a segue into our interview with BRIAN HERZLINGER, which has nothing to do with the Hamptons but everything to do with ANDY WARHOL's dictum that in the future everyone will be filmed with a digital camera trying to meet some kooky challenge that involves either going on a blind date or eating cockroaches.
 Mr. Herzlinger is on a media tour for his documentary ''My Date with Drew,'' which opens in New York tomorrow, and we had the honor of being his 5,789th interview. 
 When he sat down for coffee at a hotel in Times Square, a thick layer of makeup from a television appearance covered the 5 o'clock shadow that he sports throughout the movie. He had also replaced his T-shirt and shorts with a Banana Republic button-down shirt and fashionably pre-ripped jeans. 
 ''For my mom,'' he said, ''the highlight was me being interviewed by Star magazine. You know what that said to her? Now I've arrived.''
 ''My Date with Drew'' is like ''GANDHI,'' except instead of peace and autonomy for an entire nation, the goal is for Mr. Herzlinger, at the time a 27-year-old unemployed aspiring director, to get a date with DREW BARRYMORE.
 Everybody's gotta have a dream. 
 At this point we would be tempted to describe FABRIZIO MORETTI as the British colonial government since Mr. Moretti had begun dating Ms. Barrymore at the time the movie was filmed. 
 But Mr. Herzlinger said his goal all along was simply to meet her, nothing more. Not even first base.
 What's particularly odd is that we actually believe him. 
 First of all, he is very upbeat. And when we asked more than once if he ever found the whole concept a little embarrassing, he seemed not to understand the question. The film, he answered, is really about the pursuit of a dream. 
 ''I didn't want her thinking this was something other than what it is,'' he said. ''Something I've dreamed about since I was 6.'' 
 Also there's this: restraining orders are for today, but a nationwide distribution deal for a first movie made on a shoestring budget is the gift that keeps on giving. 
 Most of the movie concerns Mr. Herzlinger trying everything in his power (short of stalking, he insisted) to score a date within 30 days -- talking to the woman who gives Ms. Barrymore facials, staging practice dates with Drew Barrymore look-alikes, having conversations with her acquaintances, like ERIC ROBERTS and COREY FELDMAN.
 ''They didn't ask for anything back,'' he said. ''Because they got it, they got the idea, the quest. And it doesn't hurt for them to be in something.''
 But what we really wanted to know was this: you're starring in a movie about an unemployed guy overtly desperate to get a date with a movie star who already has a boyfriend. How does this affect the old love life?
 ''I've started getting phone calls,'' Mr. Herzlinger said. ''People have started tracking me down after the film festivals.''
 Stalking, huh. You don't really have a leg to stand on there.
 ''I can't say anything bad about it,'' he said with a laugh. ''I never tried to call Drew Barrymore at home at 3 in the morning, though.''

HEADLINE: Big Board Seat Sells for a Record $3 Million

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
A seat on the New York Stock Exchange has sold for a record $3 million, the exchange said yesterday, up from the previous record sale of $2.65 million in August 1999, when the stock market was booming.
 The latest sale will add fuel to the debate over the Big Board's pending merger with Archipelago, the electronic exchange operator. Since the merger was announced in late April, holders of seats on the New York Exchange, who will own 70 percent of the combined entity, have complained that they were not given a sufficient ownership stake in the company.
The merger will transform the New York Exchange from a nonprofit company into a publicly traded for-profit exchange. The debate over the value of the exchange -- which has resulted in at least two lawsuits against the Big Board -- comes at a time when exchanges around the world are converting to for-profit, often public companies with rising share prices. 
 Since the deal was announced, the price of a seat has risen 85 percent and Archipelago's stock has shot up 138 percent. 
 The Big Board has 1,366 seats. Each gives its owner the right to buy and sell stocks on the exchange. That structure has been seen as unwieldy, as most of the members have a say in how the business is run and they often have divergent interests. (Most seat owners are retired and derive income from their seats, while others still operate on the floor of the exchange.)
 John A. Thain, the chief executive of the New York Exchange, has said the merger will allow the exchange to compete more effectively by giving it stock with which to make deals, expanding trading options for customers of the exchange and giving it more products, like exchange-traded funds and options, to trade. 
 The merger is subject to the approval of the Justice Department and two-thirds of the seat holders. 
 Critics of the deal say the increase in Archipelago's stock price is a clear indication that it received the better end of the deal.
 Mr. Thain, meanwhile, says the surge in seat prices shows support for the deal. 
 ''Today's seat sale represents an historic and significant event for the New York Stock Exchange and our members,'' Mr. Thain said. ''Clearly, this is a response on the N.Y.S.E.'s recent performance and, we believe, a reflection on the market's positive reaction toward the N.Y.S.E.'s proposed merger with Archipelago.''
 In January, a seat on the exchange sold for a record low price of $975,000. Before the announcement of the deal on April 20, a seat sold for $1.6 million. 
 ''Unlike many mergers, this is a win-win for both sides because both are going up well above the average movement in the stock market,'' said Robert F. Bruner, a professor at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. ''The large question is then one of justice in the distribution of the gains. We are past whether this is an economically attractive deal. The market is telling us unequivocally it is an economically attractive deal.'' 
 One of the members who is suing the exchange, William J. Higgins, wrote a letter to the seat holders suggesting that Archipelago shareholders would receive too big a stake in the new company. According to a valuation he commissioned, the New York Exchange should own at least 88 percent of the new entity, 18 percentage points more than designated under the pending merger. 
 At the crux of the debate among seat owners is which side is contributing more to the deal.
 ''The combination appears to be great for both sides,'' Mr. Bruner said. ''It would appear that the value is being distributed asymmetrically, but one has to ask, what is the source of that value, the N.Y.S.E. or Arca?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Offers $3 Billion to End AOL Hangover

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
Time Warner Inc. hopes to finally exorcise the ghosts of its merger with America Online, after agreeing yesterday to set aside $3 billion to settle lawsuits from shareholders and employees who were stung by the ill-starred 2001 combination. 
 The costs of settling the lawsuits pushed Time Warner, the world's largest media company, to a net loss of $321 million for the second fiscal quarter, compared with net income of $882 million a year earlier.
''It's a big number -- we acknowledge that,'' Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner's chief executive, said of the $3 billion in an interview. But he characterized the settlement as ''the beginning of the end'' of the AOL merger hangover, clearing the way for the company to move forward. 
 Under an agreement in principle reached with the main class-action plaintiff, the Minnesota State Board of Investments, the media company will pay $2.4 billion to aggrieved shareholders who bought or acquired AOL or Time Warner securities between Jan. 27, 1999, and Aug. 27, 2002. That settlement -- which must still be approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York -- encompasses some 30 separate lawsuits that were consolidated by the court. 
 The company set aside $600 million to settle other pending legal actions, including the claims of Time Warner employees. 
 The suits alleged that executives at both companies misled shareholders about AOL's financial condition as well as the prospects of what was briefly called AOL Time Warner, inflating the value of both companies' shares and entering into a deal that might otherwise not have been consummated. 
 There was a certain bitter irony that Time Warner's long-suffering shareholders have to pay a price again for the merger. Time Warner had previously said it was defending the case ''vigorously,'' and had taken the position that the collapse of the Internet stock bubble, not misrepresentations to shareholders, was the primary cause of the decline in Time Warner shares after the merger. 
 ''It was a hotly contested case,'' Samuel D. Heins, of the Minneapolis law firm Heins Mills & Olson, the plaintiff's lead counsel, said in an interview. ''And it's a case where, unlike the MCI and Enron matters, there were not investment banks and underwriters to recover from.''
 Time Warner admitted no wrongdoing and had previously settled similar claims totaling $450 million with the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission. It said that it hoped $150 million related to the Justice investigation would be added to the fund to compensate investors, and that it will use ''best efforts'' to have $300 million paid to the S.E.C. added to the kitty as well. As part of the settlement, Ernst & Young, the company's auditor, agreed to contribute $100 million. 
 The $2.4 billion settlement is expected to be presented to Judge Shirley Wohl Kram in September. She will determine how large a fee to award to Heins Mills & Olson and other lawyers.
 Based on previous awards, it could be substantial. In another case in the Southern District, in which bondholders won $6.1 billion from Wall Street firms over their role in the WorldCom collapse, the law firms were granted a fee equal to 5.5 percent of any amount over $1 billion. 
 Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the settlement was good news for Time Warner. She noted that most of the payout would be tax deductible, and that litigation insurance was likely to cover some of Time Warner's costs.
 The merger, conceived in January 2000 at the height of the dot-com ebullience, valued both companies at more than $300 billion; today, Time Warner's market capitalization stands at $81 billion. 
 While Mr. Parsons has made a priority of restoring the company's credibility with investors, the AOL arm has struggled to regain its former stature at the vanguard of Internet businesses.
 Mr. Parsons said a new strategy to attract consumers and advertisers to the AOL.com portal is off to a promising start, while subscribers to AOL's core dial-up service in the United States declined by 917,000, to 20.8 million, during the last quarter. Over all, the service has lost 2.6 million subscribers in the last year.
 AOL had 29 million subscribers at the time of the merger, many of whom have migrated to high-speed Internet services provided by Time Warner and others. Thanks largely to cost-cutting, AOL increased its operating income before depreciation and amortization to $550 million, from $497 million, in the quarter; revenue fell 4 percent to $2.1 billion.
 Time Warner has twice restated its announced revenue at AOL between 2000 and 2003, reducing figures it had reported by $679 million in total. 
 Time Warner traded at $64 a share immediately after the AOL deal was announced. Yesterday shares fell 15 cents to $17.27.
 The loss for the second quarter was 7 cents a share, compared with a profit of 19 cents a share in the same period last year. Revenue at the company declined 1 percent, to $10.74 billion, and operating income before depreciation and amortization declined 3 percent, to $2.57 billion.
 Ms. Cohen, of Merrill Lynch, described the quarterly financial results as ''disappointing,'' but predicted accelerating growth in the second half. 
 Mr. Parsons said he hoped that investors would focus on the cash-generating ability of the company's film, television, cable and publishing businesses in the second half. He said the company would spend $5 billion to buy back stock, and hinted that it was looking for ''opportunistic'' acquisitions.
 He emphasized the prospects for Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-largest cable system, which is introducing broadband telephone services to offer along with high-speed Internet and digital TV. Although its digital phone business is in its infancy, it added 242,000 subscribers in the quarter to reach 614,000, a 60 percent increase. 
 In its other divisions, Time Warner reported weaker results in filmed entertainment, publishing and cable networks. In a conference call, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's vice chairman, said the cable networks' numbers were affected by investment in original programming. And a weak quarter in film was expected compared with a year ago, when the last Harry Potter film was released. The next Potter movie is expected later this year.

HEADLINE: A Mayor After Machiavelli's Own Heart

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:

The Prince of the City

Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life

By Fred Siegel
386 pages. Encounter Books. $26.95.
 New Yorkers have an uncanny knack for knowing what their city needs in a mayor. In the last half-century, the voters have had a remarkable record of electing the right candidate at the right time. The deliberative Wagner was succeeded by the charismatic Lindsay, who was followed by Beame, the taciturn bean counter, who was beaten by the irrepressible Koch. He lost to Dinkins, who insisted he didn't have to be loud to be strong, but was later defeated by Giuliani, who was loud and strong.
In retrospect, the voters' collective wisdom produced almost inevitable victors, although not every candidate fulfilled his promise or potential once elected. Against that backdrop, Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union and a former unpaid campaign policy adviser to Rudolph W. Giuliani, has written ''The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life.'' In Professor Siegel's view, that genius is largely Mr. Giuliani's, but also the electorate's. By choosing the loud and strong Mr. Giuliani, the voters finally rejected what Professor Siegel regards as the failed liberalism of the city-state inaugurated during the Depression under another ostensibly Republican mayor, Fiorello H. La Guardia -- the mayor against whom every successor has been judged. 
 Professor Siegel, who wrote this book with help from his son Harry, borrows his title from Machiavelli, the 16th-century political handler whose cynical pragmatism is periodically invoked as a framework for Mr. Giuliani's performance. Like Machiavelli's hero, Cesare Borgia, Professor Siegal writes, the mayor ''revived the republic with more than a touch of Machiavelli's corrupt wisdom.'' Like Borgia, Mr. Giuliani was not necessarily a prince of a guy. 
 Mr. Giuliani isn't inaugurated until Page 99, giving Professor Siegel ample opportunity to ruminate about what he views as decades of ''rivalry between those who hoped to restore the legendary Gotham to its former glory and those who lived well off its decline.'' In fairness, though, context demands that any such rivalry take greater account of two other factors: for many New Yorkers, the 1950's and early 60's weren't necessarily glory days; and if Mr. Giuliani had arrived to save the city much earlier, most citizens probably wouldn't have been ready to be saved. As Jonathan Mahler, author of ''Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning,'' says, the city ''had to bottom out in a way for the people to be willing to endure the things that Giuliani did.''
 What he did best, Professor Siegel writes, was reverse the conventional wisdom that New York was ungovernable -- giving Police Commissioner William Bratton a free hand and studiously tackling other seemingly intractable challenges -- and, with major assists from Bill Clinton and a booming economy, revive the vision of upward mobility, rather than dependency, for the poor.
 Accountability was the watchword, for public employees and for those citizens they served, even if it was not always the touchstone for the mayor's personal behavior.
 Professor Siegel takes a cheap shot here and there -- pointing out that the Rev. Al Sharpton did not send his children to public school (neither did Mr. Giuliani) and oozing sarcasm by observing that the universal condemnation of hooliganism after a Puerto Rican Day parade proved that, after all, ''there are limits to multiculturalism.'' He also commits a handful of minor mistakes (news conferences at City Hall are held in the Blue Room, not the Green Room) and sometimes engages in tongue-twisting turns of phrase. (Mr. Giuliani ''saved the city from crime by playing the role of a Republican playing a Democrat playing a Republican.'') 
 More frustrating, though, is the lack of a few fundamental perspectives, and this detracts from the book's stated goal of dispelling myths about Mr. Giuliani and suggesting what sort of president he might make. One line in ''Leadership,'' Mr. Giuliani's own book, is at least as revealing as anything in this book: ''You must guard against arrogance; but if you're doing your job and putting your motives and conscience through their paces, accept that maybe you really do know better and can see a little further down the road than the others.'' (Mr. Giuliani declined to be interviewed for ''The Prince of the City'' until it was practically in print.)
 We know he changed his public position on abortion, but not where he really stands; we're tutored on decades of distorted budget priorities and bloated municipal payrolls, but not specifically enough about how Mr. Giuliani changed all that. Or what fatal flaws caused his popularity to plummet before 9/11, when he was anointed America's mayor. Professor Siegel is often extremely insightful and refreshingly evenhanded. He blames the mayor for ousting his police commissioner in a clash of egos and for never studying the impact of welfare reform, accuses the city of a sweetheart deal with Disney to develop Times Square but acknowledges that the city shared in the sweetness, praises the Citizens Budget Commission (a group of business executives that he earlier denounced as ''liberal paternalists'') for complaining that the city payroll was too large and unproductive, and even compliments Mark Green, the public advocate. 
 He gives the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, its due for helping to pour the intellectual foundation for the Giuliani revolution, and he points out that while Mr. Giuliani wielded the threat of privatization largely as a public cudgel, he successfully privatized Harlem housing the city had seized for back taxes. While Professor Siegel claims that interest groups preferred slow decline to the risks of reform, he also quotes former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan as saying, more philosophically, that Democrats had ''rewarded the articulation of moral purpose more than the achievement of practical good.'' He writes that Mr. Giuliani's ''operatic'' personality drove him to excesses (it's arguable whether the mayor, as Machiavelli advised, was compelled ''to learn how to be able to be not good''), including a crackdown on jaywalking that defied the fact that, after all, ''New Yorkers didn't want to be too much like the rest of America.''
 Professor Siegel's gratuitous rant against Mr. Giuliani's successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, seems to suggest where he ranks the prince of the city compared with the inevitable benchmark, La Guardia. Historians measure mayors by what they inherited, the challenges they faced, the resources they could muster and whether they created an enduring legacy. La Guardia was ''part of a broader reform movement,'' Professor Siegel writes. ''Giuliani was the reform movement.'' Which seems, for now, to answer a question I posed to Professor Siegel when Mr. Giuliani left office at the end of 2001: Who was the greater mayor? ''It depends,'' he said then, ''on whether Mr. Giuliani's legacy fundamentally transformed what New Yorkers expect from city government.''

HEADLINE: HSBC to Acquire Metris For $1.59 Billion in Cash

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Independent credit card issuers have become an endangered species in the financial service sector this summer as the big banks, in search of higher profits, try to acquire them. 
 Yesterday, HSBC Holdings of Britain said it planned to buy Metris Companies, the 11th-biggest credit card issuer in the United States, for $1.59 billion in cash. In June, Bank of America said it would buy MBNA for about $35 billion. And a few weeks earlier, Washington Mutual said it had agreed to pay $6.45 billion for Providian Financial. 
Banks see expanding into credit cards as an extremely profitable way to take advantage of the interest rate spread between the money they lend to customers and the money they take in from deposits. Credit cards can also be wallet-sized billboards for the banks' brands and an important way to cross-sell products like home mortgages and mutual funds.
 Stand-alone issuers have higher capital costs because they lack a deposit base, and they have struggled to reach new customers in a saturated marketplace. Because they offer only credit cards, finding a more diversified financial firm to merge with has become a necessity for many. 
 ''Our thinking was heavily influenced by our credit ratings,'' said Bill Houlihan, the chief financial officer of Metris. ''We are single B- where all of our competitors are investment grade companies. That gives us a much higher cost of capital in that environment.'' 
 Metris, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., will expand HSBC's base of lower-end customers, who typically pay higher interest fees but also have a greater risk of default. Of course, it is also a segment that it understands well. Not only did HSBC inherit a similar clientele when it merged with Household International in 2003, but David Wesselink, Metris's chief executive, was a longtime Household executive. 
 HSBC said it would pay $15 a share for Metris, a tiny premium over its Wednesday closing price of $14.84. But the deal could results in an enormous payday for Thomas H. Lee Partners, a private equity firm that is Metris's largest shareholder. Thomas H. Lee stands to receive at least $682.6 million if the deal is completed by Dec. 9. If the acquisition is delayed, it could pocket even more.
 Metris has faced a series of regulatory problems over accounting irregularities, and disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission may pursue an enforcement action against two executives, including Mr. Wesselink. The deal, expected to be completed by the end of 2005, is subject to the resolution of the case.
 With the latest deal, the focus now turns to whether Capital One, the largest independent issuer left, will become a target. Some Wall Street analysts are already counting down the months.
 ''You can see them trying to hold off for another six months to a year,'' said David Hendler, a financial services analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in New York. ''There are a lot of willing buyers for Capital One, but they are still of a mind they can do it. MBNA was in that frame of mind for a long time until the fundamentals like payment rates began to slip.''
 To be sure, there are some important differences between Capital One and the other stand-alone issuers that have recently been sold. While MBNA and Providian pioneered marketing concepts like affinity partners and customer data analysis in the early 1990's, each had struggled to come up with breakthrough ideas recently. Capital One, however, has produced a steady stream of innovations, including low-interest teaser rates and flexible frequent flier mile programs. 
 Neither Providian nor MBNA made significant attempts to diversify their funding sources. Capital One, however, did. It now has a $13 billion automobile loan portfolio, and by September it should complete its $5.35 billion acquisition of Hibernia, a retail bank with branches in fast-growing areas like Texas and Louisiana. 
 ''Capital One does have access to lower cost of funds through deposits with Hibernia,'' said Ed Groshan, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Houghton in New York. ''The issue is: will that be enough?'' 
 Just a decade ago, the nation's stand-alone credit card issuers were Wall Street darlings, buoyed by double-digit industry growth rates and access to cheap capital. Today, however, growth rates have slowed and easy capital has dried up. Moreover, a rising interest rate environment, which will make funding more expensive without a large deposit base, and a more stringent national bankruptcy law, which could cause charge-offs to surge, have further dimmed their prospects. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about HSBC's acquisition of Metris, the credit card issuer, misspelled the surname of an analyst who commented on changes in the industry and misstated the name of his firm. He is Ed Groshans, not Groshan; the firm is Fox-Pitt, Kelton, not Fox-Pitt, Houghton.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Declined Slightly Last Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 1,000 last week, in part because of fewer claims from autoworkers and other manufacturers, the government said on Thursday.
 First-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 312,000 in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said. 
Wall Street economists had expected claims to move up to 315,000 from the original reading of 310,000 reported for the previous week.
 A Labor Department analyst attributed the decrease in claims to fewer layoffs in the automobile, auto-related and other manufacturing sectors.
 A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes weekly volatility to provide a better sense of underlying job market trends, also fell, dropping to 316,750 from 319,000 for the previous week. 
 That took the four-week average to the lowest level since late February.
 In another upbeat sign for the labor market, the number of people who remain on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid fell 18,000, to 2.58 million, in the week ended July 23, the latest for which data are available.

HEADLINE: Less Affordable Housing

 BODY:
The housing affordability index from the National Association of Realtors dropped sharply in the second quarter of 2005, compared with both the previous quarter and the second quarter a year ago. The index measures the ability of a family earning the median income to buy a home at the median price, using conservative financing and a 20 percent down payment. 
 In the same period, existing home sales hit a record. What gives? 
For starters, even with purchasing power on the wane, the typical family can still afford the typical home, though not as comfortably as before. The Realtors' index put the median family income in the second quarter of 2005 at $56,917 nationally, which is considered adequate to cover a house costing $251,900, according to the group's calculations. The median price for an existing home was $208,500. 
 That doesn't mean much in a hot market like California's, where the median price is $530,430. And first-time home buyers around the country are being priced out, with renters failing by a widening margin to reach the income level at which they would qualify for a mortgage on a typically priced home. 
 The fact that the home-buying spree continues is due mainly to incredibly easy mortgage money. More than 4 out of 10 first-time home buyers are putting no money down, and hot markets are rife with mortgages that allow buyers to make interest-only payments early on. 
 It's precisely that sort of what-me-worry activity that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is seeking to quell with his steady interest rate increases. So far, prices have continued to rise along with rising rates, leading to that affordability crunch. But sooner or later, the rate increases will kick in, and the market will cool. The adjustment could be orderly or disorderly, with collapses in some areas.
 Even a soft landing, however, would probably have a big impact on employment and consumer spending. For policy makers and consumers, the better part of prudence would be to assume that rising unaffordability was an early warning sign that the market was nearing a top.

HEADLINE: Too Much Pork and Too Little Sugar

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Wow, I am so relieved that Congress has finally agreed on an energy bill. Now that's out of the way, maybe Congress will focus on solving our energy problem.
 Sorry to be so cynical, but an energy bill that doesn't enjoin our auto companies to sharply improve their mileage standards is just not serious. This bill is what the energy expert Gal Luft calls ''the sum of all lobbies.'' While it contains some useful provisions, it also contains massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who need them least -- like oil companies -- and has no overarching strategy to deal with the new world. 
And the world has changed in the past few years. First, the global economic playing field is being leveled, and millions of people who were out of the game -- from China, India and the former Soviet empire -- are now walking onto the field, each dreaming of a house, a car, a toaster and a microwave. As they move from low-energy to high-energy consumers, they are becoming steadily rising competitors with us for oil.
 Second, we are in a war. It is a war against open societies mounted by Islamo-fascists, who are nurtured by mosques, charities and madrasas preaching an intolerant brand of Islam and financed by medieval regimes sustained by our oil purchases. 
 Yes, we are financing both sides in the war on terrorism: our soldiers and the fascist terrorists. George Bush's failure, on the morning after 9/11, to call on Americans to accept a gasoline tax to curb our oil imports was one of the greatest wasted opportunities in U.S. history.
 Does the energy bill begin to remedy that? Hardly. It doesn't really touch the auto companies, which have used most of the technological advances of the last two decades to make our cars bigger and faster, rather than more fuel-efficient. Congress even rejected the idea of rating tires for fuel efficiency, which might have encouraged consumers to buy the most fuel-efficient treads.
 The White House? It blocked an amendment that would have required the president to find ways to cut oil use by one million barrels a day by 2015 -- on the grounds that it might have required imposing better fuel economy on our carmakers.
 We need a strategic approach to energy. We need to redesign work so more people work at home instead of driving in; we need to reconfigure our cars and mass transit; we need a broader definition of what we think of as fuel. And we need a tax policy that both entices, and compels, U.S. firms to be innovative with green energy solutions. This is going to be a huge global industry -- as China and India become high-impact consumers -- and we should lead it. 
 Many technologies that could make a difference are already here -- from hybrid engines to ethanol. All that is needed is a gasoline tax of $2 a gallon to get consumers and Detroit to change their behavior and adopt them. As Representative Edward Markey noted, auto fuel economy peaked at 26.5 miles per gallon in 1986, and ''we've been going backward every since'' -- even though we have the technology to change that right now. ''This is not rocket science,'' he rightly noted. ''It's auto mechanics.''
 It's also imagination. ''During the 1973 Arab oil embargo Brazil was importing almost 80 percent of its fuel supply,'' notes Mr. Luft, director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. ''Within three decades it cut its dependence by more than half. During that period the Brazilians invested massively in a sugar-based ethanol industry to the degree that about a third of the fuel they use in their vehicles is domestically grown. They also created a fleet that can accommodate this fuel.'' Half the new cars sold this year in Brazil will run on any combination of gasoline and ethanol. ''Bringing hydrocarbons and carbohydrates to live happily together in the same fuel tank,'' he added, ''has not only made Brazil close to energy independence, but has also insulated the Brazilian economy from the harming impact of the current spike in oil prices.''
 The new energy bill includes support for corn-based ethanol, but, bowing to the dictates of the U.S. corn and sugar lobbies (which oppose sugar imports), it ignores Brazilian-style sugar-based ethanol, even though it takes much less energy to make and produces more energy than corn-based ethanol. We are ready to import oil from Saudi Arabia but not sugar from Brazil.
 The sum of all lobbies. 
 It seems as though only a big crisis will force our country to override all the cynical lobbies and change our energy usage. I thought 9/11 was that crisis. It sure was for me, but not, it seems, for this White House, Congress or many Americans. Do we really have to wait for something bigger in order to get smarter?

HEADLINE: Pollution Trial of Mining Company to Begin in Indonesia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Evelyn Rusli contributing reporting from Manado and Jakarta for this article.

DATELINE: MANADO, Indonesia, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
In a rare case against an American business giant operating in the developing world, the Newmont Mining Corporation and its chief executive in Indonesia go on trial here Friday on criminal charges of pollution at its gold mine near this remote city.
 The Indonesian government contends that Newmont, which is based in Denver and is the world's biggest gold producer, contaminated the equatorial waters of Buyat Bay with mine waste containing arsenic and mercury. It wants to hold the president of Newmont in Indonesia, Richard B. Ness, 55, responsible.
 In a vigorous pretrial response, Newmont said it would prove that its operations had not harmed the water, the fish or the local people, many of whom moved from Buyat Bay in June after complaining of illnesses. No definitive cause for their ailments has been found. 
 ''Everyone involved in this firmly believes we have not done anything wrong,'' Mr. Ness said Tuesday at a briefing in the capital, Jakarta. ''There is not pollution. I am very confident about what the evidence shows. We will be exonerated.''
 That the head of operations for a major American company is being criminally prosecuted abroad is exceptional enough. But the case has also become a test both of the Indonesia's legal system and of the conduct of international corporations that operate in far-off lands, where local people often feel that foreign businesses keep laxer standards than at home. 
 The verdict may prove a bellwether for Indonesia's other foreign investors with far greater stakes and potential liabilities, especially in extraction industries like mining and petroleum. If convicted, Mr. Ness could face up to 10 years in jail and a $50,000 fine; the company could have to pay for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage.
 ''We will pursue the criminal case as hard as we can,'' the environment minister, Rachmat Witolear, said in an interview. ''We will produce the best professional experts in the field.''
 Even so, the Indonesian government, which depends heavily on foreign investment, has pushed the case ambivalently. On the one hand, its anemic regulatory agencies would like to put teeth into their still-evolving environmental laws; on the other, high-ranking and local officials alike fear driving off the corporate money that is their biggest source of tax revenue.
 Western business executives and analysts said the onus was on Indonesia, with its poorly paid judges and prosecutors and its history of corruption, to run a transparent and fair trial.
 ''The Indonesian institutions involved in the case had better prove it, because it's not only the reputation of Newmont that is at stake but the reputation of the government as well,'' said Robert Broadfoot, the managing director of Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in Hong Kong, who often visits Indonesia.
 For Newmont, five of whose employees were jailed in Jakarta last year, the trial has been a major irritant, not least because of what it sees as the Indonesian legal system's arbitrariness, as well as its potential unpreparedness for a case layered with environmental science.
 The nearly yearlong events over the modest-size gold mine on a hill above Buyat Bay, on the northeastern tip of the island of Sulawesi, have become at once an emotional drama and a bare-knuckle legal fight.
 Newmont has brought defamation suits against its outspoken critics and says it has refused to take part in court-ordered negotiations for settlement of a $133 million civil suit. 
 At the same time, Newmont has distributed gold pins, designed in the style of AIDS ribbons, so its 14,000 employees worldwide can show solidarity. They were worn at the annual general meeting in Denver in May as symbols of desire to ''free the five.''
 In June, after intense lobbying by the company, the Indonesian prosecutor dropped the five employees from the 72-page indictment, choosing instead to focus on Mr. Ness, the company's public face here. 
 In an expression of its outrage at what it considered unfair treatment, Newmont publicly highlighted the fact that Mr. Ness, a native of Minnesota, was barred from leaving Indonesia and could not attend the funeral of his granddaughter in the United States earlier this year.
 As the trial has approached, the company has also tried to build a sympathetic portrait of Mr. Ness, a longtime resident who is married to an Indonesian, and let it be known in this overwhelmingly Muslim country that he is a convert to Islam who has been to Mecca three times. 
 Manado, the scene of the trial and the capital of the province where the mine is located, is a familiar arena for Newmont. The company has been the biggest taxpayer to the provincial capital and has worked at playing the responsible corporate citizen. It has supported the local Sam Ratulangi University with grants and has been rewarded with stalwart support from its scientists. 
 During an interview in her chambers last week, the chief justice for the Manado provincial court, Juliana Wullur, 56, acknowledged that she was worried about understanding the scientific testimony. ''I'll have to be told what CN is,'' Ms. Wullur said, referring to the chemical formula for cyanide, which is commonly used in gold mining.
 A few days later, the Supreme Court in Jakarta requested that she and another judge be removed from the case because of its scientific complexity. Two new judges who attended special courses on the law and the environment replaced them.
 The choice of judges is especially important. Under Indonesian laws, which are based on Dutch jurisprudence, judges have exceptional authority over witnesses and evidence. 
 In many instances, according to Western lawyers, Indonesia's written laws are commendable but are often disregarded. Often cases are decided in the privacy of a judge's chambers, they said. There is no trial by jury.
 The prosecutor here in Manado, Robert Ilat, said in an interview last week that among the government's 34 witnesses would be 11 villagers from Buyat Bay who have complained of skin rashes, tumors and dizziness in the years after the mine began operations in 1996. 
 Newmont, which finished mining operations last year, said the diseases were common in coastal areas with poor sanitation.
 Mr. Ilat said he would also argue that after 2000 the company did not have a permit from the Environment Ministry to deposit the mine waste, known as tailings, into the sea. The waste contains among other things mercury, arsenic, cyanide compounds, copper and iron. 
 The company says that it had the permits and that the tailings are nothing more than ground-up rock and sand. Newmont pumped more than 2,000 tons of it daily into the warm bay waters during the eight-year life of the mine at a depth of about 270 feet.
 The heart of the trial, both sides say, will be the expert testimony and scientific evidence, where there is likely to be sharply differing interpretations.
 As evidence, the company said it would include studies done last year by the World Health Organization and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, a government- and industry-financed group in Australia.
 The health organization said the villagers at Buyat Bay did not suffer from Minamata disease, an acute form of methyl mercury poisoning. It did not address other diseases.
 The Australian study said heavy-metal concentrations in the bay waters were below international standards, although it found elevated levels of arsenic, mercury and antimony in sediment in parts of the bay. The company argues that those elements cannot enter the food chain.
 Mr. Ilat, the prosecutor, said he would rely on a separate Environment Ministry report from last November. It found that the bay waters were clean but that the sediment was polluted with mercury and arsenic, which it said had entered the food chain after being ingested by microorganisms that are food for fish.
 The ministry's report said the fish in the bay were high in arsenic and recommended that villagers curtail their consumption. Newmont officials rejected the conclusions.
 Within Newmont itself, the mine was the subject of dispute when an internal company audit in 2001 showed that from 1997 to 2001 the managers had allowed 33 tons of mercury to escape into the air and the bay waters.
 The audit, which cited a number of infractions of Indonesian regulations and company policies, said the mine had failed to operate a pollution control device to collect the mercury for disposal. The company did not inform the Indonesian government of the releases.
 Asked about the emission, Glenn C. Miller, a professor of environmental science at the University of Nevada, who is an expert in the mining industry, said that it ''was one of the largest amounts of mercury released in to the atmosphere for any gold mine in modern times.''
 Newmont said that the releases were not harmful and that when Indonesia gave its initial approval for the mine there was no standard for mercury in the air.
 After the findings concerning mercury were published in The New York Times last December, the company hired four consultants to review the audit. The review found that the emissions did not violate Indonesian or American air standards. 
 In an interview, Robert Gallagher, vice president of Newmont's Indonesian operations, described the audit as a draft and said that ''the areas of concern were addressed.''

HEADLINE: OFFER BY EUROPE WOULD GIVE IRAN NUCLEAR FUTURE 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
In a first test of the new leadership in Iran, European negotiators have prepared a sweeping proposal that raises the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear reactors and fuel, and of achieving a full political and economic relationship with the West, if it ends nuclear activities suspected to be part of a weapons program, Western diplomats said Thursday.
 The European offer, drafted with the tacit approval of the Bush administration, is to be transmitted by the end of this weekend as the latest step in a European-American effort to get Iran to abandon its suspected nuclear arms ambitions. That effort has run into repeated difficulties, most recently over Iran's announced intention to resume uranium conversion and enrichment in defiance of European warnings.
Western diplomats who have read the European offer or who know its contents said that it presented a full spectrum of relationships for Iran with the West, from technology sharing to trade preferences to security guarantees, if the Tehran government cooperates on nuclear matters, and also on improving human rights and combating terrorism. They said it was much more detailed and specific than the more general offers floated by the Europeans earlier this year, but they did not describe the offer in full. 
 Since it seeks a pledge by Iran to end the uranium conversion and enrichment activities that Iran insists are its prerogative under international accords governing nuclear technology, there is considerable doubt that Iran will accept it, at least right away. Iran suspended its nuclear work during the negotiations.
 A senior Iranian official, reached by telephone on Thursday, said when told about the contents of the proposal that it seemed to fall far short of what Iran wanted.
 ''If the proposal asks Iran to continue its suspension indefinitely, let alone renouncing these activities, I think it will be dead on arrival,'' said the senior official, whose job involves him directly in these matters but who would not be identified by name because he had not seen the document. ''I don't think it's prudent for the Europeans to make this presentation, because it shows that they have not moved their position from that of two years ago.''
 A European official said: ''Our proposal pulls together a whole range of different ideas intended to forge a framework for an arrangement between Iran and the rest of the world. There are lots of political, economic and security elements, but the biggest piece is the offer of cooperation on a civilian nuclear program for Iran. We've never said that Iran cannot have one.''
 Bush administration officials say they cannot comment on the contents of the proposal, except to say that they approved of it. But the administration maintains that it cannot establish a normal relationship with Iran unless it changes its conduct, not simply in the nuclear sphere but in what the United States and the Europeans say is support of terrorism, particularly against Israel, and its interference in Iraq. 
 Details of the package were disclosed by diplomats who insisted they not be identified even by country because the package is supposed to be secret and its terms have not yet been formally presented to Iran. 
 The proposal would bar Iran from operating a ''closed'' nuclear fuel cycle, in which it would effectively control every aspect of fuel production and disposal. Instead, according to the diplomats who have seen it, the proposal suggests that Iran be allowed to acquire fuel and then transfer the used fuel to another country for disposal, precluding Iran from using it for weapons.
 More specifically, Iran would be obliged to continue its current suspension of the conversion of raw uranium into a gas that can be enriched for use as fuel with the use of centrifuges that international inspectors have found in Iran in several places. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which has said that it is investigating Iran's failure to disclose many elements of its program, would continue to play its inspection role to ensure compliance with the agreement.
 While taking a hard line on uranium conversion and enrichment, the diplomats said, the proposal contains a face-saving provision for Iran conceding its right to certain activities it is being asked to give up. The wording, according to one diplomat, says that nothing in an agreement with Iran affects ''the inalienable rights of all the parties to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.''
 In some respects, Iran is not likely to be surprised by the basic outlines of the European proposal. France, Germany and Britain -- the partners along with the European Union in the negotiations -- have held firm to this broad position of barring uranium conversion and enrichment under pressure from Washington.
 The view shared in Europe and Washington is that while Iran may have the right to enrich uranium as a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty, which governs peaceful nuclear technology in nearly all countries with civilian nuclear programs, Iran has forfeited that right because it has been found over the years to be engaging in clandestine activities.
 Iran's anger that it is being asked to give up activities allowed to other countries is at the heart of its repeated announcement that, like it or not, it will resume such work when it chooses. Indeed, Iran announced last week that it was renouncing its pledge of last year to suspend these uranium activities.
 On the other hand, the Tehran government has not unilaterally resumed uranium conversion or enrichment. Instead, it has called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to go to its facilities and break the inspectors' seals on equipment that would be used for these activities, and also to install monitors and sensors for the purpose of observing them.
 Iran's announcement was made in the days leading up to the inauguration Saturday of the new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who until recently was the mayor of Tehran. 
 It is widely believed in the West that Iran decided to invite the inspectors before Mr. Ahmadinejad took office in order not to taint him with the move or force him to make one of his first decisions in defiance of the wishes of the Europeans.
 Several diplomats said that it was shrewd of Iran, in political terms, to invite the International Atomic Energy Agency to its nuclear facilities to break the seals and install monitors and sensors. That way, these diplomats said, Iran can claim to be showing the world that, while it is proceeding with uranium processing, not a single gram of fuel will go to a weapons program. 
 The international agency, meanwhile, has been taking its time before installing the sensors and monitors, to give the Europeans time to refine their proposal. The Europeans have rushed the proposal to meet a deadline of this week and have begun hinting that if Iran rejects it outright, or forces the seals to be broken, some countries may call for the agency's board to meet next week to address the matter.
 That Iranian tactic, said several Western diplomats, seems clearly intended to woo wavering board members of the agency -- notably Russia, China and several other countries with similar enrichment programs -- that it is acting in good faith and doing what other countries are allowed to do. They expressed concern about getting enough votes on the board to refer the matter to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions.

HEADLINE: New Member Joins Board For NYRA 

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 4 

 BODY:
Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, today appointed a new member to the oversight board for the New York Racing Association here and urged legislators to quickly decide the fate of the state's racetracks.
 Senator Bruno named Joseph Torani, a financial consultant from Saratoga Springs, to the five-member Nonprofit Racing Oversight Board, which was formed as a part of a package signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki this week. 
At the same time, Bruno urged Governor Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to quickly fill out the oversight panel, as well as a nine-member advisory committee that will set up a process and evaluate bids for the franchise to run Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga Racecourse. 
 The racing association's franchise to run the three racetracks expires after 2007, and it is awaiting word from federal prosecutors to see if it has satisfied its deferred prosecution agreement. If so, charges related to the association's role in a 2003 tax evasion scandal involving several mutuel clerks will be dismissed.
 Bruno's remarks echoed those made earlier this week by Neil Getnick, the court-appointed monitor who has been overseeing the racing association's daily operations. Getnick praised the association as an industry leader and said new management had reformed the organization.
 Bruno said: ''I believe they are clean and competent. They are ahead by light years of where they were two years ago.''
 Still, he indicated that he was eager to see proposals from rival racetrack operators, casino companies, technology firms and investment houses interested in bidding on the racing franchise, which is part of a $2.4 billion horse racing economy that employs more than 35,000. 
 He said that horse racing was going through a ''dynamic change'' and that legislators needed to move quickly to identify the best deal for the state.
 ''We need to be off and running,'' Bruno said. ''Not still in the starting gate. We have made progress, but we need to keep moving forward.''

HEADLINE: Assessments Find Threat Of Suicide Attacks in U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
Confidential government assessments say that Al Qaeda remains intent on attacking targets in the United States and that suicide bombings are clearly ''a preferred method of attack among extremists'' in the wake of last month's terror attacks in London. 
 The July 7 attacks on the London transit system, as well as others overseas, have prompted American officials to reassess potential threats to targets in the United States. Their conclusions, circulated among law enforcement officials by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, differ little from many earlier assessments since the Sept. 11 attacks but make clear that officials see Al Qaeda as a continued threat at home.
Although American intelligence officials ''do not believe the London attack necessarily presumes a similar attack against rail or mass transit targets in the United States, there has been consistent threat reporting for some time suggesting that terrorists may have an interest in targeting mass transit systems,'' according to a security bulletin on July 20. 
 A second security bulletin also prepared after the London bombings warned that in addition to setting off bombs on trains and subways, Al Qaeda might seek to derail trains or crash a truck carrying flammable material into trains. 
 Intelligence officials are also concerned that terrorists linked to Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups may again turn to airplanes as a method of attack by sending operatives to flight training schools or using ''an increased number of operatives'' in the aviation industry to evade tightened airport security measures. 
 Still another target considered vulnerable by intelligence officials are high-rise apartment buildings. In one potential terrorist plot that officials have previously linked to ones considered by Jose Padilla, an American citizen now imprisoned as an enemy combatant, the bulletin says Al Qaeda may consider renting rooms in a high-rise building and using natural gas as an explosive to destroy it. But it cautions that the feasibility of such a plot is questionable.
 The bulletin suggests that fresh intelligence collected as recently as this spring showed that Al Qaeda ''remains interested in striking the homeland to undermine U.S. security and damage the U.S. economy.'' Since the London bombings, American officials have tightened security at many mass transit systems and have been combing leads from Queens to Oregon in search of possible connections to the attacks. So far, officials say they have found no hard evidence to suggest any complicity or knowledge by anyone in the United States, nor have they found any evidence to suggest plans under way for an attack here. 
 ''We have no specific credible information to indicate that an attack in the United States is imminent or that Al Qaeda operatives are in the United States to conduct a homeland attack,'' one of the intelligence bulletins concluded. 
 With federal officials seeking to provide law enforcement officers with quicker and more useful information to guard against terror attacks, some local officials have become more aggressive in developing their own policies and procedures. 
 A group of police chiefs, frustrated by what they see as the slow pace of information from federal officials, has begun creating a network to share terrorist-related intelligence. 
 And the International Association of Chiefs of Police, with 20,000 members worldwide, has issued new training guidelines to its members advising them to have officers shoot a suicide bomber in the head to avoid a life-threatening detonation.
 The new guidelines, which were developed before the London bombings and first reported Thursday by The Washington Post, represent a more deadly posture in dealing with the threat of possible suicide bombers, said Joseph Estey, who is president of the chiefs' association and the police chief in Hartford, Vt. 
 ''These are new circumstances for us to deal with, and this is an aggressive policy to respond to a narrow set of circumstances,'' Chief Estey said in an interview Thursday. If an officer believes he is confronting a suicide bomber who may be about to explode a bomb, he said, the new guidelines ''call for a head shot, which unfortunately is the securest way of disabling someone who may have a suicide device and may try to detonate it.''
 Chief Estey acknowledged that the shooting death last month in a London subway of a Brazilian man, whom the police mistakenly thought was a suicide bomber, underscored the tragic possibilities if the police make the wrong decision.
 For an officer to make a spot decision on whether someone is a would-be suicide bomber ''is a real tough question, and there are situations where you're not sure,'' he said. ''But when you're making those decisions on the fly, you have to have the greater public good in mind and try to save other people's lives.''

HEADLINE: Buying a Second Home Without a First Look

BYLINE: By TIM NEVILLE

 BODY:
PAUL NELSON had never seen Paraiso del Mar, a resort and golf community in La Paz, Mexico, on the Baja Peninsula, before he signed a contract to buy a $200,000 beachfront condominium there. And he didn't even consider flying down to check it out before putting down a deposit.
 ''I thought in the very worst case, at $200,000, I'm not going to get hurt that bad,'' said Mr. Nelson, 58, a semiretired songwriter from Nashville. ''I don't lose any sleep.'' 
Mr. Nelson is just one of a growing number of people who are bidding on investment properties, second homes, even primary residences, before seeing what they are buying. Indeed, buyers from Las Vegas to Manhattan have recently signed deals for as much as $2.25 million to buy places they've never been in, according to local brokers and their clients. Though the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and the National Association of Realtors have no data on purchases made sight unseen, officials at both groups say they are hearing more anecdotal reports of these sales than ever. 
 ''Nine years ago you would never have heard of this,'' said Jim Nabors, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. ''We have no empirical data, but you go to a conference and you hear people talking about this more and more. I'd say the numbers have probably increased dramatically.''
 With economists expecting a record eight million-plus houses and other residences to sell in 2005, people are worried they will miss opportunities if they don't buy, especially with prices in some markets rising $20,000 in a matter of months, said David Lereah, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors and author of ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' Last year, 36 percent of all real estate sales, or about $560 billion, were of vacation homes and investment properties, he said.
 Americans are not the only ones jumping at properties they haven't visited. Lynne Knapp, a Realtor who runs BestBrowardProperty.com, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said that this year she has sold British buyers two homes, each for about $1 million, that the clients had only seen in e-mailed photographs. Part of the reason international buyers are willing to take a gamble is that American properties are relatively cheap.
 ''With the exchange of the euro right now, people buying property today are getting a 24-percent-off coupon compared to people who bought with euros three years ago,'' said Ron Shuffield, president of Miami-based Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. 
 Of course, with more information available on the Web, ''sight unseen is kind of a misnomer,'' said Gary Garland, owner of Crested Butte Real Estate in Colorado. ''It's not like we're sending buyers Polaroids like we used to.''
 ''Virtual tours'' of vacation properties displayed over the Internet help people like Mr. Nelson, of Nashville, who also bought an $800,000 investment home sight unseen in Fort Lauderdale a few years ago, size up their purchases. ''If people can establish relationships over the Internet without seeing each other and get married, they can use the Internet to buy a home sight unseen,'' said Todd Costigan, a senior manager at the Center for Realtor Technology in Chicago.
 Still, a survey released in November 2004 by the National Association of Realtors that studied, in part, homebuyers' Internet use found that the link between the Web and buying sight unseen might not be as strong as people think. Of the 8,205 people surveyed who bought or sold houses in 2004, slightly more than half said they used the Internet ''frequently'' when shopping for property. Of those users, 3 percent said they visited zero homes before deciding to buy, including the homes they purchased. Sixteen percent of people who did not use the Internet frequently said they bought a house they had not visited during their hunt. The researchers who conducted the survey say that some home buyers may have seen the property at an earlier time, however. 
 Indeed, sight-unseen buyers often say they are familiar with the area where they've bought or have friends or relatives nearby who can look at a house on their behalf. Sales are nearly always contingent upon a home inspection, but rarely contingent upon actually seeing the property. 
 ''Sales move too fast for us to allow that,'' said John Fair, a developer behind Paraiso del Mar. When finished in 10 to 12 years, Paraiso del Mar is expected to have 2,000 condominiums, 1,500 homes, 1,000 hotel rooms, 2 golf courses and a 550-slip marina, though the development currently does not have completed roads. About half of the 350 units purchased so far -- $50 million in sales -- have sold to people who hadn't visited the site first, Mr. Fair said. 
 But buying property without seeing it in person is not risk free. Principally, the hot markets pushing sales could soon slow down. As the market cools to what Mr. Lereah expects will be single-digit growth, there will be fewer sight-unseen purchases, he said. ''People can get overexcited,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''That should go away.''
 Buyers can also be in for surprises when they finally see their properties. When Randy Burns, a retired Navy officer in San Diego, bought a $176,000 home in Spokane, Wash., without first seeing it, he had been warned that the walls were pink and that the kitchen was small. What the family member who had checked it out for him hadn't said was that the cooking area was so tiny that ''once you step in you feel like you are in a box,'' he said. Over all, though, he said the purchase had gone smoothly. 
 Ellen Ashley, 55, a Realtor from Portola Valley, Calif., signed a contract on a $650,000, 2,500-square-foot home on Vashon Island near Seattle that looked great on the Internet. Only when she visited it for the inspection did she find out about the noise from a nearby road. She was able to get out of the purchase. 
 But that didn't stop her when she found a $680,000 waterfront home with four bedrooms and two baths in Maine, also on the Web. Without visiting, she made an offer and, once it was accepted, flew out to see the views. Even then, she had to go on trust. ''It was hazy, and I was nervous, but I trusted them,'' Ms. Ashley said. ''I could hear the water lapping. I just couldn't see it all.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Falter as Shoppers Focus on Auto Deals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
July was a quiet and disappointing month for many of the nation's retailers, who were left with only modest sales gains after selling most of their summer merchandise during June, according to data released yesterday.
 Consumers were more interested in spending at auto dealers than at malls last month, and hot weather limited sales of some early fall items like sweaters.
 ''Consumers' focus isn't rising gasoline prices, but where the best deals are, and in July, that deal was in motor vehicles,'' Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said as merchants reported their monthly results. 
 According to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index, July sales at stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- rose 3.4 percent compared with a year earlier. Same-store sales are considered the best indicator of a retailer's health. July's results were below the 5.5 percent year-over-year gain in June. 
 Sales were sluggish at retailers including Federated Department Stores, J.C. Penney Company, Limited Brands, Gap Inc. and the Kohl's Corporation. Discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and Target were among the winners last month; sales in that group rose 4.4 percent, helped by air-conditioners and food items.
 Even in the usually strong teen retailing market, results were mixed, with Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. posting sales that beat expectations but with Abercrombie & Fitch announcing sales below Wall Street forecasts.
 ''Sales fell short of expectations. Strong sales in June left stores with very little inventory,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm in Swampscott, Mass. ''And hot weather hurt sales of fall clothing.''
 Wal-Mart reported a 4.4 percent gain in same-store sales. The results were in line with the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Financial. Target had a 5.5 percent gain in same-store sales, below the 6.7 percent estimate.
 High-end stores like Neiman Marcus continued to do well, as their shoppers have been first to benefit from the recovery. But moderate-price department stores, heavily dependent on apparel, had largely disappointing results. 
 Neiman Marcus had an 8.8 percent increase in same-store sales, better than the 6.8 percent estimate. 
 Penney had a 1.6 percent gain in same-store sales in its department store business, less than the 2.4 percent estimate.
 Federated had a 0.9 percent decline in same-store sales, well short of the 1.1 percent gain Wall Street had projected. Kohl's had a 0.5 percent decline in same-store sales, worse than the 1.9 percent gain that analysts had expected.
 Same-store sales at Talbots rose 11.3 percent, surpassing the 8.3 percent estimate. In a statement, Arnold B. Zetcher, chairman, president and chief executive, attributed the strong performance to robust sales of its marked-down summer items.
 Gap suffered a 4 percent drop in same-store sales, below the 0.9 percent gain that Wall Street had expected. Limited had a 1 percent gain in same-store sales, less than the 2.1 percent analysts had forecast.
 Among teen retailers, Pacific Sunwear had a same-store sales gain of 4 percent, beating the 3.5 percent estimate. Abercrombie & Fitch had a robust 22 percent increase in same-store sales, but the results were below the 28.8 percent estimate.

HEADLINE: Steel Maker Lies at the Heart of a Struggle Over Privatization

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: EREGLI, Turkey 

 BODY:
A fierce-looking banner strung between two trees in this hillside town on the Black Sea sums up how the locals here feel about the steel factory that is their principal employer: ''Erdemir is our sweat,'' it proclaims. ''Each of us would die for it.''
 Turkey recently put this state-controlled company, its biggest steel maker, on the auction block.
 With 13 suitors lining up to bid, including firms from Russia, Britain and South Korea, Erdemir could become one of Turkey's most successful privatizations -- a potent symbol of its economic progress as Turkey begins arduous negotiations this fall to join the European Union.
 But first the sale has to happen. 
 The auction process has run into an unexpected surge of opposition from political leaders and business executives, who argue that privatizing the company is not necessary, given its profits.
 Moreover, they add, Turkey cannot afford to surrender a strategic asset, especially when Europeans seem increasingly reluctant to admit the Turks into their club of nations.
 Then there are the factory's 7,500 workers, who fear they could lose their jobs under a foreign owner. Protests have erupted here and in other cities, as Erdemir has become a fraught symbol of Turkey's uneasy passage from its sheltered past into a free-market future.
 ''This is a real test for Turkey,'' said Metin Kilci, the president of the Turkish Privatization Administration, which hopes to sell Erdemir by the end of the year and follow it with sales of other state assets, including an insurance company, a sugar factory and the Istanbul Hilton.
 The Turkish government has won kudos for stabilizing the economy, with the help of loans from the International Monetary Fund, after a deep crisis in 2001 brought this nation of 69 million to the brink of bankruptcy. Turkey's output grew nearly 9 percent last year, a pace that rivaled that of China.
 The government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also credited with taming decades of sky-high inflation, which had turned Turkey's currency, the lira, into something close to funny money.
 But the process of privatizing state-owned companies has been dogged for 20 years by legal challenges and political interference. As Turkey bids for a place in the European Union -- a step the United States supports -- it is eager to show its resolve to open its economy.
 ''We would be more than happy if a foreign company wins this tender,'' Mr. Kilci said in an interview in Ankara, the nation's capital.
 Mr. Kilci expressed disappointment that the United States Steel Corporation was not on the initial list of potential bidders, and said he hoped it might join in later. U.S. Steel, based in Pittsburgh, owns factories in Slovakia and Serbia. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment.
 Analysts, however, said a sale to any foreign buyer could still be blocked. The chamber of commerce here has filed a suit opposing a sale. National opposition is robust and well organized. And there is a receptive audience for dark warnings about foreigners taking advantage of Turks. The dispute has been featured on the front pages for weeks.
 ''There's a Turkish saying, 'We serve foreigners the best meat -- the lamb without the bones,''' said Cemal Senturk, who represents local manufacturers that buy steel plates from Erdemir.
 Turkey's attitude toward outsiders has not been softened by the chilly reception it is getting these days in Europe. Although its campaign to join the union is still officially on track, with membership negotiations scheduled to start in early October, popular sentiment in Europe has turned noticeably against it.
 Some of that is fueled by fears that low-cost Turkish workers will take European jobs. Some is linked to security concerns that have intensified since the London bombings: as a Muslim country, Turkey cannot escape the taint of radical Islamic militancy, even if it is a moderate secular society.
 Politics reflects the popular mood. In Germany, Angela Merkel, a conservative leader who opposes Turkey's bid, is leading in polls six weeks before an election for chancellor. In France, the politician of the moment is Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister and would-be president, who has also expressed qualms about Turkey.
 ''The Turks are quite angry,'' said Katinka Barysch, the chief economist of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, who recently wrote a report about Turkey. ''They think, 'We've done so much for the E.U., now the E.U. needs to do something for us.'''
 In the case of Erdemir and its steel operation, critics say Europe's biggest contribution would be to skim off the cream of its output.
 The company currently supplies about one-third of Turkey's demand for flat steel, which is used to make ships, cars, machinery and household appliances. If a foreign buyer took over Erdemir, people here say the company would export the high-quality steel to Western Europe, forcing Turkish companies to switch to lower-quality steel imported from Ukraine or Kazakhstan.
 ''The foreigners are very profit-oriented,'' Mr. Senturk said. ''Why would they care about the problems in Turkey?''
 Twenty-three Turkish manufacturers that buy steel from Erdemir have banded together to submit their own bid for the company. But they face well-financed rivals, like Mittal Steel of London and Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, which are the world's two largest steel makers. 
 Owning a steel plant in Turkey is attractive, analysts say, because the country has become a hub for auto manufacturing: Ford, Toyota, Renault and Fiat make cars here. Arcelor has ties to Renault, analysts say, and might like a Turkish factory to supply the local Renault plant.
 More broadly, the global steel industry is ripe for consolidation. After two years of voracious demand, much of it driven by China's economy, analysts predict a sharp slowdown in sales, which could result in a surplus. Acquisitive giants like Mittal, which already owns 8.6 percent of Erdemir's shares, are seizing the chance to add to their holdings.
 The Turkish government knows it has a brief window in which it can command a premium price. ''Steel is a cyclical business,'' Mr. Kilci said. ''In five years, it might be losing money again.''
 Erdemir was founded in 1960 and began production in 1965. It lost a total of $169 million from 2001 to 2002, which were difficult years for the steel industry, before rebounding with a profit of $261 million in 2003 and $473 million last year.
 Although the Turkish state owns only 46 percent of Erdemir's shares, it controls the board and appoints senior management. Even those managers sounded dubious when asked why Turkey should sell it.
 ''That's the question I constantly keep asking,'' said A. Kerim Dervisoglu, who became the chief executive in 2003.
 Mr. Dervisoglu trimmed the work force to 7,500 people, from 8,400. He upgraded the factory's two hot-rolling mills, which expanded their production capacity. And he began construction of a cavernous new mill, which will turn out large plates of steel suitable for shipbuilding.
 On Tuesday, days after this interview, Erdemir announced that Mr. Dervisoglu had stepped down as chief executive because of poor health. Analysts in Istanbul said his exit most likely reflected his feelings about the sale.
 The pressure to divest Erdemir is also driven by Turkey's parlous public finances. The Turkish government is running a budget deficit equivalent to 8 percent of its gross domestic product. The company, which is publicly traded, has a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. Given a premium for change of control, that implies Ankara could realize $1.5 billion for its stake.
 Beyond that, privatizations are a handy way to attract foreign investors. Turkey lured only $1.2 billion in foreign direct investment last year, a paltry number for an economy of its size. Foreigners have been put off by the cumbersome regulations and, until recently, the gyrating economy.
 While Erdemir is making money, some critics say its financial prowess has been wildly exaggerated.
 ''It's making a profit because the demand for steel is going crazy in places like China,'' said Ishak Alaton, the chairman of Alarko Holding, a conglomerate with interests in construction, fisheries and resort hotels. ''If it were in private hands, it would make 10 times the profit.''
 Mr. Alaton said a cabal of government bureaucrats and business people was fomenting opposition to the sale of Erdemir out of a desire to maintain control of a lucrative asset.
 The opportunities for corruption are easy to see. Mr. Kilci noted that Erdemir had always supplied the president of the privatization administration with a free car -- in his case, an Audi A6. ''After we privatize Erdemir, I'll have to switch to a Fiat,'' he said with a wry laugh.
 Critics, however, say the government's headlong rush to sell a thriving company could weaken public support for future sales. ''It gives the impression of being ideological rather than rational or economic,'' said Gunhan Karakullukcu, an economist and business consultant.
 Here in Erdemir's hometown, the feelings are mostly personal. The company has built schools, movie theaters and sports centers for Eregli, and donated property for employees to build houses. It even sponsors an annual ''love, peace and friendship'' festival.
 ''This is not only financial,'' said Semsi Durdu, a Hyundai dealer who depends on the factory's workers for a good portion of his sales. ''There's a lot of emotion attached to it.''

HEADLINE: Aggressive Search by CnoocFor New Oil and Gas Seen

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The Chinese energy company Cnooc is preparing to mount an aggressive international search for oil and gas supplies in the aftermath of its failed bid for Unocal, oil industry experts say.
 In announcing on Tuesday that it would abandon its $18.5 billion offer, Cnooc, shorthand for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, signaled that it would continue to work with foreign governments and companies in its search for overseas oil and gas reserves.
Energy market experts now expect Cnooc, which is controlled by the Beijing government, to explore opportunities throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Central Asia, Russia and West Africa to find energy supplies for China's booming economy.
 ''Cnooc lost the battle over Unocal, but it will continue to wage the war toward acquiring overseas energy assets to support China's growing energy needs,'' said Kurt A. Barrow, an analyst in Singapore with the energy consultant Purvin & Gertz. 
 The hostile reaction in Washington to Cnooc's bid was a pointed reminder to the Chinese that politics remains a major obstacle to their plans to increase energy security. China's growing oil imports have helped drive prices near record highs as competition for energy emerges as a point of friction among the big manufacturing economies. 
 Given its rebuff in the United States, said Ma Shang, an energy industry analyst with Fitch Ratings in Beijing, Cnooc should place less emphasis on big investments in Southeast Asia and South America, regions where Washington exerts strong political influence. Instead, Cnooc should follow PetroChina, which has secured substantial reserves in Central Asia.
 ''Because the energy market regards Cnooc as a state-owned enterprise,'' Mr. Ma said, ''its overseas acquisitions are more political compared with other global players. Cnooc should look to Central Asia or Russia. Compared to the U.S., these regions and Russia are more friendly to China.''
 Many analysts say that Cnooc, which is listed on stock markets in New York and Hong Kong, is unlikely to find investment targets as attractive as Unocal, but that its political backing and access to cheap money will continue to make it competitive in world markets.
 And Chinese energy companies have other advantages. Some have invested in places like Sudan, Iran and Myanmar, where the major international oil companies are unwilling or unable to operate, Mr. Barrow said.
 Cnooc plans to become an important supplier of liquefied natural gas to China, and there are signs that it will concentrate on investment in natural gas reserves in Asia.
 Experts suggested two such targets: Woodside Petroleum of Australia, which operates the North West Shelf natural gas project and owns 16.7 percent of it; and the Gorgon natural gas development, led by Chevron. Cnooc is already linked to both ventures, which have substantial reserves off northwest Australia.
 In a complex agreement in 2002, Cnooc formed a joint venture with the North West Shelf project's six partners, including Chevron, to take a stake of about 5 percent in the gas fields. Cnooc's share of the reserves is equivalent to liquefied natural gas shipments of about 3.3 million metric tons a year over two decades starting in 2006, and with an estimated value of $20 billion. The venture supplies as much as 10 percent of Japan's liquefied gas imports.
 Analysts say that Woodside would be an ideal investment for Cnooc as it seeks to become China's leading supplier of liquefied gas. Ownership of Woodside would also give Cnooc access to advanced deepwater exploration and development technology, a consideration that experts say was a major factor in its bid for Unocal.
 Shell is the biggest shareholder in Woodside, with 34 percent. The Australian government in 2001 rejected a takeover bid from Shell because it would have given a foreign company control over the extraction and marketing of a major Australian energy resource. But China is soon expected to become Australia's biggest trading partner, which might make officials in Canberra more flexible if Cnooc pursued Woodside.
 In 2003, Cnooc signed an agreement with the Gorgon partners -- Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Shell -- that called on them to ''place a significant volume of Gorgon L.N.G. for use in the growing Chinese market.'' Cnooc was reported to be seeking a 12.5 percent stake in the project.
 But talks with the Gorgon partners have failed so far to produce an agreement on price. Scott Walker, a spokesman for the venture, based in Perth, Australia, said that discussions were continuing.

HEADLINE: In a City on the Move, a Civil War Issue Refuses to Die

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANSTON

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
A clamor always seems to accompany any mention here of Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, the cavalryman whose outnumbered men whipped the Yankees at Brice's Crossroads in northern Mississippi.
 He was not just any Confederate hero. After the war, he returned to Memphis and, in 1867, became the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
Today, Memphis is a city on the move. It has a new downtown basketball arena and minor-league baseball stadium, will soon have a new biomedical research complex, and is trying to lure the headquarters of International Paper. But many people here believe that Forrest's name and even his grave are in the way of progress.
 This summer, a downtown development agency urged the City Council to consider renaming Forrest Park, as well as two other city parks, Confederate Park and Jefferson Davis Park. A prominent local lawyer suggested turning over Forrest Park to the University of Tennessee and transferring the bodies of Forrest and his wife away from the park, back to the cemetery from which they came. 
 This week Mayor Willie Herenton said ''digging up and moving graves or renaming parks is not the proper way of dealing with the issue,'' but Mr. Herenton left the door open for others to do just that. He proposed giving Forrest Park to the university and giving the two other parks to the nonprofit Riverfront Development Corporation.
 ''In the aftermath of the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in our city, we do not need another event that portrays Memphis nationally as a city still racially polarized and fighting the Civil War all over again,'' Mayor Herenton said at a news conference on Wednesday.
 Although the mayor, who is black, seemed to capture many Memphians' exasperation over the issue, he did not convince those who want the parks renamed.
 A local minister is organizing a protest march on Aug. 13 and says he is trying to get national civil rights leaders to participate.
 Walter Bailey, a black lawyer and senior member of the Shelby County Commission, said: ''The best solution is to eliminate the offensive monuments and park names. By doing so, out goes the memories that they dredge up.''
 In 1905, the bodies of Forrest and his wife, Mary, were moved from Elmwood Cemetery, where he was buried in 1877, to the park on Union Avenue, and a life-sized equestrian statue of the general was erected by Confederate veterans. These days, Forrest Park is more debated than visited. Thousands of cars pass by it every day on the main street leading to downtown, but it is beyond walking distance from tourist attractions like Beale Street and the Peabody hotel.
 The dispute over Forrest has simmered and occasionally boiled over for years. He is a favorite target of some black elected officials, despised for his slave trading before the Civil War and his Klan leadership afterward. Many blame him for the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow during the war, but some historians disagree about whether he was responsible.
 Public criticism of him invariably prompts a return volley of letters and postcards from groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
 It was not lost on many that the parks issue resurfaced so soon after Shelby Foote, a Civil War authority and a Memphis resident, died in June. Mr. Foote had long opposed renaming the parks, arguing that the Civil War and the Confederacy were an indelible part of the region's past.
 Kevin Bradley, Forrest's great-great-grandson, would like to keep his ancestor's name and bones in place. ''I hope we can just move on and get this behind us,'' Mr. Bradley said this week at a news conference with two city councilmen.
 Mayor Herenton's proposal to transfer Forrest Park would have to be approved by the City Council and the university.
 Elizabeth Maynard-Garrett, a spokeswoman for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, said the center would have to review the mayor's suggestion. She said Thursday that it was ''too soon to tell'' whether the university would rename the park, if it took the offer.
 The health science center is in a forlorn section of Memphis that is being transformed by new buildings for the university and the biomedical research complex. When the new pieces are in place, Forrest Park, and its bronze statue of Forrest on horseback, will be right in the middle -- unless the statue is removed, as some would like to happen.
 There have been other proposals for how the handle the Forrest issue, like giving generic names to the parks and adding monuments of black heroes. Last week, the mayor of Southaven, Miss., a fast-growing city where many white Memphians have moved over the years, said he would be happy to have the Forrest equestrian statue in Southaven.

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' Opens Tuesday. Has the prospect of the end of the ''Star Wars'' series sent you into a deep, dark depression? Cheer up with Charles Ross's light-speed spin through the original three movies (you know, the good ones), in which he plays all the parts, including the ships (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.

'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' Opens Thursday. A musician and wedding singer gets an opportunity to sign with a major label, but that will mean leaving his bandmates behind. A musical about selling out (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)

'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)


* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jonathan Kalb)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)

'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

*'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)

Off Off Broadway

'BROTHER' Nothing is quite what it seems at first in ''Brother,'' Lisa Ebersole's confrontational one-act play about a pair of sisters who taunt each other, and a black man who suddenly joins them in the middle of the night in an East Village apartment. The audience is uncomfortably close to the action in this theater-in-the-round production, which starts with an ambiguous tension that quickly escalates (55 minutes). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)

'THE PERSIANS' Though he himself fought with the victorious Greeks, Aeschylus wrote the tragedy of ''The Persians'' entirely from the perspective of the vanquished. This imaginative musical production by a young company called Waterwell extends that act of empathy, while also managing to be wildly funny and entertaining (1:15). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment. (1:45) Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

* 'BUSTED JESUS COMIX' Based on the story of the only cartoonist ever to be tried and convicted of obscenity, this nicely performed 65-minute satire belongs to a rich dramatic tradition of turning dirty-minded artists into First Amendment heroes. David Johnston's script touches on the trial and fills out an invented biography that gives the play a satisfying arc. Access Theater , 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'THE GUT GIRLS' Like the large unwieldy carcass the Victorian-era characters must tackle in a slaughterhouse, this preachy British play by Sarah Daniels doesn't yield to either the director or the dialect coach in this revival, though several actresses manage to surmount the obstacles in a fashion (2:45). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Stevens)

'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz is himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212)719-1300, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

*'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)

*'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)

'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Mr. Dai, adapting his own novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970s, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)

*'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)

*'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)

'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam, hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (Scott)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold and entertaining. (Stephen Holden)

'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

* 'THE CONFORMIST' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Italian) Bertolucci's 1970's look at the soul man under Fascism returns to take us back not only to the Mussolini years, but also, more dramatically, to the time of its own making, a cinematic era of stylistic daring and aesthetic bravura. (Scott)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

*'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)

* 'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)

*'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)

'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British Empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

*'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

*'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)

'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)

*'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)

'OYSTER FARMER' (not rated, 93 minutes) ''Oyster Farmer,'' the Australian writer-director Anna Reeves's debut feature, soaks up the lush scenery of New South Wales's Hawkesbury River, a setting that often takes precedence to the underdeveloped story and characters, including Jack, a 24-year-old petty thief who's a newcomer to the unglamorous but strangely fascinating world of oyster farming. An uneven but ultimately endearing film that manages to portray ordinary life in a refreshingly authentic way. (Laura Kern)

* 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)

*'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'STEALTH' (PG-13, 117 minutes) A preposterous hash of ''Top Gun'' and ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' topped with a soupcon of ''2001,'' this crypto-video game about three stealth pilots has the makings of a kitsch classic; too bad it's not remotely funny. (Dargis)

* 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question, ''Is there life after high school?,'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)

*'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, ''Tony Takitani'' tells the story of a lonely man who at age 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. The film was directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)

* 'THE 3 ROOMS OF MELANCHOLIA' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Russian, Chechen, Arabic and Finnish) By focusing on children from both sides of the conflict, this magnificent Finnish documentary shows how the Russian-Chechen war may be perpetuated into the next generation. The beautifully photographed and scored film journeys from a boys' military school in Russia, to Chechnya's ruined capital city of Grozny, to an orphanage just across the Chechen border. (Holden)

' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)

'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. (Dargis)

Film Series

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

AMADOU AND MARIAM (Monday) Amadou and Mariam, a duo who met in a school for the blind in Mali, build their pop from relatively traditional materials; their songs start out sweetly and spiral upward with increasing passion.

(Jon Pareles)

TREY ANASTASIO, GOV'T MULE (Tomorrow) Mr. Anastasio, the leader of the now defunct jam band Phish, has spent recent down time joining proteges onstage and recording a stripped-down guitar album, ditching the studio filigree of his previous solo outing. Classic rock underpins the whiskeyed country funk of Gov't Mule. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y.; (516)221-1000; $38. (Laura Sinagra)

ANGER MANAGEMENT TOUR 3 (Monday and Tuesday) Rumor has it that the clever, crass rapper Marshall Mathers may retire his Eminem moniker after this tour, though what that means for his career trajectory is anybody's guess. He is joined here by the cybernetically buff superstar 50 Cent and the gravel-voiced Dirty South cheerleader Lil Jon, as well as the entourage posses D12 and G-Unit, as well as Eminem's latest protege, the modestly named Stat Quo. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden; (212)465-6741; $60 to $90. (Sinagra)

ISSA BAGAYOGO (Tonight) Mali's ''Techno Issa'' combines the traditional Wassoulou and Manding music of his homeland with Western club electronics and ethereal backing vocals, resulting in an internationalist chill-room mix. 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place; (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)

BUSH TETRAS (Tonight) The Bush Tetras are No Wave luminaries whose funky punk made them downtown faves in 1980, and who have lived on as a favorite of crate-digging D.J. scavengers since that heyday. This show will benefit the CBGB legal fund for fees incurred during the club's recent lease struggles. 9, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village; (212)982-4052; $15. (Sinagra)

KASEY CHAMBERS (Tomorrow) This spunky Australian alt-country singer-songwriter has a flair for old-timey melodies and sassy sadness free of faux-Appalachian theatrics or indie-rock irony. Her recent work has been more inspirational in nature, and a little on the safe side. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; www.celebratebrooklyn.org, $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)

COHEED AND CAMBRIA, ATERCIOPELADOS (Tomorrow) In a departure from the more self-referential bands in their emo cohort, Coheed and Cambria play a rough brand of metallic rock that veers into the prog preoccupation with supernatural lore and legend. The Colombian rockers Aterciopelados mix trip-hop and anthem-rock with folk forms from throughout Latin America. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street; (212)360-2777; free. (Sinagra)

DEVO (Wednesday) The original Midwestern New Wave juggernaut, Devo has a tongue-in-cheek postmodern theatricality and undeniable stiff-necked danceability that helped shame underground music as well as MTV pop. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; (212)564-4882; $55 in advance; $60 at the door. (Sinagra)

CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Wednesday) The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rockers Neutral Milk Hotel, and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. The bill also includes the gypsy punk band DeVotchKa. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17 (Fulton Street), Lower Manhattan, www.southstreetseaport.com free. (Sinagra)

EAST VILLAGE OPERA COMPANY (Monday) The Canadians Peter Kiesewalter and Tyley Ross mix opera and rock to form something that is decidedly not ''rock opera.'' The band includes a string section and performs classical arias like ''La donna e mobile'' and ''Ave Maria,'' adding electronic percussion, guitar solos and flamboyant 80's keyboard antics. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; (212)533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)

THE LIKE (Tuesday) This Los Angeles all-girl trio plays music that mixes the ethereal, romantic tendencies of Tori Amos with the real-world, jaded So-Cal wistfulness of its pals Rilo Kiley. The singer-guitarist Z Berg sounds wise beyond her 18 years. With the Five O'Clock Heroes and New Blood Revival. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

FUNK BROTHERS (Tomorrow) It's been almost a quarter-century since Berry Gordy put together Motown's legendary backing band, whose most famous member was the bassist James Jamerson. In 2003, the living members jammed and recounted their sometimes hardscrabble history for the documentary ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown.'' Today's group includes the original members Jack Ashford and Joe Hunter. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212)997-4144; $40 in advance; $45 at the door. (Sinagra)

GIN BLOSSOMS (Monday) This band's hooky pop-rock combined the jangle of the Byrds with the trumped-up road-rock regret of 70's hitmakers like the Eagles. As time passes, their songs hold up as closer to the meditative folk-pop of Freedy Johnston than to the angsty alt-rock of Counting Crows. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $22 in advance; $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

JULIANA HATFIELD (Thursday) Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingenue, added sharp charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 80's and her own solo projects in the 90's. This singer-songwriter's mainstream profile dimmed with the mid-decade decline of alt-rock, but she continues to release albums with a low-key, confessional spark. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J.; (201)653-1703; $14. (Sinagra)

JOHN WESLEY HARDING (Tomorrow) Mr. Harding is a singer-songwriter whose alt-country tunes are informed by power-pop. For this program, ''The Love Hall Tryst,'' he gathers the Chicago chanteuses Kelly Hogan and Nora O'Connor, as well as the vocalist Brian Lohmann, to cover spare songs by groups like the Copper Family and the Watersons. Mr. Harding will play some of his songs, as will Ms. Hogan and Ms. O'Connor. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)

HOT SNAKES (Tuesday) The Hot Snakes include former members of the noisy, dizzyingly propulsive 90's bands Rocket From the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu. But in this configuration, they veer closer to hardcore punk. The band never toured after its last album, and there are rumors of a breakup after this summer's shows. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery; (212)533-2111; $17 in advance; $19 at the door. (Sinagra)

JUANES, RICARDO MONTANER, LUIS FONSI (Tomorrow) Juanes, a rocker from Colombia, has found a way to mesh the personal and the political. His songs about finding love and compassion, sung with a somber ardency, can apply to both romance and the turmoil in Colombia. Ricardo Montaner, who was born in Argentina and grew up in Venezuela, is one of Latin pop's top crooners. And Luis Fonsi, a Puerto Rican pop singer with crossover dreams, has made an English-language album that trades most Caribbean influence for pop-R&B. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall; (212)247-4777; $55 to $130. (Pareles)

KINGS OF LEON, SECRET MACHINES (Monday) Just as the frontman Caleb Johnston mushes his syllables, rendering language a blur, these Southern boys deftly confuse 70's and 80's, skinny ties and jeans jackets, dudely chauvinism and punk pathos. Secret Machines are a local psych-rock act. 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; (212)777-6800; $27 in advance; $30 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE KNITTERS (Thursday) An unlikely 80's revival, the Knitters (featuring Joe Doe and Exene Cervenka of X, and Dave Alvin of the Blasters) released only one album, 1985's rousing, hilarious punk hoedown ''Poor Little Critter in the Road'' (Slash). They've reunited this year to record a similarly loose album of their own material and some traditional oldies. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; (212)777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)

HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS (Tuesday) Before the part-time actor Huey Lewis gears up for his starring Broadway role as Billy Flynn in ''Chicago'' this fall, his band tours the middle-of-the-road radio rock that made them famous in the 80's -- hits like ''Do You Believe in Love'' and the unconvincing polemic ''Hip to Be Square.'' 8 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y.; (516)334-0800; $52. (Sinagra)

LITTLE ANTHONY AND THE IMPERIALS (Wednesday) Little Anthony and the Imperials' hits from the late 50's and early 60's include ''Tears on My Pillow,'' ''Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop'' and ''Goin' Out of My Head.'' 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City; free. (Pareles)

M.I.A., DIPLO, DJ REKHA (Sunday) With her remix-friendly slogans and readymade radical chic, the British-Sri Lankan agit-popper Maya Arulpragasam has become an emblem of global beat matching and post-colonial shakedowns. The clever Philadelphia hip-hop producer Diplo, who is the D.J. tonight on a rock cruise with RJD2 (see below), is responsible for her popular underground mix disc ''Piracy Funds Terrorism'' (Hollertronix), which lays her vocals on music as diverse as 80's new wave and Brazilian baille funk. Basement Bhangra's DJ Rekha also spins. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street; (212)360-2777; free. (Sinagra)

MOS DEF, SMIF-N-WESSON (Sunday) This Brooklyn rapper has become more of an all-around celebrity than a rapper. He's diversified as a screen and stage actor, but his conscious rap skills have fallen a bit behind the times. Smif-n-Wesson recalls the city's mid-90's hip-hop heyday. The Eighth Annual Black August Hip Hop Benefit brings them out for a good cause. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212)997-4144; $20 to $30 (sold out). (Sinagra)

PLASTILINA MOSH, KINKY, JD NATASHA (Tonight) The Mexican culture-jammers Plastilina Mosh have fun mimicking globalist hodgepodge, swerving from funky dance music to punk to Latin hip-hop. Kinky plays a buzzing, more distorted guitar-based version of the same. The Argentine rock-tart singer JD Natasha is also on the bill. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, www.celebratebrooklyn.com $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)

ROGERS SISTERS (Tomorrow) Though the Brooklyn power-trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new wave craft during the recent Williamsburg spate of 80's revivalism, they seem to take themselves less seriously than most. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718)599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)

RJD2, DIPLO (Tonight) These two DJs represent two different offshoots of the crate-digging white kid tradition exemplified in the 90's by artists like DJ Shadow. RJD2 is perhaps the more cinematic of the two, while Diplo the more globally adventurous. Diplo also plays SummerStage tomorrow with M.I.A. (see above). 11, World Yacht Marina, Pier 81, West 41st Street and 12th Avenue, Clinton, www.worldyacht.com, $30 to $35. (Sinagra)

SHOUT OUT LOUDS (Sunday and Monday) Despite their punkish name, these Swedes make plaintive, occasionally folky, 60's-inspired romanticist rock, sometimes steadied by a new wave beat or leavened by humble dream-pop drift. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; (212)260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)

DONNA SUMMER (Tomorrow) The disco diva who teamed up with the producer Giorgio Moroder to steam up the dance floors with 70's and 80's hits like ''Love to Love You Baby'' and pop radio with burners like ''Bad Girls'' has long since left the sexpot thing behind for Jesus, but she still revisits her old hits with gusto. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Pkwy, Holmdel, N.J.; (732)335-0400; $20 to $68. (Sinagra)

HOWARD TATE (Tonight) This all-but-forgotten soul singer laid down his yearning, hoarse but sweet tracks at the turn of the 70's with the masterly and sympathetic producer Jerry Ragavoy. These recordings, including the moving love plea ''Get It While You Can,'' were rediscovered and championed in the late 90's, allowing the man to play to fuller houses and do some more recording. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place; (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)

RICHARD THOMPSON (Monday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Mr. Thompson, one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads. Then he plugs them in, adding some rock twang, and plays guitar solos that ring with ancient modes and go climbing up harmonic walls. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place; (212)239-6200; $38. (Pareles)

GEORGE THOROGOOD & THE DESTROYERS (Tuesday and Wednesday) With a growly voice, a strategic stutter and a blaring slide guitar, Mr. Thorogood rediscovered John Lee Hooker and Elmore James for a 1980's audience that heard the blues as hard-drinking, rowdy, good-time music. The blues has survived worse, and like Delaware's answer to the early Z.Z. Top, Mr. Thorogood and his band keep on pumping out basic blues-rock. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212)997-4144; $40 in advance; $45 at the door. (Pareles)

TSAR (Thursday) Energized but relatively charmless ambition fuels this Los Angeles group's belated follow-up to its 2001 glam-pop debut. That record failed to make the members stars, and naming their latest ''Band, Girls, Money'' only calls attention to its pop-punk overreach. 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side; (212)475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)

LUCINDA WILLIAMS (Tonight) With homely details and the names of southern cities, Ms. Williams maps a geography of loss and longing in her songs. The twang and determination in her voice, along with her rock-ribbed, country-rooted melodies, insist that she won't crumble, even in the toughest romantic circumstance. 8, State Theater, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, N.J.; (732)246-7469; $25 to $45. (Pareles)

Cabaret

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BILLY BANG QUINTET (Thursday) As a violinist and composer, Mr. Bang favors the astringency and formal tension of the 1970's loft scene; his frontline partner here is the equally adventurous trumpeter James Zollar. 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)

LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Wednesday through Aug. 13) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for the veteran alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, whose rhythm section consists of Randy Johnston on guitar, Kyle Koehler on organ and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30 ($35 Fridays and Saturdays), with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

MARK DRESSER TRIO (Sunday) Unconventional timbres and extended techniques are Mr. Dresser's specialty as a bassist, and this trio features musicians with equally expansive palates: the self-described ''hyperpianist'' Denman Maroney and the percussionist Mike Sarin. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

ELLERY ESKELIN TRIO (Tomorrow) Mr. Eskelin is a tenor saxophonist known for gruff abandon; his longtime band with the accordionist Andrea Parkins and the drummer Jim Black handles abstraction as well as groove. 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

*FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Through Aug. 20) Adventurous trumpeter-led bands dominate New York in August, thanks to this series organized by the horn players Dave Douglas, Roy Campbell and Jon Nelson. Highlights in the coming week include Tete-a-Tete, a project of the underrated Bobby Bradford (tonight); the Baikida Carroll Quartet, which walks a tightrope between freedom and form (tomorrow); and the Metatonal Band, an inside-out project led by the usually more traditional Randy Sandke (Sunday).

(Chinen)

AL FOSTER QUARTET (Tuesday through Aug. 14) Mr. Foster has a lithe touch as a drummer, ideal for modern jazz and more than suitable for funk; his band features the tenor saxophonist Eli Degibri, the pianist Kevin Hayes and the bassist Doug Weiss. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

RICK GERMANSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Germanson, a pianist, features the broad-toned alto saxophonist Vincent Herring in this modish bop ensemble. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212)885-7119; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BURTON GREENE TRIO (Wednesday) A force in New York's free-jazz movement during its formative years, Mr. Greene has lived an expatriate life since 1969; he's a pianist with an ear for texture (both acoustic and synthesized), and he has thoughtful collaborators here in the brothers Ed and George Schuller, on bass and drums. 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

LEE KONITZ NONET (Wednesday through Aug. 14) Mr. Konitz lends his venerable reputation and dry-martini alto saxophone tone to this midsize ensemble, which plays arrangements by the tenor saxophonist Ohad Talmor. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20 (Fridays and Saturdays, $25). (Chinen)

FRANK LACY ORGAN ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) Mr. Lacy is a trombonist with a free spirit but a taste for tonality; he goes for the gusto in this band, with the tenor saxophonist JD Allen, the Hammond B-3 organist Radam Schwartz, and the drummer Joe Brown Jr. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)

CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUINTET (Monday) A bassist with credentials in both straight-ahead and experimental circles, Mr. Lightcap fronts a group well suited to split the difference: Mark Turner and Tony Malaby on tenor saxophones, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes, and Gerald Cleaver on drums. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, (718)218-6934. No cover. (Chinen)

BILL McHENRY QUARTET (Through Sunday) Both as a tenor saxophonist and as a composer, Mr. McHenry heeds a patiently exploratory style; he often lets the focus shift to the harmonically advanced guitar playing of Ben Monder, the broadly dynamic bass playing of Reid Anderson and the sparse, intense drumming of Paul Motian. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

HENDRIK MEURKENS BRAZILIAN QUARTET (Tuesday) Mr. Meurkens, a skilled harmonica and vibraphone player, brings passion and clarity to his sambas, which he plays with an accompaniment of piano, bass and drums. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212)989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

THE NEW COOKERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Named after a mid-1960's Freddie Hubbard album, this cadre of young musicians seeks to restore the reputation of Brooklyn-based hard-bop; Keyon Harold takes the lead on trumpet, and Robert Glasper plays piano. 8 and 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

GREG OSBY'S SOUND THEATER (Sunday) MoMA is the perfect place for Mr. Osby, an alto saxophonist whose ruminative, sharp-cornered style has always seemed temperamentally Cubist. He takes to SummerGarden with a new quartet featuring the guitarist Liberty Ellman; they will give the debut of ''City Oasis,'' a composition inspired by the environs. 8 p.m., Museum of Modern Art Sculpture Garden, 14 West 54th Street, , Manhattan, (212)708-9491. Admission is free, but tickets are required, and will be distributed at 5:30 p.m. first-come-first-served. (Chinen)

DAVID 'FATHEAD' NEWMAN (Thursday through Aug. 14) The blues-inflected tenor saxophone sound of Mr. Newman was a prominent part of the Ray Charles Orchestra; for this tribute, vocal duties fall to Roseana Vitro, an experienced and likable singer. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $27.50 ($30 Fridays through Sundays), with a $10 minimum all nights.

(Chinen)

ARCHIE SHEPP/ROSWELL RUDD QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Shepp, a saxophonist, and Mr. Rudd, a trombonist, each contributed to the fiery legacy of the 1960's and 70's avant-garde; their recent collaborations have been calmer but still venturesome, and seasoned by the blues. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

 Opera

GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) Is it a leading opera company or an experimental theater, a proving ground for young artists or a showcase for stars? Glimmerglass aspires to be all these things with a summer season that ranges from an austere production of Benjamin Britten's valedictory ''Death in Venice'' to ''Lucie de Lammermoor,'' a French-language version of Donizetti's classic that verges, inadvertently, on comic relief. But through ups and downs there's a lot to like: take the American tenor William Burden, incandescent in the Britten as the writer Gustav von Aschenbach. Also on the summer program are Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. ''Cosi,'' tonight at 8, Monday at 2 p.m.; ''Death in Venice,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 2 p.m.; ''Lucie,'' tomorrow and Thursday at 8 p.m.; ''Portrait'' and ''Voix,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y.; (607)547-2255. Remaining tickets: tomorrow afternoon, $63 to $97; Tuesday and Thursday, $80; all others sold out. (Anne Midgette)

'REGINA' (Tonight and tomorrow) Based on Lillian Hellman's play ''The Little Foxes,'' Marc Blitzstein's opera aspires to forge a new American idiom with a conglomerate of styles, from salon music to jazz. It may not be the greatest opera in the world, but this production at Bard's SummerScape festival (with sets by Judy Pfaff) is spare, elegant and classy, and Lauren Flanigan is, not surprisingly, a Regina to contend with. 8 p.m. Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.; (845)758-7900; $35 to $65. (Midgette)

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. The week begins and ends with piano trios: tonight, Steven Beck, the pianist, is joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov and the cellist Eric Jacobsen in a program that includes a new trio by Elizabeth Adams and favorites by Mendelssohn (the D minor trio) and Haydn (the ''Gypsy'' Trio). On Thursday, the Trio Amelia takes over with works by Haydn, Brahms and John Harbison. And between the trios -- tomorrow and Sunday -- a larger band comes together to play Mozart's Symphony No. 29, as well as concertos for various instruments (cello, horn and piano) by Haydn and Mozart. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn; (718)624-2083; $35 tonight and Thursday; $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Allan Kozinn)

BERKSHIRE CHORAL FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) For listeners who love choral music, this festival is an ideal refuge, combining the charms of the Berkshires and highlights of the choral repertory, performed by a choir of 275 enthusiastic singers, supported by the Springfield Symphony, and conducted by renowned choral directors.

BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers trekking off to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season. Tonight at 7:30, Ms. Martin is joined by festival regulars in Mozart's Flute Quartet (K. 285). Also on the bill are Beethoven's Piano Quartet (WoO 36) and Brahms's F minor Piano Quintet, with its gripping scherzo movement. The same program repeats on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. Tonight at St. Andrew's Dune Church, Southampton, N.Y.; Sunday at Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, Bridgehampton, N.Y.; (631)537-6368; $35; $30 for 65+. (Jeremy Eichler)

COOPERSTOWN CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) Linda Chesis, the flutist who founded this energetic small festival, is joined by five other musicians for a period program of music written during the lifetime of James Fenimore Cooper, including Schubert (a fan of the author) and a performance on the Cooper family's barrel organ. This week there is also a solo cello recital by Mark Kosower on Monday and a program on Wednesday juxtaposing Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' and Astor Piazzolla's ''Four Seasons Suite,'' with a family concert the next day. Sunday night at 7:30, the Farmers' Museum, Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y.; Monday night at 7:30, Hyde Hall, Mill Road, Cooperstown; Wednesday night at 7:30 and Thursday morning at 11, Farmers' Museum, (877)666-7421; $15 to $25; half price for children 6 to 12. (Midgette)

MAVERICK CONCERTS (Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., now in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. On Sunday at 3 p.m. the pianist William Wolfram joins the Shanghai String Quartet in a program that includes the Franck Piano Quintet, ''Two Sketches on Indian Themes'' by Charles Tomlinson Griffes and Beethoven's String Quartet No. 16. Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217; $20; $5 for students. (Kozinn)

MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight through Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz, but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival features the St. Petersburg String Quartet in two programs this weekend: the first all Brahms, the second expanding to include Schubert and Natalia Medvedovskaya. Also on the weekend's program is a performance tonight of Bach cantatas by the Crescendo Chamber Choir. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126; $25; $12 for students. (Midgette)

NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Sure, the New York Philharmonic gets most of the attention, but Central Park has never been a one-orchestra green space. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, and the organization deserves credit not only for its perseverance but also for its adventuresome programming. On Tuesday, Charles Olivieri-Munroe will conduct music by Jacques Ibert, Philip Glass, Karel Husa and Dvorak, with the saxophonist John Edward Kelly joining as soloist. Not a chestnut in sight. 7:30 p.m., Bandshell, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (718)340-3018; free. (Eichler)

SUMMER STARS (Monday) This series of free concerts, part of the River to River Festival, mostly introduces young musicians at the start of their careers. This week's installment is a bit different: the main draw, the composer and violinist Daniel Bernard Roumain, is fairly well known, and although he will perform, his mission for the evening is to turn a spotlight on the young composers he is teaching as part of a workshop program sponsored by the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Last year's program included some startling pieces in a combination of jazz and contemporary classical styles, and there is every reason to assume that this year's will as well. 7:30 p.m. Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, near Park Row, Lower Manhattan; (212)346-1715. Free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)

TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Thursday) It's a busy week at Tanglewood, but isn't it always? Tonight, Ingo Metzmacher leads the Boston Symphony Orchestra in one of its most varied programs of the summer: Weber's ''Oberon'' Overture, songs from Mahler's ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' (with Matthias Goerne as the soloist), Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite and Elliott Carter's ''Adagio Tenebroso.'' The orchestra's offerings this weekend also include an all-Mozart program tomorrow, led by Sir Neville Marriner (with the soprano Veronique Gens and the pianist Jonathan Biss), and performances of Brahms choral works and the Beethoven Fifth Symphony, led by Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, on Sunday afternoon. Those performances are in the Koussevitzky Music Shed. Over in Seiji Ozawa Hall, you can hear the extraordinary new-music ensemble Eighth Blackbird on Sunday evening, the Boston Symphony Chamber Players on Tuesday, and a recital by the pianist Leon Fleischer on Thursday, with Schubert's big B flat Sonata (D. 960) as its centerpiece. All concerts are at 8:30 p.m., except the Boston Symphony's Sunday performance, at 2:30 p.m. Lenox, Mass.; (888)266-1200; $17 (lawn) to $85 for the concerts at the Music Shed; $16 (lawn) to $46 for Ozawa Hall. (Kozinn)

TANGLEWOOD FESTIVAL OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC (Tonight through Monday) This annual run of new-music programs, played by the students of the Tanglewood Music Center, touches on a wide range of styles, from the pop-inspired work of Steven Mackey and the poetic chamber music of John Harbison to the thornier vocal works of Milton Babbitt and Shulamit Ran. The student ensembles perform at Seiji Ozawa Hall today and tomorrow at 2:30 p.m., Sunday at 10 a.m., and Monday at 8:30 p.m. Lenox, Mass.; (888)266-1200; $11 to $46. (Kozinn)

'TRANSIENT GLORY' (Wednesday through Aug. 14) Writing music for children's chorus doesn't have the cachet of, say, writing for a symphony orchestra. But Francisco J. Nunez, founder of the Young People's Chorus of New York City, has set out to change that by commissioning major composers -- Ned Rorem, David Del Tredici, Judith Weir, Bright Sheng -- to write works for his ensemble. The project, started in 2001, has become an energetic endeavor, with the collaboration of a number of music publishers. This week the group is presenting a symposium with open master classes by day and concerts every evening at 7:30 from Wednesday through Aug. 13. Frederick Loewe Theater, New York University, 35 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village; (212)289-7779; $25 for all four concerts, beginning Wednesday. (Midgette)

*JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 28) A venturesomely inclined ballet troupe called Stockholm/59degrees North will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater tonight through Sunday.

SMUIN BALLET (Tuesday through Aug. 13) Michael Smuin pays a deft choreographic tribute to Frank Sinatra in ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' which shares the program with another flourish of footwork to fine old songs, ''Dancin' With Gershwin.''

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

*AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, are from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)

*GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

*GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. (See above.) (Smith)

GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,' through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)

*INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

*MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)

MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

*NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

* NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely base on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. (Johnson)

*STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENSLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)

Galleries: Uptown

'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of some 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of spired churches, sailboats and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)

IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multipart bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street (because of renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12. (Johnson)

'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person mini-shows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)

*'REPEAT PERFORMANCE' More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

*'BEBE LE STRANGE' This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)352-9460, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)

*'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' This big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter)

*WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Reid, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 3. (Johnson)

*'GREY FLAGS' Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)

DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)

*LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his own society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212)414-0370, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)

*BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)

'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, (212)375-0349, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)

'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, (212)627-8000, through Aug. 12. (Cotter)

'WORDPLAY' Twenty-three artists toy with words and letters. The show includes comical, professional-looking signs by Steve Powers; sign letters arranged to spell ''Me'' in a photograph by Jack Pierson; a neon sign that says ''Just Wait,'' by Bill Rowe; an alphabet of letters made of little water puddles photographed by Abelardo Morell; and layered, hand-painted letters spelling the hidden phrase ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'' by Joe Amrhein. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)

'EXILE IN NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL,' This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and an international introductory show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 17. (Cotter)

JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)

*MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, running through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

'CAPTURING A MOMENT-ITO' Highlights of this varied exhibition of works by nine Latino artists include Karina Aguilera Skvirsky's eerie video of vaguely menacing figures in Mideastern-style robes approaching in a peaceful park; portraits by Gabriel de la Mora in which the apparently finely drawn lines are actually made of hair from the people depicted; Gino Rubert's Surrealistic paintings of dreamy eroticencounters; and Alfonso Cantu's drawings of people viewed through marbled glass.

SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's.

Last Chance

AMBREEN BUTT: 'I NEED A HERO' With flair, wit and uncommon craftsmanship, Ms. Butt, a Muslim born in Pakistan but now living in the United States, revives the exquisitely detailed art of Persian and Indian miniature painting to explore modern issues like identity, clashes of cultural values, battles of the sexes and other knotty matters. The artist's stalwart protagonists take the form of a youngish woman and her clones, dressed in casual Western clothes, who often wield swords at old-fashioned allegorical symbols like demons, dragons and such. Her work is a pungent addition to that of the growing group of artists here who grapple with bicultural identities. Kustera Tilton Gallery, 520 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)989-0082, closing today. (Glueck)

'DEAD KIDS DO NOTHING' It's hard to say what this better-than-average group show adds up to, but it includes a sweetly quixotic video by Lee Walton in which he makes minor alterations to outdoor situations he encounters; another video, of a swimming mouse shot from under water by Adam Stennett, the show's organizer; lonesome modern interiors drawn in blue ink by Rebecca Chamberlain; and a dreamy, elegiac photograph of a dead pigeon shot with a pinhole camera by Jan Dunning. 31 Grand, 31 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-2858, closes Sunday. (Johnson)

'EARLY WORK' A retrospective look at some of the gallery's artists, including Isa Genzken, Chris Ofili, Neo Rausch, Jason Rhoades, Katy Schimert and Yutaka Sone. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2070, closing today. (Cotter)

'IDOLS OF PERVERSITY' Inspired by a 1980's book with the subtitle ''Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin de Siecle Culture,'' this show substitutes Surrealism for Symbolism for its prevailing mode, academic painting as its preferred style, and the contemporary art star John Currin as its patron saint. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-5959, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)

'LIVING FOR THE CITY' Organized by an institution in formation, the Brooklyn Institute of Contemporary Art, this group show has artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, some making New York debuts. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-1701, closing today. (Cotter)

CHRISTIAN SILVA: 'THE ENGLISH GARDEN' The best works by this Guadalajara-based artist are puzzling but have a visceral material presence. The trembling green rubber hands sticking out from a wall holding bunches of real parsley and coriander are especially weird. The life-size green man on the floor under a pile of vegetables is strange, too. But the big charcoal wall drawing of a drum kit is forgettable. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212)688-4673, closing today. (Johnson)

*'WALLS 'N' THINGS' This show about illusion and ambiguity includes a big, tough graffiti piece lifted from Barbie packaging; wall braces that support nothing; and a wall painting that isn't there until you suddenly see it, after which it is really, really there. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 213, Chelsea, (212)243-3335, closing today. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Lee Raymond, Exxon Mobil's Chief Since 1999 Merger, to Step Down at Year's End

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, announced yesterday that Lee R. Raymond, its chairman and chief executive, would retire at the end of the year, after 12 years during which he steered the company ahead of its rivals.
 He will be succeeded by Rex W. Tillerson, 53, Exxon Mobil's president and a longtime insider who recently emerged as the heir apparent to Mr. Raymond.
Mr. Raymond, who is 66, has spent the past 42 years at Exxon. Helped by record oil prices, he will leave the company in its best-ever financial and operating form. 
 ''Lee Raymond has been a very strong chairman in a line of very strong chairmen at Exxon,'' said James L. Smith, a business professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ''He brought the majors back into the realm of the world's greatest oil companies, with a global presence, financial reach and diversity of holdings.''
 The company was born in 1999 with the $81 billion merger of Exxon, the former Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), and Mobil, once the Standard Oil Company of New York, or Socony. Each day, it pumps 2.5 million barrels of oil -- more than Kuwait, an OPEC producer -- and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas. It is the world's top refiner and controls 22 billion barrels of oil reserves, the most among its publicly traded peers. 
 To his critics, Mr. Raymond is one of the last hard-liners on global climate change. He remains skeptical that human activity is responsible for the current warming trends, saying that the science is not conclusive. Other industrial giants, including BP, General Electric and Ford, have all come out with a more environment-friendly posture in recent years, said Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace USA.
 ''There is a spectrum of corporate behavior on global warming and Exxon is the epitome of denial and deception,'' Mr. Davies said. ''Raymond is unrepentant on global warming and has boxed himself so far in that corner that there's no going back for him.'' 
 Mr. Raymond is known for his direct, sometimes abrasive style and his limited tolerance for analysts, investors or journalists. In some ways, he is an old-fashioned oilman in an industry that has become more diverse, more international and more urbane.
 But the company's shareholders have had little to complain about, given the company's staggering profits, record dividends and stock performance. Last year, Exxon Mobil posted $25 billion in profits with sales of $291 billion -- a sum larger than the gross domestic product of countries like Austria or Saudi Arabia. This year, the company is on track for even better performance.
 Since the 1999 merger, Exxon Mobil has paid $33 billion in dividends to its shareholders and spent $24 billion buying back 8 percent of its shares.
 ''Raymond has created a company that delivers through the cycles, through the peaks, through the troughs,'' said Benjamin Dell, an oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, who rates Exxon Mobil outperform and owns no shares in the company. ''Betting against Exxon over the past 15 years has been a very bad bet.''
 Exxon Mobil -- like Chevron, ConocoPhillips and BP -- convinced government regulators that megamergers, set off by the oil price collapse of 1998, were vital to the industry's survival. Some called it the greatest holdup in the industry's history, in which the majors took advantage of depressed commodity prices to argue successfully for greater concentration.
 ''It was a little window of opportunity and they grabbed it,'' said Mr. Smith of Southern Methodist. 
 Mr. Raymond, who was born in Watertown, S.D., joined Exxon in 1963 with a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota. He became president in 1987 and chief executive and chairman in 1993. 
 At the board's request, he deferred his departure past 2003, the year he reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 65, and agreed to stay on to oversee the merged operations and pick a successor. 
 His successor, Mr. Tillerson, was born in Wichita Falls, Tex. He joined Exxon in 1975 as a production engineer after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in civil engineering. He rose through the company's ranks in the United States, Yemen and Russia, spending his entire career at Exxon's production units. He was named president in March 2004, an obvious steppingstone to succeeding Mr. Raymond.
 Mr. Dell, the oil analyst, expects few changes in strategy from the succession. ''Rex is stepping into Lee's shoes and there will be little change at the top,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Plays Down Bid's Failure

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
China's foreign ministry issued an unusually low-key reaction late Thursday afternoon to the collapse of Cnooc's bid for the oil company Unocal, merely noting that American and Chinese businesses benefit from economic cooperation.
 The brief statement represented a sharp shift from the foreign ministry's strong criticisms of Congress for raising objections to Cnooc's $18.5 billion offer. Analysts said that China had apparently decided not to let any lingering resentment over Cnooc's defeat disrupt the broader Chinese-American relationship. 
''Economic and trade cooperation between companies from China and the United States are to the benefit of both sides,'' the foreign ministry said. ''Cnooc's bid to merge with Unocal was a normal commercial activity between companies.''
 Cnooc, a state-controlled company, withdrew its bid on Tuesday, citing uncertainty about whether a deal could ever win approval in Washington. 
 President Hu Jintao is expected to visit Washington late next month. Chinese officials have been making elaborate preparations for the trip, while bilateral disputes continue to simmer over trade in textiles and the value of China's currency, the yuan.
 Ever since Cnooc made its offer on June 23, China had maintained that the proposal was exclusively a commercial transaction, and not a strategic move by China to gain control over foreign oil and gas fields. Bipartisan criticism of the deal in Congress drew several vitriolic responses from China in early July.
 ''We demand that the U.S. Congress correct its mistaken ways of politicizing trade and economic issues and stop interfering in the normal commercial exchanges between enterprises of the two countries,'' the foreign ministry said then.
 Li Kui-wai, director of the Asian studies center at the City University of Hong Kong, said the much more subdued reaction on Thursday reflected a pragmatic Chinese decision not to waste energy on a lost cause. ''If they have lost already, then why bother to fight?'' he said.
 Much of China's media has said little about the bid, with journalists saying that they had been ordered by the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party to rely on official reports.

HEADLINE: As More Schools Open Earlier, Parents Seek to Reclaim Summer 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
As far as its public schools are concerned, Early County in rural southwest Georgia is suitably named. School started two weeks ago, on July 22. In Chandler, Ariz., a booming suburb of Phoenix, schools opened that same week. In Florida, the last county to open schools is Putnam, east of Gainesville, where classes start Aug. 16.
 ''It's crazy,'' said Vivian Jackson, a mother of two school-age children in Marietta, Ga., where schools open in mid-August. ''There's no reason for it. I spent yesterday in the allergist's office to get a note from the doctor because my child cannot ride in a school bus when the temperature is 90 degrees, and there's not a day in August here when the temperature does not reach 90 degrees.
''We don't want to start school in August and get out in May,'' she added. ''We want our summers back.'' 
 Along with thousands of other parents, Ms. Jackson is not just complaining. Through grass-root groups like Save Georgia Summers, which she helped to organize, Save Our Summers in North Carolina and Texans for a Traditional School Year, parents are barging into state legislatures, demanding change. In some cases, they are prevailing. Last year in North Carolina, a petition and e-mail drive led to a new law that says public schools cannot start their year before Aug. 25. Wisconsin recently set its start date as any time after Sept. 1. Beginning next year in Minnesota, public schools cannot open before Labor Day.
 A bill this year in the Georgia legislature that would have pushed the start date to late August failed, but supporters vowed to fight on.
 ''Our voices are growing louder and louder, and we're going back to the legislature next year and make this an election issue,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''We've made it clear we'll endorse anyone who supports our position.''
 A major impetus for an early start to the school year is standardized testing. In many states, district officials contend that shifting starting dates to July or August allows for semester exams before the Christmas break and for added instruction ahead of statewide tests that are used to measure progress for the federal No Child Left Behind program. 
 Some have added a few days of instruction, but most have shifted the academic year, traditionally from September to June, to July or August to May. Other districts have stretched the calendar to adopt what is known in some places as a year-round school year, rotating periods of instruction in 9-to-12-week blocks with vacation breaks of 3 to 4 weeks.
 ''Districts are feeling such pressure,'' said Barbara Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National School Boards Association. ''As stakes for accountability rise, schools need flexibility to get the most out of the academic year. The calendar is one more variable to work with.''
 Surveys by Market Data Retrieval, an education research company, found that the number of public schools starting the academic year before Sept. 1 in 2004-5 rose 11 percent, to more than 63,000, over those starting before Sept. 1 a decade ago. 
 In most states, individual districts determine their school calendars. The exceptions are Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin, where school opens on the same day statewide and, in each case, no earlier than the third week of August.
 In the South, which has traditionally trailed other regions in academic achievement, changes are occurring more rapidly. In the process, they are trying the patience of parents who argue that the shifts disrupt family schedules that include summer camps, sports activities and long-planned vacations.
 The parents also contend that operating schools in the hottest weeks of summer forces districts to spend money on air conditioning that could otherwise be spent on teachers. In some states, the tourism industry supports the parents, asserting that shorter summer vacations deprive the state of millions of dollars in tourism tax revenues that, in turn, help to finance public schools.
 As in other states, the effort to fight back in Georgia began with just a few parents and grew rapidly, as an increasing number of school districts pushed their starting date earlier. This year, 23 of the state's 184 districts began classes last month.
 Ms. Jackson said that her group, which now includes up to 7,000 parents, campaigned to prevent more districts from moving to a July start. But they got only so far as a hearing before an education subcommittee in the state legislature.
 There, they encountered the kind of intense and often emotional debate that surrounds the issue of starting dates elsewhere, with the parents and tourism officials offset by teachers and school officials fighting for local control and more time for instruction before tests.
 Tommy Benton, a Republican member of the Georgia House who is a retired history teacher, said he voted against later start dates to preserve local control and to relieve teachers of the growing pressure to show improvement in their classes.
 ''It's one of the few professions where you're held accountable,'' he said. ''Our results are put in the newspaper.'' 
 In some places, the debate also includes arguments on whether shorter or longer breaks help students. Proponents of extended calendars, like the National Association for Year-Round Education, say that children retain more knowledge with shorter breaks and benefit from taking exams before their Christmas recess, rather than after it.
 ''Summer learning loss has been established in research literature, and teachers have known it for years,'' said Charles Ballenger, the association's executive director emeritus, though he cited no specific report. ''So if you cut down on summer breaks, chances are, you cut down on learning loss.''
 Harris Cooper, a psychology professor at Duke University who is director of its education program, said that a modified calendar could be more helpful to children from families of lower socio-economic status.
 But he doubted that modified calendars produce any overall academic benefits, a view shared by Gene V. Glass, a professor of education policy at Arizona State University, who said that at least a half-dozen studies suggest that ''there is not a scrap of evidence that shows a year-round calendar improves achievement.''
 The largest teachers' union, the National Education Association, said it had not taken a position on the issue.
 Among parent groups pushing for later start dates, none has been more effective than Texans for a Traditional School Year, which began in 2000 and later spawned the Coalition for Traditional School Calendars, a national advisory group.
 Tina Bruno, a mother of three school-age children who founded both groups, said that parents across Texas who were alarmed over a steady drift of start dates into early August initiated a writing campaign that led lawmakers to set a statewide starting date for late August.
 The campaign's success led to the formation of similar groups throughout the South, including one now organizing in Florida, where 20 of the state's 67 county school districts opened for classes this week and another 35 are set to open next week.
 Sherry Sturner, a nonpracticing lawyer and mother of two who is leading the Florida effort, said she grew concerned at the rapid pace of change. From just the 2000-1 academic year, 54 county districts are opening on an earlier day this year.
 ''Our goal is to start petitions, write letters and contact our representatives,'' she said, attributing the shift to the districts' need to raise scores on statewide standardized tests. ''We're prepared to do whatever it takes for a change statewide.
 ''Nobody I know wants school to start this early,'' she said. ''Everybody here is miserable.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front page article last Saturday about resistance to the early start of the school year in some areas referred imprecisely to the policies of eight states that regulate starting dates. Seven states -- Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin -- set a date for the earliest permissible start, but let districts select a specific day. And four of those states -- Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- grant waivers for earlier starts. Missouri, which used to set a statewide starting date, returned the decision to districts last year.

HEADLINE: China Accuses a Detained Correspondent of Spying for Taiwan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
China said Friday that it had formally arrested a Hong Kong-based newspaper correspondent and accused him of spying for Taiwan, the latest in a series of signs that China is tightening controls on news organizations.
 The correspondent, Ching Cheong, was detained on April 22 in southern China and has been held incommunicado since. Mr. Ching is the chief China correspondent of The Straits Times in Singapore. 
The arrest comes as the Chinese government released a long list of new regulations limiting foreign investment in the media -- in everything from book publishing to movie production.
 The restrictions also coincide with a surge of local protests in many villages and cities across China for a wide range of reasons, including commercial disputes and environmental damage. There has been no sign, however, that the protests are centrally organized or pose any immediate threat to China's political system.
 ''The government is increasingly worried about social instability and disruption of growth,'' said Tom Doctoroff, the chief executive for greater China at the JWT Advertising Agency. ''The government is clearly getting very concerned about the flow of information.''
 The official New China News Agency reported Friday that Mr. Ching had been accused of taking millions of Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of American dollars, in exchange for gathering economic, political and especially military information for Taiwan since 2000. Mr. Ching was accused of passing on classified documents labeled ''top secret'' or ''confidential'' to Taiwan's National Security Bureau and of disguising his work by using an alias, Chen Yuanchun, assigned by the bureau.
 Born in Shantou, China, and reared in Hong Kong, Mr. Ching holds a British National Overseas passport, which was issued to nearly half of Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents before Britain returned the territory to China in 1997.
 The passport does not entitle holders to move to Britain but does allow them representation by consular officials; a British Consulate spokeswoman here said late Friday that the Chinese authorities had denied access to Mr. Ching.
 Irene Ngoo, a spokeswoman for Singapore Press Holdings, which publishes The Straits Times, said that the company had been unable to contact Mr. Ching since his detention, and that company-appointed lawyers had not been allowed to contact him.
 ''We have absolutely no inkling or suggestion at all that Ching Cheong could be involved in something of this nature,'' she said. ''He has been an outstanding journalist.''
 In Taiwan, the National Security Bureau declined to comment, following a policy of not doing so in espionage cases.
 Zhao Yan, a researcher in Beijing for The New York Times, was detained last September on suspicion of leaking state secrets abroad. Prosecutors in Beijing are still deciding whether to bring formal charges against him.

HEADLINE: EMPLOYERS IN U.S. ADD 207,000 JOBS TO JULY PAYROLLS

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
American employers added more than 200,000 jobs last month, the government reported on Friday, providing fresh evidence that workers are beginning to benefit from an economy that is growing at a steady, robust pace.
 With the exception of manufacturing, the labor market was strong across the board, offering further confirmation of the economic expansion evident in recent data on consumer spending, industrial production and home sales.
 Unemployment, which is measured in a separate survey, stayed steady at a relatively low 5 percent, reflecting a growing number of people being drawn back into the labor market by the increased hiring activity. 
 ''There's a refreshing degree of consistency,'' said Brian Fabbri, chief economist at BNP Paribas. ''The number of new jobs is consistent with the rest of the economic data that shows that the economy is moving along quite strongly.'' 
 Both growing consumer spending and expanding business investment appear to be feeding a brisk expansion despite rising interest rates and the surge in oil prices that pushed the average price of gasoline to nearly $2.40 a gallon this summer. 
 Indeed, most recent statistics point to an accelerating economy after a modest dip in output growth to 3.4 percent in the second quarter, from 3.8 percent in the first three months of the year.
 Goods on store shelves and backlogs of cars on dealer lots, along with other inventories, dropped sharply in the second quarter, suggesting that orders will pick up in the months ahead as companies restock. Factory orders and industrial production posted substantial gains in May and June. Personal income and consumer spending growth picked up in June after slowing in May. 
 ''There's a wide variety of economic barometers that tell us that we've passed the soft patch,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG-Hoenig. 
 The vigorous economic tableau means it is virtually certain that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term interest rates by a quarter of a point next week, the pace it has maintained at every monetary policy meeting since June of last year.
 The signs of robust employment gains caused stocks to sag and long-term interest rates to rise as many investors saw the balance of economic risks tilting from low growth toward higher inflation, making it more likely that the Fed will continue to raise short-term borrowing costs through the end of the year and perhaps beyond. 
 The 207,000 jobs added in July indicated the fastest hiring pace since April. Coming on top of revisions to previous estimates of employment gains in May and June that added another 42,000 jobs, average job growth this year was bumped up to 191,000 a month, sufficient to absorb the expansion of the labor force and reduce the slack in the job market.
 Job growth ranged widely in July. The retail sector added 50,000 positions in July. Hotels and restaurants added 30,000 jobs. Employment in health care rose by 29,000. In an unexpected sign of increased job market stability, employment in temporary help agencies declined, indicating that employers might be relying less on temporary employees and hiring more workers full time.
 Manufacturing employment provided a soft spot -- shedding 4,000 jobs. But David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that excluding the auto sector, which has been focusing on getting rid of the excess inventory parked on dealership lots, factory employment rose by nearly 7,000 last month.
 Average hourly wages of production and nonmanagement workers rose nearly 0.4 percent, the fastest rate since July of last year. And the index of the aggregate amount of hours worked in the economy increased by about 2 percent. 
 In a particularly encouraging sign, the share of the total population that is working inched up 0.1 percent, to 62.8 percent, the highest percentage since October 2002. Gains filtered through to groups that have had a more difficult time in the labor market over the last few years. Unemployment among blacks declined 0.8 percent, to 9.5 percent, and the Hispanic unemployment rate dipped to 5.5 percent, from 5.8 percent in June. 
 Employment gains are important to keep economic growth afloat, providing wage income to fuel consumer spending. ''Personal incomes should show strong gains,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''More people are working, they are making more on average and they are working more hours.''
 But the current job growth is particularly significant because it shows employment starting to mesh well with an improving macroeconomic situation, after three years in which it set a somewhat discordant note.
 The economy added 2.2 million jobs last year, and another 1.3 million so far this year. But over the last four years, since the economy emerged from recession, employment growth has remained subpar -- below that of previous recoveries. 
 Moreover, job growth has been unstable, proceeding from month to month in fits and starts. The wage growth of typical workers has barely kept up with the pace of inflation.
 The July employment report does not signal that hiring from now on will accelerate markedly. But it indicates that the labor market has finally attained a pattern of stable growth, adding about 175,0000 to 200,000 new jobs each month, which is sufficient to sustain substantial economic growth. 
 ''The labor market entered a new phase that is consistent with a mature stable expansion,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, United States economist at Citibank.
 Emerging from recession in 2002, and through 2003, businesses refused to spend money on new workers. Indebted, overinvested and uncertain about the sustainability of demand, they responded to any sales growth by squeezing more out of their existing work forces. Productivity soared. 
 This seems to have changed. Though many economists doubt the labor market will re-attain its peaks of the late 1990's, when employers aggressively increased staff, reducing the unemployment rate to less than 4 percent, employers are hiring consistently again. 
 Jeffrey A. Joerres, chief executive of recruitment firm Manpower, said increased global competition and diminished pricing power were imposing a new discipline on employers, who only hire when they must. Mr. Joerres called it surgical hiring. 
 That might make it more difficult for workers to achieve improvements in wages living standards. But, Mr. Joerres said, it will also help companies avoid excesses.
 ''We crawled kicking and screaming out of the bottom,'' he said. ''Now we're on a very good footing. We haven't overeaten.''

HEADLINE: A Six-Day Bash Celebrates Black Theater 

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Aug. 3 

 BODY:
An estimated 60,000 people, nearly all of them black, descended on Winston-Salem this week for the six-day National Black Theater Festival. The event, held every two years here since 1989, is a showcase for black theaters, a networking opportunity for black performers and playwrights and an extended-family reunion of sorts for the fans and celebrities who return time after time from New York, Los Angeles, Newark and Dayton, Ohio. 
 As the festival, which has a budget of $1.5 million, has grown in this city of nearly 200,000, so has its audience, and organizers estimated that $15 million would be pumped into the local economy. Visitors and local residents could choose from 40 productions, ranging from musicals like ''The Jackie Wilson Story (My Heart Is Crying, Crying ),'' about the Detroit rhythm-and-blues singer; to an after-hours show, ''Herotica,'' performed by 3 Blacque Chix, a trio of middle-aged women who talk about sex; to the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ''Topdog/Underdog'' by Suzan-Lori Parks; to a variety of solo shows.
 For a few days, downtown Winston-Salem is transformed, its streets echoing from drum circles and choked with limousines. There are African art vendors and midnight poetry jams, open-mike talent shows and nightly celebrity receptions at which the dance floors are packed until nearly dawn. 
 ''It's incredible; everybody's energy is so high,'' said Daniel Beaty, 29, a New Yorker whose one-man show, ''Emergence-See!,'' imagines the sudden surfacing of a slave ship in the harbor of modern-day New York. ''We long for moments to celebrate ourselves, to have experiences that are completely positive,'' he added ''We have a history of collective consciousness and a collective spirit.''
 On Mr. Beaty's opening night, he got a whooping standing ovation from an audience that included the poet Sonia Sanchez, the playwright Lynn Nottage, the actors James Avery and Ruben Santiago-Hudson and the actresses C.C.H. Pounder and Tonya Pinkins, who whispered something in his ear about mentioning him to her agent. Also present was his mentor and producer, the venerable Ruby Dee, who had first seen his show at a tiny alternative space near Times Square. These notables and others -- Malik Yoba of ''New York Undercover,'' Antonio Fargas of ''Starsky and Hutch,'' the actress Janet Hubert -- mingled easily, without bodyguards or V.I.P. sections, giving the festival the feeling of a private celebration despite the number in attendance. 
 ''I would not want to see it in a larger metropolis,'' said Sandy Lindsay, a school nurse from New Jersey who drives down with her girlfriends every two years. ''It would lose its intimacy.'' That afternoon, Ms. Lindsay and her 15-year-old granddaughter had seen a play starring Kim Fields, still best known as Tootie on ''The Facts of Life,'' who at one point invoked the name of a famous blues singer: ''Linda Hopkins, can I sing?'' Ms. Fields ad-libbed.
 ''Yes you can, baby,'' answered a sonorous voice from the audience. 
 Much of the festival's tone is a reflection of its founder, Larry Leon Hamlin, who always wears large, flashy sunglasses (to protect others, he says, from his penetrating stare) and who was driving a new Hummer on loan for the week. Mr. Hamlin is the artistic director of the North Carolina Black Repertory Company in Winston-Salem. He started the festival to connect black theaters around the country, enlisting Maya Angelou, Sidney Poitier and Oprah Winfrey in the early years to draw attention to the project. 
 The success of the first festival, Mr. Hamlin said -- it drew 10,000 people -- helped dispel a misconception that black theaters were not professional enough to warrant grant money. ''It shook loose some dollars,'' he added. Among the groups participating this year were the National Black Theater in Harlem, the Black Ensemble Theater in Chicago, the Walltown Children's Theater in Durham, N.C., the Black Academy of Arts and Letters in Dallas and assorted independent productions.
 Mr. Hamlin, a North Carolina native who studied theater at Brown University, seems to do nothing in moderation. Opening-night festivities on Monday began outside the convention center with a purple carpet (Mr. Hamlin's favorite color) and a sold-out, $250-a-plate dinner, an awards ceremony, the first act of ''The Jackie Wilson Story'' and a dance party. The attire -- floor-length gowns and embroidered dashikis, bow ties and spindly heels -- was worthy of Oscar night. 
 The goings-on attract locals, too, who head downtown after work or school. Perhaps understandably, given the spectacle on the street, several Winston-Salemites said they did not plan to see any theater. But Ellen Carter, 56, a customer service worker at a nearby insurance company, said she was ''a connoisseur of the arts.'' In 2003 she saw ''The Jackie Wilson Story'' three times. ''Went broke,'' she said. ''Didn't pay a bill so I could go see it again.'' 
 Ms. Carter said two of her three grown children and several grandchildren were also festival fans, and such multigenerational attendance was not uncommon. Cynthia Mosely, 40, a mortgage closer from Florida, said her mother-in-law, a regular attendee, persuaded her to come this time with her 13-year-old daughter, Tyiesha, an aspiring actress who had already had her photo taken with Ms. Dee and spoken with T'Keyah Crystal Keymah, whom she recognized from television and the movies. 
 ''We'll come every year,'' Ms. Mosely said, as she and Tyiesha pored over the schedule. ''I want her to see how it really works. And it's inspiring to me.''
 For performers, the festival is a chance for exposure to artistic directors and producers from around the country. The 3 Blacque Chix, for example, hope to market their show to a wider audience. It currently plays once a month in Los Angeles. ''We want to go on tour,'' said Mariann Aalda, 57, a television actress and one of the Chix. ''We want to go to Vegas. We'd like to see a series come out of this.'' Her cast mate, Iona Morris, 48, chimed in, ''Residuals, royalties, retirement.'' At their rehearsal on Tuesday afternoon, they said they had received inquiries from Miami and New York producers attending the festival.
 What precisely makes theater ''black theater'' is hard to say. But two threads wove their way through the festival schedule. One was the celebration of black performing artists -- in addition to the musical about Mr. Wilson, there were plays devoted to Mahalia Jackson, Thelonious Monk, Dorothy Dandridge and Melba Moore (a cabaret-style show, performed by Ms. Moore herself). 
 The second was the pronounced rhythm of hip-hop and spoken word. Six years ago, the festival presented hip-hop theater as a distinct category. But now, its inflections are dispersed, from the show by Mr. Beaty, a onetime poetry slam champion, to ''By a Black Hand,'' a musical about cultural and scientific achievements by blacks.
 ''There has always been a connection between black theater and poets,'' said Weusi Baraka, 34 (no relation to Amiri Baraka), who helped organize the festival's midnight poetry jams. ''It was poets like Ntozake Shange or Amiri Baraka who paved the way and defined black theater at certain points in history.''
 The poetry jams are part of Mr. Hamlin's effort to bring in younger audiences -- a challenge he shares with American theaters of every stripe, but one that he appeared to be mastering, judging from the number of prom-age theatergoers in the houses.
 On Wednesday, though, the jam seemed to attract as many older patrons as younger. They filled an auditorium in the convention center and included Irma P. Hall, 70, who played Big Mama in George Tillman Jr.'s 1997 movie ''Soul Food'' and who sat in the front row waiting for a turn to go on. 
 Yolanda Wilkerson, a poet from the slam circuit in New York, delivered a poem called ''Untitled and Unfinished,'' in which she suggested alternatives to the term ''African-American,'' including ''UPN- and WB-American'' and ''They'll-never-test-diseases-on-me-American.''
 But before she began, she looked around the room and gave a big smile at the nearly all-black audience. ''I haven't been here in four years,'' she said, ''and I don't get to see black people that often.''

HEADLINE: Happy to Be Working and Ready to Spend Some Money

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
WHETHER they were withdrawing from one doomed corporate takeover or apologizing (with cash) for another, multinational companies spent the week closing the books on several ill-fated and ill-advised business decisions. 
 The economy, meanwhile, gained strength, undeterred by stubbornly high energy prices that jumped again -- as oil spiked above $62 a barrel in New York -- after a death in the Saudi Arabian royal family.

 SUNNY DAYS -- Good news popped up in almost every part of the economy, topped off by yesterday's robust labor report. 
 Employers hired 207,000 workers in July, more than expected, and the fastest pace since April. Unemployment remained at 5 percent.
 Consumer spending continued its brisk growth in July, rising 0.8 percent, while incomes showed a relatively vigorous gain of 0.5 percent. Factory orders rose 1 percent in June, building on a 3.6 percent jump in May; declining inventories suggest further gains are coming. 
 At the same time, companies reported generally strong profits. Based on companies that have reported so far, aggregate earnings grew well over 10 percent in the second quarter, which would be the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
 The major stock market gauges rose to their highest levels in four years, before falling by the week's ends on fears of more interest rate increases. 
 A growing economy and high oil prices have increased economists' concerns about inflation. To address that worry, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to raise interest rates another quarter-percentage-point when they meet again on Tuesday.

GIVING UP, FOR NOW -- China backed away from a political confrontation with the United States when one of its government-controlled oil concerns, the Chinese National Overseas Oil Company, withdrew its $18.4 billion bid for Unocal. The decision opens the door for Chevron to buy Unocal for about $17.7 billion in cash and stock.
 The Chinese company, known by its acronym Cnooc, touched off a debate within the United States government about whether China's economic rise and its growing thirst for oil and other resources posed a strategic threat -- and if so, what to do about it. 
 Cnooc's withdrawal has undercut the urgency of that debate, but analysts said similar conflicts were almost inevitable as China's economy and political ambitions grow.
 China may try to retaliate against Chevron for having stoked American political opposition to Cnooc's bid, analysts said. Chevron works with Cnooc on oil projects near China and Australia.

A DUBIOUS RECORD -- Enron may have failed in its ambition to set a standard for profitability or growth, but it has certainly helped to raise the bar for class-action lawsuit settlements.
 Banks and other corporate enablers have agreed to pay $7.1 billion to settle lawsuits by investors who were picked clean by Enron's accounting schemes. The latest to pony up was the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which offered $2.4 billion -- more than its profit for all of last year -- to atone for repeatedly helping Enron to conceal its debt and inflate its revenue.
 The total Enron settlements, which include $2.2 billion from J.P. Morgan Chase and $2 billion from Citigroup, surpasses the $6.2 billion that banks -- including some of those involved with Enron -- paid to settle investor lawsuits over the collapse of WorldCom in another accounting scandal. Several other banks, including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston and Barclays, as well as Merrill Lynch, are still party to the class action.
 Even if those companies settle, the 55,000 investors who are part of the lawsuit are likely to recover only a fraction of the $47 billion they lost in Enron's collapse. The lawyers representing investors, however, are in line to get $680 million, plus 10 percent of any further settlements.

TIME TO SETTLE -- Speaking of settlements, Time Warner agreed to pay $2.4 billion to settle lawsuits filed by shareholders who asserted that the 2001 merger of Time Warner and America Online was based on erroneous and misleading financial statements. It also set aside another $600 million to settle other claims, including those of Time Warner employees.
 While it agreed to the settlements, Time Warner admitted no wrongdoing. Nor did it do so when it agreed earlier to pay $450 million to settle similar claims with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Time Warner's auditor, Ernst & Young, agreed to contribute $100 million to that settlement.
 Time Warner said it agreed to the settlements to permit it to move ahead with its strategy for the underperforming AOL part of its business. It has equivocated about whether it may sell or spin off the unit.

A ROYAL PASSING -- The death of King Fahd bin Abdel Aziz al-Saud of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing nation, caused oil prices to rise above $62 a barrel in New York, a nominal record. News of an orderly transition of power to his half-brother, however, did not bring prices down much.
 Crude oil remained above $62, largely because of unrelated developments. In Texas and Louisiana, for example, accidents closed big refineries owned by Exxon Mobil, BP and Valero, renewing worries that tight supplies of gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil might not keep pace with demand. Iran's decision to reopen a uranium-enrichment program rekindled fears that the country, OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, may clash with the West over the potential spread of nuclear arms.
 The new monarch, King Abdullah, has been Saudi Arabia's effective ruler since King Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke in 1995. The kingdom's role as the world's swing producer -- one with enough idle capacity to cover shortfalls in supplies -- is not expected to change.

HEADLINE: Congregants Wanted, and the Incentives Abound

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: MALDEN, Mass., Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The advertisement laid out a number of reasons why Orthodox Jews should move here and join Congregation Beth Israel: daily services, plenty of parks for children to play in, and a subway ride of only 15 minutes to Boston, five miles south.
 But it was the synagogue's offer to help pay for a home that prompted Jonathan Myron, a software engineer in Woodland Hills, Calif., who spotted the advertisement on a Jewish Web site, to call the synagogue and make inquiries about moving across the country.
 Trying to rebuild a once-thriving Orthodox community, Beth Israel is offering low-interest loans to people who buy a home in Malden and agree to become active members of the congregation. The loans are meant to help with down payments, at no interest the first year and 1 percent to 2 percent after that. 
 While no one has yet taken out a loan, the 150-member congregation has brought in three new families with its year-old advertising campaign, which also offers other incentives including tuition assistance for Jewish day schools, free transportation there and a wide array of programs and classes.
 ''Anyone who moves here is helping build a community,'' said Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Rabinowitz, who has led the congregation for eight years. ''We're trying to build a vibrant, young community that follows the Orthodox tradition.''
 Religious bodies' use of incentives and advertising to draw people to a particular congregation or geographical area is hardly unheard of. The Archdiocese of St. Louis, for example, previously offered Roman Catholics outside the city $5,000 to put toward buying a house if they settled in one of three racially diverse neighborhoods within St. Louis. And Jonathan D. Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, said synagogues in communities including Sharon, Mass., began advertising to Jewish families years ago.
 ''But the Malden offer seems to be better funded and broader than others I have heard about,'' Professor Sarna said.
 The offer was made possible because over the years the congregation's members donated generously to it. The board of directors invested the money well, said Andrew Shulman, the synagogue's program director, and Beth Israel now has a large endowment.
 Low-interest home loans in particular are attractive to Orthodox families. Driving is forbidden on the Sabbath, and so congregants generally try to live within a mile of their synagogue, a circumstance that drives up demand for housing and its price.
 Many Orthodox families in the Boston area live in the Brighton neighborhood or the adjacent suburb of Brookline, where kosher restaurants and Judaica stores abound. But the housing market is tight around the synagogues there, causing many families to rent tiny walk-up apartments for thousands of dollars a month. So Rabbi Rabinowitz has home prices on his side: the average price of a single-family home in Malden for the first half of this year was $350,000, compared with $1,040,000 in Brookline and $480,150 in Brighton.
 The one thing Malden lacks, though, is availability of services. Kosher groceries, for instance, are hard to come by.
 ''We know we're more affordable, and that's the hook,'' Rabbi Rabinowitz said. ''But you can't draw people into something that's not there, and that's why we've established so many things as a synagogue.''
 Additional plans for the massive synagogue, which once housed an indoor swimming pool, include an expanded children's room; a ceremonial bath, or mikvah, where the pool's showers now stand; a gym with separate hours for men and women; and additional use of the industrial kosher kitchen, which the synagogue rents to kosher caterers. There is even a room where prospective congregants from out of town can stay overnight.
 Beth Israel has also built an eruv, a bounded area that expands the domain of the home, allowing certain otherwise forbidden ''work,'' like pushing baby carriages, on the Sabbath. Beth Israel's eruv is a mile square, its borders marked by rope tied to utility poles.
 Such efforts, and the congregation's warm reception, led Ellen Zagorsky-Goldberg and her husband, Sam Goldberg, to trade the cramped two-bedroom Brookline apartment where they were raising three daughters for a four-bedroom colonial-style house with a yard.
 ''It's really great to be in a place where every person makes a difference,'' said Ms. Zagorsky-Goldberg, adding, ''It's a small community, but it's a really quality group of people.''
 Beth Israel is the center of what was once a more active Orthodox religious life in this city of 56,000, where kosher butcher stores lined what is now Route 60 and children stopped by the local bakery for onion rolls after Hebrew school.
 The synagogue's membership peaked in the 1960's, when about 300 members attended weekly services. 
 But the congregation's children grew up, left for college and never came back to Malden, which gradually became grittier as the promise of urban renewal faded.
 Now the synagogue is advertising its incentives on the Internet and in national Jewish publications. Mr. Shulman, the program director, said dozens of families from around the country had inquired.
 Mr. Myron, the 28-year-old software engineer whose interest was drawn by the synagogue's offer to help pay for a home, and his wife, Andi, 33, thought for a time about leaving Southern California. Andi, who grew up in Chicago, missed the seasons. The couple visited Beth Israel last fall and liked everything about it, but, with Mr. Myron's computer programming business doing well, decided against moving now. They will re-evaluate matters in the next year, he said.
 The congregation's leaders acknowledge that change will not happen overnight, and say the program is focusing on building for the long term.
 ''It will take time,'' Rabbi Rabinowitz said. ''But you'll be part of a growing community. You'll be part of something beautiful.''

HEADLINE: Keeping A Tight Lid On Inflation

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
INFLATION is dormant, and there are sound reasons to expect it to stay that way. Consumer prices are rising at barely 2 percent a year, even though economic growth is brisk and prices for oil and other commodities have soared.
 Despite this benign backdrop, Federal Reserve officials have been making comments widely interpreted as hawkish, suggesting that interest rate increases are in store beyond the one or two that had been foreseen. But that would tighten the lid on inflation even more. 
Events overseas are helping, too. Chinese manufacturers are undercutting everyone else and workers in places like India are having the same effect on the labor market. 
 Certain investments do better than others when inflation is well behaved, and they are not always those that common sense would suggest. Jonathan N. Golub, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, advises owning growth stocks in economically sensitive industries in such a climate, as well as sectors that perform well when speculation is high. ''You want to become less risk-averse,'' he said. ''You want to own small-cap growth stocks and emerging markets. You want to buy a bigger house.''
 Mr. Golub said that a company can increase profits by making more money for every unit it sells or by selling more units -- and when businesses cannot push up prices, Method No.1 is dead on arrival. 
 When looking for companies that can increase sales, he starts with technology, he said, because those industries' perpetual innovation keeps demand thriving while other industries struggle to find new wrinkles for old products. ''I may go out and buy a new iPod,'' he said, ''but I'm not going to pop more aspirin.''
 Marc Baylin, manager of the J.P. Morgan Large Cap Growth Select fund, named four stocks that he said were experiencing significant volume growth and would benefit from low inflation: Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings, the parent of the large derivatives marketplace; Education Management, a provider of postsecondary courses; Cognizant Technology Solutions, whose specialty is customized information systems; and Expeditors International, which supplies logistics systems that help companies manage inventories.
 George Greig, a portfolio manager at William Blair & Company, said he was seeking businesses ''that benefit from low inflation because they can cut costs, or companies that can still benefit from higher prices, mainly the commodity complex.''
 Mr. Greig likes BHP Billiton, an Australian company that is the world's largest mining concern, and Ferrovial, a Spanish company that builds housing and infrastructure like roads. Both companies should benefit from the building boom in China, and they conform to his advice to ''buy what China is buying and sell what China is selling.''
 Among the cost cutters, he prefers two companies that produce electronic equipment, Sharp of Japan and Hon Hai in Taiwan. Mr. Greig said their sophisticated products are ''a little higher on the food chain,'' and have few rivals in China. Both sell their products there, so they qualify as good low-inflation stocks on both of his grounds.
 QUIESCENT inflation helps draw out the economic cycle, perpetuating growth and making life easier for businesses, consumers and policy makers. ''If you can have the golden goose without inflation coming along and crimping it, that's a pretty amazing situation,'' said Doug Sheres, a portfolio manager at Rice Hall James & Associates. He said he would take advantage of it by owning stocks in the basic materials, technology and consumer discretionary sectors. This last group encompasses cars and other items that consumers can put off purchasing until an opportune moment.
 Mr. Sheres warned, however, that the cycle was in danger of ending. Capital spending is rising, he said, and wages are likely to follow -- globalization or not -- with prices climbing at some point. ''We're looking at finally getting higher inflation and interest rates,'' he said.
 Mr. Golub does not expect appreciably higher inflation, but interest rates concern him. ''As Alan Greenspan moves rates to 4 percent, there is a meaningful chance that there will be a greater penalty on speculative assets,'' he warned. So he would rather ease off on the riskiest growth stocks -- and the bigger house -- and put money into value stocks.
 What's more, Mr. Golub said, further tightening could produce a flat or negative yield curve. That occurs when short-term rates are equal to or greater than long-term rates -- conditions that often herald a recession. Few stocks would perform well then. But drug makers might be an exception if enough investors started popping more aspirin.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Says Banks Are Resisting Inquiry on Lending Practices

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Officials from the New York state attorney general's office said yesterday that a lack of cooperation from several large banks and their regulator had significantly hampered an inquiry into whether discrimination was responsible for the higher mortgage interest rates minority borrowers often paid.
 The criticisms came as a months-long legal battle continued between the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and the banks and their federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, over who has authority to oversee lending practices. A group of eight national banks and the comptroller have filed separate lawsuits contending that federally regulated banks cannot be compelled to honor a state attorney general's request because it does not have primary oversight. 
In briefs filed yesterday, the attorney general's office argued that issues of discrimination were so important that there was also room for enforcement by state and local regulators. It also provided letters from 32 state attorneys general and several consumer advocacy groups.
 ''We aren't trying to push them out; they are trying to push us out,'' said Thomas Conway, the attorney general's consumer fraud chief. ''The more people ensuring there is not discrimination in consumer lending is what we want, not fewer.''
 In April, Mr. Spitzer sent letters requesting credit scores data and other nonpublic lending information from several large banks, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC and Wells Fargo.
 The attorney general's office later indicated it might issue subpoenas if the information, which is being sought to determine whether minority borrowers with similar credit histories pay higher interest rates, was not voluntarily provided.
 While some banks initially turned over some materials, Dennis Parker, the chief of the attorney general's civil rights bureau, said yesterday that the banks had been stonewalling since mid-June, when they sought relief from their federal regulator and the federal courts.
 ''We have not gotten complete data from anyone,'' Mr. Parker said. 
 In the two complaints, the Clearing House Association, which is a group of eight national banks, and the comptroller have asked Judge Sidney H. Stein of the Federal District Court in Manhattan to issue an order barring the state attorney general from further examining the banks. The judge denied the temporary injunction, but is expected to hear a case on the larger arguments later this month.
 Kevin Mukri, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, declined to comment on the filings because the agency had not yet reviewed them, but said the office would have a legal response in the next few weeks. 
 A spokesman for the Clearing House, Greg Berardi, said the banks shared Mr. Spitzer's view on the importance of complying with fair lending laws, but ''we strongly believe that exclusive enforcement by the O.C.C. remains the most effective way to prevent abusive lending practices at national banks and their subsidiaries.''
 ''Enforcement by multiple state and local jurisdictions,'' Mr. Berardi said, ''will increase the complexity of mortgage lending and increase borrowing costs for consumers.''
 J.P. Morgan Chase said it did not comment on its activities with regulators. HSBC and Citigroup declined to comment.

Berkshire Hathaway Earned $1.45 Billion As Insurance Losses Declined
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is controlled by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett, said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose as a decline in insurance losses helped offset a drop in underwriting. Quarterly profit was $1.45 billion, or $941 a share, up from $1.28 billion, or $834 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $18.12 billion from $18 billion. The company, based in Omaha, reported insurance premium revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $5.48 billion a year earlier. Earnings from its insurance underwriting fell to $376 million from $422 million, while investment income from its insurance business rose to $585 million from $479 million. (AP)

Cardinal Health Posts 27% Decline in Profit
A medical products supplier, Cardinal Health, said yesterday that its quarterly earnings fell 27 percent because of restructuring costs and one-time charges, while revenue rose 15 percent. The company, which supplies medicine, medical supplies and services, reported earnings of $287 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with earnings of $394 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended June 30 and was the fourth quarter of Cardinal's fiscal year, rose to $19.5 billion from $16.9 billion. Excluding special items and nonrecurring charges of 23 cents a share, the earnings would have been 89 cents a share, matching expectations. (AP)

Comcast Gives Chairman a $10 Million Extension
The Comcast Corporation, the cable-television company, extended the contract of its chief executive, Brian Roberts, and will pay him at least $10 million a year in salary and bonus for the next five years. Mr. Roberts, 46, will also receive deferred compensation starting at $2 million this year and rising to $2.43 million by 2009, the company said in a regulatory filing. Mr. Roberts became chief executive in November 2002. (Bloomberg News)

Boeing's Head of Satellite-Intelligence Unit Retires
Boeing said yesterday that the head of its satellite-intelligence unit would retire at the end of the year. The executive, Roger Roberts, 58, will be succeeded on an interim basis by Howard Chambers, vice president for program management, a Boeing spokeswoman, Marta Newhart, said. Projects being led by Mr. Roberts include the Air Force's $19.5 billion Future Imagery Architecture spy-satellite program. Boeing named Mr. Roberts as head of the space and intelligence systems division in 1997 when it acquired the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. (Bloomberg News)

British Airways Profit Doubles on Increase in Passengers
British Airways said yesterday that its first-quarter profit more than doubled as revenue increased 8.3 percent. Net profit for the three months ending June 30 rose to $:90 million ($160 million) from $:43 million. Revenue rose to $:2.06 billion ($3.7 billion). Pretax profits rose 65 percent, to $:124 million. The chief executive, Rod Eddington, left, said the results were driven by more customers flying in premium priced seats. He added that the airline had record first-quarter passenger load factors, a measure of how full its planes were across the network. British Airways warned that its annual fuel bill was likely to be $:75 million ($133.5 million) more than previously thought. (AP)

Shell to Challenge $131 Million Tax Claim in Venezuela

The international oil group Royal Dutch/Shell will challenge a $131 million tax demand made by Venezuela's tax authority as part of a wider review of foreign companies, a company official said yesterday. Shell received notification of the back tax demand from the tax authority on July 14, and was then given 15 working days to pay the amount in addition to a 10 percent fine.

The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said yesterday it would pay the Enron Corporation $250 million to resolve claims the lender aided accounting fraud, bringing it closer to resolving a costly legal dispute with the bankrupt energy trader. The bank, which on Tuesday agreed to pay Enron shareholders $2.4 billion, is the third of 10 financial institutions to settle the so-called MegaClaims litigation. (Bloomberg News)

Investment and Asset Units Drive Profit at British Bank
Barclays posted a 2 percent increase in profits in the first half of the year, driven by its investment banking and asset management units, the bank said yesterday. The bank, based in London, said profit rose to $:1.84 billion ($3.3 billion) from $:1.8 billion. The increase was driven by a 19.6 percent increase in profit in the investment banking unit, which helped offset a 17 percent decline in credit card profit and a decline in profit in the retail bank sector. Bad debts rose 20 percent, to $:706 million ($1.26 billion). (AP)

S.E.C. Inquiry of Payments by Oil Producers
Several oil producers -- Exxon Mobil, Marathon Oil, Amerada Hess and Devon Energy -- said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had started a formal investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The S.E.C. has requested documents from the companies and other oil and gas producers that have operations in Equatorial Guinea. They all said they were cooperating with the investigation that began informally in 2004. Exxon Mobil operates the biggest oilfield in Equatorial Guinea. Exxon Mobil, Marathon, Hess and Devon were part of an informal inquiry last year into accusations of bribery in the country. (Bloomberg News)

Exports Help German Industrial Output Increase
Industrial production in Germany, Europe's largest economy, rose more than expected in June as the euro's decline against the dollar bolstered exports and companies invested more in construction and goods like factory machinery. Production at factories, utilities, construction sites and mines increased 1.4 percent from May, when it slipped 0.4 percent, the Economy and Labor Ministry in Berlin said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Delphi's Use of Credit Line Raises Fears

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 5 

 BODY:
The Delphi Corporation, the auto parts supplier, said Friday that it was dipping into its credit line to finance operations, raising speculation that it might file for bankruptcy protection if restructuring talks with General Motors and the United Auto Workers union are unsuccessful.
 Standard and Poor's Ratings Services, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service all lowered Delphi's credit rating further into junk status on the news. S.&P. said Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., had total debt of about $4 billion and total unfunded pension and retirement liabilities of about $14.5 billion.
 Delphi's stock fell 82 cents, or 14 percent, to $4.96 a share. 
 Delphi, the nation's largest auto supplier, said it had begun drawing on its $1.8 billion credit line to finance its operations. It said it had initiated a draw down of $1.5 billion.
 Jim Gillette, a supplier analyst with the automotive forecasting firm CSM Worldwide, said warnings of a bankruptcy filing were premature. ''They've got that line of credit to help them through the rough bumps this year,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''Delphi, from a product standpoint, is very strong, and they've been doing a good job diversifying their customer base.''
 But S.&P. said the drawdown could mean Delphi was securing its liquidity should a bankruptcy filing become necessary.
 The company also confirmed that it was in restructuring talks with G.M., its former parent and largest customer, and the auto union, which represents about 25,000 Delphi hourly workers. 
 Fitch said it was in the union's best interest to negotiate a restructuring plan because wages and benefits might not be protected in bankruptcy court. G.M. also has a significant stake because it could be liable for a portion of Delphi's pension and health care costs if a bankruptcy filing occurs before the union's contract expires in 2007.
 Rumors that Delphi was talking with G.M. and its top union about how to restructure its operations were circulating even before Delphi's new chief executive, Robert S. Miller Jr., joined the company July 1. Mr. Miller is a veteran turnaround specialist who took Bethlehem Steel into bankruptcy in 2001 and engineered restructuring efforts at Waste Management and Aetna.
 A G.M. spokesman, Jerry Dubrowksi, said the automaker would not comment on its discussions with Delphi.

HEADLINE: The Campaign Against Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
CRITICISM of Wal-Mart may have reached a tipping point, Liza Featherstone writes in Salon.com this week.
 ''Firing whistle-blowers. Discriminating against women (and, most recently, black truck drivers). Violating child labor laws. Locking workers into stores overnight. Mooching off taxpayers. Disregarding local zoning laws. Mistreating immigrant janitors. Abusing young Bangladeshi women. Paying poverty-level wages in the United States. Destroying small-town America. If you read any newspapers -- or even watch 'The Daily Show' -- you can probably guess which company has been grabbing headlines for these and countless other charges and offenses.'' 
Wal-Mart, Ms. Featherstone writes, ''is becoming nearly as infamous as Enron or the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.'' And the campaign against it ''is a campaign against greed itself, and the current direction of our economy, in which corporations can do as they please regardless of the human cost.'' 
 Two large (and sometimes bickering) outfits have set up shop in Washington to pressure Wal-Mart into changing its ways, she points out. Both were started by unions, but after some years of trying to organize Wal-Mart workers, they have decided that -- in this age of diminished union power -- public pillorying, organized on the Internet, will be more effective. 
 Many analysts attribute Wal-Mart's anemic share price ''to what they call 'headline risk,' which is Wall Street-speak for bad press,'' she writes. ''That lagging stock price may become a critical pressure point for activists pressuring Wal-Mart to change its ways.'' 
 PRODUCTIVITY TOOL -- Temptation Blocker -- free, Windows-only software from Webjillion.com -- blocks access to user-specified programs for a set time. B. Adam Howell created the tool as ''a way for the smart part of me to head off the dumb, impulsive lizard part, and a way for me to get more stuff done at the computer.'' 
 ''Have a major deadline looming or ripe opportunity closing and just don't have time to waste playing Half Life 2 or checking Bloglines one last time?'' Mr. Howell asks. Just enter those programs, hit the ''Get Work Done'' button and computer games, Web browsers and other time-wasting programs become inaccessible. And no, you can't turn off Temptation Blocker until the restriction has elapsed.
 GET OUTTA MYSPACE -- The News Corporation, led by Rupert Murdoch, has purchased Intermix Media, which owns the social networking site MySpace.com. The Associated Press offered this curious characterization of users' reaction to the sale: ''Some of the hipsters in the online hangout fear their freewheeling ways, celebrated in naughty notes, brash blogs and provocative photos, won't mesh with the values of Murdoch's media outlets, like Fox News, which they believe are right-wing mouthpieces for the Bush administration.''
 The New York Post and Fox Television, both News Corporation properties, are at least as naughty, brash and provocative as MySpace, which is not quite the hotbed of social activism The A.P. portrays it as. A typical user profile is full of emoticons, LOL's and such self-descriptions as ''im really quiet n shy. but if u can break into the shell i hide in, ure pretty cool.'' 
 If MySpacers are upset over Mr. Murdoch becoming their overlord, one wonders how they felt in April when Intermix was charged with, among other ''deceptive business practices,'' planting spyware on users' computers. Intermix settled in June by agreeing to pay $7.5 million to New York State. 
 CRASH AND BURN -- A hideously designed Web site, Milkandcookies.com, offers a newly discovered video clip of David Bradley explaining during a 2001 panel discussion how he invented the Control-Alt-Delete function -- the last option for victims of crashed computers. ''I may have invented it,'' Mr. Bradley, then a computer engineer for I.B.M., says. ''But Bill made it famous.'' Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, is on the stage, looking less than happy about the observation, causing Mr. Bradley to backpedal furiously. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Rove and Novak, a 20-Year Friendship Born in Texas

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
These hot months here will be remembered as the summer of the leak, a time when the political class obsessed on a central question: did Karl Rove, President Bush's powerful adviser, commit a crime when he spoke about a C.I.A. officer with the columnist Robert D. Novak?
 Whatever a federal grand jury investigating the case decides, a small political subgroup is experiencing the odd sensation that this leak has sprung before. In 1992 in an incident well known in Texas, Mr. Rove was fired from the state campaign to re-elect the first President Bush on suspicions that Mr. Rove had leaked damaging information to Mr. Novak about Robert Mosbacher Jr., the campaign manager and the son of a former commerce secretary.
Since then, Mr. Rove and Mr. Novak have denied that Mr. Rove was the source, even as Mr. Mosbacher, who no longer talks on the record about the incident, has never changed his original assertion that Mr. Rove was the culprit. 
 ''It's history,'' Mr. Mosbacher said last week in a brief telephone interview. ''I commented on it at the time, and I have nothing to add.''
 But the episode, part of the bad-boy lore of Mr. Rove, is a telling chapter in the 20-year friendship between the presidential adviser and the columnist. The story of that relationship, a bond of mutual self-interest of a kind that is long familiar in Washington, does not answer the question of who might have leaked the identity of the C.I.A. officer, Valerie Wilson, to reporters, potentially a crime. 
 But it does give a clue to Mr. Rove's frequent and complimentary mentions over the years in Mr. Novak's column, and to the importance of Mr. Rove and Mr. Novak to each other's ambitions.
 ''They've known each for a long time, but they are not close friends,'' said a person who knows both men and who asked not to be named because of the investigation into a conversation by Mr. Novak and Mr. Rove in July 2003 about Ms. Wilson, part of a case that has put a reporter for The New York Times, Judith Miller, in jail for refusing to testify to the grand jury. 
 The two men share a love of history and policy, as well as reputations as aggressive partisans and hotheads.
 People who have been officially briefed on the case have said Mr. Rove was the second of two senior administration officials cited by Mr. Novak in his column of July 14, 2003, that identified Ms. Wilson by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and said she was a C.I.A. operative. 
 The larger question has been whether Mr. Rove might have been using the columnist to confirm Ms. Plame's identity to punish or undermine her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, who had accused the Bush administration of leading the nation to war with Iraq on false pretenses.
 Mr. Novak, who stalked out of a live program on CNN on Thursday after uttering a profanity on the air, declined to be interviewed for this article. 
 The anchor of the program, ''Inside Politics,'' Ed Henry, has said he was preparing later in the broadcast to ask Mr. Novak about his role in the leak case.
 Mr. Rove also declined to be interviewed.
 But Mr. Novak, through his office manager, Kathleen Connolly, provided the information about his first encounter with Mr. Rove. Mr. Novak, by his recollection, met Mr. Rove in Texas in the mid-80's, when Mr. Novak turned up to write columns about the state's shifting out of Democrats' hands into those of Republicans. 
 In those years, Mr. Rove regularly had dinner with Mr. Novak when the columnist went to Austin. Mr. Rove, in his mid-30's, was a rising political operator who in 1981 founded his direct-mail consulting firm, Karl Rove & Company. Gov. William P. Clements, a Republican, was one of his first clients.
 Mr. Novak, in his mid-50's, was big political game for Mr. Rove. He was the other half, with Rowland Evans Jr., of a much read and increasingly conservative column that was syndicated by The Chicago Sun-Times and published weekly in The Washington Post. Evans and Novak, as it was called -- Mr. Evans retired in 1993 --closely chronicled the Reagan era, and it would have been a sign of Mr. Rove's arrival on the national scene for Mr. Novak to mention him in print.
 Still, a computer search of Mr. Novak's columns shows that Mr. Rove's name did not appear under his byline until 1992, when Mr. Novak wrote the words that got Mr. Rove into such trouble. 
 ''A secret meeting of worried Republican power brokers in Dallas last Sunday reflected the reality that George Bush is in serious trouble in trying to carry his adopted state,'' the column began.
 The column said that the campaign run by Mr. Mosbacher was a ''bust'' and that he had been stripped of his authority at the ''secret meeting'' by Senator Phil Gramm, the top Republican in the state.
 Also at the meeting, Mr. Novak reported, was ''political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher.''
 Specifically, Mr. Mosbacher told The Houston Chronicle in 2003 that he had given a competitor of Mr. Rove the bulk of a $1million contract for direct mail work in the campaign.
 ''I thought another firm was better,'' Mr. Mosbacher told The Chronicle. ''I had $1 million for direct mail. I gave Rove a contract for $250,000 and $750,000 to the other firm.''
 The other firm belonged to Mr. Rove's chief competitor, John Weaver, and Mr. Rove was so angry, Texas Republicans say, that he retaliated by leaking the information about Mr. Mosbacher to Mr. Novak. 
 Mr. Mosbacher fired Mr. Rove. As a result, Mr. Weaver, who later faced off against Mr. Rove as the political director of Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2000, walked away with Mr. Rove's $250,000, too.
 ''That's about the only time that a Novak column benefited me,'' Mr. Weaver said this week in a telephone interview. 
 Mr. Rove again turned up in Mr. Novak's columns in 1999, when Gov. George W. Bush was running for president. Mr. Rove, Mr. Bush's national campaign strategist, was quoted briefly on the record in at least three columns, even though Mr. Novak has said on CNN, ''I can't tell you anything I ever talked to Karl Rove about, because I don't think I ever talked to him about any subject, even the time of day, on the record.''
 Whether Mr. Novak forgot about the 1999 mentions is unclear. What is clear is that Mr. Rove has made frequent appearances in Mr. Novak's column in a positive light, often in paragraphs that imparted information about the inner workings of Mr. Bush's operation, feeding perceptions here that Mr. Rove is one of the columnist's most important anonymous sources.
 In April 2000, under the headline ''Bush Thriving Without Insiders,'' Mr. Novak wrote of the fears of the Republican old guard about the triumvirate of ''rookies'' in Austin -- led by Mr. Rove -- who were running Mr. Bush's ''supposedly fading'' presidential campaign.
 ''Actually,'' Mr. Novak wrote, ''the Austin triumvirate has managed the most effective Republican campaign since Dwight D. Eisenhower's in 1952.''
 Last December, Mr. Novak wrote that the ''retention of John Snow as secretary of the treasury was viewed in the capital's inner circles as a defeat for presidential adviser Karl Rove, who wanted a high-profile manager of President Bush's second-term economic program.'' 
 Although Mr. Novak did not directly debunk that view, he did suggest a different turn of events when he wrote that two Wall Street executives had said no to the position and that it was ''decided at the White House to relieve Snow from his uncertainty and keep him in office.''
 These days, friends of the two men say they have not seen Mr. Rove and Mr. Novak at dinner togetherand note that there is little the two would have to celebrate. But in June 2003, The Chicago Sun-Times gave a party for Mr. Novak at the Army and Navy Club here to salute 40 years of his columns. 
 The biggest political celebrity guest, to no one's surprise, was Mr. Rove.

HEADLINE: The Chemistry of a 90 (plus) wine 

BYLINE: By David Darlington. 
David Darlington is the author of ''Zin: The History and Mystery of Zinfandel'' (originally published as ''Angels' Visits''), among other books, and writes the Short Finish column for Wine & Spirits magazine.

 BODY:
One day last September while Leo McCloskey was driving to the Chappellet winery in Napa Valley, he telephoned a client in the neighboring valley of Sonoma. ''I'm looking at your metrics,'' McCloskey said. ''They're pretty beefy. If you have that at midferm, you're already there. You need 50 percent as a 4; I think drain-down-sweet is the name of the game this year. Let's do what they do at Lafite -- come out shy of tannin, and we'll add tannin. I want to encourage you to move more aggressively than you normally would.''
 He listened for a few seconds. ''You're golden,'' McCloskey said. ''Beautiful -- you got a statue in the quad. Hey, I gotta fly.'' He ended the call and turned to me. ''If you're in Sonoma, you have to rearrange Mother Nature to match the beauty of Napa and Bordeaux,'' he said. ''Napa cabernet is the only New World wine ruler that's being used internationally. Sonoma is an also-ran.'' 
 McCloskey steered onto the Silverado Trail, entering into Stags Leap, the area that produced the cabernet sauvignon that won a famous Paris tasting in 1976, heralding the international arrival of California wine. ''They picked too early,'' McCloskey said, gazing at acres of grapeless vines on both sides of the road. ''We have a weekly online bulletin that tells people when to pick. On Sept. 13 we said not to, and people who picked anyway drained down at 87.1.''
 McCloskey could say this because his company, Enologix, takes grape samples from clients and extracts the juice to measure some of its chemical compounds. Then, using software developed by McCloskey, Enologix compares the chemistry of the projected wines with that of a benchmark example. The outcome is a score on a 100-point scale, analogous -- not coincidentally -- to those employed by critics like Robert Parker of The Wine Advocate and James Laube of Wine Spectator. McCloskey boasted that his ''thinking is in tune with Parker, Laube and Helen Turley'' -- the latter a California winemaker notorious for favoring big, fruity, intense wines.
 Not everyone shares this taste, however. Many oenophiles argue that -- owing especially to the influence of Parker, who has been called the planet's most powerful critic of any kind, in any field -- wines all over the world have become more and more homogenous. The jammy, oaky international style is largely free of the tannins that mellow and lend flavor as a wine ages but can make it taste bitter or astringent when young. Yet these wines often lack a sense of terroir, or regional distinctiveness, celebrated by so many wine aficionados. Parker's most lamented impact is his popularization of the 100-point scale that is now employed by most wine magazines. The so-called Score has been described as America's main contribution to the wine business: a democratic, no-nonsense way of jettisoning the elitist jargon that veils quality from the consumer. It is also maligned for turning wine buyers into mindless puppets and vintners into sycophants seeking the favor of King Parker and King Laube.
 But Leo McCloskey is unfazed. ''The wine world is so big today that without ratings it would be chaos,'' he says. ''The consumer doesn't need to know about terroir. He just wants to know whether a wine is worth $28 or whatever he's paying for it.''
 In the 15 years since McCloskey went into business for himself as a wine consultant, the number of California wineries has increased from 800 to 1,700, roughly speaking. The market share of foreign-made wines in the United States has doubled over the same period. With so many wineries now under the bottom-line control of corporations -- Constellation, Bronco, Beringer Blass, Brown-Forman, Kendall-Jackson, Diageo, the Wine Group and the longtime kingpin, E. & J. Gallo -- it is easy to see the appeal of Enologix, with its promise of ''metrics that assist winemakers in . . . boosting average national critics' scores.'' But McCloskey doesn't stop there. He insists that high-scoring wines can, through chemical analysis, be scientifically proved to be the best wines on the market. In other words, there is accounting for taste.
The low-slung Enologix offices are situated in a mini-business-park in the town of Sonoma. When I visited McCloskey there, he said that he has a database containing records of 70,000 wines, including information about soil, climate, prices, winemaking techniques, grape-growing practices and critical scores. While traditional wine science focuses mainly on primary chemicals -- things like sugar, alcohol and acidity, which determine whether a wine meets basic standards of acceptability -- McCloskey looks at secondary chemicals (like terpenes, phenols and anthocyanins), which, in affecting more nuanced characteristics like texture, aroma, taste and color, are more closely associated with quality.
 To analyze an individual wine, Enologix runs a sample through a liquid chromatograph (and for white wine, a mass spectrometer) to separate and measure chemical compounds. McCloskey says he has identified about 100 that can affect a person's response; to compute a wine's ''quality index,'' the ratios -- not just the amounts -- of these compounds to one another are compared with those of bottled wines previously judged and scored by groups of vintners, growers, owners and critics. McCloskey publishes his findings in his magazine, Global Vintage Quarterly, alongside a separate National Critics' Score, which represents an average rating compiled from five publications: Wine Spectator, The Wine Advocate, Wine Enthusiast, Stephen Tanzer's International Wine Cellar and Connoisseurs' Guide to California Wine.
 Enologix divides wine into four categories. For reds, Style 1 is pale in color and low in tannin, like most pinot noir or French Burgundy; Style 2 is also pale, but higher in tannin, like Italian Barolo; Style 3 is dark and tannic, like a great many cabernet sauvignons and first-growth Bordeaux; Style 4 is similarly dark but only moderately tannic. This last category, McCloskey told me, represents ''the vast majority of successful, flagship mainstream wines, the most elegant and popular wines in the world.''
 Fermentation, the foundation of winemaking, occurs when yeast converts grape sugar into alcohol. Harvesting fruit late yields more intense flavor, though higher sugars result in higher alcohol levels; ''draining down sweet'' -- separating the juice in a fermentation tank from its crushed grape skins before all the sugar has been transformed -- means that less harsh-tasting tannin will find its way into the wine, with the side effect that it may age less well. According to McCloskey, these techniques (guided by Enologix chemistry and his winemaking expertise) can yield the Style 4 qualities -- rich, concentrated flavor and a soft, velvety sensation in the mouth -- that contemporary critics value most.
 McCloskey claims that by using his system and the 100-point scale, winemakers can predict their own average critical scores within two and a half points with 95 percent accuracy (one and a half points with 80 percent accuracy). He says that the typical winery signing up with Enologix realizes a five-point rise over its previous years' average scores for red wines -- six for white. McCloskey's emphasis is on the luxury cabernet market in which wineries can afford Enologix's average annual service fee of $20,000. The company's revenues (which vary between $1 million and $1.4 million) flow from such prestigious names as Beaulieu, Benziger, Diamond Creek, Merry Edwards, Niebaum-Coppola, Ridge, St. Francis and Sebastiani. According to McCloskey, 39 Enologix wines scored 90 points or higher in a recent issue of The Wine Advocate. 
The Chappellet winery is hidden in a grove of oaks backed by open slopes of grapevines, high among the rugged hills on Napa Valley's eastern edge. Founded in 1968 by Donn and Molly Chappellet, the company won early acclaim for its cabernet sauvignon, but as consumer tastes shifted toward softer textures and juicier fruit, it acquired the aura of a has-been. To turn things around, the owners hired a young winemaker, Phillip Titus, in 1990. He began working with Enologix in 1996, and in 2004 Connoisseurs' Guide chose a Chappellet cabernet as the Wine of the Year.
 After parking the car and entering the winery's cavernous interior, we were greeted by Titus, now 49, who drew a foaming sample of merlot from a stainless-steel fermentation tank. As we tasted the wine, Titus recited its levels of tannin and complex anthocyanins -- in parts per million -- from the Enologix chemical report. ''In my tasting group, they can't speak this language,'' Titus said. ''Unless you're an Enologix client, you don't talk about complex anthocyanins.''
 Soon we were joined by two more of McCloskey's clients, Sam Spencer and Wendy Roloson, who were making 5,000 cases of wine at Chappellet. With the first fruit he had picked, Spencer had pressed the wine off its skins after fermentation was finished. ''But when we looked at the results,'' McCloskey said, ''quality was low because tannin was high.''
 ''I wasn't able to drain down into a Style 4,'' Spencer confirmed.
 ''Your grapes are growing at Style 3,'' McCloskey told him. ''That's the pitch your terroir is throwing you. But Parker, Laube and the consumer are at Style 4, so you need to ask yourself, How can I get my wine stylistically in the right ballpark?''
 The answer was that Spencer would have to press his remaining grapes earlier this time and aim to produce a successful product through blending. ''You need to be so low in tannin that you're going to feel really uncomfortable,'' McCloskey warned.
 Later, Spencer told me that Enologix at first ''seemed like a luxury. It wasn't exactly forthcoming about how the system works -- you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement to see how the metrics add up, and I wasn't convinced. But now I think it's a tool that every carpenter ought to have.''
 Not all of McCloskey's clients are so complimentary. Several I spoke to declined to be quoted, apparently owing to a fear that being identified with Enologix would suggest that they have gone over to the dark side and are chasing the Score. (McCloskey calls this ''the cover-up,'' when winemakers refuse to acknowledge their use of modern technologies at odds with romantic marketing images.)
 Joel Peterson, co-founder and general manager of Ravenswood (a noted zinfandel winery where I once worked), told me that after Ravenswood's brief experience with Enologix, he thought the company provided information only for making one style of wine. ''It's a very narrow definition of taste,'' Peterson says. ''Part of the charm and beauty of wine is its idiosyncrasy, but when everybody tries to hit the same sweet spot, it's like making soda pop.'' And when all wines taste alike, he says, ''as a consumer you have to ask what you're paying for.''
 Although McCloskey is fond of proclaiming that ''the consumer is king,'' sales don't figure into the Enologix Index. In lieu of formal studies or statistics, McCloskey (like most of the rest of the wine industry) accepts the axiom that buyers obey critics, whether or not the average consumer's palate agrees with that of the average wine writer.
The common objection to the Score is that wine is too complex a beverage to be summed up in a single number. The way in which someone responds to a wine depends on myriad variables: stylistic preference, mood, the accompanying food and the state of the wine itself after shipping and storing and aging -- not to mention the prejudices and expectations that attend a wine's reputation and price. For the same reason that a thundering symphony or screaming guitar solo may not make the best dinner music, wines that do poorly in competitive tastings sometimes fare better with meals than those attention-grabbing ones that impress judges in isolation. Hence, by keying his chemical evaluation system to critical scores, McCloskey makes the (not uncommon) assumption that intensity is tantamount to quality, when it's often equivalent only to extravagance.
 ''The prevailing critics can't distinguish real quality,'' says Randall Grahm, the winemaker at Bonny Doon Vineyards (like Ravenswood, a former Parker favorite that fell from grace as it grew). ''They're easily fooled by fakery because the only thing they're looking for is concentration. That probably can be correlated with chemistry -- but I would argue that while it can be an indicator of quality, it's not the only one. It doesn't speak to balance, for example.''
 Roger Boulton, a professor in the department of viticulture and oenology at the University of California, Davis, is critical of the fact that Enologix's analytical methods aren't available for outsiders to verify. ''If Leo is so sure about these things,'' Boulton asked me, ''why are they hidden?'' Others agree, complaining that McCloskey's proprietary system constitutes a ''black box'' impervious to academic and professional scrutiny.
 ''I'm not in the tenure-track business,'' McCloskey retorts. ''I followed the academic rules and published papers for a while. I found it was insanely slow. If you walked up to Steve Jobs and asked him to reveal everything, he'd say, 'Get out of my face.'''
McCloskey, interestingly enough, grew up in San Francisco and Cupertino, Calif., the home of Jobs and Apple Computer. Upon graduating from Oregon State in 1971 with a degree in general science, he returned home and got a job painting barrels with mildicide at nearby Ridge Vineyards; within a year, he had taken over the winery's lab -- such as it was -- and by the time he was 25 had published new methods for measuring alcohol and malolactic fermentation (both now essential to wine analysis). In 1976 he helped to found Felton-Empire, a winery whose first vintage riesling won the Sweepstakes Award at the Los Angeles County Fair.
 Paul Draper, the now celebrated vintner who arrived at Ridge shortly before McCloskey, recalls that Charlie Rosen -- one of the winery's founders and then head of artificial intelligence at the Stanford Research Institute -- considered McCloskey a genius, and Maynard Amerine, a noted U.C. Davis professor who helped to classify California's wine regions by climate, suggested that McCloskey get a doctorate at Davis with the aim of joining the faculty. But Rosen and Carl Djerassi, a Ridge investor and the inventor of the birth-control pill, advised McCloskey to study ''things like chemistry and mathematics, which actually have principles,'' McCloskey says. ''Enology is more like a social science.'' While remaining a paid consultant at Ridge, McCloskey attended U.C. Santa Cruz, and there he met his future wife, Susanne Arrhenius, a Swedish-born grad student whose lineage included two Nobel laureates in chemistry. Following Arrhenius into the field of chemical ecology, which analyzes the relationships between organisms and their environments, McCloskey completed his Ph.D. while continuing to consult with private clients and serve as president of Felton-Empire.
 ''Chemical ecology says that a wine's flavor, color and fragrance are expressions of its ecosystem,'' McCloskey told me. ''Wine scientists thought grapes were more complicated than any other plant system. But we found out that Vitis vinifera produces a relatively simple list of flavors. Grapes are really rather primitive.''
 Soon after McCloskey left U.C. Santa Cruz, Felton-Empire was sold. Along the way, he noticed that the U.S. wine industry was becoming more businesslike and less entrepreneurial. ''Critics were starting to control the value chain that went from the winery to the distributor to the retailer and restaurateur to the consumer,'' McCloskey says. ''By 1990 everybody was discrediting the Score, but I saw that the critics were going to win because Americans wanted to reduce their risk of purchase and winemakers weren't filling the information void.'' 
 That year, 1990, McCloskey met with Dick Graff, then chairman of the Chalone Wine Group. McCloskey told him that although winemakers always seemed surprised when their efforts didn't pan out, chemistry could actually predict critical performance. Graff arranged for McCloskey to taste Chalone wines with all the company's vintners, after which McCloskey assembled the results and analyzed the wines' chemistry. Later the winemakers were presented with 12 wines, and asked to rank the 6 best and 6 worst. While others tallied the votes, McCloskey produced a sealed envelope containing his chemically based predictions: he correctly guessed the group's Top 3 and Bottom 3 choices, in the correct order.
 After that, Graff introduced McCloskey to the owners of Chateau Lafite Rothschild, the famous first-growth Bordeaux estate that had a financial interest in Chalone. When McCloskey analyzed the chemistry of Lafite's vintages from the previous decade, his quality index exactly mirrored their economic performance. McCloskey continued to work with Lafite for the next four years, over which time he gained a dozen more clients. In 1993 he trademarked the name Enologix.
A week and a half after the meeting at Chappellet, Sam Spencer visited the Enologix offices with samples of wine he had pressed according to McCloskey's instructions. Studying its numbers, McCloskey said, ''That's a home run.''
 ''I literally baby-sat the fermenter,'' Spencer said.
 Later, in the privacy of his office, McCloskey told me, ''My goal is to make my customers self-sufficient so that metrics alone can solve all their problems.'' Toward that end, he is now creating a thousand proprietary documents that will include all of his winemaking knowledge. Ultimately, he said, ''I'll be replaced by customer-management software.''
 And if McCloskey has his way, descriptions of a wine's terroir will be replaced by reports on its levels of tannin and complex anthocyanin.

HEADLINE: The Wedding That Is Soooo You

BYLINE: By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
WHEN Karolynn Krause and Brian Cionek began planning their wedding, which took place on June 25, they were intent on creating an event that reflected their interests and styles. Despite pressure from their families to have a traditional Roman Catholic ceremony, the couple designed their wedding around their favorite sport, golf, and were married by a nondenominational minister at the 10th hole of the Lake Tahoe Golf Course in California. 
 ''We wanted to bring the fun that we've had on the greens to the wedding,'' said the bride, 29, a resident of Sacramento. At the reception, in the clubhouse, the wedding cake was decorated with white chocolate golf balls and greens made from fondant. The centerpieces were ceramic golf bags. 
 Highly personalized weddings are becoming increasingly common, wedding planners and caterers say. There are no statistics tracking the trend. But Jennifer Brisman, a wedding planner in New York, said she saw interest in personalized weddings rising three or four years ago. While she said she avoids ''theme weddings,'' she estimates that in 2000 only 20 to 30 percent of her clients included highly personalized elements in their events. Today, she said, 70 to 80 percent of them do. 
 Couples are personalizing their weddings in part because over the last 30 years, marriage has moved beyond the rigid economic and gender roles that defined it for thousands of years, said Stephanie Coontz, a historian and the author of ''Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage'' (Viking Adult). 
 With marriages taking more varied forms, some couples may want different ceremonies, too, she said. At the same time, Ms. Coontz added, couples are marrying later and are thus more likely to pay for their own weddings, leaving them freer to plan what they like. 
 The Rev. Galen Guengerich, a minister at All Souls Church in New York who frequently performs weddings, said ''Sometimes traditional religious expression is unsatisfying'' for couples. ''People are finding a different way of reaching the same symbolic potency,'' Mr. Guengerich said. 
 Mike Bodner and Peggy Hodgkiss certainly created a wedding that was far from ordinary.
 They met while organizing events for the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, and their connection was forged around recreational shooting and pro-gun political activity. So their wedding and reception in September 2003 at the Wayne Manor, a catering hall in New Jersey, was a gun enthusiast's dream. Tables were named for gun makers like Smith & Wesson, and guests received plastic toy gun party favors. An ice sculpture featured two Cupids carrying rifles. 
 ''Most of our family and friends are very pro-firearms,'' said the bride, 49. ''They know who we are and that that wedding was us.'' 
 Occasionally, couples dress to reflect the theme of their wedding. When Amy Mohlman and Joseph Puchalsky married in Orlando, Fla., on May 16, in a wedding with an Alice in Wonderland theme, the bride wore a white and lavender wedding dress, a white pinafore and a petticoat, while the bridegroom commissioned a $130 copy of the Mad Hatter's top hat. 
 ''We view marriage as a jump down the rabbit hole, an absolute adventure,'' the bride said. ''Just because it's whimsical and fun doesn't make it any less special or serious.'' 
 Highly personalized weddings can present logistical challenges. Ms. Krause and Mr. Cionek had to make sure none of their guests would be in peril from flying golf balls, as the course remained open during the ceremony. Kent Ehman, the food and drink director at the Lake Tahoe club, said weddings there are held at 5 p.m., when most golfers are finished with the first nine holes. Those still lingering are escorted to a temporary 10th hole tee box about 75 yards away. 
 Critics say too much emphasis on themes and pageantry may diminish the institution of marriage. ''If you need a costume to don a persona during the ceremony it begs the question of who's getting married -- the person or the character?'' said Jeanne Hamilton, the author of ''Wedding Etiquette Hell: The Bride's Bible to Avoiding Everlasting Damnation'' (St. Martin's Griffin) and the creator of the Web site etiquettehell.com, where stories of weddings run amok are shared.
 Even the most modern couples want the approval of their friends and families, Ms. Coontz said. So the challenge is to create a wedding that feels personal but not wacky. 
 ''We want our friends to say, yes, this couple belongs together,'' she said, ''but not together in an insane asylum.''

FLYING AT NIGHT
Poems 1965-1985.
By Ted Kooser.
142 pp. University of Pittsburgh Press.
Cloth, $24.95. Paper, $14.95.
 TED KOOSER'S ''Flying at Night'' seems oddly, if not misleadingly, titled; the merits of these poems derive mostly from staying close to earth. A retired vice president of an insurance company in Lincoln, Neb., Kooser sets poem after poem out among the open-ended, wind-ransacked Great Plains. This terrain is notoriously inhospitable to any plant that would root deep or grow tall, but his tree is planted there -- his family tree -- and ''Flying at Night'' offers a densely peopled, multigenerational series of portraits and anecdotes drawn from a sparsely populated region.
 In addition to being a retired businessman, Kooser is, as of last October, the poet laureate of the United States and the winner, this year, of a Pulitzer Prize. His was perceived, I think it's fair to say, as a sudden ascendancy, bringing attention to an author who over the years had published some 10 books of poetry and a couple of books of literary nonfiction.
 Kooser was born in Iowa in 1939. ''Flying at Night'' is subtitled ''Poems 1965-1985,'' and its contents, selected from earlier volumes, are largely the work of a man moving reflectively into middle age. Most of the poems are short -- it's a rare one that straddles two pages -- and closely focused. Few impose serious formal demands. Language is mostly simple and logic mostly clear. The poetry often resides in a concision that echoes the taciturnity of the people -- many of them farmers -- the poems celebrate: ''The loan that built the barn / just wasn't big enough / to buy the paint.'' Or: ''his Adam's apple hung like a ham / in a stairwell.'' 
 This is good, honest work. Of course, goodness and honesty will take a poet only so far. The problem with plain facts plainly stated is that, while they avoid the very real dangers of pretentiousness, obfuscation and self-indulgence, they often fail W. H. Auden's apt definition of poetry as ''memorable speech.'' Here's ''The Grandfather Cap'' in its entirety:
 Sometimes I think that as he aged,
 this cap, with the stain in its brim
 like a range of dark mountains, 
 became the horizon to him. 
 He never felt right with it off. 
 This has an appealing grandfilial devotion to recommend it, but little else that I can see. A few poems here have the easy geniality -- and the lastingness -- of a ''Have a nice day'' called by a sales clerk of a convenience store as you step out the door with a half-gallon of milk. 
 Others feel more substantial. Kooser is a fine portraitist; there are a number of neatly sketched, affecting people in these pages. He fortifies his empathy and admirably clean lines with a gift -- his primary gift -- for simile and metaphor. His poems characteristically move from likeness to likeness, from ''like'' to ''like.'' Sometimes the path is predictable, as in ''Carrie,'' reproduced here in full: 
 ''There's never an end to dust
 and dusting,'' my aunt would say
 as her rag, like a thunderhead,
 scudded across the yellow oak
 of her little house. There she lived
 seventy years with a ball
 of compulsion closed in her fist,
 and an elbow that creaked and popped
 like a branch in a storm. Now dust
 is her hands and dust her heart. 
 There's never an end to it. 
 Kooser is often more interesting with metaphor -- where the comparison is apt to lie under a layer or two of implication -- than with simile. There's a snake to be found in the first few lines of ''In the Corners of Fields,'' but it's a creature the more striking for being implicit: ''Something is calling to me / from the corners of fields, / where the leftover fence wire / suns its loose coils, and stones / thrown out of the furrow / sleep in warm litters.'' 
 And here and there Kooser provides moments when some metaphor that seems as old as poetry itself turns up renewed, refreshed: ''There's sun on the moon's back / as she stoops to pick up / a star that she's dropped in her garden.'' 
 The librarian of Congress has pointed out that Kooser is ''the first poet laureate chosen from the Great Plains.'' And not merely from, but of. In a poetry world dominated by poets who frequently shift from academic job to job and region to region, Kooser's poetry is rare for its sense of being so firmly and enduringly rooted in one locale. Thus, he seems a salutary symbol for a largely symbolic post -- a useful reminder, to a country whose literary loci lie on both coasts, of all the impassioned writing coming out of zones frequently less looked into than flown over. 
 In truth, the Great Plains haven't yielded poetry nearly so rewarding as their fiction -- there has been no poet you'd want to place beside Willa Cather at your ideal literary banquet (although Amy Clampitt, when revisiting the Iowa landscapes of her childhood, could produce imagery -- she saw the plains as ''only waves of chlorophyll in motion'' -- that Cather might have envied). All the more welcome, then, a poet like Kooser, who has brought to these vistas and inhabitants long familiarity and respectful affection.
 Of course, it's impossible to cross the country these days and not be aware of how powerful are the forces, economic and social, working to ensure that the restaurants and shops and motels, and the music being piped into them, are identical wherever you go. Whether or not he originally set out to, Kooser has been memorializing a vanishing world, where the oldest inhabitants hark back to the sodbusters. He's become, perforce, something of an elegist.
 Clearly, Kooser the metaphor maker speaks for an extended ''family'' of generations that have drawn sustenance, both material and spiritual, from the Great Plains. But he speaks as well, particularly in his new role as laureate, for another family -- that vast legion of poets, outspread across the country, who patiently compile one manuscript after another while pursuing a day job elsewhere. There's something heartening about those poets, like Kooser, like Wallace Stevens (who also spent his working life in the insurance business), like the doctor William Carlos Williams, whose lives reflect some vital integration of the ''real world'' and the realer world of art. If at the end of the day Kooser's poetic aesthetic is not mine (I prefer a thicker mix of language, a more complicated architecture), his poems are a tonic reminder that, in contemporary America, nearly all of our poets live in a Great Plains -- a region of thin crowds and long echoes. And that the only way for them to proceed is to write from the heart's home, as Kooser has done.

Jean Thompson's most recent novel is ''City Boy.''

 BODY:

THE SUMMER HE DIDN'T DIE
By Jim Harrison.
277 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $24.
 One of the pleasures of reading Jim Harrison's fifth collection of novellas is the reminder that this intermediate, unloved and ostensibly unpublishable form is capable of great range and vitality. Novellas must pack all the apparatus of a novel (characters moving through time, sustained action) into a briefer space. In Harrison's case this is an economical 100 pages or so. And ideally, novellas must have something of the short story's precision and the lift that comes from crisp timing and execution. ''The Summer He Didn't Die'' meets all these technical requirements, but mostly it succeeds because it is fueled by solid storytelling and by Harrison's characteristic ease as a stylist.
 The three quite different novellas that make up the book vary in tone from ribald comedy to quiet reflection. They cover time periods of a day or two, or months, or the span of a life, and travel geographically from Harrison's home ground, the Upper Peninsula in Michigan, to other places around the globe. The three entries set one another off to good advantage; the repetition of any one mode could have grown wearying -- although the pleasure of the title novella, featuring Brown Dog, a perennial Harrison character, would be enough to carry a whole book. Harrison fans can never get enough of Brown Dog. He is an Upper Peninsula mixed-blood Indian, last seen in ''The Beast God Forgot to Invent,'' incongruously misplaced in Los Angeles and attempting to recover a stolen bearskin.
 This time Brown Dog is back home in Michigan, home being a house trailer without indoor plumbing. Brown Dog's immediate crisis is a toothache, three of his teeth having gone rotten. His day-to-day concern is the care of two young children, Red and Berry, who have been entrusted to him while their mother is in jail. This effort at domestic responsibility is a new one for Brown Dog, an outdoorsman and a handyman adept at many skills that allow him to survive, if not thrive. And always present in his consciousness are any possible encounters with women: ''Brown Dog was greatly drawn to women with none of the hesitancy of his more modern counterparts who tiptoed in and out of women's lives wearing blindfolds, nose plugs, ear plugs and fluttering ironic hearts.'' 
 Brown Dog is an alter ego for Harrison, or for anyone who might imagine a life unburdened by ambition and materialism, in tune with both nature and natural appetites. Berry, born with fetal alcohol syndrome, represents another step away from all that is troublesome in the human condition, and toward an idealized animal state. Unable to speak, she imitates birds and befriends snakes. Much of the plot concerns Brown Dog's efforts to keep Berry from being placed in a special education state boarding school. Brown Dog's teeth, and other needs, are serviced by Belinda, an oversize dentist with a sexual addiction. There is broad comedy in the writing, but also tenderness, and never a moment when the reader isn't rooting for Brown Dog to get it right.
 ''Republican Wives'' is a nearly farcical look at three women, friends since childhood, Republican more in the sense of economic privilege than of politics. All three have had disastrous affairs with Daryl, a famous poet and poseur par excellence whom they knew back in college. They seek in Daryl all that is missing from their lives: romance, substance and a sort of artistic fulfillment by proxy: ''In our families it was proper to be interested in the arts but not 'too' interested, if you know what I mean.'' Daryl seems to regard them as trophies gained while waging class warfare, although he is happy to take advantage of the extravagant meals and lodging the women provide. When one of the wives attempts to kill Daryl, they gather for consolation and strategy sessions. (Murder seems understandable; Daryl has sent naked pictures of each woman to her husband.) No one comes off very well here, but there is fun to be had in reading about these expensive misadventures -- albeit rather nasty fun.
 The protagonist of ''Tracking'' shares a number of particulars with the author's life: the Upper Michigan boyhood, the accident that blinds him in one eye and, later, the coming-of-age as a writer. The tone here is more deliberate and nondramatic, a distancing mechanism that is probably necessary when turning one's own life into fiction. You might say it's a way of covering your tracks. There is an accumulation of small events and details that build as gradually as anyone's personal story. It is Harrison's consistently effective writing, his talent for encompassing both specifics and complexities, that keeps all this interesting. The true subject here is not really autobiography, but the mystery of physical place and how it marks consciousness.
 As the boy of ''Tracking'' grows into a man and travels farther and farther from his origins, to New York City, Montana, France and many other places, he experiences a kind of sensory overload, the impossibility of processing the world into a coherent whole. Self-awareness is a mixed blessing, but also an unavoidable one. On occasion it can be damped down or blotted out by visiting a favorite trout stream, as Brown Dog often does. But writing would be impossible without it. And we would all be the poorer if deprived of Jim Harrison's first-rate stories.

 BODY:
Developing a Crack Index
If you rely on the news media for your information, you probably think that crack cocaine is a thing of the past. If you rely on data, however, you reach a different conclusion.
 Measuring the use and impact of a drug like crack isn't easy. There is no government Web site to provide crack data, and surveying dealers is bound to be pretty unreliable. So how can you get to the truth of crack use? One way is to look at a variety of imperfect but plausible proxies, including cocaine arrests, emergency-room visits and deaths. Unlike the volume of news coverage, the rates for all of these remain shockingly high. Cocaine arrests, for instance, have fallen only about 15 percent since the crack boom of the late 1980's. Cocaine-related deaths are actually higher now; so are the number of emergency-room visits due to cocaine. When combined in a sensible way, these proxies can be used to construct a useful index of crack.
 And what does this index reveal? That crack use was nonexistent until the early 1980's and spiked like mad in 1985, peaking in 1989. That it arrived early on the West Coast, but became most prevalent in the cities of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States. And that it produced a remarkable level of gun violence, particularly among young black men, who made up the bulk of street-level crack dealers. During the crack boom, the homicide rate among 13- to 17-year-old blacks nearly quintupled. But perhaps the biggest surprise in the crack index is the fact that, as of 2000 -- the most recent year for which the index data are available -- Americans were still smoking about 70 percent as much crack as they smoked when consumption was at its peak.
 If so much crack is still being sold and bought, why aren't we hearing about it? Because crack-associated violence has largely disappeared. And it was the violence that made crack most relevant to the middle class. What made the violence go away? Simple economics. Urban street gangs were the main distributors of crack cocaine. In the beginning, demand for their product was phenomenal, and so were the potential profits. Most crack killings, it turns out, were not a result of some crackhead sticking up a grandmother for drug money but rather one crack dealer shooting another -- and perhaps a few bystanders -- in order to gain turf.
 But the market changed fast. The destructive effects of the drug became apparent; young people saw the damage that crack inflicted on older users and began to stay away from it. (One recent survey showed that crack use is now three times as common among people in their late 30's as it is among those in their late teens and early 20's.) As demand fell, price wars broke out, driving down profits. And as the amount of money at stake grew smaller and smaller, the violence also dissipated. Young gang members are still selling crack on street corners, but when a corner becomes less valuable, there is less incentive to kill, or be killed, for it.
 So how can it be that crack consumption is still so high? Part of the answer may have to do with geography. The index shows that consumption is actually up in states far from the coasts, like Arizona, Minnesota, Colorado and Michigan. But the main answer lies in the same price shift that made the crack trade less violent. The price has fallen about 75 percent from its peak, which has led to an interesting consumption pattern: there are far fewer users, but they are each smoking more crack. This, too, makes perfect economic sense. If you are a devoted crackhead and the price is one-fourth what it used to be, you can afford to smoke four times as much.
 But as crack has matured into a drug that causes less social harm, the laws punishing its sale have stayed the same. In 1986, in the national frenzy that followed the death of Len Bias, a first-round N.B.A. draft pick and a cocaine user, Congress passed legislation requiring a five-year mandatory sentence for selling just five grams of crack; you would have to sell 500 grams of powder cocaine to get an equivalent sentence. This disparity has often been called racist, since it disproportionately imprisons blacks. 
 In fact, the law probably made sense at the time, when a gram of crack did have far more devastating social costs than a gram of powder cocaine. But it doesn't anymore. Len Bias would now be 40 years old, and he would have long outlived his usefulness to the Boston Celtics. It may be time to acknowledge that the law inspired by his death has done the same.

HEADLINE: He's Only Just Begun

BYLINE: By Desmond Ryan. 
Desmond Ryan is the executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island.

DATELINE: Hauppauge 

 BODY:
DESPITE the typical cynical comments about lame ducks, few people are as powerful as an elected official who has announced he won't run for re-election, especially when he still has about 17 months left in office. And few in New York hold the reins to more power than Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 Unlike previous governors who viewed Long Island as an alien and often hostile environment, Governor Pataki has been no stranger to the region. He has traveled here often to sign land preservation and energy bills. He has come to honor the nation's veterans and help us bury our dead after Sept. 11. He has buttonholed our business leaders and shaken hands with environmentalists. He put hundreds of millions of dollars into the region's transportation network, created seven parks on Long Island and made the rehabilitation of state parks like Jones Beach a priority. 
But there's still much that Governor Pataki can and should do. In the wake of his announcement that he won't seek a fourth term, Long Islanders will find that the state's political environment will undergo a sea change. Expect to see the governor aggressively pursue major components of his agenda as he seeks to reaffirm his legacy. As a result, Albany alliances will shift, shatter and re-form as special-interest groups, lobbyists and legislators react to a change in tempo. Against this transformation, however, expect some very basic Pataki ground rules to remain in effect.
 I predict that the governor will continue to push for the acquisition of land for preservation. Going back to his conservative roots, he will seek additional tax cuts to encourage business growth. Mr. Pataki will insist on an expansion of criminal justice programs that sustain the state's reduction in crime, and he will push state legislative leaders far more aggressively to pass a budget on time a second year in a row. 
 On Long Island, the future of energy will occupy much of the governor's attention. He is a staunch supporter of bulking up our energy capacity, so expect him to redouble efforts to create wind power turbines off the South Shore while seeing additional energy access through the Long Island Sound cable that connects the region to New England's power grid. Similarly, he will aim for significant progress in connecting Long Island to electrical power through the Neptune project, a submarine cable from New Jersey. 
 The Roslyn school scandal shocked Governor Pataki, and his administration will most likely create new standards for oversight, auditing and financial control that will reach into every school district across the state and have an impact on every school taxpayer. 
 There are, however, a number of other far more complex Long Island issues that the governor may seek to wrestle with before he departs. He should ask whether the Long Island Power Authority is the last word on how the region wants to manage its electricity, or does the authority require a new or altered structure. Our tax assessment structure remains so tortured and so dysfunctional, do we need state legislation to untangle the mess? And given the potential for huge deficits in Nassau County's budget, does he keep in place the state's financial watchdog, which overseas Nassau's finances, to hedge the bets of taxpayers and Wall Street? 
 He also has to ask how much money the State University at Stony Brook will try to squeeze out of New York in its effort to acquire not only Long Island University's real estate in Southampton but the far more expensive tract of neighboring land owned by Gyrodyne, an industrial and commercial leasing company. For a fiscally conservative governor, the combined price tag may be too much. 
 Other issues will come far closer to the political marrow of Long Island Republicans. Does the governor invest political capital in the gubernatorial hopes of State Senator Michael Balboni, an East Williston Republican who has assumed a statewide platform with his role as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs? What of promoting potential lieutenant governor candidates, like State Senator John Flanagan of Smithtown? And how would Long Island, with its reservoir of Republican and moderate nonaligned voters, act as a strategic asset for a possible presidential primary campaign that would take Mr. Pataki to Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond? 
 Regardless of how presidential primary politics are decided and of what programs this governor undertakes during the next year and a half, George Pataki created a strong Long Island presence and established strategically important public policies that the next governor will need to match if he expects to make equally crucial inroads into this politically potent region.

HEADLINE: A Pioneer of the Big Box Builds a Tank for Some Very Big Fish

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
Every billionaire needs a hobby. And every city, it has come to seem, needs an aquarium. 
 How convenient, then, that Bernard Marcus, who opened the first Home Depot store here in 1978, has spent the past few years designing, building and obsessing over the details of a $200 million aquarium that he hopes will be the world's most impressive fish tank.
As Mr. Marcus, 76, said in a recent interview at the offices of the Marcus Foundation, ''I love big fish, O.K.?'' 
 The Georgia Aquarium, as it will be called, is scheduled to open in November. It will have five million gallons of water and more than 100,000 fish. It will have giant groupers, octopuses and two white beluga whales. The star attraction will be two whale sharks, the world's biggest fish, which can exceed 40 feet in length and, Mr. Marcus said, will be on display for the first time outside of Asia. The aquarium will even have a celebrity caterer, Wolfgang Puck.
 The hopes pinned on the project are correspondingly outsized. The aquarium is, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said, the city's biggest economic opportunity since the 1996 Olympics. It is expected to revitalize downtown and to bring Atlanta the tourism business it believes it deserves. Mr. Marcus says he conservatively estimates the economic impact at $1 billion over five years.
 The aquarium will be so great, it seems that fish may prefer it to the ocean. ''This is like going to the Ritz-Carlton,'' Mr. Marcus said. ''If you ask them do they want to go back to the ocean, you know what they would say: 'Are you crazy?'''
 Aquariums have done so well for other cities that they have become a municipal status symbol -- one that Atlanta is somewhat late to acquire. Of the 36 aquariums in the United States accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, nearly half have opened in the past 15 years, including those in Las Vegas, Dallas and Chattanooga, Tenn.
 But few have had the advantage offered by Mr. Marcus: an aquarium built entirely with private money, opening with no debt. After a year, Mr. Marcus said, it will be turned over to a nonprofit organization. Presumably he will still be allowed to feed buckets of krill to the adolescent whale sharks, Ralph and Norton, who are now 13 and 16 feet long. 
 Few people have criticized the gift, but there have been some complaints related to Mr. Marcus's control of the project. The parking garage is architecturally insensitive to the streetscape, some have said, or Mr. Marcus is too secretive, or too demanding of the city.
 But if the world can be divided between visionaries and consensus-makers, Mr. Marcus is clearly in the first camp. ''It's my money, I guess I can do whatever I want,'' he said. ''I don't care what they say.'' 
 For the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau, the hope is that the aquarium, whose profile rises like a cruise ship's prow across the street from Centennial Olympic Park, will make Atlanta a place where conventiongoers will want to stay an extra day or invite their family to join them. It is near the convention center, CNN headquarters and the Children's Museum. In 2007, Coca-Cola will open its new World of Coca-Cola museum nearby as well.
 ''All the pieces are starting to come together,'' said Lauren Kenworthy, a spokeswoman for the bureau. But the bureau has not been able to come up with its own economic projections, she said, because the aquarium has been so secretive.
 The cone of silence around the aquarium has led to a cat-and-mouse game between Mr. Marcus and local reporters. Journalists have filed open records requests and scoured the Federal Register for clues to his intentions, documenting even his choice of paint brands. 
 The arrival of the whale sharks, who traveled from Taiwan in a UPS plane with special life-support systems, was supposed to happen under wraps, but the story got out when the Taiwanese called a news conference. 
 All of which has tickled Mr. Marcus, who has extracted confidentiality agreements from practically every vendor or V.I.P. who knows anything about the project. 
 Mr. Marcus, who also gives money to medical research, the Republican Party and a school he started for autistic children, originally came to Atlanta because the huge commercial spaces he needed to start Home Depot were readily available. 
 Like Ted Turner, another Atlanta mogul, Mr. Marcus has both a strong will and an attachment to the city. He considered, and rejected, many philanthropic gestures, including a symphony hall and a museum.
 ''I would say, 'Well that would be great, but only 10 percent of the people would want to do that,''' he said. Eventually, he realized that whenever he had extra time in a city, he was drawn to the aquarium.
 Soon, he assembled a team of experts to travel the world, visiting major aquariums and asking the directors what they would do if they had no budgetary constraints. 
 Mr. Marcus had no particular fascination with marine life before this project, he said, but has since developed an acute awareness of the fragility of the oceans. ''I haven't had a Chilean sea bass I guess for a year,'' he said. ''I don't eat it because I know it's endangered.''
 Mr. Marcus has bought firmly into the belief in the aquarium world that sea creatures on display inspire public commitment to conservation. The aquarium, he said, will have the largest research facilities in the aquarium world, with operating rooms and breeding tanks, and will provide the first opportunity for scientists to study whale sharks at close range. 
 But not everyone is as enthusiastic. Marie Levine, executive director of the Shark Research Institute in Princeton, N.J., has criticized his acquisition of the whale sharks, saying they often die in captivity. ''When you're dealing with an endangered animal,'' Ms. Levine said, ''I think it's better to do like an Imax production, that sort of thing.'' 
 Last week, Mr. Marcus gave reporters their first peek inside the aquarium, ushering them through an entrance that led to the ballroom.
 After he introduced Mr. Puck, donned a chef's jacket and served some appetizers, ''Octopus's Garden'' began to play. A white curtain blocking a window the size of a movie screen fell away, and there was Ralph -- or was it Norton? -- front and center, his back dappled in a pattern that looked like sunlight through trees. Around him swam grunts and damselfish, a single hammerhead shark and a couple of sawfish.
 But Mr. Marcus had eyes only for the whale shark. He stood transfixed, his back to his audience. ''Look at the size of him,'' he said. And then, ''Look at the size of that guy.''

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the rate of family violence in this country has dropped by more than half since 1993. I've been trying to figure out why.
 A lot of the credit has to go to the people who have been quietly working in this field: to social workers who provide victims with counseling and support; to women's crisis centers, which help women trapped in violent relationships find other places to live; to police forces and prosecutors, who are arresting more spouse-beaters and putting them away.
 The Violence Against Women Act, which was passed in 1994, must have also played a role, focusing federal money and attention. 
 But all of these efforts are part of a larger story. The decline in family violence is part of a whole web of positive, mutually reinforcing social trends. To put it in old-fashioned terms, America is becoming more virtuous. Americans today hurt each other less than they did 13 years ago. They are more likely to resist selfish and shortsighted impulses. They are leading more responsible, more organized lives. A result is an improvement in social order across a range of behaviors.
 The decline in domestic violence is of a piece with the decline in violent crime over all. Violent crime over all is down by 55 percent since 1993 and violence by teenagers has dropped an astonishing 71 percent, according to the Department of Justice. 
 The number of drunken driving fatalities has declined by 38 percent since 1982, according to the Department of Transportation, even though the number of vehicle miles traveled is up 81 percent. The total consumption of hard liquor by Americans over that time has declined by over 30 percent.
 Teenage pregnancy has declined by 28 percent since its peak in 1990. Teenage births are down significantly and, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions performed in the country has also been declining since the early 1990's. 
 Fewer children are living in poverty, even allowing for an uptick during the last recession. There's even evidence that divorce rates are declining, albeit at a much more gradual pace. People with college degrees are seeing a sharp decline in divorce, especially if they were born after 1955. 
 I could go on. Teenage suicide is down. Elementary school test scores are rising (a sign than more kids are living in homes conducive to learning). Teenagers are losing their virginity later in life and having fewer sex partners. In short, many of the indicators of social breakdown, which shot upward in the late 1960's and 1970's, and which plateaued at high levels in the 1980's, have been declining since the early 1990's. 
 I always thought it would be dramatic to live through a moral revival. Great leaders would emerge. There would be important books, speeches, marches and crusades. We're in the middle of a moral revival now, and there has been very little of that. This revival has been a bottom-up, prosaic, un-self-conscious one, led by normal parents, normal neighbors and normal community activists.
 The first thing that has happened is that people have stopped believing in stupid ideas: that the traditional family is obsolete, that drugs are liberating, that it is every adolescent's social duty to be a rebel. 
 The second thing that has happened is that many Americans have become better parents. Time diary studies reveal that parents now spend more time actively engaged with kids, even though both parents are more likely to work outside the home.
 Third, many people in the younger generation, under age 30 or so, are reacting against the culture of divorce. They are trying to lead lives that are more stable than the ones their parents led. Post-boomers behave better than the baby boomers did. 
 Fourth, over the past few decades, neighborhood and charitable groups have emerged to help people lead more organized lives, even in the absence of cohesive families.
 Obviously, we're not living in a utopia, where all social problems have been solved. But these improvements across a whole range of behaviors are too significant to be dismissed. We in the media play up the negative, as we always do. The activist groups emphasize the work still to be done, because they want to keep people mobilized and financing their work. 
 But the good news is out there. You want to know what a society looks like when it is in the middle of moral self-repair? Look around.

HEADLINE: The Boom Spreads: This House Is Valued at 

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
FOR years, Maria N. Rodriquez has been hoping her parents would sell their home in East New York, Brooklyn, and move someplace safer and more appealing. 
 Ms. Rodriguez, a 33-year-old mortgage consultant, remembers her anxious teenage years walking down desolate streets in a neighborhood that was one of the most run-down and crime-plagued communities in New York City.
But now, Ms. Rodriguez wonders whether her parents were right to stay in the two-family attached brick house on Montauk Avenue -- a mile west of the Brooklyn-Queens border -- that they bought with an uncle for $62,000 in 1987. 
 East New York has changed, especially in the last five years. Last year, her parents' home was assessed at $350,000, a breathtakingly high number for those who think of the neighborhood as a symbol of urban decay. 
 Although the crime rate is still higher than in some neighborhoods in the city, it is way down. ''For years I pleaded with them to move to a better neighborhood for safety reasons, and because I was embarrassed,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, who now lives in a small ranch-style house in Island Park, on Long Island. ''I made friends who lived elsewhere and they'd heard about East New York and would not come visit.'' 
 When she would push for a move, her parents -- Domingo, 62, and Milagros, 53 -- ''would always say yes,'' Ms. Rodriguez said, ''but that would be the end of the conversation.'' Perhaps, somehow, they knew something better was coming.
 Only a decade ago, the community was pockmarked by ''vacant lots, burned-out homes on every block,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''Now they're putting homes into every nook and cranny.''
 The numbers support her perception. From 1995 through the first half of this year, according to the New York City Department of Finance, the average price for a two-family home in East New York nearly tripled, to $351,561 from $122,524.
 Investment by homeowners in the neighborhood also grew significantly. Home-purchase loans worth $279 million were originated in East New York in 2002, up from $66 million six years earlier, according to statistics compiled under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 
 Construction is also booming. From 1994 to 2004, certificates of occupancy for 3,776 new housing units were issued, according to the Department of City Planning. 
 ''That is more than for any community district in the city outside of Manhattan or Staten Island,'' said Ingrid Gould Ellen, deputy director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. ''The data show continued and growing investment in East New York.''
 Much of East New York's revival has been spurred by city programs under which the Department of Housing Preservation and Development subsidized nonprofit groups in the construction of large swaths of neatly attractive attached houses for low- and moderate-income home buyers or renters, or the rehabilitation of dilapidated buildings scattered on block after block throughout the community.
 But in the last five years -- prompted, perhaps, by those new pastel-shaded row houses and rehabbed homes, and certainly by low interest rates -- developers have snapped up hundreds of vacant lots and abandoned buildings to create market-rate housing, and buyers have been willing to pay the rising prices.
 ''A decade or two ago, the market was not strong enough for new market-rate development to work in East New York; today it does,'' said Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner. ''And with low interest rates, you see lots of market-rate construction that is affordable to people making roughly an average income for New York City.''
 The median income for a family of four in the metropolitan area is $62,800. In East New York, Mr. Donovan said, families with that income can afford a two- or three-family house. ''And with the rent from the other units, it's a very affordable way to live,'' he said. 
 Gerard Longo has watched the prices rise. ''There's been an increase in value in the area of 10 to 15 percent just over the last calendar year,'' said Mr. Longo, who, as president of Madison Estates and Properties in nearby Marine Park, has closed about 60 sales in East New York so far this year. 
 For example, a semiattached two-family home on Bergen Street -- a two-bedroom over a three-bedroom with a basement -- recently sold for $335,000, Mr. Longo said. ''That property would have been, a year ago, $290,000 to $300,000,'' he said, ''and five years ago it would have been about $170,000.''
 A one-family attached brick home on Mother Gaston Boulevard, with three bedrooms, a dining room and two baths, ''was recently up for sale for $270,000, and sold within two weeks for $260,000,'' Mr. Longo said. ''Five years ago, it would have been $140,000, $150,000.''
 Plummeting crime rates have certainly contributed to the increasing home values. In 1993, East New York's 75th Precinct set the city's all-time record of 126 murders; last year, there were 29. In 1993, there were 10,355 serious crimes (murders, rapes, robberies, felony assaults, burglaries, grand larcenies and auto thefts) in the precinct; last year, there were 3,920 -- a 62 percent decline. ''People can see and feel the tangible application of police resources,'' said Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman.
 Not that the 5.6-square-mile community has evolved into a pristine haven. There are still ramshackle buildings with boarded-up windows, vacant lots, razor-wire coils on fences, junkyards harboring piggy-backed car hulks. 
 But there is also now, on many blocks, fresh paint on house after house, front yards with flowers blooming, wrought-iron gates bearing ornamental sculptures. And just as there always were, even during the roughest days, some tree-lined streets shade stately old, even ornate, single-family homes. Around Arlington Avenue and Warwick Street, in the northern section of the community, there are century-old restored homes. The highest price for an East New York home in the last year, Mr. Longo said after checking the South Shore Multiple Listing Service, was $420,000, paid in April for a 1901 attached three-bedroom on Miller Avenue with bay windows and an arched entrance. 
 The community's prime commercial strip -- Pennsylvania Avenue, from Linden Boulevard to Flatlands Avenue, with the 42-building, 6,000-unit Spring Creek Towers middle-income residential complex looming to its south -- is now dotted with chain stores. Just east of the towers, on what had been a municipal landfill, the 640,000-square-foot Gateway Mall opened in 2002, employing about 1,500 people. And adjoining the mall, construction is to start next spring on Gateway Estates -- 2,300 housing units in single-, two- and three-family homes, with 844 units set aside as city-subsidized housing.
 And yet, for Maria Rodriguez, as she continues to weigh whether her parents should move out of their modest home, it is hard to disregard the bad old days. ''This was a rough block,'' she said of Montauk Avenue, between Pitkin and Belmont Avenues. ''My mother and father very rarely allowed us out, day or night. There were drug sales 24 hours a day on the block, around the block. There was gunfire. Not every night, every third night; not that that's much better.'' 
 Ms. Rodriguez concedes that much has changed. ''It seems like a different world,'' she said. ''The home facades are being redone, people taking pride. It's quieter, cleaner. On Pitkin, I notice the number of new businesses; the awnings are a lot nicer.''
 Purely from a housing point of view, Domingo and Milagros Rodriguez have just about seen it all in East New York since they arrived, separately, from the Dominican Republic in 1967.
 They met in East New York, while both were living doubled-up with relatives. After they married in 1970, they moved into a tiny one-bedroom -- with a bathtub in the kitchen -- on Atkins Avenue, one block from the home they now own. The rent was $80 a month. Within four years, three children had arrived; and in that tiny bedroom, Mr. Rodriguez, a carpenter, built a triple-decker bed. The Atkins Avenue building has since been razed, along with all the others on and around the block, to make way for 42 city-subsidized single-family affordable houses developed by the nonprofit Nehemiah Homes Development Fund.
 In 1974, the Rodriguez family moved six blocks to the northwest into a three-story, yellow-brick walk-up on Glenmore Street where they blissfully spread out into a four-bedroom railroad flat. Over their 13-year tenancy there, their rent ranged from $200 to $500 a month. 
 Several weeks ago, Maria Rodriguez walked by the Glenmore Street building and, in a hint of the community's persisting difficulties, encountered a woman living there with her young daughter and two nieces. The woman said she had not paid rent for months since the landlord had abandoned the building, which has had no hot water or heat since last winter.
 By stark contrast that same day, half a block from the Rodriguez's Montauk Avenue home, at the corner of Belmont Avenue, power saws were whining and hammers thudding as workers added the final trim on five new attached three-family, tan-brick homes with high-pitched roofs -- all for rent.
 The 15 homes --12 three-bedrooms and 3 two-bedrooms, all with balconies, air-conditioning, wall-to-wall carpeting and wiring for cable -- are renting for $1,300 to $1,600 a month. They were developed by Vishnu Bandhu, owner of the Guy America Development Enterprises Corporation. And they are among the dozens of small market-rate projects that now dot so many blocks in the community. Mr. Bandhu alone has built 27 homes for rent or sale in East New York over the last five years. ''I consider myself one of the starters here,'' he said.
 Five years ago, a vacant 25-by-100-foot lot cost $35,000, Mr. Bandhu said. ''Today, the same lot sells for $160,000; I just closed one,'' he said. ''Five years ago, I sold a two-family for about $325,000; now the same house might sell for about $450,000.''
 East New York has become a personal matter for Mr. Bandhu. Four years ago, he and his wife and daughter moved from Astoria, Queens, into a home at the corner of Pitkin and Shepherd Avenues. ''I built it myself; it has everything I want: a Jacuzzi, central air,'' he said. ''My wife never wanted to come here because she was so scared -- the East New York bad reputation. Now we feel like home because the people around here are very friendly. They say good morning on the sidewalk, laugh and talk with you.''
 Mr. Bandhu's home is four blocks from the Rodriguez home. There, seated with her parents on their balcony, Maria Rodriguez said she remained conflicted. ''Should I have them move, stay put?'' she said. ''They say, 'Let's stay, this is my home, this is what I know.' They may be right right now, because whatever they sell this home for, whatever amount they get for it, will probably not be enough to move into another neighborhood because of the overpriced market. So, I give up.''
 Mr. Rodriguez said: ''It's much better here now, new houses all over the place. People that left want to come back.'' 
 He smiled at his daughter. ''Sometimes she knows more than me,'' he said, then winked.

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
IF the information is not already missing, 2005 might be recorded in the databanks of history as the year of the consumer privacy breach. 
 So far, American companies including financial services giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and MasterCard, and national retailers like DSW shoes and Ralph Lauren Polo, have announced data compromises. All told, the personal information of more than 50 million consumers has been lost, stolen and even sold to thieves.
Why is this happening here, and not, say, in Britain, Germany or France? One reason may be that every other Western country has a comprehensive set of national privacy laws and an office of data protection, led by a privacy commissioner. 
 The United States, by contrast, has a patchwork of state and federal laws and agencies responsible for data protection. 
 ''In Europe, the question has been settled: citizens have strong legal rights,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, a Fordham University law professor who is an expert on international data privacy rules. ''In the United States, we basically have a mess, and we are still trying to sort it out.'' 
 More fundamentally, these two systems for dealing with data arise from a cultural divide over privacy itself. In broad terms, the United States looks at privacy largely as a consumer and an economic issue; in the rest of the developed world, it is regarded as a fundamental right. 
 In the United States, said Trevor Hughes, executive director of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, debates over the privacy of personal data generally occurs piecemeal, when a particular abuse causes harm. ''In Europe, '' Mr. Hughes said. ''data is just protected because it is data -- information about you.'' 
 The telecommunications industry offers a case study in these two perspectives. In the mid-1990's, an unusual alliance here between privacy advocates and national phone companies, which did not want regional carriers to gain an informational advantage, led to restrictions on the commercial use of phone and billing information in the United States. In France, a similar debate in the 1980's caused phone numbers to be kept private in billing documents out of respect for individual rights.
 In general, Americans are far more comfortable than Europeans with business handling their information, and far more skeptical of putting it in government hands. The tradition of making government records -- like tax records, mortgage information and census data -- easily accessible to the public is uniquely American.
 This has helped create the world's largest data collection industry by far, with companies like ChoicePoint and AxiCom to collect and analyze those records. The flourishing consumer data industry spends millions of dollars each year lobbying against more restrictive data policies.
 Not surprising, the United States has ''many more laws restricting the government collection and use of information than laws restricting corporate use of collection and information,'' said Bruce Schneier, an expert on computer security issues. ''Europe is the reverse,'' he added. Oversight is the United States is decentralized. Data protection is not a core mission of any government agency. Each of them, from the Health and Human Services Department to the Department of Homeland Security, deals with it as a secondary issue. In addition, each agency has its own internal privacy czars, who protect his agency's data as he thinks best. ''What we don't have is a general framework that says these rules apply to everybody,'' said Peter Swire, an Ohio State University law professor who served as the Clinton administration's chief counselor for privacy. 
 Most European nations, on the other hand, begin with the idea that data protection is a human right, regulated by a comprehensive set of principles that apply to both business and government. And where American businesses are given relatively free rein to collect and sell information, European companies are severely restricted from those activities without individual consent. 
 ''In Europe, there is much less use data warehousing and data mining because the culture has not been friendly to it,'' said Alan F. Westin, the director of Privacy Exchange, an advocacy group sponsored by the consumer data industry. ''No company in France, Germany or the U.K. has that kind of data-mining capability because they don't have the public record and census data'' that American companies have.
 Restrictions on the commercial use of private data has also meant that data-mining interest groups never became entrenched in Europe.
 This, too, has philosophical and historical roots. European data protection policies emerged in the early 1970's, when the German state of Hesse enacted the first set of data privacy laws. 
 ''This was still a generation with memory of World War II that knew how Nazis and fascists would use personal information against their enemies,'' said Evan Hendricks, the editor of Privacy Times, an advocacy newsletter. ''If you were going to protect liberty, you had to ensure there was fairness in the protection of information.'' 
 Privacy protection was also strengthened by the push for European integration. The European Data Protection Directive of 1995 established a framework for national privacy laws in all E.U. countries, and encouraged nearby trading partners to adopt similar measures. 
 The effect on daily life in the United States and Europe can be seen at the checkout counter. Germany, like most other European countries, restricts retailers to collecting only the personal data directly linked to a sale: ZIP codes and phone numbers cannot be requested during a cash sale, and billing information can be kept only as long as there is a purpose.
 Other countries have even more stringent laws. Switzerland, for example, requires every employee who handles sensitive data like credit information to ''sign a very draconian document,'' Ted Crooks, vice president of global fraud solutions for Fair Isaac, a data analytics company, said of data protection laws in that country. ''You don't mess with Swiss data,'' he said. 
 Most American companies, in contrast, store all sorts of customer information, and often make money selling some of it to others. ''American businesses have learned by experience to hang on to the data,'' Mr. Crooks said. ''It's cheap to keep, and maybe you will get some benefit out of it.'' 
 Then, too, most Americans are more willing than Europeans to give up personal information. 
 ''If you ask someone from another country, they will resist,'' said Chris Hoofnagle, a director at Electronic Privacy Information Center, a data protection advocacy group. ''Ask a French person their phone number, and they will ask you why. Americans don't ask why at all.''
 Of course, in Europe, though the laws and the public sentiment against collecting sensitive consumer data may be more rigorous than in the United States, there is less ability to enforce those laws, or to punish corporate wrongdoers through public exposure. Regulators will sometimes quietly discipline a company for being too free with private data, but in general European corporations need not disclose nearly so much about their activities as American ones, and class-action lawsuits and corporate fines are rare. 
 ''We don't know how often or how serious any breach of the E.U. directive actually has been because there is no need to disclose,'' said John Holland, an executive in charge of Europe and the Middle East regions for Cybertrust, a global security firm. 
 One thing that both privacy cultures have in common is that it is becoming harder for either to control what is and isn't kept private. Information is increasingly the lifeblood of the global economy, not to mention the global fight against terrorism and the quarry of hackers. 
 As this year's data breaches and compromises have shown, no one really knows how safe the world's vast pool of confidential data is, and therefore how protected anyone is against an invasion of data privacy. 
 Mr. Reidenberg, the law professor, compares the current situation to the stock market meltdown after the 1929 crash. America responded then by creating the Securities and Exchange Commission and a host of financial disclosure and accounting reforms. The need to safeguard sensitive data, Mr. Reidenberg said, ''will necessitate the United States focusing on the legal way we structure information processing, just like we needed to do in the 1930's to put the economy back on stable footing.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat as Oil Prices Climb

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market retreated modestly for the week, although the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached a four-year high on Wednesday before giving back ground.
 Rising oil prices -- crude oil closed at $62.31 a barrel in New York on Friday -- contributed to a stock market sell-off on Thursday and Friday. Also on Friday, the government issued a report indicating that employment was growing briskly. It suggested to many investors that the economy was humming along -- and that the Federal Reserve would therefore be raising short-term interest rates for months in an effort to head off inflation. 
For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,558.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.76 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,226.42. The Nasdaq composite index gave up 6.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,177.93. 
 In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.39 percent on Friday from 4.28 percent the previous week. The government announced Wednesday that in February, it would resume sales of the 30-year Treasury bond for the first time since 2001. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Finding Bargains (and Headaches) at Foreclosure Sales 

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
IF rising interest rates cause more people to default on their adjustable-rate mortgages, investors could face a potential boon. Buying distressed properties -- those that are in foreclosure or have a foreclosure pending -- is one of the few opportunities to snag a bargain in this overheated real estate market. But it is not easy, and it entails considerable risk, especially if a property is bought at an auction. And buyers may find that if they have not done their homework, or lack ready cash and an ability to reason with a distraught homeowner, they don't have a prayer of making a profit and could end up in debt themselves. 
 ''Buying a foreclosure is not a simple transaction,'' said Alexis McGee, president of Foreclosures.com, which provides information and training on how to buy distressed properties. ''It takes a lot of time and effort.'' But the rewards can be great, with the most successful investors getting 30 to 40 percent return on their money. 
If you are interested in such properties, the first hurdle is finding them. Defaulting on a mortgage is a matter of public record, so your city or county will have lists including the names of people in arrears, the lenders and the properties' addresses. Sometimes that information is available online, but you often have to go to the courthouse and search a computer database or read posted printouts. Or you could pay $30 to $40 to have the list e-mailed to you by outfits like Foreclosures.com, All-foreclosure.com and Foreclosureworld.net.
 The next step is to drive by the property to check on things like structural integrity and whether, for example, there is a toxic waste dump in the area. If the property passes curbside inspection, you will probably want to pay $300 to $400 for a full title search to find out if there are additional liens, or financial claims, against the property. Buying a distressed property at a steep discount is no bargain if multiple mortgages and years of unpaid property taxes are attached to the title. If that search finds no problems, you can wait to see if the lender actually forecloses and try to buy when the property is auctioned at the courthouse. Announcements of auctions are usually printed in local newspapers; the starting bid is typically only what the lender needs to cover its costs. ''Depending on competition from other bidders, you can generally buy properties at public auctions for 25 to 35 percent below market value,'' said Todd Beitler, founder and president of Real Estate Information Services, a publishing company in Boca Raton, Fla., that provides real estate information to home buyers and investors. 
 But many investors prefer to make offers to property owners before foreclosure. ''A lot of times they'll slam the door in your face,'' said Michael Ballard of Edmonds, Wash., who started buying distressed residential properties a year ago, after selling his interest in an electronics business. ''But sometimes you can convince them that you can help them walk away less scathed than if the bank forecloses on them.'' 
 Mr. Ballard said he preferred to work with debtors because he did not like the confusion and competition associated with a public auction -- and because he could inspect the property. That was the case a year ago when Mr. Ballard agreed to assume the $312,000 mortgage of a struggling entrepreneur who was facing foreclosure on his home, which was appraised at $360,000. Mr. Ballard allowed the man to remain in the house for $1,600 a month, with the understanding that the payments would go toward buying it back for $390,000 within two years. Otherwise, Mr. Ballard said, he would sell the house. Now, a year later, it is appraised at $425,000. 
 Properties bought at auction, however, are proverbial pigs in a poke: there is no opportunity even to peek inside before buying, much less get an appraisal. And once you buy the property, you're stuck with it. Forget about warranties or refunds. 
 Furthermore, buyers at auction often have to pay immediately. In Palm Beach County, Fla., for example, winning bidders must pay the full amount in cash or by cashier's check before 3 p.m. on the day of the auction, and they have the responsibility of evicting the occupant of the property. 
 Mr. Ballard said that when he bought properties facing foreclosure, he usually paid the owners a mutually-agreed-upon amount of ''walking money,'' typically a small portion of their equity. The owners would then sign over the deed, with Mr. Ballard either assuming their mortgage or, more often, refinancing the debt. ''If you're going to flip the property quickly, it doesn't make sense to pay the refinance fees,'' he said. But buyers holding on to a property for at least a year before selling would save 20 percent on their taxes when they sold because the asset would qualify as a long-term capital gain. 
 Mr. Ballard said he generally waited to sell to reduce his tax liability. In the meantime, he said, he leases the house, sometimes to the previous owner, to generate positive cash flow. 
 But Grace Doctolero of San Rafael, Calif., who was an account manager for a telecom company before she quit last year to invest in distressed properties, said, ''I buy them, rehab them and sell them as soon as I can,'' usually within three to four months. She has flipped five single-family homes so far, for an average 20 percent return on her investment. 
 Most people who buy distressed properties repair them before reselling. ''It helps in this business to know a good contractor,'' Mr. Ballard said, adding that updating just the kitchen and bathrooms increases resale value by 10 to 15 percent. His total return on investment on a typical house is 15 to 20 percent. 
 The safest but potentially least profitable way to acquire foreclosed properties is from the lender. Called R.E.O.'s -- for real estate owned -- these properties usually end up in a bank's possession after they did not fetch desired prices at auction. ''Since they are nonperforming assets, banks generally want to get them off their books as quickly as possible,'' said Mr. Beitler of Real Estate Information Services.
 Buying from the lender ensures that you get clear title, and you do not have to evict anyone. But the 5 to 10 percent discount is far less than you would be likely to get by buying before foreclosure or at auction. R.E.O.'s are generally sold through regular real estate agents, but Mr. Beitler said a potential buyer could also try to contact asset managers at banks to find out what they have in their portfolios. ''Sometimes they'll deal with you directly,'' he said, ''and sometimes they won't.'' 
 Regardless of when during the foreclosure process you buy a property, Mr. Ballard said, ''there's money to be made.'' But, he cautioned, ''There's also money to be lost if you aren't aware of all the movingparts.''

QUICK READ
Prospective buyers can jump in at various stages in the foreclosure process:

PRE-FORECLOSURE
At this stage, the property owner is in arrears and the lender is threatening foreclosure. For investors, there is medium risk and medium reward. This may be the most difficult time to buy, because a mutually agreeable deal has to be struck with a distraught and often resistant property owner.

FORECLOSURE AUCTION
After a property has been seized by the lender, a public auction is held. Investors often get their best deals at auction, but they are also at highest risk: Bidders cannot see the interior of the property before purchase, for example, and the winner must usually pay the full amount in cash or by cashier's check on auction day. There are no warranties or refunds, and the winning bidder may have to evict the person who lost the title.

LENDER LISTING
At this stage, the property is known as an R.E.O., for ''real estate owned.'' The lender puts it up for sale usually because it did not receive an acceptable bid at the auction. Investors are at least risk at this point, but they can also expect a smaller discount on the price. Still, they are assured of a clear title and often buy through a real estate agent, so they can tour the property in advance.

PERSON: George Forman 

HEADLINE: George Forman, 88, Dies; A.C.L.U. Leader

BYLINE: By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
George Forman, a longtime comptroller of the American Civil Liberties Union who brought fiscal discipline to a ramshackle organization near bankruptcy in the late 1970's and later helped it develop into a powerful civil liberties conglomerate, died on Monday at the home of his daughter, Judy Jamieson, in Chatham, Mass. He was 88.
 The cause was congestive heart failure, Ms. Jamieson said. 
''During the years of crisis he was more responsible than any other single person for keeping the program afloat,'' said Ira Glazer, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. from 1978 to 2001.
 He explained how Mr. Forman juggled the bills and even earned interest on a deficit operational budget, and recalled visits from officials of Chemical Bank who complained that although the organization was moving around millions of dollars, its average balance was $3.79.
 ''He was the chewing gum and rubber bands that held the organization together and made the high intellectual and strategic law possible,'' Mr. Glazer said.
 When Mr. Forman arrived at the A.C.L.U. in 1968, the organization had two lawyers, one part-time press person and no one in charge of administration and finances, fund-raising or development. By the time he retired in the late 1990's, the organization had a $50 million annual income, more than $100 million in assets and staffed offices in every state.
 Before joining the A.C.L.U., Mr. Forman was the comptroller of the Noma Corporation, a large, diversified holding company; he became unemployed when Noma merged with a predecessor of Gulf and Western.
 George Forman was born in Manhattan on Feb. 15, 1917. He lived alone in his parents' apartment in the Bronx, where he had cared for them until they died. 
 During World War II, he was an Army officer stationed in Washington, where he fell in love with a woman with whom he had his only daughter but felt he could not marry because she was not Jewish. 
 He graduated magna cum laude from New York University in 1939 and earned a graduate degree in business administration there. 
 Besides his daughter, he is survived by a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Keeping Dostoyevsky Safe From The Surf

BYLINE: By BRENDAN I. KOERNER

 BODY:
ASK book publishers to list their idols, and you'll most likely find the names of Alfred A. Knopf or the Random House founder Bennett Cerf. But Charles Melcher, president of Melcher Media in Manhattan, would rather pattern his career after that of a man without literary credentials: Ruben Rausing, the Swedish founder of the packaging company Tetra Pak.
 Mr. Melcher's admiration stems from Tetra Pak's patenting of several paperboard cartons that changed the way that milk and orange juice are sold. Mr. Melcher has similarly grand plans for his own invention, a package for words rather than beverages: the waterproof DuraBook. 
''I want to roll out a licensing program, so that any publisher or company that wants to publish a DuraBook would be able to do so,'' said Mr. Melcher, who founded his publishing company in 1994. Last August, he received United States patent No.6,773,034 for the process of making waterproof books. He envisions banking ''a few pennies'' for each one sold.
 Who would buy a waterproof book? When Mr. Melcher first thought up the DuraBook eight years ago, his model customer was a middle-aged woman who liked to unwind with a hot bath. ''I thought: Why can't she take a good book into the bath with her?'' The answer, he said, was that she was afraid she would inadvertently drop her paperback, warping it beyond recognition.
 Mr. Melcher and his production designer, Andrea Hirsh, began searching for waterproof paper, eventually settling on a synthetic variant that consists of polypropylene and inorganic fillers, rather than wood fibers. Such synthetic paper was developed in the late 1960's and is known for its resiliency; it is commonly used in frozen-food trays, for example.
 The trick was figuring out how to print on the heavier paper so that the ink wouldn't smear if the paper became wet. Melcher Media eventually found an Asian supplier that had perfected a finishing technique for synthetic paper. ''They figured out a way to roll it and press it, and treat the surface,'' Mr. Melcher said. ''So it has what we call good ink holdout -- if you put a dot of ink on it, it won't spread.''
 It was also necessary to experiment with types of binding glue, which combines with thread to attach a DuraBook's pages to its spine. During the testing phase, in which books were kept submerged for days, most glues couldn't endure. ''We would find that certain glues would dissolve, and others would give off a white, milky substance,'' Mr. Melcher said. He eventually found a glue that did neither.
 The first book in the DuraBook format, a racy fiction collection called Aqua Erotica, was published in 2000, while the patent was pending. Several titles have followed; Mr. Melcher estimated that, in all, around 750,000 copies of DuraBooks have been sold. As advertised, the ink doesn't run, though pages can clump together if they are dried inadequately; for this user, giving a wet book a hard wring, plus two minutes under a blow dryer, more or less solved the issue.
 The tougher problem for Melcher Media has been the added expense of publishing DuraBooks; Mr. Melcher said the process adds 30 percent to a book's production costs, largely because the printing presses must run more slowly and the sheets require longer drying times.
 He expects economies of scale to kick in soon. The nascent licensing program, he said, ''is what's going to enable me to buy in volume and change the economic model.'' He added that his ultimate aim is to mimic the success of Tetra Pak.
 That's quite an ambitious goal. Tetra Pak, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, had net sales of $9.14 billion last year, and the Rausing family has a multibillion-dollar fortune. If licensing fees produce a few pennies a book, Mr. Melcher must hope that reading in the bathtub becomes as common as drinking orange juice in the morning.

HEADLINE: A Closing That Led to Some New Openings

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE way Phyllis Bulhack of Drossman Jewelry recalls it, ''I was very upset because I didn't want to move from the booth my father started 70 years ago.''
 Roy Raineri of N. Raineri Jewelers says he found the forced move ''traumatic'' after 40 years in the same spot. And Iris Stare of Stare Jewelry remembers, ''A lot of Valium went down the throat because we did not know what we would be doing.''
All three Lower Manhattan merchants were recently recounting the emotional blows -- and fears for the future -- that they felt two years ago when they were told that they would soon have to vacate their stalls at the Chinatown jewelry mall where they or their families had long operated their businesses. 
 The building's owners had decided to lease the two-story structure, at the corner of Canal Street and the Bowery, for a new Commerce Bank branch, and the 33 jewelry retailers were told they would have to leave by January 2004. 
 The building, in a jewelry district that runs west from the end of the Manhattan Bridge, had housed the mall -- the Paramount Diamond Exchange -- since 1935. Some of the merchants, or their parents or grandparents, had operated from its booths since the mall's earliest years, when the area was the city's biggest jewelry hub, long before the Midtown diamond district rose to dominance.
 Today, a year and a half after the merchants left the Paramount, at least half are operating in other jewelry malls down the block from their old building, including Ms. Bulhack, Mr. Raineri and Ms. Stare. How many had relocated elsewhere or had closed could not be determined.
 Interviews in recent days with some of those still operating brought accounts of revenues recovered and revenues reduced, of smaller space without lower rent, of new locations nicer than the old for some but less favorable for others, and of some camaraderie lost but some retained. And one closing was accompanied by a career change after 44 years of jewelry dealing at the Paramount. 
 Drossman, Raineri and seven other businesses found new homes down the block at 82 Bowery, where they created a small new mall that they call the Paramount Diamond Center. The leaseholder had planned to open a cosmetics shop there, but ''I convinced her to sublease to us,'' Mr. Raineri said.
 Mr. Raineri, whose father installed the family's business at the first Paramount in 1964 and who joined it in 1972, said its patronage was now at about the same level as in 2003, its last year at the former site. But the move cost him more than $100,000, he said, including the expense of new safes for his far smaller new space.
 Ms. Bulhack, whose father, Edward Drossman, began Drossman Jewelry in the original Paramount in 1937, and who now owns the business with her sister-in-law Ellen Drossman, also said that patronage was about the same as in 2003. Of her smaller space, she said, ''You make the best of what you have.''
 Ms. Stare, whose husband began operating the Stare Jewelry booth in the first Paramount in the 1970's, said her counter in the mall next door, the New York Jewelers Exchange at 72 Bowery, was four feet long, a third of what she had had. But her new surroundings are brighter and better kept, she said.
 Jean Kao, an owner of M.Y. Jewelry, is also at 72 Bowery, but only since April. For more than a year after leaving the defunct Paramount, M.Y. was in still another Bowery mall, where ''business was down about a quarter'' because the setup there diminished the number of people browsing at her stall, she said. 
 Then there is Jerry Wallace. His mother opened Ida Wallace Jewelry in the original Paramount in 1956. Mr. Wallace, now 61, began working in the business as a teenager and later ran it for years. His business is among those that closed.
 He now manages a Sleepy's mattress store in Monroe, N.Y., in Orange County, a career move he called ''something positive'' in response to the loss of his jewelry site in Manhattan. 
 But ''sometimes I still miss the Bowery,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An Anniversary to Forget

BYLINE: By Joichi Ito. 
Joichi Ito is an Internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist.

DATELINE: CHIBA, Japan 

 BODY:
WHEN people ask my thoughts on the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, I always feel uncomfortable. As a Japanese, I know how I'm supposed to respond: with sadness, regret and perhaps anger. But invariably I try to dodge the issue, or to reply as neutrally as possible. 
 That's because, at bottom, the bombings don't really matter to me or, for that matter, to most Japanese of my generation. My peers and I have little hatred or blame in our hearts for the Americans; the horrors of that war and its nuclear evils feel distant, even foreign. Instead, the bombs are simply the flashpoint marking the discontinuity that characterized the cultural world we grew up in. 
I was born in 1966, just before the student uprisings in cities across Japan and just as Tokyo and Washington were renewing the strategic alliance. The uprisings were a broad-based swing to the left and in the end were so completely obliterated by the government and the conservatives that my generation views the masked, helmet-wearing students and the whole notion of political activism as alien. The fiery beliefs of both the war and the immediate postwar era seem, in our jaded consumer-era consciousness, to be echoes of a bygone era of passionate belief.
 To my grandparents, the war was about poverty, bombings in Tokyo and anxious waiting for the end. Men were sent off, often never to return, but the war came to them, as news of distant battles in distant lands and as firebombs from the skies. The suffering during this time is well documented in television dramas and other stories, but these memories of poverty and starvation culminated in the atomic bombs, which wipe clean all images of the crazily exuberant, imperialist prewar Japan.
 I remember only two stories about the war from my family. My grandmother often spoke about the defeated voice of the emperor over the radio and how this shook the foundations of their beliefs, but signaled the end of a traumatic era. With the fall of the emperor, the Shinto religion also collapsed, since it had been co-opted from the decentralized animism of its roots into a state-sponsored war religion.
 My mother used to talk about the American occupation of our hometown in northern Japan when she was a child. Our house, the largest in the area, was designated to be the Americans' local headquarters. When the soldiers arrived, my great-grandmother, nearly blind at the time, was head of the household, my grandfather having died during the war.
 My great-grandmother and my grandmother faced the occupiers alone, having ordered the children to hide. The Japanese had been warned that the invading barbarians would rape and pillage. My great-grandmother, a battle-scarred early feminist, hissed, ''Get your filthy barbarian shoes off of my floor!'' The interpreter refused to interpret. The officer in command insisted. Upon hearing the translation from the red-faced interpreter, the officer sat on the floor and removed his boots, instructing his men to do the same. He apologized to my great-grandmother and grandmother. 
 It was a startling tipping-point experience for them, as the last bit of brainwashing that began with ''we won't lose the war'' and ended with ''the barbarians will rape and kill you'' collapsed. 
 Just one year later my uncle sailed to the United States to live in a Japanese ghetto in Chicago and work in a Y.M.C.A. Eventually his strivings led him to become the dean of the University of Detroit Business School. My mother followed my uncle, making the United States her base.
 Postwar Japan followed a similar trajectory of renewal. The economy experienced an explosion of growth from the rubble of flattened cities, led by motivated entrepreneurs and a government focused on rebuilding Japan. The United States, in its struggle to keep communism in check, became a strong supporter of Japan and opened its markets to Japanese products. The Liberal Democratic Party thrived under the protection of the United States and pushed its simple party line of ''growth, growth, growth,'' stomping out opposition, including efforts to educate Japanese about the war. No one had the opportunity to look back at the past, and by the time I can remember anything, Japan was about the bullet train, the 1970 Expo in Osaka, world-class electronics and automobiles, and even a vibrant Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
 My grandparents' generation remembers the suffering, but tries to forget it. My parents' generation still does not trust the military. The pacifist stance of that generation comes in great part from the mistrust of the Japanese military. 
 To be sure, the memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still plays a part in the imagery of popular culture. But more meaningful references to Japan's nuclear past, like those in the story of Godzilla (awakened from his slumber by American atomic tests) or the cartoonist Keiji Nakazawa's best-selling series about a Hiroshima survivor, have morphed into the cultural equivalent of elevator music. 
 Indeed, Japanese culture is unusual (although by no means unique) in its ability to take shocks or disturbances and gradually transform and neuter them. In that respect, today's atomic imagery in pop culture is not so different from the mohawked punks who apologize profusely if they bump into you in downtown Tokyo: the T-shirts they wear with violent, antisocial slogans (in English) are an aesthetic statement, not a moral one.
 For my generation, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and the war in general now represent the equivalent of a cultural ''game over'' or ''reset'' button. Through a combination of conscious policy and unconscious culture, the painful memories and images of the war have lost their context, surfacing only as twisted echoes in our subculture. The result, for better and worse, is that, 60 years after Hiroshima, we dwell more on the future than the past.

HEADLINE: Niche Publishers in Search of the Next Small Thing 

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
PRODUCING each copy of the book ''Talking With Your Hands, Listening With Your Eyes'' costs Square One Publishers in Garden City Park about $8 -- four times as much as a typical book. But Rudy Shur, the founder and publisher of Square One, insists that it is well worth it. 
 ''When you have a small company, sometimes it's not about the economics, but having a commitment to turn out a project that you think will be better than what is out there -- even if it initially costs more than you hoped,'' Mr. Shur said.
The book, released in 2003, is a 390-page photographic guide to American Sign Language by Gabriel Grayson that took 8 1/2 years to complete. 
 Instead of line drawings of each sign being made by disembodied hands, the book uses more than 1,400 photographs of people demonstrating each sign, Mr. Shur said, because ''anyone who teaches sign language knows that there is an expression on the face that goes with the sign.''
 ''As a small publisher, you have to be able to do a better job on the projects that you work on,'' Mr. Shur said, ''and look for markets that large companies don't want to spend the money or time developing.'' 
 A number of small book publishers call Long Island home, trying to carve out profitable market niches in the shadow of the media giants in New York. Some concentrate on specialized offerings for non-retail markets, like Barron's Educational Series in Hauppauge, which publishes test preparation manuals and school directories, and ViaTech Publishing Solutions in Bay Shore, which publishes books for businesses. Others, like Square One, are after the retail book buyer.
 Mr. Shur created Square One in 2000, three months after he and two partners sold the Avery Publishing Group, also based in Garden City Park and known for alternative health books since the mid-70's, to Penguin Putnam. Square One's books, Mr. Shur said, are about subjects like parenting, health, spirituality, military history and interesting hobbies. The large publishers rarely concentrate on specialty books, he said, leaving opportunities for small companies that can work effectively on a small scale.
 ''There are a tremendous number of small publishers that deal only in niche markets, and they do extremely well,'' Mr. Shur said. By contrast, he said, ''I would never try to do a fiction best seller in a marketplace dominated by large companies, hoping my book would be the exception to the rule.''
 Under the general heading of parenting, Mr. Shur said, his company specializes in books for parents aiming to teach their children reading and math before preschool. It seeks out expert authors rather than waiting for manuscripts to come in, he said: ''The large companies would say, 'You write the book and we'll look at it.' We will work with them.''
 Ordinarily, Mr. Shur said, his books have a first printing of 10,000 copies. He said if half are sold, he breaks even. But the high production cost of the sign-language book meant that Square One did not earn back its investment from a sellout of the 7,000-copy initial printing. Mr. Shur said he kept the first run short ''to make sure there were no mistakes.'' 
 The second printing of 11,000 finished recouping the cost; more than 50,000 copies have now been sold. Of Square One's 130 titles so far, Mr. Shur said, at least 30 have surpassed 50,000 copies in sales, the threshold to be considered a best seller. 
 ''That is an unusually high number'' and one of the reasons Publishers Weekly, in its March 7 issue, ranked Square One as the fastest-growing small publisher in the United States, he said. Annual sales of $2 million or more were required for inclusion. 
 Dover Publications has had a presence in Mineola since it was founded by Hayward Cirker in 1948, according to its president, Paul Negri. Shortly after Mr. Cirker died in 2000, his widow sold the company to the Courier Corporation of North Chelmsford, Mass., one of the country's largest book manufacturers. Mr. Negri, who started with the company in 1978 as the advertising director, said that most of the company's executives were kept on and that he became president last year.
 ''This company began by being a paperback publishing house and it still is,'' Mr. Negri said. But its specialty is inexpensive reprints of literature and specialized professional books that have gone out of print or off copyright. For example, Mr. Negri said, the company has a line of more than 500 classical music scores and more than 800 books of ''clip art,'' copyright-free illustrations for artists' and designers' use.
 At Dover, a first printing can be anything from 2,000 to 50,000 books, depending on the content. The Thrift Editions of classic literature sell for $1.50 to $3.50, retail, which Mr. Negri said was $1 to $2 less than the competition's price.
 ''Part of our marketing strategy is that we publish books that we intend to keep in print over multiple printings, so that we have a long stream of revenue from the title,'' he said. ''Many of the books make a profit in the first printing. But when we publish, we are not looking for a best seller, but rather a steady market over the long haul. Very few of our books go out of print. That is why we have 9,000 titles that are still in print. They go back all the way to 1948.''
 Mr. Negri said the company's 660 new titles a year rank it as a midsize publisher.
 A Sag Harbor publisher, the Permanent Press, is a much more personal enterprise. Founded in 1978 by the husband-and-wife team of Martin and Judith Shepard, the company sticks almost exclusively to original fiction, and gets about 6,000 submissions a year; both partners must like a manuscript before the company will go ahead with it. 
 Mr. Shepard said the first printings of his company's books, all hardcover, are typically 1,000 to 2,000 copies.
 ''We break even with the sale of 1,000 books,'' he said. ''It costs about $10,000 to do a book -- $7,000 for the printing, $1,000 for the author's advance, $1,000 for the typesetting and money for the cover artist.'' 
 By his lights, a successful book is any ''that earns more than $10,000 and covers our expenses,'' he said. A book generally makes the bulk of its money in its first year in print, but one that Mr. Shepard published 23 years ago is really paying off only now: ''The Hoax,'' Clifford Irving's account of his faking an autobiography of Howard Hughes, is being made into a movie.
 The Pushcart Press in Wainscott is another small fiction publisher. Founded in 1972 by Bill Henderson, the company publishes just three or four novels a year, along with an annual anthology of stories, essays, short stories and poems from magazines across the country. 
 ''Each book costs $10,000 to $15,000, and I print 2,000 to 3,000 copies,'' Mr. Henderson said. 
 Warren and Barbara Phillips founded Bridge Works Publishing in Bridgehampton in 1992. The company generally publishes 13 books a year, mostly nonfiction, selected from among 3,000 proposals submitted annually. In 2000, the Phillipses sold their business to Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group in Lanham, Md., and stayed on to run it until last March. Now, Mr. Phillips said, the couple plans to publish a limited number of books on their own each year as an affiliate of Rowman & Littlefield.

HEADLINE: Number of Unsold Houses Grows

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
THE number of homes for sale on Long Island and in Queens in June was 22 percent higher this year compared with the same time last year, signaling, some say, that prices have been raised too high for many buyers.
 The numbers come from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, a network of about 2,300 real estate offices in Long Island and Queens. The service also reports that median home sale prices are still rising in Nassau and Suffolk, but at a slower rate.
 ''A lot of people are trying to cash in on the boom before it goes away,'' said Irwin Kellner, the Weller professor of economics at Hofstra University and chief economist for North Fork Bank. 
 With more people putting homes on the market at ever higher prices, the supply is starting to outpace demand, Mr. Kellner said. ''I think I see the beginnings of a cooling for the housing boom right now on Long Island,'' he said.
 Real estate brokers have encountered both edgy sellers and savvier buyers, saying that news reports on the real estate market have added to the uncertainty and anxiety on both sides.
 Brokers also say that more older homeowners are trying to cash in on the equity in their homes and fatten their retirement nest egg.
 Evelyn Atanas, the owner of Atanas Realty in Williston Park, said many homeowners she has encountered are worried about housing prices leveling off.
 ''The sellers are very nervous,'' Ms. Atanas said. ''I had people in today who were saying: 'What should I do? Should I sell? Should I rent?''' 
 Kathy Anastasio of Anastasio Associates in Huntington said that she still sees a lot of buyers, but that lately sellers slightly outnumber them. 
 ''We have some people trying to cash in, but we also have more sellers because they're asking more than they should, more than it will appraise for, more than it will actually sell for,'' Ms. Anastasio said.
 Ms. Anastasio, who specializes in the Huntington market in Suffolk County, said there were 762 more homes for sale in the Town of Huntington during the first six months of 2005 than during the same period last year, while the number of homes sold during that time declined by 184, according to numbers from the Multiple Listing Service.
 Sharon Topper, of Topper Realty in Long Beach, said that unsold houses are accumulating because sellers are holding out for a high offer, and because there are so many hesitant buyers.
 ''I have a lot of people sitting in high-priced rentals who sold their homes,'' Ms. Topper said. ''They're sitting in $4,000-a-month rentals waiting for the bubble to burst.'' Homes are still selling at all-time highs in Long Beach, Ms. Topper said, especially condos and co-ops with ocean views, but ''a lot of houses are $100,000 overpriced, and people are sitting and waiting on those.'' 
 The median sale price for a home, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, in both Suffolk and Nassau Counties rose 10.5 percent, to $436,000 in June, compared with the same month last year. That was less than the previous year's increase in prices, which was 12.4 percent.
 "They're beginning to slow down, though 10 percent is nothing to sneeze at," Mr. Kellner said of the change in home price increases. 
 Lost in the Multiple Listing Service reports is data on the very expensive houses on the East End, where many real estate offices are not members of the services.
 Brokers say that demand and prices on the East End are still very strong and that there is no excess inventory. ''In the village of Southampton, there's not a whole lot'' of homes at the high end, according to Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 Numbers in the luxury market can be deceiving, she added, if not tempered with knowledge of the yearly trends.
 Suffolk Research Service, a firm that tracks East End real estate transactions, reports that in Southampton, for example, 12 percent fewer homes were sold in the first six months of 2005 than in the same period last year.
 That's down from a 39.5 percent increase in sales in the first six months of 2004.
 But Ms. Herman said that the important sales numbers for the Southampton market turn up in September and October, after homeowners have collected their summer seasonal rents and decide to sell their homes. 
 ''Over the summer, my offices have all done well,'' Ms. Herman said of her firm's East End business. ''And the high end is still very strong.''
 Academics who study real estate trends across the country note that while there may be a surplus of homes on the market, they may not be in the kinds of places people want or can afford. 
 That appears to be the case in Long Island. ''If you look for a town house or a condo or anything on Long Island, there's not enough supply,'' said Clifford Sondock, president of the Jericho-based Land Use Institute, a real estate and planning think tank. 
 He said that between the start of 2000 through November 2004, new home construction on Long Island had declined by 68 percent. Nationwide, he said, there was an increase of 18 percent.
 ''In order to maintain a level average home price in any market, you need to build at least four new homes per thousand people'' each year, Mr. Sondock said. 
 But fewer than two homes per thousand people are built each year on Long Island, he said, largely because of zoning regulations that restrict builders to producing single-family homes. 
 In areas like Houston and Las Vegas, relaxed zoning has resulted in up to 60 percent increases in new construction. 
 ''The problem with a restrictive market like Long Island is the builders produce what the political system will allow,'' Mr. Sondock said. ''So if there's a demand for town homes, which are more dense, but the political system doesn't allow more density, the builders will produce single-family homes instead.''

HEADLINE: Score It a 10 When the Fed Raises Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IT is another week for Federal Reserve policy makers to decide on interest rates, and, again, each forecaster followed by Bloomberg News expects them to raise the benchmark short-term rate by another quarter-point. 
 That would be the 10th such increase since June 2004 and would lift the target for the federal funds rate on overnight loans to banks to 3.5 percent.
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, now expects this predictable quarter-point progression to continue until the rate reaches 4.75 percent in March. At that time, he said, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note should also be around 4.75 percent. 
 His forecast for the fed funds rate is a quarter-point higher than his earlier prediction. Mr. Maki raised his estimate because he had increased his prediction for economic growth and because the Fed's favorite inflation measure -- price increases for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy -- was revised higher last week. 
 Based on the data revision back to January 2002, the trend of this core inflation rate has been much higher than was previously thought. In fact, the 12-month version of the core rate is now at the top of a range expected by Fed policy makers for the rest of 2005 and 2006. 
 The new data puts the recent high for this 12-month price gauge at 2.3 percent in November, with the rate falling to 2 percent in May and 1.9 percent in June.
 Before the revisions, the 12-month rate hit 1.7 percent in November, slipped to 1.5 percent in April and inched back up to 1.6 percent in May.
 So while the revised figures show a decline in June, Mr. Maki said ''the whole trajectory has been revised up, and, even in June with 1.9 percent, we are at the upper end of the Fed's range.''

DATA CHECK -- Retail sales figures, due Thursday, are expected to show a climb of 2.0 percent for July, according to Bloomberg, after a 1.7 percent increase in June.
 The trade-deficit figure for June, due Friday, is expected to be $57.2 billion. In May, the deficit shrank to $55.3 billion, surprising analysts. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, also due Friday, is expected to be unchanged for August, at 96.5.

HEADLINE: Military Plans Gradual Cuts In Iraq Forces

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
In a classified briefing to senior Pentagon officials last month, the top American commander in the Middle East outlined a plan that would gradually reduce American forces in Iraq by perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 troops by next spring, three senior military officers and Defense Department officials said Saturday. 
 The assessment by Gen. John P. Abizaid, the head of the military's Central Command, tracks with a statement made last week by the top American general in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., that the Pentagon could make ''some fairly substantial reductions'' in troops by next spring and summer if the political process in Iraq remained on track and Iraqi forces assumed more responsibility for securing the country.
Together, the generals' appraisals offer some of the most concrete indications yet that the Pentagon is moving toward reducing American forces in Iraq. They also reflect the Bush administration's growing concerns over how the country's involvement in Iraq is influencing domestic considerations. 
 But in his assessment, given as part of a larger regional analysis, General Abizaid has also warned that it is possible that the Pentagon might have to keep the current levels of about 138,000 American soldiers in Iraq throughout 2006 if security and political trends are unfavorable for a withdrawal. The number of troops will temporarily increase this December to provide security for Iraqi elections. And some troops leaving Iraq could be held in Kuwait as a reserve force.
 Senior administration and Pentagon officials, as well as political leaders in both parties, say there is mounting anxiety over the $5 billion-a-month cost of the war, an overtaxed military, dismal recruiting in the Army and National Guard, dwindling public support for the operation, and a steadily growing number of casualties, punctuated this week by the death of 20 marines in two separate attacks in western Iraq. 
 ''When you wake up in the morning and lose 14 marines, people say, 'What's going on?''' said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and a Republican, referring to the attack on Wednesday, when an armored troop carrier hit three stacked mines. ''This is a very complicated equation.'' Mr. Gingrich, a member of a Pentagon advisory panel, said military casualties in Iraq could play a prominent role in next fall's Congressional elections. 
 President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have insisted that United States troops will remain in Iraq as long as necessary and that there is no set timetable for withdrawal. But the war in Iraq and possible troop reductions are expected to come up when Mr. Rumsfeld and other top national security aides meet with the president at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on Thursday. 
 With some prodding by American officials, a shift in thinking and public pronouncements from Iraqi leaders is also unfolding in Baghdad. On Thursday, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari outlined a new, 12-point security plan for the country promising to better coordinate the work of the Ministries of Defense and Interior, to improve intelligence and protect infrastructure more effectively.
 Also last week, a new commission that includes General Casey and the new American ambassador to Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, as well as the Iraqi defense and interior ministers, held its first meeting to define the conditions to be met for a phased American troop withdrawal. 
 The commission, whose recommendations are due to Mr. Jaafari by Sept. 26, said in a statement that the main measurement will be the ability of the 176,000 Iraqi military and police forces now in place to assume enhanced security roles. Other considerations include the size and strength of the insurgency, and the ability of the new Iraqi government to take on governance duties. 
 After meeting with Mr. Rumsfeld in Baghdad two weeks ago, Mr. Jaafari reiterated that there was no firm timetable for an American withdrawal but added that Iraqis ''desire speed in that regard.''
 American military planners continue to refine their future requirements for troops. But under the current thinking, as reflected in briefings that General Abizaid and General Casey have provided to Mr. Rumsfeld, the number of American troops would temporarily increase in December to about 160,000 troops, an increase achieved through overlapping the normal rotation of incoming forces and those who have finished their tours, to provide security for elections to a new National Assembly, scheduled for Dec. 15.
 Assuming security conditions allow, the number would then gradually decline, first back down to about 138,000 troops, or roughly 17 brigades and their supporting forces, and then by another 20,000 to 30,000 forces by late spring, senior officers and Pentagon officials said. Further reductions of tens of thousands of troops are possible throughout 2006, if conditions set by the American-Iraqi commission are met.
 ''General Abizaid has consistently understood that if conditions on the ground warrant it, a smaller coalition footprint could bolster self-government in Iraq,'' said Lawrence Di Rita, the chief Pentagon spokesman. 
 Army brigades and divisions assigned to Iraq could be sent home before the end of their normal yearlong tour, or other units preparing to go to the combat zone could be told to stay where they are, if American commanders and Iraqi officials believe they are not needed. ''The rotation schedule is up in the air,'' said one senior Army officer based in Europe who is awaiting deployment orders. 
 Some American forces could be held in Kuwait, south of Iraq, as a reserve force in case security deteriorates, said one military officer who has been briefed on the planning.
 ''It will be something of a staged drawdown,'' Maj. Gen. J.B. Dutton of the British Marines, commander of allied forces in southern Iraq, told reporters on Friday. ''Certain areas of the country will be able to take charge of their own security sooner than others.'' 
 Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, who leads the American effort to train Iraqi forces, said this week that Iraqi units would probably first control the nine southern provinces and the three Kurdish provinces, but he declined to offer a timetable. 
 In an interview with Al Arabiya on July 27, the Iraqi national security adviser, Mowaffak Rubbaie, said that it was likely that American troops would first turn over control to Iraqi security forces in cities such as Najaf, Karbala, Samawa and others in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
 How and when that handoff will take place is a sensitive issue that Mr. Rumsfeld addressed in a speech in Los Angeles on Thursday. He described a ''tension'' between having too many American troops in Iraq, which present a bigger target for insurgents and reinforce a perception that the United States is an occupying power, and too few capable American and Iraqi forces, which could lead to greater violence and imperil the fitful political progress and economic reconstruction. 
 ''We are training the Iraqi security forces as fast as they can be trained,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''We are passing off pieces of real estate to the Iraqis as fast as they're capable of taking it over.'' 
 Over the past two months, more than 1,500 American military advisers have been assigned to work in Iraqi units, giving American commanders much keener insights into the strengths and weaknesses of individual units, as well as the Iraqi ministries. 
 The quality of the Iraqi security forces is uneven, these advisers say. General Petraeus said that more than two dozen of the 105 Iraqi Army battalions were now leading combat operations with American support. But a Pentagon assessment in July concluded that about half of Iraq's new police battalions were still being established and could not conduct operations, while the other half of the police units and two-thirds of the new army battalions were only ''partially capable'' of carrying out counterinsurgency missions. 
 Pentagon and other administration officials have been emphasizing in recent days the need to strengthen Iraq's political and economic framework to quell the insurgency, and not to rely on military might alone.

HEADLINE: Trapped in Nether-Nether Land

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
''IT'S like having a gun in my mouth,'' a young man with a nose ring and way-out hair says in a video art performance being shown at Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art. ''The worst part is I like the gun in my mouth. I like the taste of heroin.'' His face crinkles into a frown, the confusion of his predicament visible. 
 This young addict is one of 26 homeless Seattle teenagers who participated in ''Endurance,'' an art project completed in 2002 by Bradley McCallum and Jacqueline Tarry.
They produced a series of life-size color photographs of the teenagers and a video performance in which each of them stood still on a Seattle sidewalk for an hour staring at the camera. Later they recorded a monologue about their lives.
 Mr. McCallum and Ms. Tarry, New York artists, are known for their socially minded, collaborative art projects. In 1996 they produced a controversial artwork exploring police violence, while more recently they have been engaged on a series of site-specific installations about the Underground Railroad and the legacy of slavery. 
 With ''Endurance'' they sought to give voice to the issues that face homeless young people in Seattle.
 Their stories are heartbreaking. One of the girls is pregnant, and she talks about how hard it is to stay off heroin so she won't harm her baby. 
 She has already contracted hepatitis by sharing dirty needles, and she worries that her child will also be infected with the virus. She will go back to heroin, she says, once she has given birth. 
 Harrowing stories of lost friends are a recurring theme in the taped interviews. Time and time again, we hear about a friend who overdosed on drugs or was killed in gang warfare or street violence. Two members of the project died during the course of its production, one of a heroin overdose, the other a random homicide. The photographs present grim, arresting frontal portraits of the teenagers against stark black backgrounds. They look as if they are in mourning, staring glumly at the camera with sad, empty eyes.
 Maybe they are just dazed by grief, or conditioned to keep their emotions hidden. They inhabit a netherworld, hovering silently in the blackness of these photographs much in the same way they lurk in society's shadows. They may as well be dead. 
 The mug-shot photographic style is confronting. But it also tends to obliterate traces of the sitter's personality. We are left only with their clothing, tattoos, piercings, jewelry and hairdos from which to piece together who they are. 
 I didn't have much luck, except to note that all seem to exude an aura of anarchic freedom. Nobody tells these guys what to do.
 Art is powerless in the face of hopeless social and economic marginalization. But it can raise awareness of injustice, social distress and inequality and can act as a catalyst for change. The artists have done their part.

HEADLINE: The Sacred and the Profane

BYLINE: By TERRY GOLWAY

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD 

 BODY:
THE tidy split-level houses that line one side of Shunpike Road in this historic Union County town tell a story of postwar New Jersey, when middle-class urban dwellers fled their walkups and the old neighborhood for the siren call of a backyard, a grill and a mortgage. Their arrival transformed small-town Springfield into a solidly middle-class car-centered suburb.
 On the other side of the road is old New Jersey, a swath of Springfield that glories in tradition and has resisted the passage of time and the pressures of development.
A part of the famed Lower Course of Baltusrol Golf Club runs along Shunpike Road, separated from the 21st-century noise and clatter by a simple fence and a line of trees.
 This week, the greatest male golfers in the world will descend on both versions of Springfield, the old and the new, as Baltusrol Golf Club plays host to the annual P.G.A. Championship, the fourth and final major men's tournament of the year. From the first ball struck on Thursday morning to the championship's final putt on Sunday evening, the attention of the world's golf community will be focused on this town of 15,000, which blends its Revolutionary War traditions with architecture and sensibility that are straight out of 1955. 
 To those not steeped in golf's lore and traditions, gritty New Jersey may seem an unlikely place to play host to one of the sport's signature events. The Garden State's golf courses lack the geographic drama of Scotland's wind-lashed links courses or the moonlight and magnolia atmosphere of Southern courses like Pinehurst and the Augusta National Golf Club. 
 Even so, Baltusrol is considered hallowed ground for professional and amateur golfers alike, for it has been the site of 15 major tournaments in its 110 years, and it is the only place where the legendary Jack Nicklaus won two United States Opens, in 1967 and 1980. Amazingly enough, however, the club's Lower Course -- the more famous of the two 18-hole courses that make up Baltusrol Golf Club -- is not considered the best in the state.
 That honor belongs to little-known Pine Valley Golf Club in Camden County. Golf magazines regularly rate Pine Valley as the country's best course, or list it among the top two or three. But because Pine Valley's members have no interest in playing host to professional tournaments, its existence -- for most of the state's amateur golfers -- remains more rumor than fact.

Perth Amboy, Epicenter of Golf?
 The state's connection to world-class golf does not end with Pine Valley and Baltusrol. The Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, Somerset County, is among the country's best new courses. One of the nation's leading golf course designers, Rees Jones -- son of the famed designer Robert Trent Jones -- lives in Montclair. 
 And golf's governing body in this country, the United States Golf Association, is based in bucolic Far Hills. The executive director of the U.S.G.A., David Fay, is a member of Baltusrol, along with other New Jersey boldface names, like Robert E. Mulcahy III, the athletic director of Rutgers University, and Leonard Coleman, the former president of baseball's National League and one of the club's first African-American members.
 If that weren't enough, the editors of Golf magazine recently named Perth Amboy -- that's right, Perth Amboy -- as the country's best city for golf. What makes the choice not just interesting but positively outlandish is the not insignificant fact that there are no golf courses in Perth Amboy. 
 ''However, within 150 miles of the city are 25 of our top 100 courses,'' said Mike Corcoran, the magazine's deputy editor. ''That makes Perth Amboy the epicenter of golf in the United States.''
 One of the courses within easy reach of Perth Amboy is, of course, Baltusrol, although it is fair to say that not many of the struggling city's residents can spare the $75,000 the club requires as an initiation fee. That's in addition to thousands of dollars in annual costs, although Baltusrol is by no means the most expensive or economically exclusive club in the state. The Trump course in Bedminster costs members $150,000 to join. Meanwhile, a new course in Bayonne will cost members a half-million dollars up front.
 But if those prices make Baltusrol seem like an affordable option, they do not make it accessible to most people, even most golfers. Like much, though not all, of private golf, Baltusrol has a membership that tends to be affluent, predominately white and middle age. 
 These days, however, a club that wishes to play host to a PGA Tour event or a championship run by the U.S.G.A. cannot discriminate on the basis of race and gender. (The Masters is held at the all-male Augusta National Golf Club, but that event is run by the club, not the PGA or U.S.G.A.) In 1990, the P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek in Alabama faced a major boycott by television sponsors because of the club's exclusively white membership. The club quickly admitted its first black member, and the boycott was called off. Since then, Baltusrol and other elite clubs have added black members. 
 The club's steep fees certainly suggest a rarefied atmosphere, an impression made all the more evident by the hushed conversations in the clubhouse lobby, the heavy rugs that muffle the groan of stately old staircases, the hint of cigar smoke in the men's grill room, and a dress code that forbids members from wearing shorts on the course. (That rule was not applied to the nonmembers Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, who played a practice round last Monday while showing lots of leg.)
 ''The clubhouse is a classic old-school structure that was intended to be very understated,'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''It was a very blue-blood thing.''
 He included Baltusrol in a group of the country's ''classic blue-blood clubs,'' with Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, N.Y.; the Country Club in Boston; and Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa., outside Philadelphia. 

Golf, and More Golf
 Baltusrol members are quick to point out that however stately their clubhouse may seem, however elitist the atmosphere on the lovely patio overlooking the Lower Course, this is no country club.
 ''Baltusrol is a golf club only,'' said Anthony Cicatiello, a Plainfield resident who is chairman of CN Communications in Newark. ''There are no tennis courts at the club, no pool, no racquet sports and no spa. You become a member of Baltusrol to play two of the greatest golf courses in the world. We're not all great players, but we love the game.''
 As a result, members and guests say, Baltusrol is not necessarily a place where the state's financial and political elites go to see and be seen, or to socialize with other affluent members. 
 The club is about golf and very little else, in contrast to the nearby Canoe Brook Country Club in Summit, where members have access to activities like swimming and tennis.
 In any case, many members of private golf or country clubs insist that golf clubs and country clubs in New Jersey simply are not what they used to be compared with the days when affluent businessmen judged their colleagues and competitors by the club to which they belonged. 
 ''A lot of that sort of snob appeal doesn't exist anymore,'' said Alan Marcus, a Secaucus-based lobbyist who is a member of Alpine Country Club in Bergen County. ''What club you belong to is no longer considered the measure of a man. It doesn't matter that much these days.''
 Still, membership in Baltusrol certainly can inspire awe and envy among those who appreciate the club's place in golf history -- it has been home to the United States Open a record seven times. But the envious and the ambitious may have a hard time understanding that for Baltusrol's members, the burden of playing host to a glamorous major championship is heavy. 
 First, there are the logistical burdens, some of which have fallen on the shoulders of Laurie Gaertner, a Baltusrol member and Chatham resident who is serving as the club's executive chairwoman of administration. ''I'm in charge of volunteers who do everything from arranging for day care for the players' children to finding accommodations for the players,'' said Ms. Gaertner, who has been working on championship logistics for two years.
 Then there are the burdens that members have been facing in recent days as the course has been transformed into a test for the likes of Mr. Woods, Mr. Mickelson and the rest of pro golf's best. On one recent Friday evening, two members in an otherwise deserted grill room muttered to each other about the futility of playing their beloved course as the greens became faster and the rough thicker.
 ''That rough can ruin your day,'' Mr. Cicatiello said. 
 Members were able to play the course until the middle of last week, but several said they had noticed that few were availing themselves of the privilege. They're waiting for the course to return to its old, more playable self, Mr. Cicatiello said. 
 Mortimer O'Shea, president of Hilltop Community Bank in Summit, has played Baltusrol several times as a guest, and said he considered it ''tough without being unfair'' -- something he could not say about all of New Jersey's courses. ''I like a course where I have an opportunity to break 100, and Baltusrol is that kind of course,'' he said.

A Changed Course
 But things change in a hurry when the P.G.A. Championship comes to town.
 While holding major tournaments has been a way of life for Baltusrol, this year's P.G.A. Championship will be the first major professional tournament held on the Lower Course since the dawn of the Tiger Woods era, which began in 1996. The last decade has seen astonishing changes in the equipment the players use, allowing them to routinely hit 300-yard drives. In addition, Mr. Woods's renowned workout ethic has inspired his competitors to lose weight, lift weights and otherwise make themselves fitter and stronger.
 The course has been lengthened to account for the way the game has changed since Lee Janzen won the United States Open in 1993, the last time the world's top pro golfers visited Springfield. (The United States Amateur was held there in 2000.) For example, the course's legendary 17th hole, a par 5 that played at a hefty 630 yards in 1993, has grown to 647 yards. But it is not the tract's length that will defend the course's reputation as a world-class test of golf. The challenge will be the overflowing plant life that is growing energetically on either side of those lengthened fairways.
 A ball that strays even a few inches from the first cut of rough most likely will be all but invisible as it disappears into long, juicy rough. Television viewers are certain to hear the phrase ''horrible lie'' uttered many times by on-course reporters. They will not be referring not to some amateurs' method of keeping score, or even one of the commentator David Feherty's rollicking Irish golf stories, but to the way a wayward ball is sitting in the tangle of long grass.
 No wonder, then, that after Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey played a practice round with the defending tournament champion Vijay Singh several weeks ago, he shook his head and said, ''I'm glad I'm not a member.'' For the record, it should be noted that Mr. Codey is a member of Essex County Country Club in West Orange, where the closing nine holes have inspired all manner of invective from frustrated members and guests alike.
 When the championship begins Thursday, Mr. Woods is likely to be the center of attention as he tries to win his third major tournament of the year, a feat he achieved in 2000 but which no golfer has accomplished twice. But the day before will belong to Mr. Nicklaus, whose legacy is part of Baltusrol's mystique. The club will commemorate Mr. Nicklaus's two United States Open victories at Baltusrol by unveiling a plaque adjacent to the 18th tee box.
 During a brief tour of the Lower Course, Richard E. Wolffe Jr., a Baltusrol member and the club's historian, pointed to what looked like a pile of stones near the tee box. The plaque will be placed on the stones, he said. Mr. Nicklaus will be on hand for the ceremony, although he will not play in the championship. He has announced that, at age 65, his days of playing major tournaments are over.
 Once Mr. Nicklaus, a star of the past, is properly commemorated, Baltusrol's members and the golfing world will turn their attention to the present. 
 After all, today's championships are the stuff of tomorrow's history.

HEADLINE: An American in Chile Finds Conservation a Hard Slog

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RENIHUE, Chile 

 BODY:
Douglas Tompkins first fell under the spell of Chilean Patagonia's lush forests and rushing streams as a backpacking teenager from New York. Today, 40-odd years older and much, much richer, he may well be the region's biggest individual landowner, and its most controversial foreign presence.
 His holdings in this realm of snowcapped peaks and wind-whipped shores are larger than Rhode Island and include tracts that timber, electric power and agricultural interests covet. But instead of moving to chop, dam and dig, Mr. Tompkins has turned his properties into nature sanctuaries, open to the public but with strict limits on use, that he has said repeatedly he hopes to donate to the people of Chile. If they can be persuaded to accept his offer.
 In so insular a society, far-fetched explanations for Mr. Tompkins's presence here have flourished like moss. Some have suggested that he wants to turn Patagonia into a nuclear dumping ground, others speculate that he wants to seize control of water supplies in a world with a growing thirst, and there have even been accusations that Mr. Tompkins, a buttoned-down, gray-haired WASP, has acquired the land as the site for a new Jewish state. 
 Over the years, Antonio Horvath, a conservative senator who represents the region just south of here, has been one of Mr. Tompkins's leading critics, suggesting that he is just the latest in a long line of foreign adventurers with extravagant designs on Patagonia. He dismisses some allegations against Mr. Tompkins as ''extreme ultranationalist postures,'' but says his presence does raise legitimate issues of sovereignty and development.
 ''If I were to go to the United States and buy a big area of Florida as an environmental preserve and tell people they can't go here or there, I think the U.S. would kick me right out of there,'' Mr. Horvath argued. ''Every nation wants some degree of protection of its territory, and Chile is no different.''
 Just the reserve here where Mr. Tompkins lives much of the year, known as Pumalin Park in honor of the pumas that roam the park's virgin forests, occupies 1,153 square miles. All told, he and his wife, Kristine McDivitt, a former chief executive officer of the Patagonia retail chain who is wealthy in her own right, own more than 2,000 square miles of wilderness real estate dotted across southern Chile, either directly or through foundations they control.
 ''We want to do something good, but you've got to be very naive and out to lunch to think that certain sectors of society are not going to put up resistance,'' Mr. Tompkins said in a rare interview on a typically squally day here at his remote homestead at the head of a fiord. ''If you're not willing to take the political heat, then you shouldn't get into the game of land conservation, especially on a large scale.''
 Raised in Manhattan and Dutchess County, Mr. Tompkins, 62, became interested in the outdoors as a teenage rock climber in the Shawangunk Mountain Range, in the Hudson River Valley, and visited Patagonia for the first time as ''kind of a ski bum'' in 1961. He later founded The North Face, an outdoor apparel company, and the Esprit line of clothes, which he sold in 1990 for a price reported to be more than $150 million, giving him the means to indulge his fascination with the wilderness.
 Mr. Tompkins has the lean and weathered look of the outdoorsman and a direct and blunt style that Ms. McDivitt, gentler and more cheerful, tempers. Their home here, which they designed themselves, is built in a simple but elegant style that recalls the Pacific Northwest, open and airy with plenty of windows to take advantage of a view that includes a volcano off in the distance.
 One of the reasons he chose Chile as the base of his conservation efforts, Mr. Tompkins said, was a dynamic free-market economy that is unique in Latin America, with few government restrictions on the purchase or development of property. But the tradition of philanthropy that accompanied the growth of American capitalism has not taken root here yet, and that, Mr. Tompkins's local supporters say, has worked to his disadvantage.
 ''Because he is a North American doing this for such a strange purpose, for conservation, the assumption is that he must have hidden intentions, a secret agenda,'' said Rodrigo Pizarro, the director of Terram, a leading environmental group in Chile. ''If he were buying the land for profit, like all the other foreigners do, no one would be raising any questions.''
 Pumalin Park actually bisects Chile, running from Corcovado Gulf to the Andean mountain border with Argentina. Mr. Tompkins and his wife have acquired an additional 1,129 square miles of land in Argentina, mostly in the Patagonia region there, which only adds to nationalist anxieties, here and there.
 Business interests here and in the United States have also sought at public events, in publications and on Web sites to portray Mr. Tompkins and the nonprofit Foundation for Deep Ecology he established in 1990 as environmental extremists, even crackpots. He shrugs that off as part of a smear campaign, but makes no apologies for his belief that human interference with nature has provoked looming global disaster.
 ''To me, we are on a runaway train, heading for a cliff with nobody at the controls,'' he said. ''It has to do with our economic model and our ecological illiteracy, our overexpansion, our dangerous technologies that have damaging effects on ecosystems, our consumption patterns. It's an interminable list of environmental catastrophes and encroaching populations, and you have to ask: Where are we going? What is enough? What are the limits?''
 Chilean ecologists agree with his objectives, but not always with his methods, which reflect his hard-charging background in the American business world rather than the chummy, close-knit world of politics in this nation of 15 million people.
 ''The project itself is a very good one, a model for others to follow, but Tompkins himself sometimes doesn't help much,'' Mr. Pizarro said of Pumalin Park. ''He has an entrepreneurial mentality, wants to do his business his way and can be a bit disdainful of the way things are done in countries like ours, which has led him to make a lot of errors in communication.''
 In the late 1990's, Mr. Tompkins's efforts to join the north and south sections of Pumalin Park by buying the 125-square-mile tract separating them were blocked by the Christian Democratic government then in power. Even though he was willing to offer the best price, the Roman Catholic university that owned the parcel sold it to a Spanish-controlled power company.
 His relationship with the current, nominally Socialist government, which leaves office early in 2006, has been cautiously friendly. At the start of this year, an area he owned south of here, known as Corcovado and Tic-Toc, was designated a national park, and plans are under discussion to expand it to include what would be Chile's first marine sanctuary.
 These days, Mr. Tompkins also has a message that may calm his critics: he has reached his limit and does not intend to buy more land. ''We have a number of ventures that we are working on, and those are going to take the rest of our lives to finish,'' he said, clearly interested in his legacy.
 Carlos Weber, the director of the National Forestry Corporation, Chile's equivalent of a national park service, said that ''though the local authorities still have in their heads a model based on settler colonies that raze the forest to plant potatoes and raise animals, what Tompkins is doing offers the best opportunity for sustainable development in that region.'' 
 ''He is little appreciated, understood or welcomed in Chile today,'' Mr. Weber said, ''but I predict that 30 years from now, after people's thinking has matured and they see results, no one will be against him.''

HEADLINE: On Question of Pensions, Forrester Opts for Fiscal Conservatism 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
When Douglas R. Forrester was New Jersey's pension director during the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean, he established a reputation as a fiscal conservative. When he became a member of Gov. Christie Whitman's transition team, he solidified his credentials as a loyal Republican.
 But in a brief episode that has been largely overlooked, Mr. Forrester had to choose between the two attributes when he was asked in 1994, as a member of an obscure government commission, to assess Ms. Whitman's proposals to slash the state's contribution to the pension fund. Ultimately, Mr. Forrester's fiscal conservatism won out, as he criticized those proposals as a ''Pandora's box,'' then resigned from the commission in protest.
''I just felt that I couldn't go on with what was happening,'' Mr. Forrester, the Republican candidate for governor, said in a recent interview about the proposals, which helped pay for tax cuts under Ms. Whitman. ''Once you go off on the wrong vector, the farther you get away from the starting point, the harder it is to get back.'' 
 Now, more than a decade after that showdown, Mr. Forrester finds that one of the most vexing and politically delicate challenges he will face, should he become governor, is a familiar subject: the rising costs of pension benefits for public employees.
 The state treasurer estimates that these benefits, now totaling more than $2 billion, will consume $6.6 billion by 2010, or 20 percent of the budget. It is a politically delicate issue, because, Mr. Forrester believes, today's woes can be traced, in part, to what he called the 1994 ''disaster'' of ''wretched'' pension reforms, which were propelled by Ms. Whitman and the Republican-controlled Legislature.
 When asked whether he faulted Ms. Whitman, Mr. Forrester demurred, saying only that ''there's enough blame to go around.'' Then he added that it was the administration of Gov. James J. Florio, a Democrat, that first tried to ''monkey around'' with the pension system.
 Mr. Forrester said that if he were elected, he would need to review the system's liabilities thoroughly before determining ''what opportunities there might be for refinancing the system.'' 
 Put another way, he might treat the pension issue as if he were an actuary seeking long-term solutions, not a politician looking for short-term gains, according to more than a dozen pension, union and government officials who have worked with him.
 ''I found Doug to be very fair, and very competent, and he had a philosophy about what a pension system should be about, and how it should be administered,'' said James E. Schroeder, director of government relations for the New Jersey Education Association. Mr. Schroeder said that his comments should not be interpreted as an endorsement by the association, given Jon S. Corzine's strong pro-labor record in the United States Senate. But on the issue of pensions, at least, he said that he would be comfortable with the prospect of a Governor Forrester.
 ''I think his approach to how pension funds are funded would be a plus,'' he said.
 Ivette Mendez, a spokesman for Senator Corzine, who is Mr. Forrester's Democratic opponent, said that the senator ''believes we must put money into the pension systems on a consistent and responsible basis'' and ''do a better job of managing pension assets so we maximize returns and reduce risk.'' 
 Mr. Forrester developed his approach in the 1980's, when, as the director of pensions, he set aside money for postretirement medical benefits, modernized the office's operations and improved customer service, according to Thomas P. Bryan, the pension director from 1999 to 2002.
 After leaving government in 1990, Mr. Forrester founded BeneCard Services, a company that helps local governments and other clients manage prescription coverage. Four years later, Chuck Haytaian, then the speaker of the State Assembly, asked him to serve on the Pension and Health Benefits Review Commission to assess the fiscal impact of all legislation on the pension funds.
 Right away, the Whitman administration asked the commission to review three proposals to alter the actuarial assumptions to reduce the state's payments into the pension system and help set the stage for income tax cuts. Those proposals assumed that wages would grow more slowly than originally forecast, and that investment returns would be more robust. 
 As a result, lower salaries would lead to smaller pensions, stronger investment returns would cover more liabilities, and the state would no longer have to contribute as much to the pension fund or reserve money for postretirement medical coverage.
 The changes led to the biggest protest in Trenton in years, as 35,000 union workers demonstrated in June 1994. Mr. Forrester denounced the proposals, as well, at the commission's public hearings.
 ''Doug was a vocal critic, and Doug and I exchanged some heated words at that point,'' said Pete McDonough, a former spokesman for Ms. Whitman, and now a spokesman for BeneCard, among other clients. ''I just think he thought it was scam financing.''
 In the end, Mr. Forrester lost the vote among the nine-member commission, five of whom had been appointed by the governor. As a result, Ms. Whitman reduced the contributions by more than $1.3 billion.
 But Mr. Forrester's advocacy impressed commission members.
 ''He had a feeling about pensions in general, and they're pretty important in people's lives, that perhaps it isn't something to be used to balance the budget,'' said John B. Brescher Jr., a former member of the commission who is now a partner at the law firm McCarter & English , specializing in pensions. 
 By 1997, Ms. Whitman warned that the state's pension funds were being depleted. But rather than increasing the state's contribution, she decided to borrow $2.8 billion in bonds to put into the pension system.
 When the stock market soared, the state saved $600 million in pension payments in the 1998 budget, and used the returns to offset more than $2 billion in contributions in later years. But after the market plummeted, the losses caused the pension fund to fall to $57 billion by 2002, from $82 billion in June 2000.
 At the time, Mr. Forrester did not criticize the Whitman administration's bond sale publicly. But in a recent interview, he said that the sale had been ''unfortunate,'' because it had not corrected the methodological problems created in 1994.
 ''We would not be having this fight over benefit design issues today if we hadn't made the underlying financial mistakes before,'' he said. ''So it's a little annoying to have to go back and realize that one of my bigger challenges as governor will be to restore again what I thought had been protected.''
 Some pension experts and legislators have suggested changing from a defined benefit system, which promises a specific payment each month, to a defined contribution plan, in which the state pledges to put aside some money, with no absolute guarantees. But Mr. Forrester said that he was wary of choosing one system, and instead was intrigued by a hybrid arrangement.
 Mr. Forrester said that he was skittish about a multitier system that would offer different plans for different jobs. That kind of segregation, he said, could hurt morale, because the guiding principle should be to ''recruit and retain the best employees in the most economically efficient way.''
 Above all, Mr. Forrester warned that any solution would be hard to stomach, especially at a time when Trenton is facing so many tough budgetary choices on transportation, schools and more. 
 To put things in perspective, he recalled how, when he had been the state's pension director, people would ask him what had prepared him for the challenge.
 ''I said, 'Well, you know, I have a degree in theology, which I think is the ultimate in retirement planning,''' Mr. Forrester said.

HEADLINE: Frequent-Guest Perks Grow More Generous 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS an elite-level frequent guest with several major American hotel chains, including Marriott and Hilton, Tom Nieman is accustomed to being singled out for special treatment at hotels. But Mr. Nieman, a vice president of KeyBank in Phoenix, admits he was taken aback by the perks at the Pacific Palms during a recent stay.
 Not only did the Pacific Palms, a 292-room golf resort in Industry Hills, Calif., offer him a rate of $99, a saving of about $60 a night but it also threw in a deal on green fees, billing him $55 instead of the $69 that other guests pay. Then it offered a set of Callaway clubs and a pair of golf shoes -- free. 
''Most frequent guest programs make you wait until you've checked out before collecting your reward,'' Mr. Nieman said. 
 The Pacific Palms' program is one of several pulling out the stops to please frequent guests. This summer, despite soaring hotel rates, almost every big chain (and several independent hotels and resorts) are turning up their loyalty programs a notch or two. 
 The traditional frequent-stay program allows you to collect credits, or points, for each dollar you spend. For example, Hilton HHonors members earn 10 base points for each dollar charged to their room (including phone and room service). A free room can be had for as little as 7,500 points. At Best Western, members of its Gold Crown Club program receive one point per dollar spent, with a free room available at 800 points. 
 But in an increasingly competitive hotel industry, it is becoming difficult to tell the rewards programs apart, said Tom Knighton, the executive vice president for the Forum Corporation, a consulting company based in Boston. ''So hotels are trying to create differentiation,'' he said. 
 Hotels are bidding for the loyalty of new customers ''because they know it will make a bottom-line difference,'' said Joyce L. Gioia, a management consultant based in Greensboro, N.C.
 Indeed, the new programs are not necessarily designed to make existing customers more loyal, but to attract new guests who would see them through the next economic downturn, said Ali Kasikci, the managing director of the Peninsula Beverly Hills But he noted that strategy could backfire. ''The more rewards you throw in,'' he said, ''the hungrier customers get.''
 The bottom line for the frequent hotel guest is that this could be a summer of over-the-top perks and one-upmanship. 
 Ms. Gioia, a member of Hilton's HHonors rewards program, experienced a comparatively modest sampling of these new bonuses when she checked in to the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. ''Not only did we receive breakfast coupons for each morning and a coupon good for two small or one large bottle of water, but we also were given a coupon good for $5 in the hotel's pantry,'' she said.
 But the newest Hilton HHonors offer, which is believed to be a first in the hotel business, is considerably more innovative. Hilton Hotels, which also owns the Conrad, Doubletree and Embassy Suites brands, teamed up with GE Commercial Finance to offer investors in new Hilton hotel development projects loyalty points for their investments. Loan amounts of less than $10 million can earn a million HHonors points. Those who have more than $10 million to invest, will get two million points, enough for about 265 hotel nights. 
 Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which owns the Sheraton, Westin and W brands, has taken a less formal approach. It recently introduced a ''surprise and delight'' program that randomly issues its gold and platinum members event tickets. ''It might be something like tickets to the P.G.A. Tour or to a Mets game,'' said Mark Ricci, a Starwood spokesman. 
 InterContinental Hotels Group, which also runs the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Candlewood Suites brands, is giving its gold and platinum Priority Club Rewards members an opportunity to redeem loyalty points to see the rock group U2, which is touring the United States and Canada this fall. The packages include two concert tickets and such extras as a preconcert party ticket. 
 But perhaps its most generous offer is one that every rewards member qualifies for: a program begun this summer called ''Any Hotel, Anywhere'' that allows points to be redeemed for an American Express prepaid lodging cards of between $100 and $250. The cards are accepted at more than 500,000 hotels worldwide -- even those not belonging to InterContinental.
 Of the four major hotel chains, the one that appears to be practicing the most restraint is Marriott International, which owns Ritz-Carlton, Courtyard and Residence Inn, among others. ''Our research shows that people want promotions that add value to the vacation or trip, such as making it more affordable,'' said John Wolf, a spokesman. For example, this summer, Marriott is offering any guests who pay with a Visa card certificates for $100 off a future stay and a discount on a United Airlines flight. The special applies to Marriott and Renaissance properties.
 But why not save money and own a piece of the hotel, too? That is the idea behind the new program offered by Jameson Inn, which operates 105 hotels, mostly in the Southeastern United States and another 18 under the Signature Inn brand in the Midwest. Repeat guests earn credit toward the purchase of Jameson Inn stock equal to 10 percent of their room rate. You have to stay at a participating hotel for at least three nights in order to start accumulating credits; conditions are described on jamesonstockawards.com apply. 
 Hotel guests seem to like the new choices, even if they border on the gimmicky. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, for example, is running a ''loyalty lottery'' for new members of its rewards program, giving away four three-night trips for two, including air fare, to any one of its properties. 
 Mr. Nieman, the bank executive from Phoenix, said that for him the changes were having the intended effect. ''When you know you're going to be rewarded like this,'' he said, ''it certainly influences where I'm going to stay.''

I am looking for information about French and Italian cooking schools that offer classes several hours a day in English for about five days. -- Rusty Greenland, Virginia Beach, Va.

Culinary instruction is available in France and Italy for every type of student, from seasoned chefs to casual cooks. One resource for cooking school vacations is ''The Guide to Cooking Schools,'' an index of programs throughout the world that ShawGuides publishes annually. The Web site, cookforfun.shawguides.com, offers a directory searchable by location and month.
The International Kitchen, (800) 945-8606, www.theinternationalkitchen.com, organizes cooking school vacations to France, Italy and Spain. Options include the Amalfi Coast, Tuscany and Sicily and the Loire Valley, Provence and French Riviera. ''All the lessons we offer are in English,'' said Karen Herbst, its president. ''If a particular chef isn't fluent, we'll have a translator who is knowledgeable in cooking.'' 
 A trip to the Walnut Cooking School in Mayenne, Loire, includes a five-night stay at a country farmhouse, five hands-on cooking classes, all meals and excursions including visits to an 18th-century windmill, a medieval city and a local fromagerie for $1,950 a person. (This rate and other listed here are based on double occupancy.) An alternative in Italy could be a six-night trip to Chianciano in southern Tuscany with four cooking lessons and excursions to Siena, Montepulciano, Montalcino, Pienza and Montefollonico. Prices start at $2,199 a person and include transfers from the train station in Chianciano. 
 In addition to vacations exclusively devoted to cooking lessons, Jo-Ann Gaidosz, the owner of Active Gourmet Holidays, (203) 732-0771, www.activegourmetholidays.com, offers holidays for those who want variety or have traveling companions with different interests. For example, a six-night vacation to Sorrento includes five Italian-language lessons, four cooking lessons, all breakfasts and dinners, excursions to Pompeii and Positano and transfers to and from the Naples airport for about $1,320 (at $1.23 to the euro) a person. 
 In France, a vacation could include cooking instruction, wine tasting and bicycle rides in Bordeaux. Six nights at a bed-and-breakfast, all meals and wine, four cooking lessons in private homes and all excursions are included in the price of about $2,400. 

Recently I have developed extreme anxiety over air travel. My anxiety takes the form of being claustrophobic and then having a panic attack. Can any airlines be helpful? -- Richard Donohue, Bluffton, S.C.

Aviophobia, the fear of flying, is common. Some airlines used to offer programs to help passengers who were afraid to fly, but they have been eliminated or suspended. The Wings program at Northwest Airlines was discontinued because it was no longer economically viable, according to Jennifer Bagdade, a spokeswoman for the airline.
 You might want to talk to your doctor about an antianxiety medication for a flight. ''For a short-term solution, we will sometimes recommend an anxiolytic medication such as Klonopin, which is short acting, or Xanax, which is a bit longer-acting for longer flights,'' said Dr. Bradley A. Connor, medical director of the New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine. ''These can be quite effective in preventing or treating such symptoms.'' 
 Among private courses is a four-day program offered by the Fear of Flying Clinic at San Francisco International Airport, (650) 341-1595; www.fofc.com. It takes you behind the scenes so you can hear from pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and air traffic controllers. The course, which includes discussions of weather-related issues, demonstrations of the parts of airplanes and the sounds they produce and a tour of the air traffic control tower, costs $550. 
 Of course, sufferers of aviophobia could find it difficult to travel to a workshop. Tom Bunn, a therapist and retired airline pilot, has developed a video program called SOAR, or Seminars on Aeroanxiety Relief, (800) 332-7359; www.fearofflying.com. The 23-year old program, based in Westport, Conn., consists of four courses that explain the problem of flying anxiety, describe the physics of airplane travel, provide advice for controlling panic and anxiety and familiarize you with the cockpit and the cabin. 
 Individual programs are $95 to $190. The complete 10-DVD package is $480. There is also an option for one-to-one counseling over the phone. MARJORIE CONNELLY

HEADLINE: Grateful Student Returns the Favor

BYLINE: By Robert Johnson

 BODY:
After a 37-year advertising career at Young & Rubicam, Peter A. Georgescu is finding time to promote a few causes that are as dear to him. 
 Mr. Georgescu, 66, who once managed well-known campaigns like the ''Softer Side of Sears,'' retired as chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam in 2000, but he says he is now in ''the most wonderful chapter of my life.'' 
It is an apt metaphor because his book, ''The Source of Success'' (Jossey-Bass, $27.95) is being published this month. The book aims to explain what Mr. Georgescu views as the two major challenges facing America: economic competition from the emerging economies of China and India and a need to foster more creativity within American companies. 
 ''The only way this nation can compete with those that produce high-quality products at a lower price is by generating ideas that build a special relationship with consumers,'' he said. ''Everyone has buildings and technology; those are commodities. The only leverageable asset in the future will be creativity.''
 Any profit from his book will go to a charity called Better Chance, which finds bright children in some of the nation's poorest neighborhoods and helps them to attend outstanding high schools, including private prep schools like the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.
 Mr. Georgescu, an Exeter alumnus, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Princeton and an M.B.A. from Stanford before starting at Young & Rubicam in 1963. 
 He said he counted himself lucky to have gained admission to Exeter in 1954, when he arrived in the United States at the age of 15 from his native Romania after spending seven years in a Communist labor camp.
 ''I had been cleaning sewers, and I spoke little English, but someone gave me a chance,'' he said. ''I want to do that for other young people who are disadvantaged.''
 He also volunteers as a board member of the New York Philharmonic. In the business world, he holds the title of chairman emeritus of Young & Rubicam and serves as a director for several companies. 
 He and his wife, Barbara, live in Manhattan and have a son and three granddaughters. He rises at 6 a.m. most days to run five miles, partly along the East River. 
 ''That's how I torture myself,'' he said. Robert Johnson

HEADLINE: Library on Wheels Enters the Digital Age

BYLINE: By DAVID GOTTLIEB

DATELINE: VALHALLA 

 BODY:
THE residents of Westchester Meadows, a low-rise apartment complex here, are intense readers, so much so, said Valerie Griffith, a librarian, that ''they seem to be in competition with one another.'' But a weekly visit to their nearby library doesn't take this group of elderly residents long: it parks downhill from their community on an enclave off Grasslands Road.
 It's the Greenburgh Public Library cybermobile, a brightly painted bus that visits 10 sites convenient to library patrons six days a week, with a collection of more than 4,000 books, tapes, CD's and DVD's. 
The cybermobile's week starts at Westchester Meadows, a private residence for people 65 or older. Judging from the elegance of the residence, they are at ease with life's comforts. But for many, driving is no longer an option, and the cybermobile is host to a steady flow of patrons. One of them, Betty Wiener, who described herself as ''very old,'' said she sticks to fiction, sometimes detective works. 
 Marjorie Galenson is a retired economics professor at Cornell. ''I was always in academics,'' she said, ''but I didn't have to reach out. Now I have to reach out.'' Grace Howard taught in the public schools in Norfolk, Va. Albert Wasson had retired to Florida, but when his wife died, he sold his house and car and moved north to be near a daughter. ''I read anything,'' he said, ''especially politically oriented books and classics.'' The mobile library, he said, is terrific. And Leo Lang echoed his pleasure, saying, ''We are so grateful.''
 The mobile library is known by its keepers as a cybermobile because it has three laptop computers and offers Internet access -- not in demand here, but used by patrons at other stops. Its stops include other apartment houses, fire department and movie house parking lots, a community center and the Hartsdale train station. Now that it's summer, it also stops at town parks. 
 Two adjoining garden apartment communities, Edgebrook Coop and Edgebrook Estates, also get the services of the cybermobile, where 40 neat apartments house quite a few single- and two-wage-earner parents, mirroring a national demographic that has brought mobile libraries out of rural regions into more densely populated areas like Greenburgh. 
 John Philip, a library consultant based in Westerville, Ohio, said that ''over the last five to six years, rural service has absolutely been superseded by urban and suburban bookmobiles.'' 
 Information about the cybermobile, including its schedule, is available at (914)993-1600 or at www.greenburghlibrary.org. The Yonkers Public Library also has a bookmobile, which has been in service about three years; (914)375-7951.

HEADLINE: Supporters Rise to Defend A Cherished Power Station

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
THE two 10-story smokestacks of the Glenwood power station here loom over the city, symbols of its faded industrial past. For nearly a century, the station and its soaring stacks have stood sentry along the Hudson River, providing a treasured and unmistakable feature of the Yonkers skyline.
 But soon, those pillars, visible for miles along the Hudson shoreline, may exist only in photographs. The owner of three buildings that make up the station has made preliminary plans to tear them down to make way for a housing development. 
 The prospect has prompted some Yonkers residents to fight for its preservation. 
 ''This power station is a gem in the rough, it's one of the premier relics of the Hudson Valley,'' said Deirdre Hoare, a Yonkers resident who grew up near the station and is trying to save it. ''We're basically hoping that the city will realize that this can really be a very valuable asset in the economic redevelopment of the area along the Hudson.''
 She is one of several Yonkers residents who recently submitted a detailed 14-page application to the city's planning board, urging it to designate the station as a landmark to prevent any changes to its exterior. The board is expected to issue an advisory recommendation at a hearing at City Hall on Wednesday on whether the station should receive landmark status from the city.
 The argument of those who would preserve the station rests in part on the fact that the station, an abandoned shell for the last 40 years, was designed by Reed & Stem, one of the architectural firms involved in Grand Central Terminal, and built by the American Bridge Company, whose portfolio also included the Flatiron Building in New York. 
 They also point out that the Glenwood station, with its high ceilings and windows and Tudor-style design, would be perfect for condominium apartments, art galleries and perhaps even affordable housing. Not only should the station be left intact, they say, it should also be cleaned and refashioned into a waterfront plaza, a project that may create revenue in a city that has long struggled to brighten its image and rebuild. 
 ''We have budget crises, we need money for the schools, and we definitely need to increase our commercial tax base,'' said Mrs. Hoare, who works for the Population Council in New York. ''This is something that shouldn't just be torn down and replaced with some standard, mediocre housing development or shopping center, because it's wasting an existing asset that we already have.''
 But not everyone agrees. Richard Halevy, a spokesman for the mayor's office in Yonkers, said that the push to make the site a landmark could interfere with an effort to revitalize the four and a half miles of riverfront along the Hudson that is already under way. After being abandoned for the last 40 years, he said, the station's exterior could be in such a state of decay that the costs of restoring it would prevent any developer from wanting to do anything with the site at all. Knocking it down may be the only practical solution, Mr. Halevy said.
 ''If it gets landmarked, I'm speculating that there will never be a development proposal,'' he said. ''It's interesting that this building has been vacant since 1963, and they're only trying to landmark it now as we're redeveloping the land in a way that brings residences, retail, jobs and vibrancy to the waterfront. Why didn't they try to landmark it all these years?''
 The company that owns the station, K. Capolino Design and Renovations, which is run by Kenneth Capolino, did not respond to messages seeking comment on plans for the site. But at a meeting in June that was organized by the landmarks board to consider the Glenwood application, Mr. Capolino and a developer, REMI Company, revealed plans to tear down the station and replace it with a housing development, Mrs. Hoare said. 
 Jeffrey S. Williams, the president of the Yonkers Historical Society, said that such a decision would be a shame. He said he was writing a letter to the landmarks board urging it to protect the station. ''I know it's a development site, and I'm sure like any other property owner they're looking to use the property to its fullest extent,'' he said. ''But in this case I believe that the historic character of the building adds to the value of the site, and to its potential for reuse.''
 Commissioned in 1904 and finished in 1906, the station was built at a time of public outcry over steam-powered trains because they were polluting cities with excessive smoke and dirt. When it became operational, the plant, along with a twin station in the Port Morris section of the Bronx, helped power the Hudson, Harlem and then Putnam railroad lines. That, in turn, helped spur economic growth in the region by allowing people to live in Westchester and commute to New York. It also caused industry in the region to flourish, allowing businesses like Otis Elevators to ship its goods to other parts of the country. 
 ''This had an incredible influence not only on Yonkers, but on the region as well,'' Mr. Williams said. 
 By 1963, the station had pumped its last jolt of electricity and was closed down. Its turbines and boilers were removed, its interior machinery carted away. It has barely been touched since. Today no one seems to know exactly what shape it is in. Mr. Halevy, the spokesman for the mayor's office, said that several years ago the city received a grant to conduct an environmental exploration of the site. It never took place.
 ''There was a problem with the property owner,'' he said. ''The developer didn't want to do anything. So we never proceeded with the study.''
 If the station ends up being preserved and becomes part of a plan to redevelop the waterfront, it may be in good company. Similar power plants across the United States and in other countries have been cleaned and brought back to life as condominium apartments, museums and shopping centers. 
 The Battersea power plant in southern London, pictured on the cover of the Pink Floyd album ''Animals,'' is being converted into hotels and apartments. An old power plant in the inner harbor in Baltimore, is now home to a Barnes & Noble bookstore, an ESPN Zone and a Hard Rock Cafe. Pinned against one of the building's three defunct smokestacks is a funky red guitar that stands several stories high and faces the harbor. The plant, surrounded by hotels, a baseball field and convention centers, is among the city's most popular attractions.
 Martin McGloin, a co-applicant for the landmark status who fell in love with the Glenwood plant as an amateur photographer, sees a similar future in Yonkers.
 ''This is one of these magnificent buildings that could easily be reused,'' he said. ''Yonkers unfortunately has a very poor history of preserving landmarks. But it's such a vibrant city with people from various backgrounds and nationalities who I think are saying maybe we need to preserve some of our past.''

HEADLINE: Two Smoke-Free Years

 BODY:
Two years ago last month, New York State banned smoking in bars and restaurants over the noisy protests of many owners and smokers. Jobs would be lost, they predicted, businesses would go belly up. The idea of the Clean Indoor Air Act was never really unpopular among most diners and drinkers, but to a vocal group and their powerful allies, it was a hazard to New York's financial health. 
 The results of the new law have begun to emerge, and the news is better than most people expected, in terms of economics as well as health. Some bars and restaurants have lost patrons, but most apparently have not. Even better, according to the August issue of Tobacco Control, a public health journal, people who work in bars and restaurants are suffering fewer of the nagging sore throats, runny noses and red eyes that plague those who hang around other people's cigarettes.
 A study led by Matthew C. Farrelly, a health economics researcher at Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, charted how nonsmoking workers began breathing easier after the law went into effect in July 2003. And while the study showed no significant changes in upper-respiratory symptoms like coughing, other cold-like symptoms declined a great deal.
 Even more important, however, a study of saliva indicated a sharp drop in exposure to secondhand smoke. Cotinine, a substance produced by the body that indicates exposure to cigarette smoke, dropped 78 percent among those workers within the first year after the law went into effect. Secondhand smoke, once thought to be nothing more than a nuisance, has been linked to a variety of deadly health problems, including cancer and heart disease. Antismoking advocates say the declining levels of cotinine is evidence that New York State has started to save lives -- those of workers, diners and the bar crowd.
 New York's law is working, despite the efforts of powerful lobbyists in Albany who threaten occasionally to try to weaken the law for their tobacco-loving clients. The law allows some waivers for cigar bars, some membership organizations and in cases when the law would cause ''undue financial hardship''. But over the last two years, only about 190 waivers have been granted statewide among 78,000 restaurants, bars and bowling alleys.
 Because downstate counties and New York City had already begun adjusting to smoke-free eating and drinking when the law was passed, most of the waivers have gone to upstate establishments where financial hardship is often easier to prove. But as it becomes clear that more and more people appreciate drinking and eating in a smoke-free room, health departments around the state may be increasingly reluctant to renew even those waivers.
 Though the law still stirs controversy (there are some real noisemakers out there), a state health department poll showed that more than 70 percent of New Yorkers like it. That makes this an anniversary worth celebrating.

HEADLINE: Two Smoke-Free Years

 BODY:
Two years ago last month, New York State banned smoking in bars and restaurants over the noisy protests of many owners and smokers. Jobs would be lost, they warned, businesses would go belly up. The idea of the Clean Indoor Air Act was never really unpopular among most diners and drinkers, but to a vocal group and their powerful allies, it was a hazard to New York's financial health. 
 The news is better than most people expected. While some bars and restaurants have lost patrons, most apparently have not. Even better, according to the August issue of Tobacco Control, a public health journal, people who work in bars and restaurants are suffering fewer of the nagging sore throats, runny noses and red eyes that plague those who hang around other people's cigarettes.
 A study led by Matthew C. Farrelly, a health economics researcher at Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, charted how nonsmoking workers began breathing easier after the law went into effect in July 2003. While the study showed no significant changes in upper-respiratory symptoms like coughing, other cold-like symptoms declined a great deal.
 Even more important, however, a study of saliva indicated a sharp drop in exposure to secondhand smoke. Cotinine, a substance produced by the body that indicates exposure to cigarette smoke, dropped 78 percent among those workers within the first year. Secondhand smoke, once thought to be nothing more than a nuisance, has been linked to a variety of deadly health problems, including cancer and heart disease. Antismoking advocates say the dropping levels of cotinine is evidence that New York State has started to save lives -- those of workers, diners and the bar crowd.
 In short, New York's law is working, despite the efforts of lobbyists in Albany who threaten to try to weaken it for their tobacco-loving clients. The law already allows some waivers for cigar bars, some membership organizations and in cases when the law would cause ''undue financial hardship.'' But over the last two years, only about 190 waivers have been granted statewide for about 78,000 restaurants, bars and bowling alleys. Most of the waivers have gone to upstate establishments where financial hardship is often easier to demonstrate, at least over the short run.
 Though the law still stirs controversy, a state health department poll showed that more than 70 percent of New Yorkers like it. That makes this an anniversary well worth celebrating.

 Because downstate counties and New York City had already begun adjusting to smoke-free eating and drinking when the law was passed, most of the waivers have gone to upstate establishments where financial hardship is often easier to prove. But as it becomes clear that more and more people appreciate drinking and eating in a smoke-free room, health departments around the state may be more reluctant to renew even those waivers.
 Though the law still stirs controversy (there are some real noisemakers out there), a state health department poll showed that more than 70 percent of New Yorkers like it. That makes this an anniversary worth celebrating.

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Revolution Is Mired Over Markets

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: YALTA, Ukraine 

 BODY:
Eight months after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators removed a corrupt government in Ukraine, its peaceful Orange Revolution is being undermined by rivalries, conflicting reform programs and lack of coordination between the two people who did most to lead the revolt, advisers and supporters in both camps say. 
 They say the struggle between President Viktor A. Yushchenko, a former chief of Ukraine's central bank, and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, a former business tycoon, is delaying much-needed reforms. It could even erode the popular support that put both leaders, who are very different, into power.
 ''Tymoshenko is very left-wing, hugely populist, paternalistic and also very charismatic,'' said Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister of Russia, leading member of Russia's pro-market Union of Right Forces political party and now an adviser to Mr. Yushchenko. 
 ''Yushchenko is a liberal, democrat, European-oriented politician,'' he said, using the term liberal in its economic, free-market sense. ''Such ideological differences are very hard to overcome. There is jealousy and rivalry while reforms keep being delayed.''
 Yet, say their advisers and analysts, they depend on each other. Mr. Yushchenko needs Ms. Tymoshenko's power, popularity and political guile to keep a fragile coalition of free-market advocates, Socialists and Communists together before parliamentary elections in March. Ms. Tymoshenko needs Mr. Yushchenko's support to retain the office of prime minister. 
 Neither politician will admit publicly to a conflict. But the openness with which their advisers discussed the problem at a conference in Yalta in late July illustrated that the rivalry and clash of agendas were hampering change. This means that changes proposed by the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development -- like the introduction of clear property rights, the rule of law and privatization -- have not gotten very far. 
 ''There is a lack of coordination and coherence inside the government,'' said Grigoriy Nemyrya, an adviser to the prime minister and director of the Center for European and International Studies in Kiev. ''If last December's revolution was a managed revolution, then a managed counterrevolution is possible over the next eight months. It would be damaging for Europe and Ukraine. It would be catastrophic for the region.'' 
 Mr. Nemtsov and Mr. Nemyrya were among several top government advisers and businesspeople at the conference in the Livadia Palace, a favorite summer residence of the Russian czars perched above the southernmost tip of the Crimean coast in Ukraine. It was here, in February 1945, that the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union decided the fate of Germany and Eastern Europe after World War II. After Nazi Germany capitulated three months later, Eastern Europe soon came under Soviet domination. 
 Sixty years later, with the Soviet Union gone, Germany reunited and former Communist countries becoming members of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, there is another agenda. ''This is about bringing Ukraine back to Europe,'' said Marek Siwiec, a Polish legislator in the European Parliament and a board member of Yalta European Strategy, a private group that organized the conference. 
 The aim of Yalta European Strategy is to muster international support for Ukraine's wish to become a member of the European Union. The driving force behind it is the oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, the son-in-law of the former Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma. 
 Mr. Kuchma stepped down last December after Mr. Yushchenko was elected in a vote that was rerun after huge protests by people accusing the government of electoral fraud. 
 At the conference, the staunchest supporters of the Orange Revolution from inside and outside the country could not hide their disappointment over the slow pace of change, seen as an essential step toward Ukraine's gaining entry in the World Trade Organization. ''There is mounting anger in Western business circles over the lack of radical liberal reforms and the failure to establish a functioning legal system,'' said Alexander Rahr, an expert on the region and program director at the German Council for Foreign Relations in Berlin. 
 With the election scheduled for next spring, Mr. Rahr and other analysts said Ukraine's legislators would balk at any unpopular changes that could damage their election chances. Widespread privatization could lead to restructuring and job losses, which could dent support for the reformist parties.
 The political challenge for these changes was clear earlier last month, when the government tried to get parliamentary approval for reducing import tariffs, a measure required for joining the W.T.O. 
 Socialist Party legislators backed by the Ministry of Agriculture fought hard against Mr. Yushchenko's supporters to prevent any relaxation of the high tariffs on sugar imports in order to protect domestic farmers. The debate ended in fistfights.

HEADLINE: This I.P.O. Trend Has Nary a Dot Nor a Com 

BYLINE: By IRA BRESKIN

 BODY:
THE fashion in initial stock offerings this summer is about as retro as you can get: shipping companies, the kind with vessels that carry cargo across the waves.
 About a dozen such companies have initial offerings in the Wall Street pipeline -- and eight shipping I.P.O.'s, valued at almost $1.6 billion, have already gone to market this year, said Craig Fuehrer, head of the global shipping investment banking practice at Deutsche Bank Securities.
Shipping, he said, accounts for 15 to 20 percent of the value of prospective listings in New York now. ''It certainly is unusually high market activity for this nonsexy industry, in terms of I.P.O.'s,'' said Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. 
 It's unusual, but not illogical, Professor Ritter said. The I.P.O. market tends to have a flavor of the month, and right now, with all the attention being paid to world trade, it's shipping. Despite signs that the ship leasing market is softening, the stock issues are still coming, although offering prices have begun to decline. 
 ''The perception is that the shipping group is still very strong, despite coming off recent highs,'' said Joe Morea, head of United States equity capital markets at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
 For some investors, shipping stocks offer a way to capitalize on the strong growth in the Chinese and Indian economies, said Mons Bolin, president and chief executive of Aries Maritime Transport, which is based in Athens; the company went public on June 3. 
 Demand for ships is high, partly because they are needed to haul the surge of Chinese and Indian imports of raw materials and fuel -- and exports of consumer goods destined for markets like the United States.
 Demand can be measured through charter rates -- the charges for leasing a ship. These rates are highly volatile. They generally peaked late last year and began falling this spring, in time to depress the market offering prices of the spate of new shipping company issues.
 Charter rates have declined for both of the major categories of ships owned by the companies with new stock offerings. These are dry bulk ships -- which haul dry, raw material like grain or ore -- and crude-oil tankers. Most recent dry bulk shipping company stock issues are trading below their offering prices, while tanker operators like Aries Maritime have generally done better.
 The industry's recent I.P.O.'s, including Aries, were generally priced below their expected ranges. Aries opened trading at $12.50 a share; it originally sought to list shares at $14 to $16. It is now at $14.71. 
 Aries has been insulated from some of the volatility of the charter market because it has accepted longer-term leasing deals, Mr. Bolin said. 
 ''Good, experienced ship operations with longer-term charters perform substantially better in U.S. equity markets,'' Mr. Morea said. 
 The stock performance of the shipping industry has been mixed this year, according to indexes compiled by Deutsche Bank. Stock prices of oil tanker operators were up 14.8 percent, significantly ahead of the 1.2 percent price gain of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. In contrast, dry bulk carrier stocks have declined 5.7 percent, and container ship stocks are up 11.7 percent. 
 In addition, many companies planning to offer shares have had to lower their sights. 
 For example, Quintana Maritime of New York, which early this summer planned to sell 16.7 million shares at $14 to $16 each, cut the price of its July 5 offering to $11.50. The stock is now at $11.58. Quintana operates eight larger-size dry bulk ships.
 Weakness in the charter market may mean that several offerings will fall through. ''Not all deals will get done,'' Mr. Feuhrer said.
 The Capital Maritime and Trading Corporation, which had sought to raise $306.7 million through an I.P.O., in late June withdrew its plan for a $14-to-$16-a-share offering, according to S.E.C. documents. Investment bankers had reported slackening interest in the I.P.O. among institutional clients. 
 While demand for tankers will remain strong this year, it will not reach the levels of 2004, said Royal Shepard, an equity industry analyst at S.&P. in New York.
 Daily charter rates for tankers carrying 200,000 to 300,000 tons of cargo and supplies averaged about $62,000 in the second quarter, versus more than $100,000 in the fourth quarter of 2004, Mr. Shepard said. That is when charter rates hit a three-decade peak, reflecting increased global demand and strained tanker capacity, he noted.
 Charter rates for dry bulk ships have also been volatile because utilization is high, approaching 95 percent of capacity, said Barry Parker, of bdp1 Consulting of Bayville, N.Y. ''Small increases in demand quickly translate into higher charter rates that generally go to the bottom line for operators of these ships,'' he said. Of course, small declines in demand can put a big dent in profits.
 New issuers are generally using I.P.O. proceeds to reduce debt incurred when creating or expanding their fleets, to cash out original investments or to buy additional vessels. The world's shipyards are already working full tilt, so the offerings are unlikely to result in an immediate increase in global shipping capacity. 
 Beyond worrying about charter rate volatility, investors may be concerned that many new shipping companies have limited operating histories because they were formed specifically to buy and manage newly acquired ships. 
 Finally, there is history to consider. The first-day returns for shipping I.P.O.'s are well below the historical average for I.P.O.'s in general, according to Mr. Ritter. 
 From 1988 to 2004, the average first-day return for 13 shipping industry I.P.O.'s was 2 percent, compared with 21 percent for 5,137 other I.P.O.'s during the same period, he said. And from 1988 to 2001, the 10 shipping companies that had I.P.O.'s and histories of at least three years had an average return, excluding first-day gains, of just 5.6 percent a year over their first three years. That compares with 6.9 percent for other I.P.O.'s during the same period, Mr. Ritter determined.

HEADLINE: Lower Prices, but Not Better Lives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The arguments of Pankaj Ghemawat and Ken A. Mark in praise of Wal-Mart include the implicit assumption that markets are perfectly competitive. This is a nice idea in theory, but it doesn't always hold in practice. 
 Wal-Mart is the largest employer in the United States, exercising considerable market power in hiring low-skilled workers. The fact that it is ''unacceptable to Wal-Mart's shareholders'' to raise the compensation of Wal-Mart employees -- quite low by industry standards -- surely reflects, in part, the relentless decline in the relative bargaining power of labor over the last 25 years.
 Notably, this decline has been accompanied by a steady rise in the fraction of wealth and income accruing to the richest households.
 The important question is: Who is benefiting from the surge in worker productivity at Wal-Mart? Wal- Mart's profits could be cut in half and still be quite sizable. In times past, shareholders would have accepted this as more than fair compensation.

HEADLINE: Dismiss, Yes. Demoralize, No.

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO. 
Workplace or career topics may be sent to ccouch@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Q. For the first time in your career, you have to fire an employee, and you dread the encounter. How should you proceed?

A. Despite the apparent ease with which people are regularly fired on television shows like ''The Apprentice,'' dismissing an employee is always unpleasant at the very least, said Paul Falcone, director of human resources at Platinum Equity, an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif., and author of ''The Hiring and Firing Question and Answer Book'' (Amacom, 2002). ''The rules of thumb: Be kind, put the other person's needs above your own, and treat that person with dignity and respect at the finish line.''


Q. Is there a standard formula for these uncomfortable encounters?

A. Brevity is best, most managers say. Karen S. Muchnick, senior vice president for career transition services at BeamPines, an outplacement consulting firm in New York, says that the entire session should take no longer than 15 minutes, and that the actual dismissal should take place within the first 75 to 120 seconds. Ms. Muchnick said managers should use straightforward phrases like ''the end of our relationship'' and ''your career here is over.'' She also recommended outlining the terms of the employee's severance package at that meeting.
 Ms. Muchnick said it was important to give a fired employee an opportunity to react and to ask questions. ''Say your piece, then sit back and listen,'' she said.

Q. Must you outline the reasons for the dismissal?

A. Because most companies have a regular review process, the dismissal session is generally not the time for a comprehensive performance appraisal. Ms. Muchnick said managers should avoid dwelling on an employee's work history and focus instead on the decision to part ways. Jonathan A. Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, says that when managers try to explain their decisions for dismissing an employee, they often misstate facts and can get themselves into legal trouble. While courts have said that making false statements doesn't prove an employer is discriminating against you, he said, such statements can be cited as evidence of an effort to conceal something. In this session, he said, the less you reveal about what led to the dismissal, the better.

Q. How should you conduct yourself during the conversation?

A. Speak respectfully and calmly, Mr. Falcone said. While compassion is always appropriate, Ms. Muchnick said that you should recognize that there are limits to what you should say. ''The last thing they want to hear is that you're sorry,'' she said.
 Some managers say that whoever does the firing should take direct responsibility for it. Scott Rosenberg, chief executive of Miro Consulting in Fords, N.J., learned this lesson the hard way. In the 1980's, when he was a project manager at a manufacturing company in Secaucus, N.J., he said, he was told he was being fired by a vice president who claimed that the move ''wasn't his decision.'' Mr. Rosenberg says he still remembers feeling betrayed. ''If it wasn't this manager's decision to fire me, why wasn't the plant boss the one doing the deed?'' he asked recently. ''I just saw it as cowardly.'' Mr. Rosenberg now handles all firings himself.

Q. What should you do if your employee reacts emotionally?

A. Be prepared for the possibility that your employee will shout at you in anger or refuse to leave the office. It is common for managers to have security guards on call to handle these situations.
 Dismissal, of course, can be emotionally shattering. Some managers have a box of tissues on hand.
 Winston Trotter, employee relations manager at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, recalls an employee who sat in a meeting room sobbing for almost 45 minutes after her dismissal by another manager. 
 With security guards en route to escort her out of the building, Mr. Trotter intervened and asked the woman why she had not budged. She said that she wanted to tell someone how badly it would hurt her family if she were unemployed. 
 ''She wasn't looking to cause any trouble, and she certainly didn't expect to get her job back,'' Mr. Trotter said. ''She was devastated, she needed someone to talk to, and I was happy to be that man.''
 Later, the employee assistance program at the hospital offered additional help. Such programs can provide psychological counseling as well as assistance in rewriting resumes and sharpening interview skills. In this woman's case, he said, the program helped her find another job, which she still holds.

Q. Should anyone else be present when you dismiss an employee?

A. If you're uncomfortable, ask your supervisor to sit in on the exchange. Your company's human resources department can be a valuable resource, too -- before, after and even during a termination. ''You can never ask too many questions for something like this,'' said Gail Aldrich, chief membership officer at the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.

Q. How should you prepare?

A. It pays to rehearse. You might even use a mirror or a video recorder to check your facial expressions and tone of voice. Ms. Muchnick suggested making a checklist of points to cover and using it during the meeting. This document should help make the dismissal easier for you, and it may show that you respect the employee enough to get things right.

And based on the vote totals, a large majority of New York City residents apparently dismissed him as a country bumpkin -- or, at best, a suburban arriviste. There's no way this barefoot boy from Peekskill could be good news for the city, they must have assumed. Well, they were in for some surprises. 
 During his tenure, Governor Pataki spent more days in his Manhattan office than did his Albany-centric predecessor, Mario Cuomo of Queens. And many, if not most, of his real accomplishments have been focused on New York City-- usually resulting from effective partnerships with his pre-9/11 rival, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
Through his control of the City University of New York's board of trustees, Mr. Pataki provided indispensable support for Mr. Giuliani's push to raise standards at CUNY. The governor also helped reform welfare, signaling his new approach by changing the name of the state Department of Social Services to the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. Mr. Pataki cooperated with Mr. Giuliani in anticipating the 1996 federal welfare changes and pulling off an incredible 60 percent reduction in the city's welfare rolls.
 The Compstat crime-accountability revolution in city policing tactics was buttressed by Mr. Pataki's tougher state sentencing and parole policies. By completing Mr. Cuomo's prison construction spree, the governor ensured that criminals caught by New York cops would stay locked up for a long time. 
 And by leveraging state legislators' hunger for a pay raise in 1998, Mr. Pataki accomplished the previously unthinkable: a law allowing charter schools in the state. For the first time, parents with children stuck in some of the worst schools in New York City have publicly financed alternatives to the failed traditional system -- a concept now embraced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration. 
 Perhaps most important, Governor Pataki was a huge promoter of economic growth in the city. His state personal income and business tax cuts probably did more to improve the economy of greater New York than of any other region. The city also benefited from the Pataki-led cleanup of the mob-infested Javits Convention Center and reform of the state's balkanized economic development structure -- especially the elimination of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, which had been an obstacle to development in upper Manhattan. 
 But there is a flip side to these positives. The more the governor has sought to tailor his positions to New York City's voting blocs, the more he has actually hurt the city's interests. In crucial instances, he has sided with municipal unions against city taxpayers. The same goes for his costly political alliance with Dennis Rivera's health care workers union. 
 And as he approaches his final year in office, Mr. Pataki is leaving the city transit system with an enormous capital financing hangover from which it will not soon recover. His 1997 turnabout on renewal of the city's rent regulations was a huge missed opportunity to unleash market forces to solve New York's unending housing shortage. 
 The Campaign for Fiscal Equity school financing case has been another missed opportunity. Instead of using the court fight to spotlight the structural causes of school failure, like the teachers' contract, Governor Pataki embraced the discredited notion that more money is the cure for what ails the system. His response has boiled down to a same-but-less approach that, predictably, pleases no one.
 And the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, touted by Mr. Pataki as an accomplishment, has in truth been an embarrassing muddle.
 In the wake of his announcement that he won't be seeking a fourth term, Governor Pataki still has a little more than 16 months to serve. But even as a lame duck, he retains some significant power and leverage in Albany. Three priorities should be considered well within his reach:
 Raising the limit on the number of charter schools and amending the charter school financing formula to encourage more such schools in New York.
 Vetoing any effort by the city to raise its state-controlled income, business or sales taxes.
 Getting the ground zero rebuilding effort to move decisively forward.
 If he can accomplish these things, Gov. George Pataki's legacy in New York City will on balance be a positive one.

HEADLINE: Was Someone Squeezing Treasuries?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A STORM swept through the United States Treasury market in June, creating big losses at banks and brokerage firms and bringing back memories of the infamous short squeeze by Salomon Brothers in 1991 that ultimately brought the firm to its knees. 
 The recent turmoil is a troubling sign that the pools of capital at hedge funds and investment firms have grown so enormous that they can easily swamp the government securities market, one of the world's deepest, most liquid and heavily used financial markets. The upheaval also involved a short squeeze -- financial-speak for what happens to short-sellers when they are forced to stanch their losses in a buying spree that sends prices higher and higher.
Back in 1991, remember, a trader at Salomon Brothers propelled the price of Treasury securities skyward by illegally buying more than the firm's allotted share at auction. That squeeze created significant losses for many other players in the market and enraged regulators. The government punished the trader, Paul W. Mozer, and the firm, which paid $290 million in fines and penalties to settle the matter. John H. Gutfreund, Salomon Brothers' chief executive at the time, resigned as a result of the mess. 
 This time around, the market upheaval centered on a 10-year Treasury security issued in February 2002 that pays an interest rate of 4.875 percent. The notes generated about $25 billion for the government when they were issued, but the amount of bonds changing hands regularly, known as the float, is significantly smaller than that. 
 It's not known who was behind the recent short squeeze and there is no indication that the activity was illegal. 
 But by far and away the largest holder of the 10-year Treasury in question, and therefore the one that would benefit the most from the action, is the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the $500 billion money management firm specializing in fixed-income investments and overseen by William H. Gross. 
 As of June, according to data from Bloomberg News, Pimco held more than 45 percent of the outstanding 10-year security in its various funds. Pimco's percent of the daily float was unknown but would have been far larger.
 James M. Keller, a managing director at Pimco and director of its government/derivatives desk, said that the company as a policy does not comment on its trades.
 This particular 10-year note was also the security underlying a Treasury futures contract that expired in June. Such contracts are crucial hedging vehicles for investors and traders in mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and other fixed-income investments. 
 Problems began emerging in late May, when traders who had sold the 10-year note short suddenly found that they could no longer go into the open market and borrow the securities for delivery to their purchasers. If sellers of a security cannot deliver it to buyers, the trades cannot settle. In Wall Street parlance, this is called a ''fail.'' 
 ACCORDING to traders, beginning in late May and extending into June, billions of dollars of the 10-year Treasury were failing each day. It was clear that one or more holders of the securities had stopped lending them, setting up what appeared to be a perfect short squeeze. As sellers scrambled to buy back the securities to cover their short positions, the price of the Treasury rose, creating losses for anyone who still had a short position. 
 Holders of securities often agree to lend them, for a fee, to traders who are short the security. If no securities are available to be borrowed, anyone who is short the security must pay the amount of the coupon or interest rate to the people who have bought them. So, those who were short this particular Treasury were losing twice: once on the coupon, and again as the security's price rose.
 The June turmoil was not limited to the Treasury market, however. It also created problems for the throngs of traders at brokerage firms, hedge funds and banks that use the futures market to hedge their positions in other fixed-income securities. At one point, positions taken by investors in the Treasury futures contract that had the unborrowable 10-year note as its underlying security reached $200 billion. 
 Under the terms of a futures contract, any trader who has sold one must supply the underlying security to the contract's owner when it expires. If a trader fails to make the delivery, he or she may face a penalty from the Chicago Board of Trade, where Treasury futures change hands. 
 The disruption of the Treasury market in June seemed to have prompted the Chicago Board of Trade to institute limits on the number of Treasury futures contracts a trader can buy or sell in the last 10 trading days of its cycle. For example, traders in the futures contract that corresponds to a 10-year Treasury will be limited to 50,000 contracts. The limits, announced on June 29, go into effect with the December contracts. The last limit on the 10-year Treasury was 7,500 contracts; it was in place from 1990 to 1992. 
 Officials at the Chicago Board of Trade declined to discuss why the changes were made. But a notice explaining the new limits said the exchange's action furthered its ''interest in providing deep, liquid and transparent markets and underscores our commitment to protecting the integrity of these contracts.'' 
 And last week, Treasury officials discussed the problem of large capital pools possibly overwhelming the government securities market. In a meeting last Tuesday of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Bond Market Association, which meets with Treasury officials four times a year to discuss matters relating to the financial markets, Timothy S. Bitsberger, assistant secretary for financial markets at the Treasury, said it was considering creating a securities lending facility to provide an extra supply of Treasuries in emergencies when large numbers of settlement failures occur. 
 According to the minutes of the meeting, some people in attendance expressed support for the lending facility. Others, the minutes reported, were opposed. As is customary, the minutes did not identify which members were for or against the emergency lending facility. 
 The advisory committee's members are executives at brokerage firms, banks and hedge funds. One member is Mr. Keller, the Pimco managing director. He declined to discuss his view on the emergency lending facility.
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Bitsberger said that a proposal outlining how an emergency facility would work could emerge in the next six months. He said the Treasury is concerned that, as fails increase, some market participants may re-examine their reliance on government securities. 
 There is no doubt that supply and demand in the government securities market is becoming increasingly imbalanced. And such imbalances almost guarantee greater volatility in Treasuries and, therefore, interest rates. 
 From 1981 to 2004, according to government figures, Treasury securities outstanding grew 8 percent each year, on average, while annual trading volume increased 16 percent, on average. And from 2000 to 2004, Treasuries outstanding increased 4 percent a year, on average, while average trading volume rocketed 22 percent. 
 The futures contract expiring in September is based on a Treasury issue that is even smaller -- $19.5 billion -- than the $25 billion 10-year underlying the expired June contract. 
 In other words, fasten your seat belt. More gyrations in this market almost certainly lie ahead.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Israel to Smooth the Path to a Palestinian Gaza 

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has increased pressure on the Israeli government in recent days to do more to make a Palestinian Gaza successful after Israeli settlers are pulled out later this month, according to American, Israeli and international officials.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has put her influence behind the two American coordinators of the withdrawal -- James D. Wolfensohn, who is dealing with economic and civilian matters, and Lt. Gen. William E. Ward, who is helping to reform Palestinian security services.
 Just how much the Israelis will move on the complicated balance between security and economics, as Mr. Wolfensohn describes it, will become clearer on Sunday, as the Israeli cabinet begins a series of crucial meetings on Gaza. 
 Ms. Rice is also trying to bolster Mahmoud Abbas, the president. She sent a senior adviser, James Wilkinson, on a quiet visit last week to Ramallah, Palestinian officials said. He and a small team worked with Mr. Abbas to reorganize his office to improve efficiency and accountability, so orders will be followed.
 Mr. Wilkinson also urged Mr. Abbas to set up a press office and a protocol office, to try to improve his image and authority.
 In interviews, both Mr. Wolfensohn and General Ward praised the support they were getting from President Bush and Ms. Rice, who have emphasized that a successful transition in Gaza is vital to progress toward a viable, democratic, independent Palestinian state.
 ''The big thing is their personal commitment, especially from the president and Secretary Rice, to an orderly and peaceful withdrawal, and then to work toward a permanent peace based on a two-state solution,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said.
 Both men stress the importance of economic development and freedom of movement to give Palestinians the sense of a better future -- one Mr. Abbas can hope to take credit for, in his political struggle with the militant Islamic movement Hamas.
 Israeli officials, who agreed to speak only on background, acknowledge the new pressure from Washington to resolve questions of Palestinian life in Gaza: access, assets, security, travel and the import and export of goods and people.
 Ms. Rice in particular has been forceful and even abrupt in her dealings with senior Israeli officials, including the foreign and defense ministers, Silvan Shalom and Shaul Mofaz. On her recent trip here, she ran the meetings with them in their offices, taking control of the agenda and even announcing when they would end, the Israeli officials said.
 She has also expressed impatience with continuing Israeli requests for millions of dollars to help build modern passenger and goods terminals between Gaza and Israel, which the Bush administration contends is in Israel's interest in any case. Washington also rejected a request from Israel to help pay for the destruction of the settlers' houses. While the issue of where the rubble from the houses will go remains unsettled, the Palestinians have agreed to use much of it to build a seaport, while Israel has agreed to accept hazardous material for disposal.
 Ms. Rice was initially considering a return trip to Israel next week to monitor the Gaza pullout, but has since decided against it. ''She'll get credit if it works, and she doesn't want to be here if it doesn't,'' one American official in the region said. 
 In Washington, a senior American official said that American involvement had increased sharply after Ms. Rice, in June, told reporters she wanted to avoid mediating the details of Gaza coordination. But since then her aides have been doing precisely that. ''Our engagement has increased and it's likely to be sustained,'' the official said.
 General Ward said that Israeli and Palestinian military officials, down to the field level, were meeting to coordinate the pullout, to try to ensure that the Israelis will not come under fire. If there are mortar or rocket attacks, the Israelis say they will stop the pullout long enough to ensure that the firing stops.
 That could mean a major Israeli military action that could badly undermine Mr. Abbas. General Ward, a careful man, confirmed that two weeks ago, American pressure helped stay the Israeli military when it was poised to go into Gaza after a suicide bombing and rocket and mortar attacks that killed six civilians. He predicted that there could be similar pressure should the need arise.
 ''That scenario is a scenario that none of us would like to see,'' he said. ''There is a deep realization on the part of the Israeli leadership, including the military, about the consequences of that type of scenario.''
 Mr. Wolfensohn is concentrating hardest on the movement of goods and people.
 He has been trying, along with the United States Agency for International Development, to find a way to buy the remaining greenhouses from Israeli settlers to preserve Palestinian jobs, create new ones and maintain export markets. But the Palestinians have refused to allow American aid earmarked for them to be used to pay the Israeli settlers, even for greenhouses for Palestinians. Efforts continue to find private donors. But more than half the greenhouses are already dismantled or destroyed, and it may be easier to find foreign aid to rebuild.
 On the crucial issue of border crossings, Israel and Egypt are near a deal to station 750 Egyptian troops along the border between Egypt and Gaza, which would allow Israeli soldiers to leave. The European Union has offered to replace Israeli customs and security agents at the Rafah terminal there; Israelis would not be secure without the army.
 Israel objects to European supervision of Palestinian and Egyptian customs and security officials, but may finally agree if Rafah is used only for the crossing of individuals, whose details would be passed to Israel by computer for approval, and their luggage. Such agreement would have great symbolic importance for Gazans and their freedom of movement, given that no Israeli officials would be present, and Washington supports it. Trucks and other goods would cross after inspection at another existing terminal in Israel at Nitzana, south of Gaza.
 There has also been progress at Karni, the main goods terminal for Israel and the West Bank. Delays have been reduced, corruption has been attacked on both sides of the border, and the purchase of more sophisticated scanners has been agreed, if not the financing, said Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Expresses Support For Property Tax Rebates

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer criticized the $400 property tax rebate pushed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg after it was proposed last year, but now he says he supports the measure.
 Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president who is leading in polls among the four Democrats vying to unseat the mayor, was asked during an interview on NY1 on Friday night whether he supported the rebate, which has proven so popular that Mr. Bloomberg has pledged to renew it. 
''Sure I do,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''In fact, the simple, the simple truth of the matter is Mayor Bloomberg asked for too much in the first place. It's only right that he gave it back, and he should be giving it back to renters, too.'' 
 But last year, Mr. Ferrer questioned the wisdom of making such a move during tough budget times for city government. 
 ''Everybody likes to get a check in the mail, but the simple fact is if you're giving me that check in the mail while you're cutting after-school programs, cutting my firehouse, this doesn't make sense,'' he said in a June 2004 interview on WNBC-TV.
 Mr. Ferrer's expression of support for the rebate came a day after he proposed an $8.5 billion plan to create more housing for low- and middle-income residents by raising taxes on vacant land and forcing developers in certain areas to set aside housing for them. 
 Yesterday, the Bloomberg campaign said Mr. Ferrer's statements on the rebate suggested a pattern of waffling on key issues to pander for votes. ''Once again, flip-flop Freddy has found a way to be on both sides of an important issue,'' said Kevin Sheekey, the mayor's campaign manager. ''How can New Yorkers take anything he says seriously?''
 In March, Mr. Ferrer angered some black leaders after he appeared to soften his earlier criticism of the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, in 1999. While addressing a gathering of police sergeants, Mr. Ferrer said that he did not believe the shooting was a crime. 
 Jen Bluestein, Mr. Ferrer's communications director, said yesterday that Mr. Ferrer had not changed his position on the rebates. She said that he was simply pointing out that after raising property taxes, cutting after-school programs and closing firehouses, the mayor had ''a lot of gumption'' to send out the rebate checks with his name on them.
 ''Taxpayers deserve relief, but the property tax rebate alone isn't enough,'' she said. ''Mike Bloomberg should have made building housing his priority, rather than sweetheart deals for billionaire developers and popularity-boosting, election-year rebate checks.''
 Mr. Ferrer made a series of campaign appearances yesterday, as did his three rivals in the Sept. 13 primary. 
 City Council Speaker Gifford Miller fulfilled his campaign pledge to visit 100 neighborhoods in 30 days -- he even finished three days early -- by marching into Madison Square Park in Manhattan. He then announced plans to visit 100 more, starting yesterday afternoon with a festival in Jamaica, Queens.
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner taped television campaign commercials, and later met with two community groups in Downtown Brooklyn and Sunnyside, Queens. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, attended the renaming of a section of Lexington Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant in honor of Timothy Stansbury Jr., a 19-year-old who was killed there last year by a police officer who said he shot him unintentionally. Ms. Fields joined Councilman Charles Barron in calling for an economic development program to create jobs for young people in poor neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Is Now An Invisible American

BYLINE: By David W. Chen. 
David W. Chen reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
DO you remember where you were on Aug. 12, 2004?
 Assemblyman Bill Baroni, a Republican from Mercer County, certainly does. He had just completed a week in Liberia teaching students about voting rights and democracy. And the next morning, as he waited at the airport in Monrovia, he noticed a familiar face on a blurry television screen. 
''I said, 'Why is Jim McGreevey on CNN?''' 
 The reason, as the world now knows, is that Gov. James E. McGreevey announced that he was a ''gay American'' and that he would leave the governor's office. And as Mr. Baroni absorbed the news, on a circuitous route home through Abidjan and Paris, he felt both human sadness for Mr. McGreevey, and a profound concern over the State of New Jersey's government.
 ''It was beyond surreal, in country after country, to be reading this, in multiple languages, to see that personal agony play out,'' Mr. Baroni recalled.
 Now, one year later, the most surreal postscript to Mr. McGreevey's dramatic fall from grace may be the fact that he has disappeared from public view, and that the state's Democrats almost act as if he had never been in office.
 Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey rarely mentions his predecessor. Same thing for Senator Jon S. Corzine, who wants to be Mr. Codey's successor. In fact, when asked about Mr. McGreevey at a news conference last Wednesday, Mr. Corzine had this to say: ''I think Governor Codey has moved the ball down the field pretty effectively in a difficult time.''
 The summertime tourists who visit the State House may also be excused for failing to detect evidence of Mr. McGreevey's tenure. His official portrait, for instance, is finished. But because Mr. McGreevey has not yet asked Mr. Codey's office to schedule a ceremony to unveil the painting, it is unclear when his portrait will be displayed, said Kelley Heck, a spokeswoman for Mr. Codey.
 About the only person who mentions Mr. McGreevey's name with any regularity, in fact, is Douglas R. Forrester, Mr. Corzine's Republican opponent, who lumps him with other Democrats who have been mired in controversy or scandal.
 ''It's become the 'M word','' said Joseph Marbach, chairman of the political science department at Seton Hall University in South Orange.
 Mr. McGreevey's name has become such a political poison pill that even some Republicans feel that schadenfreude should be replaced by sympathy.
 ''I think he was very well intentioned, and people ought not be afraid to mention his name,'' said Pete McDonough, a former spokesman for Mr. McGreevey's predecessor, Gov. Christie Whitman. ''He was a good public servant, and it appears that he did nothing for his own self-aggrandizement.''
 Of course, the anniversary is also a chance to think about what New Jersey might have been like had Mr. McGreevey not left office.
 For one thing, everything that Mr. McGreevey said or did would have been viewed through the prism of his all-but-certain bid for re-election. And given the compromising forces of election-year politics, it is hard to imagine Mr. McGreevey proposing an austere budget -- as Mr. Codey did -- that even Republicans praised.
 ''It was widely perceived, and I think it's fair to say, that McGreevey put politics first,'' said Rick Thigpen, a political consultant and former executive director of the state's Democratic Party.
 Republicans, in particular, believe that Mr. McGreevey would have been more lukewarm than Mr. Codey to ban political contributions by government contractors, a practice known as ''pay to play.'' And part of the reason is that Mr. McGreevey, as the presumptive Democratic nominee, would have needed to raise a lot of money to take on a self-financed multimillionaire like Mr. Forrester.
 It is unlikely, meanwhile, that Mr. McGreevey would have elevated the profile of mental health issues to a degree that Mr. Codey has done. It is also unlikely that he would have reversed course and done what Mr. Codey, an avid sports fan, did: agree to build a new stadium for the New York Giants.
 But the biggest change of all, perhaps, is the speed and thoroughness with which Mr. McGreevey has exited the political scene. After all, we are talking about the same Mr. McGreevey who was so ubiquitous that a running joke, as retold by Mr. Thigpen, was that ''if you get three people together, Jim McGreevey would be the fourth, because the Jim McGreevey we knew was the guy who was willing to go everywhere.''
 Now, however, Mr. McGreevey seems content to be politically invisible. He had been working quietly as a lawyer for the developers of the $1.4 billion Xanadu retail and entertainment mall. But after environmentalists and other critics howled that it was a conflict of interest to be paid to bolster a project he was so closely associated with while in office, he quit his job at the politically connected Weiner Lesniak law firm in Parsippany.
 As for Mr. McGreevey's future, State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, one of the two principals at Weiner Lesniak, said that ''the governor is going to have a lot to say,'' and that he would likely make an announcement about his next endeavors within 30 to 60 days.
 Those endeavors would likely involve work for nonprofit organizations on issues he has long worked on, Mr. Lesniak said, such as ''affordable housing, job training, education and economic development in impoverished areas.''
 In addition -- and this may be the most intriguing part -- ''the positions he's looking at will take him out of the state and out of the country for lengthy periods of time,'' Mr. Lesniak said.
 If Mr. McGreevey indeed becomes a globe-trotting citizen, Mr. Lesniak said that New Jersey residents should judge his abbreviated tenure by considering some of the challenges that confronted Mr. McGreevey when he took office: automobile insurance rates, unhappiness with the Division of Motor Vehicles, problems with the E-ZPass system.
 So is anyone talking about car insurance now? Didn't think so, Mr. Lesniak said. ''It's a tribute to him for having solved those problems and taking them off the gripe list,'' he said.
 In any event, those who do bump into Mr. McGreevey these days say that he is still pleasant and friendly. Indeed, Mr. Baroni said that a former campaign intern of his ran into Mr. McGreevey recently, and that Mr. McGreevey wanted to pass on his greetings. 
 And no, it wasn't in Liberia, or Siberia, but at a Duane Reade pharmacy in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Iran Rejects European Offer To End Its Nuclear Impasse

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
Iran announced Saturday that it would reject a proposal by three European countries aimed at ending the confrontation over Iran's nuclear program. 
 A Foreign Ministry statement announcing the decision came as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in as Iran's new president.
President Ahmadinejad's new government now faces a decision about whether to proceed with Iran's announced plan to continue with a uranium conversion process that Tehran suspended a year ago, a step that the West has said may lead to it seeking sanctions against Iran at the United Nations Security Council. 
 Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, told state radio on Saturday that the European proposal, which was drawn up by Britain, France and Germany on behalf of the European Union, was ''unacceptable.'' 
 ''The proposals do not meet Iran's minimum expectations,'' he said, adding that Iran will send its official rejection to the Europeans within days. 
 Britain, Germany and France, which represent Europe in their negotiations with Iran, offered a package of economic, technological, political and security incentives to Iran on Thursday in return for Iran's cooperation to ensure its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful purposes. 
 The United States said Friday that it supported the European proposal. However, Western diplomats had said earlier that they expected Iran initially to reject the European plan. 
 Iran announced last week that it intended to remove seals the International Atomic Energy Agency had placed on its uranium conversion facilities in Isfahan, where raw uranium can be converted into gas. 
 Uranium enrichment is part of the process of making nuclear fuel, but at higher levels can serve in nuclear weapons. Iran voluntarily suspended the process last year while it negotiated with the Europeans about its nuclear program.
 In his inauguration speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad said Iran would not give up its rights, but did not refer specifically to Iran's nuclear program. 
 ''We want peace and justice for all and they are the integral part of our foreign policy,'' he said, addressing senior Iranian officials and foreign ambassadors at the ceremony. ''I stress on these two principles so that countries which use the instrument of threat against our nation know that our people will never give up its right to justice.''
 ''I don't know why some countries do not want to understand that the Iranian people will never give in to pressure,'' he added. ''When people see such attitude, resistance grows in them and achieving a national right becomes an ideal.'' 
 European officials had said that if Iran rejected the offer, as they expected, the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog, would probably meet on Tuesday in Vienna. 
 Mr. Asefi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said such a meeting would be an effort to pressure Iran.
 Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but it has pursued a policy of concealment about the program for the past 20 years. An Iranian opposition group disclosed in 2002 that Iran had built a facility to enrich uranium in the city of Natanz. 
 The former Iranian government began negotiations in November 2003 with European representatives in an effort to divert the threat of United Nations sanctions and agreed to allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, 48, is taking office at a time of tension inside the country as well. Several bombs went off before the election in June, including one that killed 10 people in the Arab minority region of Ahwaz. Another bomb exploded outside three Western companies in northern Tehran this week and a judge was shot dead on the street. 
 Ethnic unrest in the western region of Kurdistan has led to the death of civilians and security forces. The government has tried to keep the unrest out of the news, but the foreign news media and Web sites have reported the events. 
 In the meantime, the local press has reported that Mr. Ahmadinejad has angered his conservative supporters by his refusal to yield to their choice of cabinet ministers, whom he must introduce to Parliament within two weeks. 
 Analysts said the recent chain of events had raised concerns among many Iranians.
 ''The domestic and international situation Iran is faced with has created the same shock for society that the unexpected victory of Mr. Ahmadinejad created in the election,'' said Hermidas Davood Bavand, a political analyst at Tehran University. 
 ''Society is in a wait-and-see situation but there is a fear that the conservatives' foreign policies might lead the country into a crisis,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hear the Big Pop? A Chinese Search Engine Went Public 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The driving force behind the spectacular market debut of shares in the Chinese search engine company Baidu.com on Friday was its resemblance and ties to Google, whose own offering created a sensation last year, analysts said over the weekend.
 Shares in Baidu soared Friday on the Nasdaq stock market in one of the most successful initial public offerings since the peak of the dot-com era. The stock more than quadrupled by the end of the day, instantly creating the most valuable Internet company in China. The shares were priced at $27 but opened at $66 and then soared to $122.54. 
''This is the biggest pop since the Internet bubble burst,'' said Alan Qiu, a former stock trader and managing director at Ucdao.com, an online gaming and trading company based in Shanghai. ''It's got the Google concept, and people think Google might acquire it. And then there's the China growth factor -- everyone wants to be here.''
 Investors in Baidu include Google and the Silicon Valley venture capital firms Draper Fisher Jurvetson and IDG Ventures. 
 Foreign investors are trying to cash in on an Internet boom in China, where there are now estimated to be about 100 million regular Internet users.
 ''Outsiders are betting on the growth of the Internet in China,'' said Huang Jia Li, an analyst at Shanghai iResearch, a consulting firm. ''And over 80 percent of the Internet users in China are using Baidu.com as their search engine.''
 Over the weekend, several analysts questioned whether Baidu's stock had risen too sharply, creating comparisons with the dot-com era when some Internet companies soared in their debut, only to crash later on.
 But others said that American investors were betting that Baidu would grow into a Chinese powerhouse.
 Eyeing this huge market, American technology giants and venture capitalists have been rushing into China over the last few years, searching for the next Yahoo, Google, eBay or Amazon.com. A group of Chinese entrepreneurs in their 20's and 30's, many of them educated in the United States, have been busy fashioning Chinese versions of American Internet companies. 
 They seem to be succeeding. Backed by foreign investments, Chinese companies like Sohu.com, Shanda Interactive Entertainment, Ctrip.com, Netease.com. and Sina Corporation have all prospered with listings on the Nasdaq stock market in recent years.
 Silicon Valley's biggest companies are also eager to participate. Last year, Yahoo acquired 3721, another successful Chinese search engine company. Then Google bought a 2.5 percent stake in Baidu.com for about $5 million. After Friday's offering, that stake was worth close to $100 million.
 EBay has also come to China, acquiring an online company called Eachnet.com for about $180 million. EBay says it plans to invest another $100 million in China over the next few years in what the company forecasts will become its largest auction market in 10 to 15 years.
 Baidu is a four-year-old company that had just $13 million in revenue last year and about $1.4 million in profit. But in China, Baidu is the search engine leader, followed by Google, according to online research consultants.
 The company hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston to take it public. But even the giant investment banks seemed to underestimate demand for its offering.
 The company is now valued at close to $4 billion, and its co-founder and chief executive, 36-year-old Robin Li, is worth close to $1 billion, easily making him one of China's richest entrepreneurs.
 Baidu's investors also made a fortune on Friday. IDG, one of Baidu's earliest investors, watched the stake it acquired for $1 million a few years ago jump to more than $150 million. And the 28 percent stake that Draper Fisher Jurvetson acquired over the last few years for about $12 million is now valued at close to $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Acting Like There's No Tomorrow When There May Be Many Tomorrows Left

BYLINE: By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
TRYING to figure out how many years you have left to live is not the most enjoyable way to spend a summer day. But it does have its benefits.
 It can help you decide how to invest, what kind of insurance policy to buy and, if you are old enough, whether to splurge on a grand vacation or make do with another trip to the beach this summer.
 Most of the time, human beings do a pretty good job of making these kinds of decisions, whether or not they are consciously thinking about life and death. Generally, 25-year-olds do not buy a lot of life insurance, and most recent retirees sharply reduce their spending, understanding that their money might need to last another 25 years or so. 
 But there are a couple of life moments when people do an unusually poor job of estimating their life spans, and they tend to be times when such guesses can matter the most. 
 Studies show that people who have just been diagnosed with a serious disease tend to be overly pessimistic, thinking their ailment could quickly bring death. After they have outlived their own grim expectations, though, many then swing the other way. They confuse their survival with triumph over the disease. Vulnerability becomes invincibility.
 The elderly seem to follow a similar pattern. People in their early 70's should be more hopeful about living to 85 than they are, surveys have shown. But once they reach 85, they give themselves a better chance of reaching 100 than they truly have.
 These errors are worth some thought these days, as the population bulge known as the baby boom enters its silver years and faces many choices that hinge on expected life span. Couples in northern California will try to figure out when to turn their million-dollar homes into something resembling a pension, while people without such big assets will consider selling their life insurance policies in exchange for an upfront payment. Many of them will make the wrong call -- unless they first understand how human instinct can lead them astray.
 ''When people are making large economic decisions at a time when they're most vulnerable, they're prone to big mistakes,'' said Jay Bhattacharya, a doctor and economist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
 The easiest way to study how long people expect to live is, obviously, to ask them. A survey known as the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old does so, and its results show how the elderly change their expectations over time. 
 Women between the ages of 70 and 74 said they believed they had a roughly even chance of living to 85, according to a paper by Michael D. Hurd, Daniel McFadden and Angela Merrill, published in 1999. In fact, their odds were about 58 percent.
 By contrast, 85-year-old women said they had a 30 percent chance of reaching 100. Only about 7 percent of them would actually do so. Men were even more overly optimistic. Their predictions were similar, while their survival rates were worse. 
 But surveys like these always have one big question hanging over them: do they mean anything? People surely do not think as seriously about a poll question as they would if they had something tangible at stake. So economists looking for insights into human behavior have never liked surveys. They prefer money.
 And money is exactly what it at stake in an obscure part of the insurance business known as viatical settlements, which sprung up in the 1980's, when AIDS was a deadlier disease than it is today. These settlements, Dr. Bhattacharya and two colleagues realized, offer a natural experiment in which people make mortality guesses that really mean something.
 Viatical settlements started as a way to help AIDS patients afford their treatment when they had to pay for it themselves. A group of investors would buy a patient's life insurance policy at a discount, becoming its beneficiary, and the patient would use the money from the sale to buy AIDS drugs that, at the time, often cost more than $15,000 a year.
 A typical patient might have had a policy that would pay a benefit of $100,000 upon death, said Dana P. Goldman, the director of health economics at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., and one of Dr. Bhattacharya's collaborators. (The other was Neeraj Sood, also of RAND.) The longer that the investors thought the patient would live, the less money they would offer for the policy, because they would have to wait longer to claim the benefit.
 For a patient who seemed likely to live for a few more years, they might pay $50,000 for the policy and also take over the monthly premiums of, say, $150. The patient could then afford the drugs, while the investors turned a profit, making them willing to strike similar deals with others.
 ''This type of transaction might seem kind of unseemly,'' Dr. Goldman said. ''But it can be valuable to everyone.'' 
 Whatever you think of the settlements, they clearly work best when everybody has good information about how long patients are likely to live. If the investors are the only ones who understand the odds, they can take the advantage of the patients. 
 In fact, patients in a more advanced stage of AIDS often accepted less money than they should have, suggesting that they expected to live longer than the investors thought they would. They thought they still had years and years to live, so they figured they had to accept a deep discount on their insurance benefit. People with a recent diagnosis, on the other hand, tended to reject many offers. They were less hopeful about their chances than the investors were and thus thought they should receive nearly full value for their policies.
 It is hard to get too upset about the irrational optimists in this story. Hope in the face of long odds can be an inspiring thing, and many doctors believe that it raises a person's chance of recovery. Somebody vowing to beat back a disease probably has more use for emotional support than an actuarial table.
 But if the pessimists -- people with a recent diagnosis, as well as those who have simply entered their 70's and begun to think more about mortality -- knew what the future really held, they might act differently. 
 They might not sell their house quite yet, and they might wait to splurge on that once-in-a-lifetime vacation. (Then again, why wait?) They might even consider a viatical settlement, because that market has spread well beyond AIDS patients in recent years, or an annuity, which makes a yearly payment that can last the rest of a person's life. 
 Best of all, these newly optimistic realists might be a little happier about all that still lies ahead of them.

HEADLINE: Will the Flight Be on Time? It's Anybody's Guess 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Pity the passengers on AirTran Flight 576, which is supposed to leave Atlanta every afternoon at 4:54 and arrive at Newark Airport at 7:07. When it actually gets there, however, is almost anyone's guess. 
 That is because Flight 576 has the dubious distinction of being late more often -- 72 percent of the time -- than any other flight in the United States during the last 12 months, according to government data.
As dismal as that might sound, some travelers have had it even worse this year. Six flights from airlines like United, Delta, Independence Air and, yes, AirTran were delayed 100 percent of the time for a full month this year. The Transportation Department defines a delayed flight as one that departed or arrived at least 15 minutes late. 
 This is not a good time for time-conscious air travelers. Data from the department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics last week showed that this was shaping up to be the worst year for departure delays since 2000. In the year through June, nearly one in five flights, or 17 percent, left airports late. 
 To placate exasperated passengers, airlines have scrambled to get their planes in on time -- by flying faster once in the air, for example, which burns more fuel. This actually led to a minuscule improvement in on-time arrivals this year compared with last year -- 78 percent versus 77.8 percent -- but more than one in five flights still arrived late. At certain times of the day, like late afternoon and evening, and at some airports, like Atlanta Hartsfield, Newark Liberty International and Chicago O'Hare, delays are almost a given, and airline timetables bear little semblance to reality. 
 Chris McGinnis, editor of a travel newsletter called The Ticket, said that the airlines, which have collectively lost $30 billion since 2000 and stand to lose at least another $5 billion this year, are trying to get as many jets in the sky as possible each day in the slim hope of making a little money on each one. 
 ''There are just too many flights trying to get in and out, and that means that there are some flights that are really, really bad,'' said Mr. McGinnis, adding that he has been stuck many times on AirTran's delay-plagued flights from Atlanta.
 The airlines say they would like to do better, and several, including Delta, United and American, have made extensive attempts to improve their performance at the most delay-prone airports. 
 Fundamentally, however, they argue that they are hampered by the nation's overstretched air-traffic control system, by weather and by the need to offer enough flights to compete with other airlines. AirTran says stormy weather at its main hub in Atlanta and heavy traffic in the air are the cause of its troubles.
 And unless told by the government to cut back, as has happened to American and United at Chicago O'Hare, the airlines simply keep flying.
 ''Airlines like to reach right to the threshold to stuff in as many airplanes as they can,'' said Bryan Reiter, the manager of performance and planning at Delta Air Lines, which has two of the 15 most-delayed flights in the country, according to the Transportation Department.
 But Christopher J. Mayer, a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, says airlines can do more. In two studies of airlines' schedules over the last 12 years, Professor Mayer concluded that airlines rarely make adjustments in their timetables, even when they can easily predict when there will be bad weather or heavy traffic, rendering their schedules unrealistic. 
 ''The perception people have that they are abused by the airlines is actually right,'' Professor Mayer said.
 Government statistics bear that out. Through June, 36,000 more flights left the gate late than in the first six months of 2004, and 10,000 more flights were canceled. In raw terms, the number of departure delays, based on 20 airlines this year and 19 last year, was the highest in the 10 years that the Transportation Department has been keeping track -- and that was before the busy summer travel season kicked in.
 Few passengers would seem to have more right to complain than those on perpetually late flights like those from AirTran. Along with the worst-performing flight, AirTran has 4 of the 15 most-delayed flights during the past year, a list that also includes flights by American, US Airways and Delta, according to the government.
 How can an airline let things get so out of hand? Robert Fornaro, the president of AirTran, a low-fare airline that used to be called ValuJet, places the blame for its delayed flights primarily on the weather. 
 During May, for example, the airline's hub in Atlanta, along with much of the South, was frequently hit by severe thunderstorms, Mr. Fornaro said, forcing airport officials to halt all takeoffs -- what the industry calls a ''ground stop.''
 Meant to guarantee travelers' safety, ground stops back up the airlines' schedules for hours and sometimes even days, depending on how long traffic is halted and how many planes are waiting to take off.
 That's why AirTran Flight 41, which leaves Atlanta at 8 p.m., wound up on the 100-percent-late list during the month of May, Mr. Fornaro theorized in an interview late last month.
 ''You can have extremely bad weather, and then by 8 or 9 o'clock at night, everything is running late,'' he said.
 For passengers, there is one saving grace on longer flights, which is that airlines can atone for tardiness en route by flying faster, and modifying their flight plans to avoid heavily trafficked skies. During Mr. McGinnis's cross-country trips, ''A lot of time we'll take off late, but then the pilot will come on and say, 'We will be able to make it up.' Then he'll give it a little gas,'' he said. 
 But airlines can rarely make up time during short flights on the East Coast, the nation's busiest corridor for air travel. That is one reason AirTran's flight from Atlanta to Newark topped the list of the worst-performing flights for the past 12 months. 
 Mr. Fornaro said the airline might not be allowing enough time to complete the flight, promising passengers that it could leave and arrive in too small a window. ''You have to build more pad in the schedule,'' said Mr. Fornaro, although he doubted that the situation would improve any time soon: ''This has been a much more stormy summer'' than in 2004, he said.
 AirTran, Mr. Fornaro said, does everything it can to avoid canceling flights. That approach keeps passengers from being stranded, but it also makes good economic sense. If AirTran can get its flights off the ground, no matter how late, it keeps the ticket revenue. If it rebooks passengers on a rival like Delta, it must reimburse the other airline. 
 Delta is trying its best to get two of its flights off the most-delayed list. It has already retooled one problem performer, Flight 5803, between Washington Dulles and Cincinnati.
 Until June, the flight stopped in Atlanta on the way, only to be hung up frequently by weather delays. Now the flight, operated by the Comair subsidiary of Delta, travels directly between Washington and Cincinnati. While it remains on the worst-performing list, its on-time record has already improved, said Chris E. Kelly, a Delta spokeswoman. 
 Delta has also focused heavily on smoothing out the schedule in Atlanta under a program it calls Operation Clockwork, spreading out flights during the day so it is not hampered by too many flights at rush hours. The effort follows similar bids by American to smooth out its schedules in Miami and Chicago, where United has also tried to retool its operations.
 But Mr. Reiter said the airlines simply couldn't mend every delayed flight. ''There are hundreds of pieces that go into making up a timetable,'' he said. 
 The easiest cosmetic fix for the delays, allotting more time in the schedule to complete flights, causes its own problems. Wholesale changes to an airline's schedule would wreak havoc on the airports' efforts to efficiently manage their gates and would have ripple effects on other airlines. And some airports have curfews after which planes cannot take off and land, so any airline that added too much time could be forced to cut back on service.
 Mr. McGinnis said that because of the number of variables involved, fixing one late flight can actually backfire on an airline. ''That's kind of like squeezing a balloon,'' he said. ''If you pay a whole lot of attention to one flight trying to get it on time, then another flight will be late.''
 Still, Professor Mayer argues that airlines have all the tools they need to fix their flight delays. He sees a more important factor at play: cheap fares. With passengers intent on paying as little as they can for plane tickets, airlines do not think they can successfully market timeliness, he said. So most simply let the issue slide. 
 That makes them like famous doctors who leave patients waiting hours after their appointment times, secure in the knowledge that they will not walk out. 
 Passengers ''are not going to change their behavior,'' Professor Mayer said -- in other words, if they are not willing to spend more money to arrive on time, neither will the airlines.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Blame Each Other for Stalemate in Talks

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing for this article, and David E. Sanger from Aspen, Colo.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
North Korea and the United States on Sunday each blamed the other after nearly two weeks of six-nation negotiations deadlocked over the issue of ''peaceful use'' nuclear programs. 
 But both sides also said an agreement remained possible and confirmed that they would have ''contacts'' during the three-week break in the talks that was announced Sunday. Negotiators from the six countries taking part are scheduled to reconvene in Beijing during the week of Aug. 29.
 Hours before he was scheduled to fly back to Washington, Christopher R. Hill, the top American envoy, said North Korea had derailed the process by unexpectedly making a late demand for the right to operate light-water nuclear reactors. American officials believe the North Koreans could use such reactors to secretly make material for nuclear weapons. 
 Meanwhile, the chief North Korean negotiator, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, said the United States had been unwilling to compromise on North Korea's desire for a peaceful nuclear program and needed to acknowledge its right as a sovereign nation for such a program.
 ''We couldn't meet in the middle because we were too far apart,'' Mr. Kim said. ''What we are making is a just demand.'' 
 This fourth round of nuclear talks extended a record 13 days as negotiators tried to agree on a joint statement of principles that would serve as broad but essential framework for future negotiations. The first three rounds of talks -- which include China, North Korea, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Russia -- ended without progress, and expectations were high for a joint statement in this latest round.
 But on Sunday, Wu Dawei, the chief delegate from China, sought to shift expectations, saying that the delegations had made progress and that the 13 days of negotiations were ''in depth and useful discussions.'' Still, Mr. Wu would not predict whether a joint statement would be reached when the parties reconvene in three weeks.
 ''I cannot say for sure if we will reach agreement on a common paper after the recess, and I also want to stress the ability to issue a joint paper is not the barometer of success of these talks,'' Mr. Wu said.
 Mr. Hill emphasized that agreement on a joint statement of principles is essential to crafting a final disarmament deal. He said that if delegates could agree on such a statement upon their return, he expected that a fifth round of talks could begin as soon as September to address the specifics of a final deal.
 ''We still have a lot of work to do, but I think there is progress,'' said Mr. Hill, upon returning to his hotel midday Sunday after a final meeting of the six delegations.
 His appearance was the last of what had become regular nightly ''doorstop'' news conferences inside his hotel lobby at the end of each day. He used these appearances to shape international news coverage of the talks and to present a more flexible public image for American foreign policy.
 In the past, China had criticized the United States for being too inflexible in its approach to North Korea, particularly its prior unwillingness for bilateral meetings. But in this round the two sides held almost daily private meetings and even shared a dinner at a local North Korean restaurant. Mr. Hill repeatedly portrayed the United States as a reasonable player willing to work with others. He regularly complimented his ''Chinese hosts'' and spoke of the draft joint statement as ''the Chinese draft text.''
 Not only did this play to China's desire to be seen as an international diplomatic player, but it also placed implicit pressure on North Korea, since the draft under consideration was a ''Chinese text,'' not an American one. 
 Kenneth Lieberthal, a former Clinton administration official involved in past negotiations with North Korea, said a recess should not be interpreted as a collapse in the process. Mr. Lieberthal, who has been critical of the Bush administration's handling of the North Korean nuclear issue, said in this latest round ''you had the sense that they were there to tee up a real negotiation.''
 Mr. Lieberthal said it did not surprise him that the North Korean delegation might need to return to Pyongyang for instructions before signing any statement. ''Negotiations with North Korea,'' he said, ''are never, ever easy.''
 In this round, delegates were debating over principles that touched on several fundamental themes: the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; a normalization of relations between North Korea and the United States, South Korea and Japan; energy and economic assistance for North Korea; and the monitoring and verification procedures to ensure that North Korea dismantles its nuclear program.
 In an interview at his hotel, Mr. Hill said that the talks began with great promise and that an agreement began to crystallize after four or five days of meetings. He said this optimism prompted the Chinese to begin assembling draft texts based on comments from each delegation. But as last weekend neared, Mr. Hill said North Korea said it wanted a reference to light-water reactors included in the draft statement.
 ''That was something that the other delegations wouldn't go along with,'' he said. ''These light-water reactors are simply not on the table.''
 North Korea already has one working 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at its main nuclear complex, Yongbyon. It claims to have reprocessed 8,000 spent fuel rods from that reactor into weapons fuel. American experts say that would be enough fuel for roughly six weapons, though it is unclear if the fuel has actually been turned into warheads.
 In the spring, North Korea said it shut down the reactor to harvest a new, but smaller, crop of spent fuel. For this reason, the administration argues that North Korea cannot be trusted with reactors, even a kind considered ''proliferation resistant.'' 
 President Bush canceled a Clinton-era program, negotiated with North Korea as part of a 1994 nuclear freeze accord, to build two such reactors in the North. 
 ''They want that back,'' said one American official involved in the talks. ''But there is no way if you think what they did with their current reactor.'' But the official said the reactor was not the only stumbling block, just the only one Mr. Hill was authorized to discuss publicly.
 Still, there were hints that other delegations might consider language that would allow North Korea eventually to have some sort of peaceful use nuclear program -- if not light-water reactors -- if they rejoined nuclear nonproliferation treaties and allowed in international inspectors. The chief Russian envoy publicly raised such a possibility on Saturday. 
 Mr. Kim, the North Korean envoy, on Sunday again blamed threats from the United States for ''causing us to produce nuclear weapons.'' He said the Americans threaten North Korea with nuclear weapons through security alliances with Japan and South Korea.
 Mr. Hill, who has consistently rejected such accusations, responded by saying that ''the only nuclear weapons that threaten North Korea's future are its own nuclear weapons.''

HEADLINE: That Hissing Sound

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
This is the way the bubble ends: not with a pop, but with a hiss.
 Housing prices move much more slowly than stock prices. There are no Black Mondays, when prices fall 23 percent in a day. In fact, prices often keep rising for a while even after a housing boom goes bust. 
So the news that the U.S. housing bubble is over won't come in the form of plunging prices; it will come in the form of falling sales and rising inventory, as sellers try to get prices that buyers are no longer willing to pay. And the process may already have started.
 Of course, some people still deny that there's a housing bubble. Let me explain how we know that they're wrong.
 One piece of evidence is the sense of frenzy about real estate, which irresistibly brings to mind the stock frenzy of 1999. Even some of the players are the same. The authors of the 1999 best seller ''Dow 36,000'' are now among the most vocal proponents of the view that there is no housing bubble.
 Then there are the numbers. Many bubble deniers point to average prices for the country as a whole, which look worrisome but not totally crazy. When it comes to housing, however, the United States is really two countries, Flatland and the Zoned Zone.
 In Flatland, which occupies the middle of the country, it's easy to build houses. When the demand for houses rises, Flatland metropolitan areas, which don't really have traditional downtowns, just sprawl some more. As a result, housing prices are basically determined by the cost of construction. In Flatland, a housing bubble can't even get started.
 But in the Zoned Zone, which lies along the coasts, a combination of high population density and land-use restrictions -- hence ''zoned'' -- makes it hard to build new houses. So when people become willing to spend more on houses, say because of a fall in mortgage rates, some houses get built, but the prices of existing houses also go up. And if people think that prices will continue to rise, they become willing to spend even more, driving prices still higher, and so on. In other words, the Zoned Zone is prone to housing bubbles. 
 And Zoned Zone housing prices, which have risen much faster than the national average, clearly point to a bubble. 
 In the nation as a whole, housing prices rose about 50 percent between the first quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2005. But that average blends results from Flatland metropolitan areas like Houston and Atlanta, where prices rose 26 and 29 percent respectively, with results from Zoned Zone areas like New York, Miami and San Diego, where prices rose 77, 96 and 118 percent.
 Nobody would pay San Diego prices without believing that prices will continue to rise. Rents rose much more slowly than prices: the Bureau of Labor Statistics index of ''owners' equivalent rent'' rose only 27 percent from late 1999 to late 2004. Business Week reports that by 2004 the cost of renting a house in San Diego was only 40 percent of the cost of owning a similar house -- even taking into account low interest rates on mortgages. So it makes sense to buy in San Diego only if you believe that prices will keep rising rapidly, generating big capital gains. That's pretty much the definition of a bubble. 
 Bubbles end when people stop believing that big capital gains are a sure thing. That's what happened in San Diego at the end of its last housing bubble: after a rapid rise, house prices peaked in 1990. Soon there was a glut of houses on the market, and prices began falling. By 1996, they had declined about 25 percent after adjusting for inflation.
 And that's what's happening in San Diego right now, after a rise in house prices that dwarfs the boom of the 1980's. The number of single-family houses and condos on the market has doubled over the past year. ''Homes that a year or two ago sold virtually overnight -- in many cases triggering bidding wars -- are on the market for weeks,'' reports The Los Angeles Times. The same thing is happening in other formerly hot markets.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has become deeply dependent on the housing bubble. The economic recovery since 2001 has been disappointing in many ways, but it wouldn't have happened at all without soaring spending on residential construction, plus a surge in consumer spending largely based on mortgage refinancing. Did I mention that the personal savings rate has fallen to zero?
 Now we're starting to hear a hissing sound, as the air begins to leak out of the bubble. And everyone -- not just those who own Zoned Zone real estate -- should be worried.

HEADLINE: 'The Thin Man' Is Escapism, From an Unlikely Source

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
Two of the media stars of the summer are a charming husband-and-wife team who made their last film appearance in 1947. Nick and Nora Charles, Dashiell Hammett's wealthy Depression-era detectives, are the hero and heroine of six ''Thin Man'' movies, which were released this month in a boxed set that quickly jumped to No. 1 on Amazon.com's list of best-selling DVD's. 
 If it's surprising that 21st-century Americans find Nick and Nora so appealing, it's no more so than that Hammett, a dedicated socialist with a very dark worldview, created them in the first place.
Hammett was an ex-Pinkerton detective who became a writer of pulp crime stories with unsentimental, sometimes unsympathetic, heroes. His Continental Op, an operative for the fictional Continental Detective Agency, was a sullen loner who was just a few moral notches above the criminals he was tracking down. ''It is a long step from Holmes pondering the significance of a flake of cigar ash,'' one critic has said, ''to Hammett's Op, who, on one occasion, stuffs a length of copper wire into his pocket because it's just the right length to go around somebody's neck.'' 
 Hammett's first full-length novel, ''Red Harvest,'' is a searing story set in a corrupt mining town called Personville and pronounced ''Poisonville'' by the locals. ''Poisonville is right,'' the Continental Op, who ends up engaging in a few bad acts himself, says bitterly. ''It's poisoned me.'' Dorothy Parker once called another Hammett detective, Sam Spade in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' ''so hard-boiled, you could roll him on the White House lawn.'' 
 But then the stock market crashed, and Hammett created Nick Charles, a happily married, semi-retired private eye who lives off his wife's money and cheerfully drinks his way through Manhattan high society. 
 ''The Thin Man'' announces itself right away as a very different kind of novel. It begins with Nick waiting for Nora to finish her Christmas shopping. When she does, she reports that Asta, the couple's spirited terrier, has ''had a swell afternoon -- knocked over a table of toys at Lord & Taylor's, [and] scared a fat woman silly by licking her leg in Saks's.'' Nick and Nora's lives revolve around their elegant apartment, swank parties and posh supper clubs.
 ''The Thin Man'' was made into a classic movie, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, which in turn produced five sequels. Despite their often uninspired, even convoluted, plots, the movies' witty dialogue, engaging acting and sophisticated ambience made them immensely popular. Their great charm lies in Nick and Nora's strikingly modern marriage of equals, and the genteel, carefree world they inhabit.
 Even if it is first-rate escapist entertainment, Hammett purists consider ''The Thin Man'' his weakest novel. It was certainly a moral compromise for a man who identified strongly with the downtrodden and would eventually be jailed during the McCarthy era. 
 He had exposed the rough working of capitalism in ''Red Harvest'' in early 1929, when the economy was still giddy. He could not have helped but be troubled by how much worse things were in 1934, when the unemployment rate was more than 20 percent. Yet that was the time when he was creating his most upbeat, upscale characters.
 There are at least two competing explanations for the new direction Hammett took in ''The Thin Man.'' One is that he was inspired by Lillian Hellman, the playwright with whom he was to have a lifelong, often tortured relationship. 
 Hellman said that Hammett told her she was the model for Nora -- although he also told her, she said, that she was ''the silly girl in the book and the villainess.'' 
 Perhaps a better explanation is that Hammett knew that in hard times, when people opened a popular magazine or a novel, they wanted to read about penthouses, not breadlines. If they would pay to do so, Hammett was more than willing to oblige.
 That may be the reason Nick and Nora are popular again. Leaving the world's grittiness behind to wallow in a life of luxury is a fantasy that is particularly prevalent right now. On a new television show on VH1, ''Kept,'' young men are competing to be the kept man of a wealthy woman. On another, NBC's ''I Want to Be a Hilton,'' young people are vying to be part of a family of rich celebrities. 
 We are not in a Great Depression. But with the economy feeling precarious, the war in Iraq going badly and the headlines filled with London subway bombers and North Korean nuclear weapons, it is comforting for many people to imagine that a rich person might want to take care of them -- or that they are rich themselves, with little more to worry about than how to get over a martini-induced hangover.

Questioning Officials' Role In Military Prison Abuse
Military prosecutors have been moving briskly to dispense with the cases they have filed in the brutal deaths of two Afghan prisoners in 2002 at the American military detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan. Some of the trial testimony has underscored a question long at the core of this case: What is the responsibility of more senior military personnel for the abuses that took place? A1

Less Authentic Old West Town
Tombstone, the famous Old West town in Arizona, is at risk of losing its designation as a national historic landmark because it has been a little too kitschy in embellishing its heritage. The town will hold a three-day public meeting, with federal and state officials in attendance, to discuss whether and how to preserve its historic authenticity. A11

Nominee's Privacy Views
Judge John G. Roberts Jr., President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, has written quite a bit in opposition to a constitutional right to privacy that has served as the basis for Supreme Court decisions protecting abortion and gay rights. But his writings were always on behalf of superiors and clients and might not reflect his own views, then or now. A1

Fossil Poaching in Nebraska
Poaching fossils is a practice the Forest Service says has become rampant in recent years. There is only one federal law enforcement officer patrolling 1.1 million acres of federal grasslands in Nebraska and South Dakota, which makes it easy for those with even the most elementary knowledge of archaeology to take what they want.

HEADLINE: A Fair Policy On Immigration 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Making Immigration Work'' perpetuates the myth that illegal immigrants ''take backbreaking unskilled jobs that Americans don't want.'' This is repeatedly used as a justification for why we should continue to tolerate a porous border: the insinuation that our economy would collapse if these workers disappeared.
Essential service workers include the construction trades: plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, cement finishers and laborers, as well as other skilled or semiskilled workers. These blue-collar trade jobs are traditionally well paying and respectable ways to make a living. 
 When I look around in my community, these are mainly the jobs now being taken by Hispanic immigrants, most of whom are probably undocumented workers. There are many low-income citizens in my community who would welcome the opportunity to work at these jobs, but who are not being hired because the construction contractors hire undocumented workers at lower wages, pay them in cash and avoid paying Social Security and other taxes on a majority of their work force.
 The way to fix illegal immigration is to start enforcing existing laws preventing the hiring of undocumented workers. If a few contractors go to jail, the problem may fix itself.

YOU SAW IT HERE FIRST -- So as not to keep you in suspense, we will reveal the headline now: Fed Board Raises Rate a Quarter Point for 10th Time. That means the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks will go up to 3.5 percent. If there had been any doubt about that, Friday's upbeat job report should have doused it. (Tomorrow.)

 DAY OF RECKONING -- Scott D. Sullivan, right, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, will be sentenced this week for his part in an accounting scandal that forced the company into bankruptcy in 2002. He faces 25 years in jail, the same fate that befell the ex-chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, last month. (Thursday.)

 SEED MONEY -- The Monsanto Company made a genetically modified version of rapeseed for use in animal feed, and the European Commission is expected to give its final approval to the product today -- a rare corporate victory over European foes of letting any such altered plant life into the food chain. The World Trade Organization in Geneva also is to make a ruling Friday on a European Union complaint that the United States has not gone far enough in removing tax breaks for American exporters like Boeing and Microsoft.

 BOUNCING BACK -- Expect the trade deficit to resume its march to a record-breaking year in June. The gap shrank in May, largely because oil prices declined. But they have reversed course sharply, flirting with a record high on Friday. Policy makers and angry members of Congress will be paying close attention to the size of China's surplus. It might be some time before Beijing's modest upward revaluation of the yuan against the dollar in July has any impact on trade, but any widening of last month's $15.8 billion imbalance would be grist for opponents of free-trade agreements. (Friday.)

 RETAIL RETOLD -- Several big retailers will announce results this week: May Department Stores tomorrow, Federated Department Stores on Wednesday and the Kohl's Corporation and Target on Thursday. Last week, Federated and Kohl's joined a large pack of retailers reporting sluggish July sales, though Target did well. Other earnings disclosures coming up include Cisco Systems and Walt Disney tomorrow and Dell on Thursday.

 ECONOMIC INDICATORS United States productivity in the second quarter (tomorrow); weekly jobless claims and retail sales for July (Thursday); balance of trade (Friday).

HEADLINE: Spinoff of Expedia Comes At Tough Time for Its Sector 

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
In the summer of 1978, Dara Khosrowshahi, then 9 years old, left his home in Tehran with his family for their regular vacation in the south of France. With turmoil and revolution rocking Iran, his family did not return to Tehran, and wound up settling in Tarrytown, N.Y.
 ''I like to think I've been on vacation ever since,'' Mr. Khosrowshahi said. 
Now, Mr. Khosrowshahi is going to be involved in a lot of people's vacations. This afternoon, Expedia, the largest online travel agency, is expected to be spun off from its parent, IAC/InterActiveCorp, with Mr. Khosrowshahi becoming its chief executive.
 Mr. Khosrowshahi, now 34, spent the last seven years working for Barry Diller, IAC's chief executive, mainly as a deal maker and financial officer. He started running Expedia in December.
 IAC is trying to bolster its lagging stock price by separating its large travel business from its other units, which include the HSN shopping network, Ticketmaster and the Ask Jeeves search engine. The newly independent Expedia, which will include the Expedia Web site, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor.com, is at a crossroads. Over the last few years, it has gained market share in the online travel industry, which is still taking business from traditional travel agents. But as the economy improves and travel picks up, airlines and hotels are constantly pressing to cut the fees they pay to Expedia. And in the second quarter of this year, Expedia lost market share to Sabre Holdings, Travelocity and Priceline as it cut advertising expenses to maintain profitability. 
 ''There is no question that the game is a lot harder,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''But Expedia moves more product than any other online agency. They are simply better at marketing and better online.''
 Mr. Khosrowshahi is moving quickly to put his own stamp on the company. Last month he reorganized the management, bringing in outsiders as chief financial officer and vice president for technology.
 ''We have a mix of new management and people who have been there for a long time,'' he explained. Mr. Khosrowshahi will move to Seattle, where Expedia is based, with his wife and two young children.
 One of Mr. Khosrowshahi's goals in the reorganization was to repair cracks in what had been one of Expedia's greatest strengths, its ''merchant model'' of selling hotel rooms. Instead of simply taking a commission on hotel rooms sold, Expedia contracts to buy a big block of rooms from a hotel at a deep discount and sells those rooms at a markup. 
 In slow times, hotels were very happy to have guaranteed business, but as times got better and the online travel business got larger, the hotel chains realized that they were effectively paying a much higher cut of the room rate than with traditional commissions.
 Moreover, as other sites moved to copy this approach, the big hotel chains started to rebel, in part because the travel agents were undercutting the prices charged on the chains' own Web sites.
 Expedia, in particular, developed a reputation for arrogance, and a few chains, notably InterContinental Hotels, withdrew their properties from the site.
 Since then, Mr. Khosrowshahi has created a new department devoted to smoothing relationships with hotel companies and other suppliers. And he has changed some policies. For example, Expedia now will agree not to undercut the Web prices offered by the hotel chains. InterContinental hasn't returned, but Mr. Khosrowshahi said, ''I'm optimistic we can figure out a way to do business with them.''
 Hotels and airlines are also encouraging customers to use their Web sites rather than sites like Expedia, and industry analysts say that more people are doing so. For airline tickets, for example, Expedia charges a $5 fee to consumers that the airlines don't charge on their sites.
 ''The hardest thing for us is to build is lasting consumer loyalty,'' Mr. Khosrowshahi said. ''The average consumer shops at three sites; we want to be two of those three sites.'' 
 He said that Expedia would try to differentiate itself through more useful features and additional content, like hotel reviews.
 ''There are enough consumers who are willing to pay for the service we provide,'' he said. 
 Still, with Expedia's growth slowing in the United States, Mr. Khosrowshahi said that many of the company's future opportunities lay outside of the United States.
 ''We are totally passionate about being global,'' he said, attributing that in part to his experience immigrating to the United States. Before taking over Expedia, now the nation's third-biggest travel agency, Mr. Khosrowshahi had never worked in the travel industry. But he was very involved in getting Mr. Diller's company into online travel, perhaps the most successful of its many Web-based enterprises. 
 Mr. Khosrowshahi received an engineering degree from Brown University, but chose a banking job after college. He was a junior banker at Allen & Company, the media investment bank, when he met Mr. Diller. At the time, Mr. Diller was the head of the QVC shopping channel, and Allen & Company was advising him on his attempt to take over Paramount. 
 In 1998, Mr. Khosrowshahi joined Mr. Diller's company, then called USA Networks, as the head of strategic planning. One of his first projects there was to buy a company called 1-800-hotels, which is now called Hotels.com. In 2001, he was involved in buying the controlling stake in Expedia, which Microsoft created in 1995. In 2003, the company bought Hotwire, a deep-discount travel site, and in 2004 it bought TripAdvisor.com, a site with extensive travel reviews.
 At IAC and its predecessors, Mr. Khosrowshahi built a reputation as an affable executive who could both challenge and get along with the mercurial Mr. Diller. 
 ''Dara combines a couple of things Barry has,'' said Jonathan F. Miller, now the chief executive of America Online, who was a top aide to Mr. Diller until 2002. ''He has a real intellectual curiosity about things, combined with real rigor and critical thinking.''
 Mr. Khosrowshahi says that he and Mr. Diller are comfortable debating issues. For example, they are constantly disagreeing over how much cash IAC needs to keep in its corporate coffers. Mr. Diller had accumulated $4.7 billion in the bank as of the end of June. 
 ''I felt we were overcapitalized,'' Mr. Khosrowshahi said. He will now be forced to live with that view. Expedia is leaving IAC with only $100 million in the bank, but no debt.
 Mr. Diller will remain executive chairman of Expedia and will be deeply involved in running the company. Mr. Khosrowshahi says he and Mr. Diller talk every day. Mr. Diller also owns 6 percent of Expedia's shares and, through various arrangements, controls 61 percent of the shareholder votes.

HEADLINE: Productivity Is the Issue Of the Hour For the Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, broke with conventional wisdom and correctly recognized that the United States had entered an era of faster growth in productivity.
 It was a huge shift that allowed the Fed to encourage faster economic growth and increased prosperity without significant inflation.
But as Mr. Greenspan prepares to retire, probably by early January, the Federal Reserve faces a slowdown from the torrid pace of productivity in the past several years. 
 As shown by the big jump in jobs during July, up 207,000 from June, and the more than 1.3 million jobs added this year, the pool of unemployed workers is dwindling and wages are rising faster than productivity. The big question for the Federal Reserve is whether the lull is simply a return to the average pace since 1995 or a return to the doldrums that prevailed from the early 1970's to the early 1990's.
 With economic growth strong and labor costs rising, Fed officials are all but certain to raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday to 3.5 percent and to increase them again to at least 4 percent by the end of the year as they grope toward a neutral monetary policy.
 The issue of productivity growth lies behind much of the debate. If output climbs more slowly than labor costs, companies will be under pressure to raise prices. If output rises in line with labor costs, whether because of new technology or new ways of doing business, wages and employment can rise without contributing to inflation.
 Productivity growth has slowed sharply in the last year, but Fed officials and most outside specialists said this was to be expected. Productivity often surges in the early part of an economic recovery, as companies rush to meet higher demand but are still too nervous to add workers, and then slows as employment picks up. 
 The issue for Fed officials is the long-term trend.
 From about 1973 to 1995, productivity rose an average of 1.5 percent a year. But the pace nearly doubled after 1995, to almost 3 percent, as major advances in technology spurred big drops in the cost of computing power and companies invested heavily in information technology.
 Productivity growth shot up to 4 percent a year from 2001 through 2004. Employers shaken by the recession of 2001 and then uncertainties tied to terrorism and war sought and found ways to increase production without hiring workers. And because many companies overspent on technology in the 1990's, they were able to generate new efficiencies without additional investment in the years that followed.
 The superheated productivity, which caused anemic job growth for three years, appears to be ending. 
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hourly wages for nonfarm businesses climbed at an annual rate of 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 -- the biggest jump in almost five years -- and by 6.3 percent in the first three months of this year. 
 Unit labor costs, or the cost of labor for a given amount of output, went down in 2001 and 2002 but have climbed sharply since the middle of last year. 
 So far, productivity has remained strong -- 4 percent in 2004, for the third year in a row, and 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2005.
 Fed economists say they believe the normal rate of productivity growth in the new era is about 2.5 percent. 
 But Mr. Greenspan recently cautioned that predictions were difficult, because the pace of productivity growth depends heavily on the pace of technological innovation. 
 ''Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has benefited from a remarkable acceleration of productivity,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last month. ''But experience suggests that such rapid advances are unlikely to be maintained in an economy that has reached the cutting edge of technology.''
 Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have noted that there are some possible red flags. One measure of technological innovation is the drop in prices for computing power and communications.
 Those declines have been much smaller in recent years than they were in the boom years of the late 90's. According to the Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis, which prepares the government's growth statistics, technology prices are falling much slower now than in the 1990's.
 Prices for computer equipment, adjusted for increases in processing power, plunged by more than 23 percent a year from 1995 through 1999. But since 2000, the declines have slowed to about 10 percent -- roughly where they were before the big productivity boom.
 A similar pattern holds for prices on a broader array of information and communications technology. 
 ''The rate of technical change, which is the most difficult thing to measure, seems to be slowing from the unprecedented pace of a few years ago,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. 
 The issue is important to future productivity, because many analysts say they believe that plunging technology prices were responsible -- along with the dot-com stock market bubble -- for a big part of the huge investment in such equipment during the 1990's.
 Mr. Zandi added that investment in technology, though strong, was not as strong as it was when the productivity boom took off. As a share of gross domestic product, investment in equipment and software has slipped from about 9 percent in the late 1990's to 8 percent today.
 But in a paper published last December by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a trio of economists predicted that technology would keep productivity growth about 2.6 percent.
 Dale Jorgenson, a professor at Harvard and a co-author of the study, said last week, ''We are experiencing productivity growth that is very high by historic standards, and there is nothing on the horizon to slow it down,'' 
 The biggest risk, he cautioned, is not that innovation will slow down but that the United States is too dependent on foreign capital for its investments. ''Productivity is zooming along because of the investment, but we are not financing much of this ourselves,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch, Redefining 'Vacation'

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush left for his summer vacation last week, and so did a lot of the White House senior staff.
 Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, headed for his house in the Florida Panhandle. Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, was with his family in Poland Spring, Me. Nicolle Devenish, the White House communications director, had plans to leave late in the month for her September wedding on Mykonos, in the Greek islands. 
Mr. Bush, of course, was in the less exotic blast furnace of his Texas ranch, settling in for a five-week stay on the prairie that will be his longest time away from Washington as president. His return to his full August idyll -- Mr. Bush cut short his time at the ranch last summer because of his re-election campaign -- is not only the length of a classic French vacation, but grist for some Democrats, who have accused the president of fleeing Washington to escape the federal investigation into who leaked the name of a Central Intelligence Agency officer to reporters, a potential crime.
 But in his first days away, Mr. Bush was relatively busy. He gave a speech on Wednesday in Grapevine, Tex., and met with the president of Colombia at the ranch on Thursday. He is to travel to New Mexico today, meet with his economic advisers and hold a news conference at the ranch tomorrow, travel to Illinois on Wednesday, meet with his foreign policy team and hold another news conference back at the ranch on Thursday, go to a Republican fund-raising lunch at a neighboring ranch on Friday and attend a Little League championship game in Waco, Tex., on Saturday.
 One reason for the activity might be the desire to be in purposeful motion on another anniversary of the now-infamous C.I.A. briefing that Mr. Bush received at the ranch on Aug. 6, 2001. That briefing, which informed the new president that the terrorist network Al Qaeda had maintained an active presence in the United States for years and could be preparing for hijackings here, created a political uproar when its contents were eventually made public. 
 Critics have long called it a symbol of the administration's complacency in the slow summer days before the catastrophe of Sept. 11, 2001. Administration officials have countered that there was no specific information to act on, and that the briefing never warned that planes could be used as missiles.
 Then as now, White House officials take turns doing Crawford duty, which nobody fights for. This past week, Joe Hagin, a deputy White House chief of staff, was settled into his double-wide trailer across the road from the entrance to the ranch, where his job includes chainsaw time with the president. 
 At some point this summer Mr. Hagin will switch off with Mr. Rove, who has testified to a grand jury in the leak investigation and who in the past has not done long stretches of ranch time. But when Mr. Rove was elevated to White House deputy chief of staff after Mr. Bush's re-election, the promotion came with summer Crawford duty.
 Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, will split his ranch duty with his deputy, J.D. Crouch. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was freed from ranch duty when she moved on from national security adviser, will visit anyway, first for the foreign policy meeting this week, then for more of a social visit later in the month.
 Mr. Card does not do ranch duty, although he is expected briefly for the economic meeting on Tuesday, as are Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, and Treasury Secretary John Snow. If the past is any guide, the men will meet with Mr. Bush, stand at his side during a news conference under a blistering sun, then race for the airport.
 Meanwhile, back at a sleepy White House, major August repairs were under way.
 The walnut and oak floor of the Oval Office, installed during the Reagan administration and now thin from constant refinishing, was to be ripped up and replaced. The irrigation system on the White House grounds was to be replaced, too. The masonry and stucco in the West and East Colonnades was under restoration, and the windows along the East Colonnade were being repaired.
 But for the staff members left behind, it was not entirely quiet. ''It's always something,'' said one administration official who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen as complaining about the job. ''Somebody's dying or something blows up or somebody issues a tape. We never really cool off that much.''
 On the other hand, it was definitely August. ''It's a nice pace,'' said Susan Whitson, Laura Bush's press secretary. ''You can come in around 8 o'clock and still find parking.''

HEADLINE: ATOMIC ACTIVITY RESUMES IN IRAN AMID WARNINGS

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and JOEL BRINKLEY; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran for this article, and Joel Brinkley from Washington. David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Aspen, Colo.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Iran resumed sensitive nuclear activities at one of its facilities on Monday, despite warnings from European negotiators that the move would prompt them to refer the case to the United Nations Security Council for punitive action.
 With surveillance cameras from the International Atomic Energy Agency installed, Iranian technicians at a facility outside Isfahan resumed the intricate process of converting uranium that Iran says is intended to yield energy but that the West worries is a precursor to the development of nuclear weapons.
The United States and its European allies reacted with dismay to the renewed activity, and left little doubt that they would take Iran to the Security Council with a recommendation for economic sanctions if Iran does not back down.
 The State Department even held out the possibility that the United States might deny a visa to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was sworn in Saturday as Iran's president, to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month. 
 Iran has long contended that it has the legal right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to convert and enrich uranium for peaceful energy purposes, but agreed to suspend its activities as long as negotiations lasted with Britain, France and Germany over its nuclear program. Iran has admitted to deceiving inspectors for 17 years about many of its activities, and the United States argues that those deceptions effectively negate its right to a full nuclear program and that they provide a basis for international sanctions.
 Concerned that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, European negotiators put forward a proposal last week -- with the support of the United States -- to provide Iran with economic, technological, security and political incentives if it permanently abandoned its conversion and enrichment activities. 
 But Iran rejected the proposal, saying the offer failed to meet its ''minimum expectations.'' Even before rebuffing the offer, Iran had asked the agency to set up cameras at the facility so that it could resume its nuclear program under international inspection, as the nonproliferation treaty requires. 
 Mohammad Saidi, vice president of Iran's Atomic Organization, who was at the facility near Isfahan on Monday, said that Iran would like to continue negotiating with Europe and that it intended to keep its freeze on nuclear enrichment. 
 Yet the facility began an earlier stage of the process, known as conversion, the official Iranian news agency, IRNA, reported. Converting uranium can lead to energy production or, ultimately, nuclear weapons. 
 The French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, called the Iranian actions ''a grave crisis.'' Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, told ARD television that the nuclear issue ''will end up at the Security Council if Iran does not give in.''
 European diplomats said Iran would be presented with an ultimatum during a meeting of the agency's board of governors in Vienna on Tuesday: Cease the uranium conversion, or face sanctions. Although no timetable has been set for a response, officials and diplomats said the issue would probably be taken up during the United Nations meeting in September.
 The three European nations that have been negotiating with Iran for two years, along with the European Union, threatened last week to end the talks should Iran resume its nuclear development. The European diplomats said they would follow through on that threat if Iran did not respond positively to the last-chance ultimatum that is to be issued after the meeting in Vienna.
 ''It definitely will end the negotiations,'' a European diplomat said. He and others declined to be identified before a formal position is taken at the meeting.
 A senior Bush administration official said the United States would support a motion for United Nations sanctions, should Iran not back down. Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman, said ''this is Iran thumbing its nose at a productive approach'' by the Europeans. ''We'll have to work together to take a response.''
 Uranium conversion involves turning mined uranium, known as yellowcake, into a gas known as uranium tetrafluoride, or UF4. The gas is then turned into uranium hexafluoride, or UF6, which can be fed into centrifuges for enrichment. The process can lead to making nuclear fuel or, if enriched to high levels, weapons. 
 The Iranian news agency reported that yellowcake was injected into the equipment for making UF4 on Monday. It also said the rest of the facility would be operational after the agency's inspectors removed the seals at other sections and installed the cameras. 
 Iran's action on Monday was largely symbolic -- the conversion of raw uranium into gas is many steps removed from making a weapon, and Iran says it possesses uranium in gas form -- but it poses both a short- and long-term challenge to Europe and the Bush administration.
 The immediate challenge is to determine if the European nations and the United States can now win over enough members of the agency's board to refer Iran to the Security Council for possible sanctions. It is a risky political effort, both because the agency's board might balk, and because Iran has threatened to pull out of the nonproliferation treaty if it is subjected to sanctions. North Korea did exactly that two and a half years ago.
 The longer-term challenge is to President Bush's effort to ensure that no new nations are allowed to produce enriched uranium or to reprocess plutonium, the two routes to making a nuclear bomb. In essence, Mr. Bush wants to break the ''nuclear fuel cycle,'' the ability of a country to produce its own nuclear fuel, which could then be used for either civilian or military purposes. For that reason, the United States refused last week to go along with demands by North Korea that it be allowed to retain a nuclear reactor. 
 Iran has a large reactor under construction, though Washington has prevailed on Russia to take back the spent fuel that it sells to Iran. If that plan works, the fuel would not be available for bomb-making.
 Iran argues that under the nonproliferation treaty it has a right to a civilian nuclear power program, and it points out that no one has ever proved that it is seeking to produce a nuclear weapon. 
 If the United States denies a visa for Mr. Ahmadinejad, the State Department said, it would be as much for his possible role in the taking of American hostages in Tehran in 1979 as for Iran's nuclear activities today. Thus far, the government has found no evidence to support the hostages' allegations that he was among their captors.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is planning to address the United Nations General Assembly to discuss Iran's nuclear program and other foreign policy issues, the Iranian news agency Fars reported.
 A spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council said Monday that Mr. Ahmadinejad appointed a conservative politician to replace Hassan Rowhani, a pragmatic negotiator who led the talks with Europe for two years. 
 The new lead negotiator, Ali Larijani, was a security adviser to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last year he described Iran's decision to freeze its nuclear activities while it tried to reach a settlement with Europe as ''trading a pearl for a lollipop.''
 Analysts in Tehran linked Iran's decision to resume work at the facility with the new president's policies.
 ''It seems that Mr. Ahmadinejad's team wants to reject the past policies in the first week that it is taking office,'' said Mohammad Hafezian, a political analyst in Tehran.
 The previous team, he added, ''would not have started work so unexpectedly and without coordination with the international community.''

HEADLINE: Jets Greet Law And Say So Long To Mickens

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Since March, Ty Law has worked tirelessly to make his surgically repaired left foot as good as new, the better to carry some N.F.L. defense on his shoulders. On Monday, Law was able to piggyback his 5-year-old daughter off the field after his first practice with his new team, which made him happy. 
 Tya lives in New York, and now, so does her father.
 Law, a four-time Pro Bowl selection who won three Super Bowls with the New England Patriots, agreed late Sunday night to a multiyear, incentive-laden deal that could pay him as much as $28.5 million over the next three years and $50 million over seven years. The contract, said Law's agent, Carl Poston, is complex, reflecting the circumstances in which Law became a star without a team. 
 Law, who has 36 interceptions in his 10-year career, fractured his left foot in a game at Pittsburgh on Oct. 31 and finished the season on injured reserve. He had surgery in January and was released in February by the Patriots in a move spurred by salary-cap considerations.
 After taking a physical Monday morning, Law, 31, was introduced as a member of the Jets in the afternoon and participated in a few drills after that. To make room under the cap for Law, the Jets released five players: running back Delvin Joyce; offensive lineman David Yovanovits; safety Derek Pagel; cornerback Roosevelt Williams; and cornerback Ray Mickens, who was coming back from a knee injury that caused him to miss last season. 
 Law worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs, the Detroit Lions and the Jacksonville Jaguars, and he had recently talked with Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, whom he said was interested in taking him back. But Law said, ''This was definitely my first choice since the beginning, so I'm glad everything worked out.''
 So are the Jets, who look at Law as a player capable of getting them to the Super Bowl. The Jets came within a field goal of advancing to the American Football Conference championship game last season. 
 ''He's a shutdown-corner-type guy,'' Jets center Kevin Mawae said. ''He's a guy that can make the big plays and help us win the championship. Hopefully he can bring that experience, intensity and work ethic and help all of the young guys.'' 
 Jets receiver Chas Gessner gained an appreciation of the qualities that set Law apart last season when he went through the entire Patriots' training camp before becoming one of the final cuts. ''Ty's a competitor,'' Gessner said. ''I'd be lining up and he'd be saying, 'You're dead,' that kind of thing.''
 Gessner said Law had a choreographer's attention to detail. ''He comes out at practice and he works more on his technique,'' Gessner said. ''He tries to get his steps down, tries to get his technique down.'' 
 When Law was with the Patriots, he was routinely assigned to cover the opposing team's top receiver. If he can fill the same role with the Jets, it would allow the defensive coordinator Donnie Henderson to blitz as much as he wants.
 ''You can play a little bit more man and be a little bit more aggressive,'' Henderson said last week. 
 Law grew up in Pittsburgh, not far from running back Curtis Martin, and broke into the N.F.L. with him in New England in 1995. The desire to play with Martin and for Coach Herman Edwards and against the Patriots all loomed large, Law said, in his decision to sign with the Jets. 
 ''First of all, I'd have to say that this is the division that I feel comfortable in,'' Law said. ''A lot of it had to do with Coach Edwards. I've known him over the years, and I'm fond of him as a coach and as a friend. He was a big factor along with Curtis Martin. We came in together and always talked about one day meeting back up at some point.''
 Martin said that Sunday night, after the last of the contract hurdles had been cleared, he and Law ''were slapping and high-fiving and everything.''
 Martin added: ''To get a player like Ty is rare. Marquee players who are in the upper echelon of players in their position, who you say 'this could be the best person in the game at their position,' it's rare that people like that come up and I'm glad we seized the opportunity and got him.'' 
 As happy as the Jets were to welcome Law, they were sorry to see Mickens go. Mickens, a 10-year pro who was drafted by the Jets and had the longest tenure on the team of any player on defense, was a victim of the salary cap. His $1.2 million salary doomed him even though he was, by all accounts, an asset on and off the field. 
 When asked last week about the possibility of the Jets signing Law, Mickens, who had 79 passes defensed and 11 interceptions in 126 regular-season games, said: ''I hope we get him. It's just going to make us even stronger in the secondary.'' 
 Unselfish one day, unemployed the next. ''That's the difficulty of it,'' Edwards said. The salary cap, he added, ''forces you to do something that you don't like doing as a coach because it has nothing to do with ability.'' 
 ''You always want to make your decision on talent and ability, how the guy plays, not he makes this much money,'' Edwards continued. ''It's a tough deal.''
 Jonathan Vilma, the Jets' second-year linebacker, spoke with Mickens and Law on Sunday night. He said he went to sleep thinking how lucky he was to have both for teammates. ''I come in this morning,'' Vilma said, ''and Ray's saying goodbye to me. It was a little surprising, a little shocking and kind of tough to see him go so quickly.''
 With the signing of Law to a multiyear deal after a season cut short by injury, the spotlight shifted to defensive end John Abraham, the team's franchise player, who has refused to sign a $6.67 million offer sheet because he desires a long-term deal after a season cut short by injury.
 A message left with his agent, Tony Agnone, was not answered. 
 Abraham, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, cannot report to camp until he is signed, and he is clearly missed. During the morning workout, a fan in the bleachers shouted, ''When's John coming in?'' 
 Edwards turned toward the stands and, with his arms outstretched and palms extending skyward, shrugged and shouted back, ''We don't play until September.'' 
 Law's arrival has given Jets fans more reason to count down the days.

HEADLINE: Whirlpool Raises Maytag Bid To $20 a Share, Adding $2 

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation yesterday raised its bid for the Maytag Corporation, its competitor in the appliance market, to $1.62 billion in cash and stock.
 The offer, which works out to $20 a share, tops both Whirlpool's most recent $18-a-share proposal and the all-cash bid of $14 a share that Maytag originally accepted from an investment group led by Ripplewood Holdings, the private equity firm. Whirlpool had until today to raise its offer. 
Whirlpool, which is based in Benton Harbor, Mich., originally offered $17 a share for Maytag in mid-July and has been the most persistent bidder in a crowded field. In addition to the Ripplewood bid, Maytag, which is based in Newton, Iowa, received a $16-a-share offer in June from a consortium comprising the Haier Electronics Group of China, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group. That offer was withdrawn when Ripplewood threatened to collect a $40 million breakup fee.
 Whirlpool's sweetened bid calls for the payment of that breakup fee to the Ripplewood group, the assumption of $977 million in debt and a $120 million payment to Maytag if regulators reject the deal. 
 ''The $20 bid was a little bit of a surprise,'' said David MacGregor, an analyst at Longbow Research, an independent research firm based in Cleveland. ''It reflects a high level of conviction in synergies and sends a pre-emptive signal to other bidders.''
 Shares of Maytag gained $1.60, or 9.4 percent, to $18.58 on the news. They are down 12 percent this year. Whirlpool closed up $2.75, or 3.5 percent, to $82.46.
 A spokesman for Ripplewood had no comment, and a Maytag spokesman would only confirm that the company had received the latest Whirlpool offer. 
 In a letter to Maytag's management, Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive, wrote, ''We are providing a tremendous economic package of benefits to Maytag and its shareholders, and one that we believe would be strongly welcomed and supported by your shareholders.''
 Mr. Fettig has tried to assuage concerns that a Whirlpool-Maytag alliance, which would consolidate control of nearly half the domestic market for appliances, would be anticompetitive. In a quarterly analyst conference call in July, he noted that the combined company's market share in eight core product categories -- including refrigerators, washers, dryers and dishwashers -- would still be less than 30 percent.
 If completed, the deal would bring Amana, KitchenAid, Magic Chef, Hoover and Jenn-Air under one corporate roof.
 Last year, Maytag announced its first annual loss in nearly a decade on tough competition from rivals with lower manufacturing costs. The company has since reduced its dividend and said that job cuts could be in the offing.
 Maytag has scheduled a special shareholders meeting for Aug. 19 to vote on the Ripplewood offer; Whirlpool's bid expires the following day.
 ''I think it's going to be very difficult for Ripplewood to beat it,'' Mr. MacGregor said.

HEADLINE: G.M. Thrives in China With Small, Thrifty Vans 

BYLINE: BY KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: LIUZHOU, China 

 BODY:
In this obscure corner of southern China, General Motors seems to have hit on a hot new formula: $5,000 minivans that get 43 miles to the gallon in city driving. That combination of advantages has captivated Chinese buyers, propelling G.M. into the leading spot in this nascent car market. 
 Compact and utilitarian, these vehicles, called Wuling Sunshine minivans, hardly fit the big-is-better image of G.M., known in the United States for producing some of the largest gas guzzlers on the market, like Hummers.
The minivans, which G.M. builds in a joint venture with a Chinese partner, have a quarter the horsepower of American minivans, weak acceleration and a top speed of 81 miles an hour. The seats are only a third the thickness of seats in Western models but look plush compared with some Chinese cars. 
 Their development was led by an American, Philip F. Murtaugh, a native of Ohio and a maverick executive who was willing to zig while the rest of G.M. was zagging. Mr. Murtaugh was able to create in China the kind of innovative environment that G.M. has struggled for decades to achieve in its American operations. But whether G.M. can duplicate elsewhere its achievements in China or even keep its pace here is unclear. 
 In what may be a telling sign of the corporate culture at G.M., Mr. Murtaugh's success in China led not to promotion but to his departure from the company. G.M. declined to discuss personnel matters, but both it and Mr. Murtaugh said he resigned and was not dismissed. 
 A soft-spoken man in a company known for autocratic leaders, Mr. Murtaugh ran the China operations for more than nine years from his base in Shanghai, repeatedly making some of the best calls in the industry. Now he finds himself unemployed and living in a small community in rural Kentucky.
 His resignation in March, at the age of 49, came shortly after senior company executives reorganized management to give more power to Detroit executives to oversee design, engineering and various manufacturing disciplines all over the world, including operations in China.
 The shift was supposed to allow greater coordination between the growing Chinese operations and the rest of G.M.'s businesses. Other G.M. regional executives had already been more under Detroit's control and did not leave the company. 
 For years, G.M. has linked its fortunes in the United States to the sale of big vehicles, like Chevrolet Suburbans, only to find oil prices soaring and many Americans nervous about paying more than $50 for a tank of gas. 
 But here in China, Mr. Murtaugh's G.M. was the only multinational automaker that spotted the potential in the late 1990's for building lots of small, inexpensive, fuel-sipping cars, minivans and pickup trucks.
 ''It is impressive, and it is strategically very smart,'' said Michael Dunne, president of Automotive Resources Asia, a consulting firm based in Beijing and Bangkok.
 The utilitarian minivans and pickups are mainly purchased in China by small-business owners in towns and smaller cities, who drive them both to carry supplies for their businesses and to transport their families. Gasoline in China is slightly cheaper than in the United States, as the government is gradually passing on price increases to consumers. 
 The minivans have been a big hit, helping G.M. sell more than 170,000 very small vehicles -- automobile types not available in the United States -- and to pass Volkswagen this year in sales in a market that VW has dominated for two decades. They have helped turn China into G.M.'s biggest center of automotive profit -- in contrast to losses in manufacturing operations in the United States -- and its second-largest market in terms of the number of vehicles sold, after the United States. 
 In the important market for larger cars, those not made by the Wuling joint venture, Honda, Toyota and Hyundai are gaining on Volkswagen and, to a lesser extent, G.M.
 Such slippage is a familiar experience for G.M. at home. It has repeatedly failed to halt a slide in its domestic market share that began in the 1960's, and has faced the humiliation of seeing its bonds downgraded to junk status this spring. G.M.'s success in China shows that the company, the world's largest automaker, can still summon the energy and innovation occasionally to take command of a big market.
 The Chinese government has also encouraged a shift toward more efficient models through stringent fuel-economy regulations, even as Congress has opted for more subsidies for oil production and a limit on hybrid car subsidies.
 G.M.'s reward came in the first half of this year, when demand for the utilitarian vehicle market in China soared in response to steep gasoline prices and rising prosperity among peasants and small-business owners. G.M.'s sales of spartan minivans and pickups and of very small cars have climbed faster than those of its rivals, to 172,368 in the first half of this year, up 48.7 percent from the period a year earlier.
 Its Asian and Pacific division -- just 5 percent of worldwide sales -- is increasingly dominated by the fortunes of its China business. The division earned $176 million in the second quarter, even as overall automotive operations lost $948 million amid heavy losses in North America. 
 The factory here now runs day and night, six days a week. ''When the employees stop for lunch, the maintenance people run in,'' said Yao Zuo Ping, the chief of manufacturing.
 Mr. Murtaugh played a central role in 1996 in setting up the company's main operation in China, a 50-50 joint venture with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, or S.A.I.C. Instead of following the usual G.M. career track of bouncing through assignments around the world every couple of years, he stayed on to run the operation for nearly a decade. 
 In the late 90's, he noticed that millions of small-business owners and affluent peasants were not yet prosperous enough to afford the latest Western models but were saving enough to acquire more frugal vehicles selling for less than $5,000.
 ''Essentially, it is his baby,'' said Stephen Small, the joint venture's G.M.-appointed chief financial officer. 
 Mr. Murtaugh never learned to speak Chinese, but he was instrumental in setting up the Liuzhou joint venture, which is 34 percent owned by G.M., 50.1 percent by S.A.I.C. and the rest by the Liuzhou Wuling Automotive Company. His personal skills and ability to explain the latest ways to run a factory, often borrowed from Japanese automakers, made a deep impression with executives here, as did his regular visits.
 ''Murtaugh himself was actually paying a lot of attention to our facility here,'' said Shen Yang, the president of the joint venture and a leading executive at the factory for more than a decade before G.M. invested here. 
 To build the cars, G.M. helped gut and rebuild a former tractor factory in ways that could become a model for automobile production in China for years to come.
 Long white halls erected in 1958 during Mao's Great Leap Forward still stand here, the paint peeling in places, the wood window frames warped and the windowpanes cracked and broken. Inside, however, is a factory that combines old and new management techniques. Small, plastic racks of parts delivered several times or more a day have replaced large bins of parts delivered to the assembly line in big shipments every few days. This way, the factory can keep low inventories and order quick design changes, if necessary, from nearby suppliers.
 The assembly process has only one robot, for sealing windshields, relying mostly on workers earning $60 a month, above average for this impoverished region. That comes after G.M.'s experience in Shanghai, where it installed four dozen robots for its first assembly line only to find them much costlier and less flexible than people; G.M.'s second assembly line there was built with only four robots.
 ''Low cost doesn't just mean low wages, it means low investment,'' Mr. Small said.
 Worker safety in most Chinese factories is abysmal by Western standards. But workers at the factory here wear safety glasses, and the equipment has automatic cutoffs to prevent workers from losing fingers.
 Mr. Murtaugh said in a telephone interview from his home, now in Cadiz, Ky., that he made safety suggestions at the start of his first visit to the factory in 1999. ''We got about 20 paces inside the stamping plant and I said to Shen Yang, 'How many eye surgeries and finger amputations do you perform every year?'''
 Before the joint venture began to be set up in 1999, Wuling did not even have procedures for handling workers' suggestions. Now, the workers are given extensive information about the performance of their units and encouraged to submit suggestions. The factory received 4,000 suggestions from its 5,000 employees last year, and as many suggestions again in the first five months of this year. 
 Zhou Libo, a 28-year-old worker who welds minivan underbodies and has worked here for 10 years, said that until the last several years, ''We made a lot of parts that were not good quality and had to be thrown away.''
 Mr. Murtaugh's departure was widely seen within the automotive industry as linked to moves by G.M. that limited his autonomy. Last summer, the company transferred executives from Singapore to an office just down the street from Mr. Murtaugh's in Shanghai, a shift that made closer supervision possible.
 Mr. Shen, the president of the joint venture here, becomes visibly emotional when he mentions Mr. Murtaugh's surprise departure.
 ''I have a very good relationship with Mr. Murtaugh, he is my friend, and seeing him leave is very hard on me,'' Mr. Shen said, his voice catching slightly. ''He was both a teacher and a friend.''
 Mr. Murtaugh said that he was playing a little golf now, but found himself with many idle hours.
 ''I'm looking for work,'' he said, and then joked, ''do you have a deck that needs painting?''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices, Amid Global Concerns, Surge to a Record

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
With little news to restrain oil markets, crude prices began the week by hitting a record $64 a barrel yesterday, pushed higher by concerns over Middle East supplies and refinery shutdowns in the United States.
 Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $63.94 a barrel, up $1.63, or 2.6 percent, after climbing as high as $64 shortly before the end of the regular session. Oil prices have risen 47 percent this year.
The latest high was set on the day that President Bush signed an energy bill more than four years in the making. The legislation provides some incentives for domestic oil and gas producers but does little to curb consumption. 
 The refinery outages sent gasoline prices soaring to record highs as well. On the Nymex, gasoline futures closed at $1.86 a gallon, up 1.5 percent, the contract's highest-ever close. With refineries running near their maximum capacity during the summer months, a time when demand for gasoline is at its highest, motorists are now paying an average $2.37 a gallon, about 49 cents a gallon more than at the same time last year according to national estimates compiled by the Energy Information Administration.
 After a week of record-breaking sessions, the latest surge in prices came as United States diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia, including the embassy in Riyadh and consulates in Dhahran and Jeddah, were closed for two days amid reports of planned attacks. 
 Oil markets are sensitive to any threat to the stability of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter. Last week, Crown Prince Abdullah became the new king after the death of his half-brother, Fahd.
 Adding to the political anxiety, Iran, the second-largest oil producer within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, began work at its uranium reprocessing plant in Isfahan, a move that is certain to ignite, at minimum, a diplomatic confrontation with the West.
 ''Iran is back in the headlines,'' said Katherine B. Spector, the head of global energy strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York. Over the weekend, Iran rejected a European economic and political package aimed at breaking the deadlock over the country's nuclear program.
 For most of the last two years, oil markets have been volatile, a reflection of the lack of spare production capacity worldwide, inadequate refineries, strong consumer demand in the United States and China, and supply disruptions from major producers like Iraq and Venezuela. That has led to a doubling of oil prices since 2003.
 The strain on refineries is beginning to show in the United States as they operate at full capacity to meet summer gasoline demand. In recent weeks, several unplanned shutdowns, incidents or accidents have sparked concerns that supplies would be unable to meet demand through the end of the year. 
 ''Refiners are exhausted, like runners in midmarathon,'' said Deborah White, a senior commodities economist with Societe Generale in Paris. ''They've been pushing very hard since last year. As a practical matter, these things have limits. If you push too hard, capacity drops.''
 The latest incident was a fire on Saturday that shut a refinery in Philadelphia that produced 200,000 barrels a day. There was no word from its operator, Sunoco, on when the refinery would restart. That follows a long list of shutdowns at major refineries owned by BP, Exxon Mobil and Valero.
 ''Other than the weather, and hurricanes, and refineries going down, and Saudi Arabia and Iran, and strong economic statistics, there really is no reason why crude oil prices should be so high,'' Ms. White said. ''It must be speculation, don't you think?''
 There is little relief to expect from producers in the short term. 
 OPEC has increased its supplies to 30.4 million barrels a day, raising output by 300,000 barrels a day over the last two weeks, in a bid to cool prices, according to the organization's president, Sheik Ahmad Fahad al-Sabah. 
 But analysts dismiss OPEC's power to influence markets. With little production left untapped outside of Saudi Arabia, there is nothing the cartel can do to rein in prices. 
 ''OPEC? They are irrelevant,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the PIRA Energy Group, an oil consultancy in New York. ''It's only when you hold off supplies than you become influential.'' 
 He added, ''Today, all the events are leaning in the same direction: Up.''

HEADLINE: Under the Influence of Drug Samples?

BYLINE: By Eric Nagourney

 BODY:
Those cabinets in medical offices stuffed with promotional drug samples may lead doctors to prescribe more expensive drugs, even to patients who cannot afford them, a new study finds.
 Writing in the current issue of The American Journal of Medicine, researchers say medical residents who have access to the samples are more likely to write prescriptions for heavily advertised drugs than for less expensive brands, generic versions or even over-the-counter medicines. 
The study, conducted by Dr. Richard F. Adair of the University of Minnesota and Dr. Leah R. Holmgren of Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, looked at the prescribing patterns of 29 internal medicine residents over six months in an inner-city primary care clinic.
 The study, the researchers said, contradicts the argument made by many doctors that the samples do not influence them. It also undercuts the suggestion that the samples save patients money.
 ''Although samples may provide short-term economic benefit for some patients,'' the authors write, ''their primary purpose is to market new and expensive drugs.''
 The study found that the doctors who were allowed access to the samples were more likely to prescribe expensive versions of the drugs. If the samples were really influencing them, the authors said, it would appear to violate national guidelines on the relationship between drug companies and doctors.
 The study cited earlier research that showed, among other things, that when samples were removed from clinics, doctors were more likely to prescribe drugs recommended by medical authorities. After the samples run out, some research has found, doctors write prescriptions for that brand instead of switching to drugs that they would have otherwise preferred.

HEADLINE: Investors Beat a Retreat As Oil Prices Hit a New High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for a third consecutive session as oil prices soared to record highs after the United States Embassy in Saudi Arabia said it would close for two days because of security threats.
 Wall Street retreated after oil prices jumped $1.63 to settle at $63.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the embassy's warning that there was a ''threat against U.S. government buildings in the kingdom.'' It was the second alert from the embassy in two weeks.
 Meanwhile, gasoline prices also hit a record high of $1.86 a gallon on the Nymex, adding to the market's gloom with heightened fears of a slowdown in consumer spending. 
 Before oil surged, acquisition news catapulted stocks in the opening minutes of trading. The E*Trade Financial Corporation and Quest Diagnostics said they were buying rivals in deals worth more than $1.6 billion combined, and a British newspaper reported that Cisco Systems might bid for the cellphone maker Nokia.
 Investors were also worried about today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, who are expected to raise the short-term federal funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to 3.5 percent -- the 10th increase since last summer. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.10, or 0.2 percent, to 10,536.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 3.29, or 0.27 percent, to 1,223.13, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 13.52, or 0.62 percent, to 2,164.39. 
 Bonds fell 9/32, to 9721/32, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at 4.42 percent, up from 4.39 percent Friday, the highest since April. 
 Stock in companies with announced deals climbed; E*Trade rose $1.24, to $16.10, and Quest was up $1.71 at $49.21. Quest, the nation's top provider of medical tests, said it planned to buy LabOne in a $934 million deal that would expand its share of the testing market. E*Trade will buy HarrisDirect from BMO Financial Group for $700 million.
 The possibility of a deal involving Cisco and Nokia was reported by The Business, a British newspaper, which said that Cisco was considering buying a wireless company and that Nokia had been identified as the most likely target. Cisco lost 5 cents, to $19.25; Nokia rose 14 cents, to $16.08.
 ''The acquisition story helps get investors more invested in stocks and interested in stocks,'' said John P. Waterman, chief investment officer at Rittenhouse Asset Management. ''There's a lot of investors sitting on the sidelines now, particularly retail investors.''
 The market for initial public offerings may also be warming up. Ruth's Chris Steak House increased the size of its offering to 13 million shares, from 11.43 million, after the Chinese Web search engine Baidu.com rose 354 percent in its market debut Friday.
 The Whirlpool Corporation submitted a binding offer to acquire the Maytag Corporation for $20 a share, up from an earlier offer of $18 a share and 43 percent higher than a deal Maytag had already agreed to with a private equity firm. Whirlpool rose $2.75, to $82.46; Maytag rose $1.60, to $18.58.
 Delphi Corporation shares rose 7 cents, to $5.03, even though Delphi fell to a second-quarter loss from a year-ago profit and said it would consider filing for bankruptcy protection. Delphi, the nation's biggest auto parts maker, continues to be hurt by the ailing domestic auto industry. All three ratings agencies have downgraded its debt ratings to highly speculative levels.
 The following are the results of yesterday's auctions of three- and six-month Treasury bills and three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: For Subsidized Tenants, Hopes and Fears Collide

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The living room walls in Germania Ventura's apartment match her mood -- peachy. She did it herself, along with a lot of other home-improvement projects in her modest two-bedroom place tucked between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. She even took a castoff drawer, gave it a coat of paint and hung it on her son's bedroom wall like an improvised trophy niche. 
 ''I like to fix things,'' she said. ''I'm short, but I can reach.'' 
A boost is all she needs to get to those tough spots, starting with the apartment itself. Five years ago, with the help of Section 8 housing subsidies that covered much of her rent, she moved into the building after having been homeless for two years.
 Having a place like this helped her to tackle her biggest fixer-upper yet, her life. She works as a patient liaison nearby, has volunteered as a counselor and intends to finish her college degree. And yes, she now pays most of the $914 monthly rent herself.
 While the mayoral candidates trade barbs and promises over who will provide more housing for low- and moderate-income families, people like Ms. Ventura are quietly getting on with their lives. But in her neighborhood, where the Lower East Side and Chinatown blend together, other tenants who have long enjoyed moderate rents are worried they may be pushed out by a combination of federal budget crunches and renters willing to pay newly increased rents.
 A similar pressure is being felt in other mixed-income neighborhoods that have gone from lousy to trendy, housing advocates said, with residents being pushed farther out to who knows where. Worse yet, they said, it could wreak havoc with local institutions and businesses that find themselves without people to work for or with them. For example, St. Mary's Church on Attorney Street has seen not only a drop in new members, butalso an exodus of young leaders who grew up poor, got an education but can no longer afford the Lower East Side. 
 ''If Section 8 were to go away, I don't know where these people would move to,'' said John Kelly, a partner with the law firm Nixon Peabody, who has worked with many Section 8 landlords. ''In real estate terms, there are no bad neighborhoods anywhere, and there is real pressure. But these are people who add to the quality of life of the city. They contribute to the economic life. This is not some sort of old welfare scam.''
 Mr. Kelly is co-chairman of the New York Housing Conference, a coalition of developers, advocates and bankers, which has been trying to spotlight the people who benefit from the subsidies. Carol Lamberg, the executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund, which has built or manages hundreds of moderately priced apartments, said Section 8 has helped her group bring in tenants who benefited from seeing others succeed.
 ''It allows a mix of incomes to happen in a building,'' Ms. Lamberg said. ''Having that mix of incomes encourages upward mobility for others and makes this city what it is. There's not nearly enough of it.''
 According to figures supplied by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, about 170,000 city households benefit from the program. In most cases, the government sets what it considers to be the standard rent for an apartment -- about $1,000 for a two-bedroom, for example -- and has the tenant pay 30 percent of his or her income for rent, with the subsidy covering the gap.
 The government sometimes pays more in areas where buildings that once provided lower rents through other programs are converted to higher, full-market rents. In those cases, tenants receive what is called an ''enhanced voucher,'' which is renewable each year, to cover the gap. Some tenants are worried about pending government legislation -- so far unsuccessful -- to limit the enhanced vouchers to one year. 
 ''There is an inchoate fear over how long this will be continued,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''The concern is it would get rolled into the regular voucher program after one year that would be based on the lower, below-market rents in certain areas of the city.''
 That fear is evident half a block away from Ms. Ventura on South Street, where tenants in a building that recently converted to market-rate units wonder how long they will be able to afford the neighborhood.
 Tenant leaders in the building said a small percentage of residents whose incomes exceeded the limits to qualify for vouchers reached a deal with the landlord that enabled them to stay. If the vouchers were to be reduced, they said, many people would have to leave the area.
 ''Let the people who can afford it move to some other neighborhood,'' said Jim Jannuzzi, a songwriter and tenant leader who shares a two-bedroom apartment with his sister. ''This is my neighborhood. This was not a gourmet neighborhood, but I was very happy here. Very secure here. Now I don't know what is going to happen.''
 Daisy Echevarria, another tenant leader, who did not qualify for the vouchers, said she was still worried about the future. She recalled her alarm when city officials talked excitedly about renovating the waterfront. 
 ''Are we supposed to leave all we know?'' she said. ''In five years this will all be beautiful. O.K., so you beautify the waterfront. Am I going to be able to appreciate this waterfront? Or will I be forced out?''
 The only place Ms. Ventura plans to go is up. She counts herself lucky to have found her apartment. While she was in the shelter system, she had looked at some other buildings whose landlords seemed more interested in taking her rent voucher than in giving her a clean place to live.
 She appreciates the hand up she was given. In return, she has given back a bit, too. Even when she was unemployed, she decided to volunteer at nearby Gouverneur Skilled Nursing Facility soon after the Sept. 11 attacks. After all, she said, she once worked as a counselor and was studying for a college degree in psychology.
 ''I wanted to provide something to this community,'' she said. ''This is a happy environment for me. When I first saw this building, I thought it was for people with money. This place gave me an opportunity to raise my children.''
 She shares her bedroom with her 13-year-old daughter, Jessica Perez. The teenager wants to be a chef, and she watches food shows like crazy. Ms. Ventura's 15-year-old son, Elvin Perez Jr., is just as passionate about basketball, with posters covering much of his bedroom. Both children have brought home academic awards, which their mother proudly displays alongside many family pictures.
 Ms. Ventura gives off one of those glad-to-be-alive kind of smiles. It is not the smile of a charity case, but the badge of a woman becoming what she always thought she would be.
 ''I'm getting back on my feet,'' she said. ''I believe in getting ahead.''

HEADLINE: Bush Signs an Energy Bill That Had Been a Longtime Priority

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
On a day when oil and gasoline prices hit record highs, President Bush on Monday signed into law a bill that encourages increased domestic oil and gas production and the building of new nuclear power plants. It also creates incentives for alternative energy sources and requires modernization of the nation's electrical grid.
 At a ceremony at the Sandia National Laboratory here, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the measure would not immediately bring down the price of gasoline, but he said it would give the United States a start on reducing its dependence on foreign oil and help the economy over the long run. 
''This bill will strengthen our economy, and it will improve our environment, and it's going to make this country more secure,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 ''This bill is not going to solve our energy challenges overnight,'' he said after touring a research program here to generate electricity by capturing and concentrating sunlight in giant dishes. ''Most of the serious problems, such as high gasoline costs, or the rising dependence on foreign oil, have developed over decades. It's going to take years of focused effort to alleviate those problems.''
 The measure has been one of the White House's legislative priorities since 2001, when Mr. Bush, who got his start in business as a Texas oilman, put Vice President Dick Cheney, a former chairman of the oilfield services company Halliburton, in charge of developing recommendations for addressing the nation's energy needs. The final product did not contain a number of provisions backed by the administration, including one that would have opened part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. 
 It won support from some Democrats in Congress, but it was criticized by many others and also by environmental and consumer groups, who said it gave away too much to energy companies at a time when they were benefiting from high oil prices, which neared $64 a barrel on Monday. The Energy Department reported on Monday that the average national price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline hit $2.37 last week, a record and 49 cents a gallon above where prices were a year ago.
 ''It will not reduce America's dependence on oil and it will not create a cleaner energy future,'' said Anna Aurilio, legislative director of U.S. PIRG, the Washington lobbying office for state public interest research groups, which opposed the legislation. ''Instead the bill allows big oil companies to pollute water supplies, plunder the Treasury and attack our coastlines.''
 Mr. Bush cast the measure as ''an economic bill,'' reflecting the White House's concern that despite reasonably strong economic growth, many Americans feel they are struggling to make ends meet, a feeling made worse by high gasoline prices.
 ''This economy is strong, and it's growing stronger,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And what this energy bill is going to do, it's just going to help keep momentum in the right direction so people can realize their dreams.''
 Mr. Bush has summoned his economic team to his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on Tuesday, to focus attention again on what the White House says has been solid economic progress brought about by the president's policies. 
 The bill he signed here touches on many aspects of energy policy. In addition to encouraging more domestic oil and gas production, it provides money for research into technology to help burn coal with less pollution and creates federal risk insurance for companies that build a new generation of nuclear power plants.
 It extends or creates tax incentives for alternative energy sources like wind, creates incentives for the use of more ethanol and finances research into the use of hydrogen to power automobiles. The bill contains incentives for oil companies to expand refineries to reduce periodic tightness in supplies of gasoline, and tax credits for conservation and energy efficiency.
 But many Democrats said it emphasized the wrong things and rewarded the energy industry while harming the interests of consumers and putting the environment at additional risk.
 ''This new law is a historic failure,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''It fails to do anything to increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and S.U.V.'s, even though more than two-thirds of the oil we consume goes into gasoline tanks. It fails to mandate increased use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. It fails to address emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel industries that are contributing to climate change.''

HEADLINE: Top Lobbyist Retires From Delta

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The chief lobbyist for Delta Air Lines, who has led the airline's fight for pension overhaul legislation in Washington, retired last week, Delta said yesterday. The airline's treasurer also resigned.
 Delta said its senior vice president for government affairs, D. Scott Yohe, retired Aug. 1 after 26 years with the company. Mr. Yohe, 52, will become a consultant and remain as the airline's top Washington representative, a job he has held for 17 years, a Delta spokeswoman, Chris Kelly, said. 
Delta also said its vice president and treasurer, Todd Helvie, left the airline, a year after he was promoted to the job. Paul Jacobson was named to the post. 
 Mr. Jacobson returned to Delta from the Mirant Corporation, which he joined in March. Before that, he had been Delta's assistant treasurer.
 Mr. Yohe and Mr. Helvie are the latest executives to leave as Delta battles a deepening financial crisis. The airline has lost its chief financial officer, top two legal officers and other managers.
 Delta's chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, has repeatedly warned that the airline could seek bankruptcy protection unless it is able to cut more costs. The airline has lost nearly $10 billion since 2001. 
 Delta has been lobbying hard in Congress for a measure that would allow it and other major airlines to stretch out overdue pension liabilities. Mr. Yohe, the son of a Delta pilot, has been in charge of the efforts, and Ms. Kelly said he would continue to lead the push for the bill.
 If it files for Chapter 11 protection, Delta could ask a court to terminate pension plans for salaried employees and its pilots, which are its only union group.
 Last month, Delta's chief financial officer, Michael J. Palumbo, left, and its general counsel, Gregory L. Riggs, and its assistant general counsel, Walter A. Brill, both retired. Like Mr. Yohe, Mr. Briggs was retained as a consultant.
 The airline has not named their successors.

HEADLINE: Stuck in Second 

BYLINE: By ANDREW KOHUT AND PETER HOEY

 BODY:
As Washington shuts down for August, President Bush's report card from the public for the first halfyear of his second term is not a good one compared with how the public graded Presidents Reagan and Clinton at a similar point in time. Only President Nixon, who had by then begun to tumble into the abyss of Watergate, had a lower presidential approval rating. 
Unlike Nixon's precipitous decline over one mega-problem, Mr. Bush's fall in public esteem reflects discontent in a number of areas: Americans are unhappy about economic conditions, the war in Iraq, Washington's intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo and general partisan bickering. In that regard, it is noteworthy that favorable ratings for Congress are lower than in the past, too.
 Ultimately, scandals undermined the second terms of all three of Mr. Bush's two-term predecessors. For now, the president has only a relatively small one in the investigation of possible White House collusion in the unauthorized outing of C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame. But according to July's polls, Mr. Bush's personal credibility rating, once a strong point, is slipping. Despite some recent legislative victories, this second term president could use some sustained good news to restore his public standing. Andrew Kohut is president of the Pew Research Center. Peter Hoey is an illustrator.

HEADLINE: Amid Boston Glut, Office Projects Shift to Condos

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Construction activity is brisk among the downtown high-rises here. But with occupancy poor in the office market for the fifth consecutive year, the activity is centered on developing luxury condominiums in new and existing buildings rather than producing new office space. 
 Last spring, two projects once planned as office space won city approval to be built as luxury condos instead, and more such conversions are expected. In addition, over the last year, about two million square feet of existing office space has been pulled out of the market and is being renovated, mostly for luxury housing and hotels, said Gilbert Dailey, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield of Massachusetts Inc. 
One building under construction is the 96-unit Folio Boston at 80 Broad Street. After a year of marketing, 62 units are under contract and the rest are on sale for $700,000 to $1.2 million, said the developer, Michael Rauseo, president of the Suffolk Companies, who in 2001 intended to build office space on the lower floors and about 35 condos above. 
 The preference for residential projects reflects an office market with 16.6 percent of its space available for lease or sublease, only a slight improvement from the 20-year high of 19.7 percent reached in the third quarter of 2004. As for average asking rents, they are about half the peak reached in 2000. This poor performance is a result of weak demand, and is segmenting the office market between premium upper floors and those below. 
 By the end of June, 13.9 percent of space above the 15th floor was available at an average asking rent of $42.62 a square foot. On lower floors, an additional 800,000 square feet brought the availability rate to 16.6 percent with asking rents of $32.49, said Debra J. Gould, a principal at Spaulding & Slye Colliers International, a real estate developer, investor and broker.
 ''We're seeing a greater-than-usual spread in rents,'' she said.
 For the first time in many years, small to midsize professional firms can find 20,000-square-foot high-rise floors with expansive views. But big corporations that once filled sprawling 60,000-square-foot low-rise floors with clerical and administrative workers have moved these back-office operations to lower-cost sites, have adopted technology that enables them to further cut the number of employees or they need less space because of consolidation. 
 So far this year, major financial tenants seeking to sublet their space have put 1.7 million square feet back on the downtown Boston market, which has a total of 56 million square feet. Manulife Financial, which acquired John Hancock, released 725,622 square feet of space; Bank of America, which purchased Fleet Bank, released 245,082 square feet. 
 Despite lackluster leasing and growth prospects, commercial properties here are achieving record sale prices. Well-leased properties fetch $350 to $605 a square foot. But even those with, or anticipating, high vacancies are commanding solid prices. Last fall, 330 Stuart Street, a building that is about 80 percent vacant, sold for $267 a square foot. Earlier this year, One Faneuil Square, a retail and office building that was totally vacant, sold for about $450 a square foot, brokers said.
 ''Landlords who can't find tenants are selling,'' said Jonathan G. Sloan, co-chief executive of Century Bank, a regional community lender with $1.8 billion in assets. 
 With investors spurning securities markets, they are bidding up commercial property prices. But ''high sale prices reflect activity in financial markets, not the value of real estate,'' Mr. Sloan said. ''The state economy is at a questionable turning point. The labor force has been reduced. Businesses aren't investing in capital plant. The growing companies are nonoffice users like health care, education and biotechnology. Where will the office growth come from? If there's more outsourcing, we're in for rough straits.''
 The discrepancies between real estate fundamentals and commercial property values also worry William F. McCall Jr., president of McCall & Almy, real estate advisers. A landlord who in 2000 could net $25 a square foot for an office building now nets about $15 a square foot because of vacancies, lower rents and higher tax and operating expenses. Buyers paying high prices, therefore, are settling for annual returns around 6 percent rather than the 10 percent they may have realized five years ago, he said.
 ''They'll stop buying offices when they find higher returns elsewhere,'' Mr. McCall said. ''The big question: Is there an office market bubble here?''
 But the lure for residential developers is strong: condominiums sell for $750 to $1,500 a square foot. Such a prospect presumably moved Rose Associates of New York to change direction after spending four years planning to build the 214,000-square-foot Two Financial Center. In April, it won city approval to instead put up a $110 million 162-unit condominium. Rose declined requests for an interview.

HEADLINE: Butts in the Street? The Least of Their Problems

BYLINE: By Michael Wilson

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. 

 BODY:
Asking smokers not to flick their cigarette butts into the street or crush them on sidewalks would seem a perfectly reasonable step toward beautifying a city, an extension of the broken-windows theory that keeping up with the little things can keep a place clean and safe. 
 Except that here, not only are the windows broken, but the buildings are abandoned and falling apart, and some parks are so overgrown that people have been known to dump their dead dogs in the tall weeds.
Mayor Donald J. Williamson has promised to clean up the city, but he is busy of late threatening to arrest the members of the City Council, whom he has called ''idiots'' and ''a cancer on society.'' The councilors, in turn, are exploring ways to recall the mayor and have ignored him when he has called emergency meetings. 
 So the three women from Keep Genesee County Beautiful were pretty much on their own on a recent day on Saginaw Street, the main drag through downtown, smiling at workers puffing outside an office building or at ragged men lighting up outside the courthouse. 
 One volunteer, Erin L. Caudell, 27, carried a sack of ''pocket ashtrays,'' little plastic containers where smokers could dispose of their cigarette butts instead of tossing them on the ground. 
 ''Would you be willing to try this?'' Ms. Caudell asked one man. ''It's yours for free.'' 
 Those four words alone are enough to get a person's attention in Flint, where far more has been taken than given away in recent memory. General Motors employed 80,000 people here a quarter-century ago and is down to just 17,000. The city's unemployment rate, at 13.9 percent in June, is almost three times that of the nation's. 
 The city has struggled to recover, and many see nowhere to go but up. But infighting between the City Council and the mayor's office has held up real progress, both sides have said, leaving hopes for short-term change in the hands of groups like Keep Genesee County Beautiful. 
 In 2002 the city, with a population of 125,000, had spiraled to $40 million in debt, prompting the state to put a financial manager in charge, effectively replacing the mayor's office for over a year.
 It was in that period that Mr. Williamson, 71, a multimillionaire automobile dealer and previously unsuccessful candidate who liked to say that he retired from the 10th grade to go to work, ran again for mayor with an effective ''Clean Up Flint Now -- Not Later'' campaign. Mr. Williamson bought a street sweeper and sent it all over Flint, and invited residents to dump their garbage into containers that he paid to have hauled away. 
 Members of the Council endorsed him, with some even campaigning alongside him. ''We needed our parks mowed,'' said Joshua Freeman, 29, a council member. ''We needed our garbage picked up.'' 
 Mr. Williamson had to overcome a checkered past. In 1962 a federal jury convicted him in a conspiracy to steal automobiles and sell them over state lines. In 1963 he pleaded guilty in Federal District Court to violating the National Bankruptcy Act and served three years and four months before being paroled, The Flint Journal reported.
 Mr. Williamson went on to found Sports Resorts International, a motor sports organizer and maker of truck bed liners. His wife, Patsy Lou, owns an auto dealership that has repeatedly been named the country's largest in Buick sales.
 Councilman Freeman said that he, like others, had looked past Mr. Williamson's criminal background and taken comfort in his tough talk. ''I figured he had paid his debt to society,'' he said.
 Mr. Williamson won the 2003 general election, taking office on July 1, 2004, when the state yielded oversight of Flint. Council members said he turned on them almost immediately. 
 ''I don't think he understands the process of government,'' Mr. Freeman, an automobile salesman, said. ''It's not a business. You can't unilaterally make decisions with people's money.'' 
 Another councilor, Edward Taylor, a 46-year-old retired police officer, was less generous. ''The man is stone crazy,'' he said.
 Mr. Williamson defended his record. ''Why did I run for office? To help the city of Flint,'' he said. ''We've paved more streets. We've cleaned this city up. We've done more stuff since I've been here.'' He said he was accepting only a dollar a year as salary. 
 Council members say Mr. Williamson has publicly accused them of theft and other crimes. At a meeting last month, after the Council voted to finance a department at less than a third of what the mayor had sought, Mr. Williamson lashed out. 
 ''I look at this Council here,'' he said, ''and I see three sets of Three Stooges.'' He added that he was looking forward to this year's general election in hopes that ''these idiots will be gone.'' 
 Since then, he has called two emergency meetings of the Council, but not enough members have shown up to begin the sessions. He has threatened to have council members arrested the next time they ignore a meeting.
 The members have said that the mayor chooses meeting times when he knows they cannot attend, to embarrass them. 
 ''He calls people like me names like idiot, imbecile, and I respond politically by saying, 'Well, I'm not approving his appointments,''' said Mark Horrigan, a council member who is not seeking re-election. 
 The mayor's critics concede that he has paved roads and fixed up parks, but they add that the pace of improvements seems to be slowing. Mr. Freeman said he was walking by an overgrown park early one morning this spring and saw two drunken men singing over a campfire. Mr. Horrigan said that illegal dogfights were held in Flint, and that the bodies of the animals killed were dumped in the parks. 
 Yet the area's economic picture may be slowly brightening, said Mark J. Perry, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint. Housing construction and sales are at all-time highs in Genesee County, which includes Flint, and Bishop International Airport has doubled its passenger totals in the last decade, to more than one million a year, he said. ''There is probably a lot more wealth and prosperity going on than people would think,'' Mr. Perry said.
 At the offices of Keep Genesee County Beautiful, the goal is at once less spectacular and more ambitious than cleaning up dead dogs. Keep America Beautiful, a nonprofit organization devoted to improving communities, named Flint as a test area for a cleanup of cigarette butts. 
 The turmoil within the city government actually helps projects like this, said Karen West, 51, the group's executive director. 
 ''It's encouraged ownership,'' Ms. West said. ''People have finally gotten past the stage of 'Woe is me' and 'I've had it up to here,' to, 'I'm tired of waiting for someone else to do something about it.'''

HEADLINE: A Roof Garden? It's Much More Than That 

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
As temperatures soared over 90 degrees and New York City broke records for electricity use at the end of July, landscapers were installing a ''green'' roof at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, where parts of the HBO series ''The Sopranos'' are filmed.
 Above Tony Soprano's head will be New York City's largest green roof, a thin layer of plants covering 35,000 square feet in a design that aims to reduce air pollution, control heating and cooling costs, and absorb storm water runoff.
Proponents of the project, which has been two years in the making, are hoping to use data collected from it to convince commercial property owners and developers that not only are green roofs good for the environment, they can benefit the bottom line. 
 The highly visible location near the large Silvercup Studios' sign will be its own best advertisement. A matrix of 1,500 planters will have 20 different species of plants intended to show off their red, yellow and green colors, visible from the Queensboro Bridge when in full bloom. 
 Not to be confused with a roof garden, however, a green roof is less of an aesthetic amenity than it is a workhorse. The carefully selected plants and soil -- engineered to weigh only a fifth as much as typical dirt -- help clean the air and absorb rain that would otherwise become storm-water runoff. And when many of them are clustered together, green roofs can reduce the urban heat island effect (densely populated cities tend to be hotter than surrounding areas because of the heat-trapping properties of tall buildings, asphalt and concrete). 
 Less well established are the benefits of green roofs to property owners and developers. It is known that they can reduce a building's heating and cooling costs, and extend the life of the roof, but the question is, Do the long-term benefits justify the initial cost? 
 ''We are looking to demonstrate to the government, the public and most of all private business that green technologies are an economic benefit,'' said Stuart Suna, co-owner of Silvercup Studios. ''What exactly that benefit is will be determined by this green-roof demonstration project.'' 
 The Silvercup project originated with a study undertaken by Diana Balmori of Balmori Associates, a landscape design firm.
 Ms. Balmori's interest in the submarket of green-roof design led to a comprehensive assessment of New York City's flat-roof buildings. What she discovered is that Long Island City has 667 acres of empty flat-roof surfaces suitable for vegetation, an area more than three-quarters the size of Central Park. Given the available flat roofs, the air pollution generated from the area's heavy industry and traffic, and a nearby power plant that produces 25 percent of the city's electricity, Long Island City turned out to be the perfect green-roof laboratory. 
 Ms. Balmori took her idea to build a demonstration green roof to the Long Island City Business Development Corporation, the neighborhood's business improvement district; Mr. Suna is a member of the group. They secured a grant from Clean Air Communities, an organization devoted to reducing air pollution and energy consumption in the city's low-income neighborhoods. 
 The $500,000 grant is paying for the green-roof design by Balmori Associates, and the installation by Greener by Design, a landscaping company based in New York that specializes in green roofs. Ms. Balmori estimates the outlay will be about $10 a square foot, not including the structural engineering costs paid for by Silvercup Studios, or the yearlong study to be undertaken by the Earth Pledge Foundation, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization based in New York. 
 Leslie Hoffman, executive director of Earth Pledge, said that once the green roof was established, her organization would measure energy savings as a result of reduced temperature fluctuations in and around the building. The study will also measure the amount of storm-water retention, which alleviates pressure on the city's overtaxed wastewater system. 
 A study conducted in Chicago, for instance, demonstrated that a green roof absorbed nearly half the water that was captured elsewhere in a conventional roof rain barrel during a downpour. 
 Richard Heller, president and chief executive of Greener by Design, said energy savings from green roofs would fluctuate depending on the building type, but the greatest savings would be achieved in low-rise flat-roof buildings. The same Chicago study, conducted in 2003, showed that green-roof temperatures were 19 percent to 31 percent cooler during peak daytime hours in July compared with a conventional roof. 
 Despite the existing data, Ms. Hoffman and many other green-roof proponents agree that appealing to the enlightened self-interest of property owners and developers is not enough. Getting local government involved is critical to reducing the cost of green-roof installation and achieving economies of scale through mass production. With current technology, green roofs typically cost $8 to $10 a square foot, whereas a regular roof costs about $4 to $6 a square foot.
 ''Isolated green roofs are expensive insulation,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ''But when you have a whole community of green roofs, it changes the microclimate of the area and reduces demand for energy. Think about one sidewalk in front of a building. That doesn't make a transportation path. But if everyone has one in front of their property, you have a way to walk around the city. Only a citywide effort can achieve that.''
 To that end, proponents in New York have been lobbying City Hall to offer incentives to developers and property owners. While green-roof incentives are still in the ''nice idea'' phase at City Hall in New York, Chicago has been a proponent of green roofs since Mayor Richard M. Daley installed the country's first municipal green roof on top of City Hall in 2001. Chicago now has both requirements and incentives in place for private businesses to follow the city's lead. 
 As a result, Sadhu Johnston, Chicago's commissioner of the environment, said there were approximately two million square feet of green roofs already built or in various stages of construction in Chicago. Currently, New York City has approximately 60,000 square feet of green roofs built or under construction. 
 Two years ago, Chicago began offering a density bonus in the central business district in exchange for green-roof installation. The city uses a complex formula to calculate the bonus, but at least 50 percent of the roof must be covered with vegetation before the bonus starts to apply. More significantly, of the estimated 150 green-roof projects currently in development, only 12 are taking advantage of the city's incentives. The rest are being built because the city requires that new developments that benefit from city financing must install a green roof. 
 ''It's a combination of incentives and requirements,'' Mr. Johnston said. McDonald's built a flagship restaurant in downtown Chicago and installed a highly visible, 3,150-square-foot, bi-level green roof. Target and Apple Computer have also installed green roofs on their stores in Chicago.
 While studies in Chicago and other cities in Canada and Europe have demonstrated the environmental benefits of green roofs, green roof proponents know they need hard numbers to convince New York's developers of the economic benefits. 
 ''We want to bridge the gap between theory and reality,'' said Glenn Goldstein, program director for Clean Air Communities. ''Having definitive data that informs developers and other real estate people how a green roof could perform for them is critical.''

HEADLINE: Tipped Off

BYLINE: By Steven A. Shaw. 
Steven A. Shaw is the author of the forthcoming, ''Turning the Tables: Restaurants From the Inside Out.''

 BODY:
WHEN Thomas Keller, one of America's foremost chefs, announced that on Sept. 1 he would abolish the practice of tipping at Per Se, his luxury restaurant in New York City, and replace it with a European-style service charge, I knew three groups would be opposed: customers, servers and restaurateurs. These three constituencies are all committed tipping -- as they quickly made clear on Web sites. To oppose tipping, it seems, is to be anticapitalist, and maybe even a little French. 
 But Mr. Keller is right to move away from tipping -- and it's worth exploring why just about everyone else in the restaurant world is wrong to stick with the practice. 
Customers believe in tipping because they think it makes economic sense. ''Waiters know that they won't get paid if they don't do a good job,'' is how most advocates of the system (meaning most everybody in America) would put it. To be sure, this is a seductive, apparently rational statement about economic theory, but it appears to have little applicability to the real world of restaurants. 
 Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, has conducted dozens of studies of tipping and has concluded that consumers' assessments of the quality of service correlate weakly to the amount they tip. 
 Rather, customers are likely to tip more in response to servers touching them lightly and crouching next to the table to make conversation than to how often their water glass is refilled -- in other words, customers tip more when they like the server, not when the service is good. (Mr. Lynn's studies also indicate that male customers increase their tips for female servers while female customers increase their tips for male servers.)
 What's more, consumers seem to forget that the tip increases as the bill increases. Thus, the tipping system is an open invitation to what restaurant professionals call ''upselling'': every bottle of imported water, every espresso and every cocktail is extra money in the server's pocket. Aggressive upselling and hustling for tips are often rewarded while low-key, quality service often goes unrecognized.
 In addition, the practice of tip pooling, which is the norm in fine-dining restaurants and is becoming more common in every kind of restaurant above the level of a greasy spoon, has gutted whatever effect voting with your tip might have had on an individual waiter. In a perverse outcome, you are punishing the good waiters in the restaurant by not tipping the bad one. 
 Indeed, there appears to be little connection between tipping and good service. The best service in the Western world is at the Michelin three-star restaurants of Europe, where a service charge replaces tipping. As a customer, it's certainly pleasant to dine in France, where the menu prices are ''service compris,'' representing actual totals, including the price of food, taxes and service.
 Tipping is hardly the essence of capitalism. Actually, it would seem to have little to do with capitalism at all: it is -- supply and demand be damned -- a gift, a gratuity decided on after the fact. 
 Waiters and waitresses also believe it is their right to be tipped. A tip, while a gift, is a strange sort of gift in that it is a big part of the server's salary. In most states, servers don't even get paid minimum wage by their employers -- there is an exemption (called a ''credit'') for tipped employees that allows restaurants to pay them just a token couple of dollars an hour (as low as $1.59 per hour in Kansas and $3.85 per hour in New York City). They are instead largely paid by tips, to the tune of $26 billion per year.
 When you talk to servers, you'll find that most believe they make more money under the tipping system than they would as salaried employees. And that's probably true, strictly speaking. The tipping system makes waiters into something akin to independent contractors. And in most any business the hourly wage of a contractor is higher than that of an employee. Yet in most businesses, people choose to be employees. 
 That is because those who wish to guarantee their long-term financial security sacrifice a little bit of quick cash for longer-term benefits like health insurance, retirement plans and vacation pay. But, of course, most servers see themselves as transient employees -- waiting tables before moving on to bigger and better things. 
 Still, this may not always be the case. The large number of waiters I see in their 40's, 50's and 60's put the theory in doubt. While kitchen workers trade low wages and no tips for a future in the business -- the opportunity to rise in rank, to one day run a kitchen -- what calculation do waiters and waitresses make? Under the tipping system, it seems, they're trading a little extra now for the promise of nothing later. With his announcement, Mr. Keller has sent a signal to his culinary colleagues that there just might be a better way. 
 For their part, restaurateurs believe it is their right to have consumers pay servers, so they don't have to pay their employees a living wage. They prefer the current system because it allows them to have a team of pseudo-contractors rather than real employees. 
 But that too is shortsighted. Over time, as in any service-oriented business, waiters loyal to the restaurant will perform better and make customers happier than waiters loyal only to themselves. 
 In this, the world's most generous nation of tippers, most restaurants don't even offer service as good as at the average McDonald's. While it lacks style, service at McDonald's is far more reliable than the service at the average upper-middle-market restaurant. This is not because the employees of McDonald's are brilliant at their jobs -- it's because they are well-trained and subject to rigorous supervision. 
 And come to think of it, at McDonald's there is no tipping.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed Statement on Interest Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:
 The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated.
 The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4.50 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Ordeal of Disney's Board Could Herald Changes in Pay Perks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Directors of the Walt Disney Company may have dodged a bullet, but battles over executive compensation -- and especially supersize severance agreements -- are here to stay. 
 After yesterday's ruling that Disney directors did not violate duties to shareholders when they allowed the hiring, firing and payment of $140 million in severance to Michael S. Ovitz, the company's onetime president, the relief in corporate boardrooms was palpable.
 But the outcome may well end up less important than that Mr. Ovitz received so much money (and so much publicity) as he left Disney, and that shareholders were so incensed that they sued the board over it. 
 ''The Disney case will have an impact'' no matter what the verdict, said Ira T. Kay, an executive compensation consultant in the New York offices of Watson Wyatt Worldwide. ''The very fact that it went to trial had a significant impact on the types of conversations in general on compensation committees, and in particular about severance plans.''
 In the Disney case, shareholders argued that the board should not have permitted the payment to Mr. Ovitz, and they sought to recover more than $200 million on behalf of the company. That legal effort is part of an evolution in thinking about both executive compensation and corporate governance, said David A. Fine, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray in Boston. 
 ''Executive compensation arrangements are clearly getting much more attention these days'' from regulators, shareholders, investor advisers and the courts, Mr. Fine said. ''The Disney decision was just a piece in that puzzle.''
 A number of seemingly outsize severance payments have come under a harsh spotlight in recent months. The most recent was the $32 million paid to Stephen S. Crawford last month after just three months as co-president of Morgan Stanley; Mr. Ovitz worked at Disney for 14 months for his $140 million.
 The ruling, however, does take some of the heat off corporate boards. If the judge had found that Disney directors violated their duties to shareholders, it is possible that their liability insurance would not have covered them, putting their personal assets at risk. That prospect quite naturally terrified many directors. 
 ''It's a comforting ruling for corporate boards,'' said Daniel J. Kramer, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York. ''It confirms what most sober corporate lawyers thought the law was, and it dispels some of the fears that had been expressed previously about where the law might be headed, in terms of director liability.''
 Nevertheless, Chancellor William B. Chandler III, who presided, was critical of the conduct of the Disney board.
 ''Many lessons of what not to do can be learned from defendants' conduct here,'' he wrote in his opinion.
 The board at Disney, the judge wrote, was ''stacked'' with friends of its chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, who himself suffered various ''lapses'' in the hiring of Mr. Ovitz. But neither those lapses nor the errors of the board amounted to breaches of duties to shareholders, the judge concluded; executives and board members acted in what they believed was the best interest of the company.
 In his ruling, Judge Chandler also noted that ideas of the role of directors changed significantly after scandals at Enron, WorldCom and elsewhere. It would be unfair to apply today's standards to past conduct, he wrote.
 ''This court strongly encourages directors and officer to employ best practices,'' he wrote, ''as those practices are understood at the time a corporate decision is taken.''
 He continued that ''Delaware law does not -- indeed the common law cannot -- hold fiduciaries liable for a failure to comply with the aspirational ideal of best practices.''
 The judge's language may pave the way for future lawsuits like the Disney matter, as shareholders challenge recent conduct that could be weighed against current ideas of best practices for directors. 
 ''As you see more and more of these golden handshakes, you're seeing institutional investors becoming more outraged and more active,'' said Stuart Grant, a securities lawyer for plaintiffs at Grant & Eisenhofer in Wilmington, Del., referring to the rich severance payments.
 It will take time for executive compensation to reflect changing ideas of what is appropriate pay and severance, if such changes are going to occur, said Mr. Kay of Watson Wyatt, because no single company will be able to reset what has come to be the norm. 
 ''If the market for severance is going to correct, it's going to be a multiyear, relatively slow process,'' Mr. Kay said. Several companies will have to reduce the severance packages they have paid, and few companies will be willing to risk offending desirable executives by taking such a step, he said. ''It's going to take a few companies being more conservative.''
 But board members have good reason to adopt a more conservative stance in compensation matters and avoid second-guessing, said Charles M. Elson, head of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware's Lerner College of Business and Economics.
 Although the judge ultimately found that the Disney board did not breach its duties, he discussed a tough standard for the diligence required of board members, Mr. Elson said. The standard has been clarified, and directors at other times and at other companies could be held accountable under it.
 ''It means that you can't just make a decision with a devil-may-care attitude,'' Mr. Elson said, adding, ''it has altered director behavior forever.''

HEADLINE: M.B.A. Students Bypassing Wall Street for a Summer in India

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
This summer, Omar Maldonado and Erik Simonsen, both students at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, did something different.
 Bypassing internship opportunities on Wall Street, just a subway ride away from their Greenwich Village campus, they went to India to spend the summer at an outsourcing company in Gurgaon, a suburb of New Delhi.
''The India opportunity grabbed me,'' said Mr. Maldonado, a Boston native whose family is from the Dominican Republic. ''I wanted to get a global feel for investment banking and not just a Wall Street perspective.'' 
 He and Mr. Simonsen, both 27, are spending three months at Copal Partners, an outsourcing firm with 100 analysts. It produces merger and acquisition pitch books and provides equity and credit analysis and other research to global banks and consultant groups, including those on Wall Street.
 Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Simonsen, of Riverside, Calif., are part of a virtual invasion of India by American students. Graduate students from top schools in the United States, most from master of business administration programs, are vying for internships at India's biggest private companies. For many, outsourcing companies are the destinations of choice. 
 India is not just a line on an American student's resume, said Kiran Karnik, president of the outsourcing industry trade body, Nasscom, ''but also culturally fulfilling.'' Many students travel while in India, giving them a view of the country and its long history, he said. 
 Nasscom is now trying to track the ever-increasing numbers of foreign interns. Many are in India to study globalization firsthand, Mr. Karnik said; that is often not possible in China because, unlike India, English is not widely spoken there.
 Mr. Karnik said he had met more than a dozen interns from the Harvard Business School who were spending this summer in India. ''I expect a bigger horde of students to arrive next year because the ones here said they had a great time and will go home to talk about it,'' he said.
 Elsewhere, too, the trend is on the rise. Four students from Fuqua School of Business at Duke University are interning in India, compared with only one last year and none in 2003. Of this year's interns, three are at Infosys Technologies, an outsourcing company in Bangalore, and the fourth is in Chennai at GlobalGiving, an organization based in Bethesda, Md., that helps support social, economic and environmental projects around the world.
 At Georgetown University, Stanley D. Nollen, a professor of international business at the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business, said India was of growing interest to students. 
 ''No longer is India thought of as a land of snake charmers and bride burnings,'' he said. ''Now India means the world's best software services, and increasingly, pharmaceuticals and auto parts.'' 
 Professor Nollen directs the school's programs for M.B.A. students in India, which include ''residencies'' -- academic courses that are centered on consulting projects for companies operating in India. A group of 49 students arrived this month and went to companies like Philips India Software and MindTree Consulting, both in Bangalore; the motorcycle-making unit of Eicher in Chennai; and the ICICI Bank in Mumbai.
 India can be a jolt to a first-time American visitor. In Gurgaon, a small town despite its tall office complexes and shiny new malls, Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Simonsen share an apartment where the power fails several times a day. Temperatures are regularly above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. 
 The two men said they came prepared to find inadequate infrastructure, but were not prepared for the daily frustrations of Gurgaon. There is no mass transportation system, and shopping, even for something as basic as an umbrella, can take hours. They rumble to work in an auto rickshaw -- a motorized three-wheeler that seats two and is a ubiquitous form of transport in Indian cities. 
 But the sophistication of the work being done in Copal's Gurgaon office contrasts with the chaotic city outside. Mr. Simonsen said he was amazed. ''I came expecting to see number-crunching and spreadsheet type of work; I didn't expect American banks to farm out intricate analytics,'' he said. The two students are working on a project that analyzes investment opportunities for clients across 23 countries.
 Infosys Technologies, the country's second-largest outsourcing firm after Tata Consultancy Services, discovered how popular India had become as an internship destination for Americans when the company began recruiting: for the 40 intern spots at its Bangalore headquarters, the company received 9,000 applications. Only those with a cumulative grade-point average of 3.6 or more made it to a short list, and then they were put through two rounds of interviews.
 The final 40, who cut a wide academic swathe from engineering schools like M.I.T. and Carnegie Mellon to business schools like Stanford, Wharton and Kellogg, have since arrived on campus for average stays of three months. The interns work in areas from marketing to technology. They live in a 500-room hotel complex on Infosys's expansive campus in the suburbs of Bangalore, exchanging coupons for meals at the food court and riding the company bus downtown to decompress at the many pubs and bars. 
 Among the Infosys interns is Caton Burwell, 28, from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ''India has come to symbolize globalization and I wanted to participate in the workings of the global economy,'' he said. ''Besides, it would look great on my resume.''
 Mr. Burwell said that, since arriving in India, he had developed a better grasp of the workings of the global economy and the logic behind the choices companies and countries make. ''Being here is a powerful experience; it is impossible not to think differently,'' he said.
 Also, his attitude toward outsourcing has changed since meeting Indian employees, who he said work very hard and care a great deal about the quality of their work. ''To come here, meet these people, and to return home and turn your back on outsourcing is hard,'' he said.
 Jeffrey Anders, 29, from the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., is similarly stirred. Mr. Anders is halfway through his internship at the business process outsourcing division of Hewlett-Packard India in Bangalore.
 ''I can't help but feel that I am witnessing the creation of a new global economic order, a new reality that most people back home don't realize is coming,'' said Mr. Anders.
 After a meeting with the recruiting head of Hewlett-Packard India's back-office unit at a conference at M.I.T., Mr. Anders came to India to help build a group of Indian economists and statisticians to perform complex analytics and predictive modeling for Western multinationals. ''These highly educated and qualified people are not stopping at call centers and back-office work,'' he said. ''They are getting ready to compete for every job.''
 Meanwhile, Indian companies are looking at summer internships as a way of building a diverse work culture.
 ''Bringing investment bankers here provides our Indian team a perspective and context of Wall Street,'' said Joel Perlman, co-founder of Copal Partners, a company based in London that has four employees each in New York and London and another 100 or so in India.
 Other companies, and even the schools themselves, are looking at internships as a step toward attracting bright young Americans to work in India. Infosys, for instance, hired Joshua Bornstein, a former intern from Claremont McKenna College in California, nearly two years ago as its first American employee based in India.
 ''In this increasingly global economy, we would expect to see India become an even greater source of employment for our students,'' Sheryle Dirks, director of the Career Management Center at Fuqua, said.
 Mr. Anders, from the Sloan school, works in a new Hewlett-Packard building, where he sometimes works out at the gym in the basement and eats at the cafeteria on the terrace. The employees work in open cubicles, similar to those in offices anywhere in the West. His team consists of four Indians, all with M.B.A.'s like him, and they operate globally, collaborating with teams in California and elsewhere.
 Interns like Mr. Anders are getting a close view of social changes that are happening in India. Outsourcing has created thousands of better-paying jobs and spawned communities of young people who can afford cars, apartments and iPods.
 ''I thought the stipend was the down side,'' said Mr. Anders, ''but coming here is a priceless experience.''

HEADLINE: MCI Posts Profitable Quarter, First Since End of Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
MCI Inc., the long-distance carrier that has agreed to be sold to Verizon Communications, said yesterday that it earned $64 million, or 19 cents a share, in the second quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations. It was MCI's first profitable quarter since emerging from bankruptcy last year.
 The company, based in Ashburn, Va., lost $71 million, or 22 cents a share, in the quarter last year. 
MCI has been aggressively cutting costs and has eliminated about 15,000 jobs in the last year. The reductions have helped the company offset a continued decline in sales.
 Revenue fell 10 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, to $4.7 billion, compared with $5.2 billion. Operating expenses, however, slid 11 percent, to $4.6 billion.
 MCI also said it had $5.3 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet at the end of June, and $5.9 billion in debt. 
 MCI's shares rose 7 cents yesterday, to close at $25.38. 
 MCI, like AT&T and other long-distance carriers that serve corporate customers, has been in a price war resulting from the construction of too many fiber optic networks during the late 1990's, as well as the emergence of cheaper Internet-based phones and other technological innovations.
 The entry of the Bells into the long- distance residential phone market has also led MCI, AT&T and others to retreat from the consumer business.
 With its future in doubt, MCI agreed this year to be acquired by Verizon for $8.5 billion. The company rejected a $9.8 billion bid from Qwest Communications. MCI and Verizon hope to receive approval from regulators for their deal by the end of the year.
 Verizon's purchase came a few months after SBC Communications agreed to buy MCI's primary rival, AT&T.
 If both deals are approved, as many industry analysts expect, Verizon and SBC will end up controlling 56 percent of the country's $134 billion corporate telecommunications market, according to the Yankee Group.
 BellSouth, Qwest and Sprint control another 19 percent of the market.
 Without AT&T or MCI competing in regions dominated by SBC and Verizon, prices for wholesale high-speed data lines in those areas will rise 11 to 400 percent, depending on the connection, according to Simon J. Wilkie, a former economist at the Federal Communications Commission.
 Mr. Wilkie, who prepared a study for the Alliance for Competition in Telecommunications, a group of non-Bell telecommunications companies, said that wholesale carriers would ultimately pass these higher costs on to their customers.
 The merging companies, however, insist that there will still be plenty of competitors in the high-speed data line market after the deals are concluded.

HEADLINE: Suggesting No Letup, Fed Raises Rate Again

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Anne Kornblut contributed reporting from Crawford, Tex., for this article.

 BODY:
Saying that the economy was still getting stronger, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark short-term interest rate again yesterday and gave investors reason to think that it would continue lifting rates through the end of the year.
 The Fed lifted the rate to 3.5 percent, from 3.25 percent, the 10th increase since last summer, as the economy has recovered from recession and its long hangover.
The change in the benchmark -- which directly affects many credit card and business loans and usually influences mortgage rates though with a lag -- had been expected. But the Fed's rate-setting committee also tweaked the language in its public statement after the meeting to note that economic growth had picked up.
 ''Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter,'' the statement said, ''and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.'' 
 The Fed now seems to be in a race against the economy's gathering strength, with policy makers hoping that they did not keep interest rates low for a long enough time to ignite inflation. Many Wall Street economists are growing worried about that possibility, while others -- especially on the left -- say that job and wage growth remain too weak for serious inflation fears.
 After President Bush met with his economic team yesterday at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., he sidestepped a question about whether higher interest rates could slow the economy, saying that energy and health care were his top concerns.
 The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Ben Bernanke, speaking with reporters, said: ''Inflation is well contained, under control. The core inflation rate over the last year is about 2 percent, and I see inflation remaining well contained going forward.''
 The Fed reiterated that it planned to raise short-term rates at a ''measured'' pace, a term that is widely thought to mean that it would continue to move in quarter-point increments. 
 Investors expect the benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, to reach 4.25 percent by the end of the year, based on the price of a futures contract that tracks Fed actions. That would require the Fed to lift the rate at each of its three remaining meetings in 2005.
 In the spring, when economic growth looked weaker than it has recently, investors were betting that the key rate would end the year at 3.75 percent.
 ''A policy mistake may have been made,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. ''They may have lingered too long'' at interest rates that will eventually cause a surge in inflation.
 The housing boom, a recovery in business investment and strong consumer spending have kept the economy growing at a steady pace despite oil prices that have reached the highest levels since the early 1980's, adjusted for inflation.
 On Tuesday morning, stocks rose slightly, after a Labor Department report showed that productivity growth had slowed less than expected in the second quarter, and the market held onto its gains after the Fed's announcement in the afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,231.38, up a little more than 8 points.
 In a sign that investors might have expected the Fed to express more concern about inflation than it did, the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 4.39 percent, from 4.42 percent late Monday. 
 In its statement, the Fed used many of the same words that it did last month to describe its attitude toward prices.
 ''Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,'' it said, ''but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated.''
 The fact that long-term interest rates, including those on mortgages, remain lower than they were a year ago, when the Fed started raising rates, has perplexed many analysts, and the causes are not clear. This has made the Fed's job more difficult, preventing the rate increases from slowing the economy as they typically do.
 In recent weeks, long-term rates -- which are set by day-to-day trading in the bond market -- have risen somewhat, which probably took some pressure off Fed officials to issue a stronger statement about inflation risks. 
 The benchmark interest rate now exceeds inflation, which has been running about 2.5 percent a year, by a small amount. In the language of the Fed, that means the rate is still below the ''neutral'' level and is still pushing the economy ahead instead of holding it back. 
 The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has declined to say publicly just what the neutral level is. ''We don't know what neutrality is until we get there,'' he told Congress last year. 
 Many forecasters say it is in the neighborhood of 4 percent, which is why they expect the Fed to continue raising its benchmark for the rest of the year. In previous cycles, though, the Fed struggled to avoid overreaching, and raising or cutting rates more than looked necessary in hindsight. At times later, it had to reverse course.
 ''The spooky part is that Greenspan and others have said they don't know what neutral is,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, ''but they'll know it when they see it. A fairer thing to say is probably that they don't know what neutral is, but they'll know it when they've passed it.''
 The labor market is also complicating the Fed's attempt to understand the economy's direction. Wages for most workers have recently been rising no faster than inflation, often a sign that the economic growth is not healthy enough to set off inflation. New technologies and the movement of some jobs to low-wage nations seem to be holding back wage and price increases. 
 But another possibility is that pay increases will come with time. Raises often lag behind job growth by months or even years, and some economists say that the Fed should continue increasing interest rates to prevent wages, and inflation, from spiraling over the next year.
 ''Politically, they're not going to come out and say, 'We don't want to see unemployment come down any more,''' Maury N. Harris, chief United States economist at UBS, said, referring to Fed officials. ''But I think what they would like to see is an economy that grows just fast enough to keep unemployment stable.''
 In its report yesterday, the Labor Department said that unit labor costs, a measure of pay for each unit of output, rose 4.3 percent over the last year, the fastest growth since 2000. But most of the increase occurred late in 2004. In the second quarter of 2005, unit labor costs rose at an annual pace of just 1.3 percent.
 Using the same words it did at its last meeting, the Fed called productivity growth ''robust.''
 Mr. Bush praised the economy over all, saying that job growth was strong and that trade agreements were opening new markets. But his advisers struggled to explain why, if the economy was improving, public confidence remained shaky, as numerous polls show it does.
 Allan B. Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council, said that most people ''in terms of their personal finances, feel very good about the economy.''
 ''At the same time, there is unease about the economy in general,'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''None of us are comfortable paying $2.50 per gallon when we go to fill up our cars with gas.'' And, he said, ''We are a nation at war.''
 Both Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Bernanke said that health care costs were a major topic of discussion at the ranch meeting, but declined to specify what if any policies the president intended to pursue to address them.

HEADLINE: 'Great Race'? Sorry, the Title Is Taken

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
SURELY there must have been other elections that seemed as made for prime time and TiVo as the prospect of a Hillary Rodham Clinton-Jeanine F. Pirro Senate race from New York, but the list can't be a long one. Arnold Schwarzenegger versus the world in California? Jesse Ventura in Minnesota? 
 Well, maybe not. If the goal is to reach the desirable demographic of affluent suburban women, neither of those quite matches up with the all-Westchester smackdown featuring two smart lawyers with big ambitions and wayward husbands, and an intriguing thicket of subplots. Mrs. Clinton for Senate or White House? Ms. Pirro for Senate or Fox News? Al Pirro or Bill Clinton as the adoring spouse? Up-close-and-personal remembrances of Ms. Pirro's Vietnamese potbellied pigs or the Clintons' Labrador retrievers? Reality show or prime-time soap? 
Yes, it's easy to discern something more than a bit sexist about the early ''catfight'' story line and fascination with a race that doesn't even yet exist. (There is that Republican nomination for Ms. Pirro to worry about, after all.) But in truth, it's the husbands hovering offstage who provide most of the tabloid frisson. Think ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in Westchester (''Truth and illusion. Who knows the difference, eh, toots?''). And what's the alternative for political excitement in these parts -- Jon Corzine versus Doug Forrester? 
 Politics, after all, with the exception of ''American Candidate,'' which bombed last year, has been one of the only areas of American life spared from reality television's version of reality. And, since there are no unscripted moments left in American life, word is that both campaigns already have arranged for television tie-ins and product placements to amp up interest in the race and maximize campaign contributions. Shows and story lines are being negotiated, but look for the following: 
 ''Desperate Housewives'': Wisteria Lane is thrown into an uproar as flamboyant Gabrielle (Ms. Pirro, replacing Eva Longoria) and more controlled Lynette (Mrs. Clinton, replacing Felicity Huffman), disgusted with the exploitative, sexually out-of-control tenor of the neighborhood, announce they are both running for the United States Senate. Gabrielle and Lynette turn each episode into a seminar on a different worthy topic. They debate upstate economic development, Medicaid reform and Social Security privatization. Viewers are encouraged to cast their ballots for the candidate of their choice before the show is summarily canceled.
 ''SURVIVOR: FINGER LAKES'': It is three weeks before Election Day, and Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Pirro are stranded in Buttermilk Falls State Park without press secretaries, staffs or Ms. Pirro's $200,000-a-year driver. Clad in camouflage dress-for-success suits and armed only with navigation information downloaded onto their BlackBerries, the two must find a way to get to the tribal council in Ithaca or get voted off the island.
 ''Brat Camp AARP'': With their wives' political careers on the line, aging bad boys Bill Clinton and Al Pirro are shipped off to a wilderness camp in Oregon that serves as an intense intervention program for troubled adults in need of financial counseling or therapy for emotional or behavioral problems. If they're good boys, they will be sent home in November 2006. 
 ''Fear Factor'': Forced to confront their greatest fear before a panel of swing voters, Mrs. Clinton finds herself alone in a room with Jane Fonda and a Fox News camera crew, and Ms. Pirro, with Tom DeLay in tow, is forced to promote the Bush administration's policies on Iraq, stem cell research and Social Security private accounts, to an Upper West Side audience.
 ''Wife Swap'': Renamed the more appropriate ''Husband Swap,'' the show features the two candidates trading mates. Mrs. Clinton arrives home to find Mr. Pirro speed-dialing Republican contributors and poring over the family tax returns, which she needs to sign immediately. Ms. Pirro comes home planning to hit the treadmill only to find Mr. Clinton and James Carville in their Speedos giving a tour of the house to a group of creative-writing and dance majors from Sarah Lawrence College.
 There are limits. ''So You Think You Can Dance''? ''Rock Star: INXS''? ''Nashville Star''? Probably not. But NBC is working on a show called ''Treasure Hunters'' billed as a reality ''quest'' series that will feature teams traveling the globe and ''using folklore, fantasy and actual history to solve an intricate puzzle.'' Reports are the first episode will center around a global quest to find Mr. Pirro.

Disney's Board Wins Lawsuit Over Ex-President's Severance
Disney's board won a shareholder lawsuit filed over the $140 million severance for the company's former president, Michael S. Ovitz. But the Delaware judge who made the ruling chided the board for falling short of the highest standards of conduct. [Page A1.]

Battles over executive compensation -- and especially supersize severance agreements -- are here to stay. [C1.]

The Walt Disney Company posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, as strength in its broadcast and cable television networks outweighed a continued slump in its movie division. [C6.]

Fed Continues String of Rate Increases
Saying the economy was still getting stronger, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark short-term interest rate to 3.5 percent, from 3.25 percent, the 10th rise in interest rates since last summer. [C1.]

Investor May Take Aim at Time Warner
Carl C. Icahn, who disclosed that his $2 billion hedge fund held five million shares in Time Warner in March, has been putting out feelers to large shareholders about forming a faction with enough leverage to press the board to spin off Time Warner Cable, and possibly other divisions. [C1.]

Merrill Lynch Settles With Stockbrokers
Merrill Lynch & Company has agreed to pay $37 million to settle a claim that it had been shortchanging people for years. The plaintiffs were the firm's own stockbrokers. [C1.]

Different Career Path Takes 2 to India
This summer, Omar Maldonado and Erik Simonsen, business students at New York University, bypassed internship opportunities on Wall Street. They instead went to India, to an outsourcing company near New Delhi. [C1.]

Cablevision Reports Profit for Second Quarter
Helped by a one-time gain related to a realignment of sports-related networks and businesses with the News Corporation, Cablevision Systems reported net income of $222 million for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $187.1 million a year earlier. The results could have some impact on the offer by Charles Dolan, left, Cablevision's founder, to take the cable systems business private. [C7.]

Outsiders Steer Troubled Auto Parts Suppliers
The men running Delphi and Visteon, two of the auto industry's largest and most troubled parts companies, have one thing in common: both are relative outsiders to the corporate cultures they now inhabit. Market Place. [C3.]

Suez of France Makes Offer for Belgian Utility
The French utility Suez offered 11.2 billion euros, or $13.8 billion, in cash and stock to buy Belgium's largest power company, Electrabel. [C4.]

Accounting Gains Bolster A.I.G.'s Results
American International Group, the insurer under state and federal investigations for its accounting practices, reported quarterly profit rose mostly because of large accounting gains booked during the period. Second-quarter profit rose to $3.99 billion, or $1.53 a share, compared with $2.65 billion, or $1.01 a share, last year. The investigations led to the ouster of Maurice R. Greenberg, the longtime chief executive, and also led A.I.G. to file its annual report late and restate earnings. [C3.]

Investors May Raise Their Bid for Maytag
In a last-ditch effort to outbid its much larger rival Whirlpool, a consortium of investors led by the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings indicated it might raise its offer for the appliance maker Maytag to about $15.65 a share, or $1.3 billion, according to executives close to the negotiations.

HEADLINE: In a State Devoted to Autos, A Prayer to Take a New Road

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Lanny L. Johnson recently came up with a prescription for Michigan and its auto industry. Prayer. On billboards. 
 Mr. Johnson, a 71-year-old retired orthopedic surgeon, bought two months of advertising space on four billboards in the state and put up this message: ''Dear Gracious Heavenly Father, Forgive us our sin of being dependent upon the Automobile Industry and not on You. Please restore invention, productivity and prosperity. In Jesus Name, A Michigan Citizen.'' 
 Mr. Johnson has personal ties to an industry that claims 7 of the state's top 10 employers. His cousins and uncles once worked in Buick plants in Flint, Mich., a town now better known for the ghostly remains of General Motors factories than for the few that are still operational. 
 In a state that has had its share of hard knocks, this year has been worse than most. Michigan's unemployment rate, at 6.8 percent in June, was the second-highest among the 50 states, after Mississippi. 
 The bonds of G.M. and the Ford Motor Company have been reduced to junk status by Standard & Poor's, and the companies have been eliminating thousands of jobs. G.M. has said it will cut 25,000 blue-collar jobs by the end of 2008. 
 Life is even worse for their suppliers, from Fortune 500 companies like Delphi and Visteon to small tool-and-die shops. Some large suppliers have declared bankruptcy, chief executives have been toppled and jobs continue to go to China. 
 ''If what you're dependent on is failing you, you have to look at something else,'' Mr. Johnson, who called himself a born-again Christian, said in an interview. An avid golfer, Mr. Johnson recently started Prescription Putting, making golf clubs.
 He said he was motivated to put up the billboards in part by his frustration at the high cost of doing business in the state. He likened the state's single-minded devotion to the auto industry to ''idolatry'' and said, given the current doldrums, that it was time to look beyond cars. 
 ''I think there's a problem,'' he said. ''There are three dimensions to things, the mental, the physical and the spiritual, and it seems to me we exhausted the mental and physical, so we needed to explore the spiritual aspect.''
 His gesture does not come cheap. A spokeswoman for Adams Outdoor Advertising would not divulge how much he had spent, but said four billboards for two months cost at least $16,000 and as much as $40,000.
 Three of the billboards are located in or around the state capital of Lansing -- Mr. Johnson lives outside of the city -- and a fourth is on a highway between Ann Arbor and Flint. 
 ''It's so long you can't read all of it,'' said Rachel Curtiss, 22, an office manager of an asphalt company near one of the signs. ''I think it's weird. I don't quite understand it. I don't think it could hurt, but I didn't think we were that bad off.''
 Michelle Chaves-Torres, a 22-year-old receptionist at the asphalt company, said, ''Michigan thrives on the auto industry. We can't help what happens with the foreign cars. A prayer like that might help create a positive energy to get things going in a better direction.''
 Both women are grandchildren of Big Three retirees. 
 ''It's a prayer,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I think it's there for people who might want to share in the same petition. The people who think it's weird can just drive by.''

HEADLINE: All Cultures Are Not Equal 

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Let's say you are an 18-year-old kid with a really big brain. You're trying to figure out which field of study you should devote your life to, so you can understand the forces that will be shaping history for decades to come. 
 Go into the field that barely exists: cultural geography. Study why and how people cluster, why certain national traits endure over centuries, why certain cultures embrace technology and economic growth and others resist them. 
 This is the line of inquiry that is now impolite to pursue. The gospel of multiculturalism preaches that all groups and cultures are equally wonderful. There are a certain number of close-minded thugs, especially on university campuses, who accuse anybody who asks intelligent questions about groups and enduring traits of being racist or sexist. The economists and scientists tend to assume that material factors drive history -- resources and brain chemistry -- because that's what they can measure and count.
 But none of this helps explain a crucial feature of our time: while global economies are converging, cultures are diverging, and the widening cultural differences are leading us into a period of conflict, inequality and segmentation. 
 Not long ago, people said that globalization and the revolution in communications technology would bring us all together. But the opposite is true. People are taking advantage of freedom and technology to create new groups and cultural zones. Old national identities and behavior patterns are proving surprisingly durable. People are moving into self-segregating communities with people like themselves, and building invisible and sometimes visible barriers to keep strangers out. 
 If you look just around the United States you find amazing cultural segmentation. We in America have been ''globalized'' (meaning economically integrated) for centuries, and yet far from converging into some homogeneous culture, we are actually diverging into lifestyle segments. The music, news, magazine and television markets have all segmented, so there are fewer cultural unifiers like Life magazine or Walter Cronkite. 
 Forty-million Americans move every year, and they generally move in with people like themselves, so as the late James Chapin used to say, every place becomes more like itself. Crunchy places like Boulder attract crunchy types and become crunchier. Conservative places like suburban Georgia attract conservatives and become more so.
 Not long ago, many people worked on farms or in factories, so they had similar lifestyles. But now the economy rewards specialization, so workplaces and lifestyles diverge. The military and civilian cultures diverge. In the political world, Democrats and Republicans seem to live on different planets.
 Meanwhile, if you look around the world you see how often events are driven by groups that reject the globalized culture. Islamic extremists reject the modern cultures of Europe, and have created a hyperaggressive fantasy version of traditional Islamic purity. In a much different and less violent way, some American Jews have moved to Hebron and become hyper-Zionists. 
 From Africa to Seattle, religiously orthodox students reject what they see as the amoral mainstream culture and carve out defiant revival movements. From Rome to Oregon, antiglobalization types create their own subcultures.
 The members of these and many other groups didn't inherit their identities. They took advantage of modernity, affluence and freedom to become practitioners of a do-it-yourself tribalism. They are part of a great reshuffling of identities, and the creation of new, often more rigid groupings. They have the zeal of converts.
 Meanwhile, transnational dreams like European unification and Arab unity falter, and behavior patterns across nations diverge. For example, fertility rates between countries like the U.S. and Canada are diverging. Work habits between the U.S. and Europe are diverging. Global inequality widens as some nations with certain cultural traits prosper and others with other traits don't. 
 People like Max Weber, Edward Banfield, Samuel Huntington, Lawrence Harrison and Thomas Sowell have given us an inkling of how to think about this stuff, but for the most part, this is open ground. 
 If you are 18 and you've got that big brain, the whole field of cultural geography is waiting for you.

Iran removed United Nations seals on uranium processing equipment at its Isfahan nuclear site on Wednesday, making the plant fully operational, as envoys to the United Nations nuclear agency in Vienna continued to pursue consensus on the wording of a resolution calling for the suspension of Iran's nuclear program.
 The removal of the seals took place under the supervision of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, after the agency had installed surveillance cameras intended to ensure that no uranium would be diverted.
The Iranians' move was criticized by the United States, which with Britain, France and Germany is pressing Iran to resume its voluntary suspension of uranium enrichment.
 The nuclear agency, based in Vienna, confirmed that Iran had removed the seals at the Isfahan plant, where a first phase of uranium conversion had begun on Monday. 
 ''It's obviously a unilateral decision on Iran's part, taken despite repeated requests from the board of governors to maintain a full suspension,'' said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the agency.
 The board, which includes representatives from 35 countries, canceled a meeting on Wednesday after failing to achieve consensus on the issue. But the fact that a meeting was called for Thursday indicated that Britain, France and Germany had made significant steps toward winning support for a resolution urging Iran to suspend activities related to uranium enrichment. 
 The major fault line is between developing countries wary of any limit on their rights to peaceful nuclear programs and Western countries -- some of which have military as well as civil nuclear capacity -- that fear the spread of nuclear technology. 
 Signers of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty have the right to process and enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. The European Union and the United States say they are suspicious of Iran's nuclear activities because Iran hid its nuclear program for 18 years, in violation of international law. Its existence was disclosed by an Iranian opposition group in 2002.
 Since then, Iran has remained in compliance with the treaty and has worked in full cooperation with United Nations inspectors, who have installed cameras in its nuclear plants and make regular visits and reports.
 But the nuclear agency's board adopted a resolution in September 2004 saying that it ''considers it necessary to promote confidence that Iran immediately suspend all enrichment related activities.''
 The removal of the United Nations seals allows Iran to resume the second phase of the uranium conversion process, which Iran says it is pursuing for its civilian nuclear program. Production remains suspended on the more sensitive part of its nuclear fuel program, the uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.
 Some countries are not convinced by Iran's argument that it needs nuclear power. The country last year was the world's fourth-largest producer and exporter of oil, averaging about 4.09 million barrels a day, and has sizable reserves of natural gas. 
 But Iran argues that a growing population and economy are raising its consumption rates, leaving it with progressively less oil to export.
 The removal of the seals was part of Iran's tough stance on its nuclear program under the conservative new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who took office this week.
 The daily newspaper Keyhan warned Wednesday in its lead editorial that Iran would withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty if its case was sent to the United Nations Security Council. The newspaper is close to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. European leaders have threatened to take Iran to the Security Council, but such a move is not on the table at the Vienna talks.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has defended the resumption of work but said Iran wanted to maintain its negotiations with Europe. He also said his government would make its own proposal to end the standoff.

HEADLINE: To Woo Students, Colleges Choose Names That Sell 

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Since Beaver College in the Philadelphia suburbs became Arcadia University four years ago, applications have doubled. Western Maryland College was also looking for a boost when it became McDaniel College in 2002. And California State University, Hayward, decided last January that a name change to California State University, East Bay, would help it reach out to students in new communities.
 Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges jockey for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admissions standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.
''All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,''' said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lipman Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. ''There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.'' 
 Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research became New School University to reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it the New School.
 Now, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of ''naming structures,'' ''brand architecture'' and ''identity systems,'' the university has come up with a new name: the New School. Beginning Monday, it will phase in new logos, stationery, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words ''the New School.'' 
 ''My view is that you never argue with the customer about your name,'' said Bob Kerrey, the university's president.
 Names are important in the repositioning of colleges, but usually the process does not end there. 
 ''The name becomes a powerful organizing principle for the product,'' Mr. Westerbeck, the branding expert, said. ''It's the words and imagery of how the institution is going to be identified in the marketplace.''
 These days, he said, ''every college and university is trying to articulate what makes it uniquely valuable.''
 The new efforts are directly tied to the growth in the number of colleges and universities, including profit-making ones like ITT Technical Institute and the University of Phoenix, and with it, a more intense competition for students. 
 The idea at the New School, Mr. Kerrey said, is to unify the university's disparate units, clarify its mission and project to potential students and donors what makes the place unusual. That, he said, and the fact that New School University is not particularly good English.
 Changes in names generally reveal significant shifts in how a college wants to be perceived. In altering its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east of San Francisco.
 The University of Southern Colorado, a state institution, became Colorado State University at Pueblo two years ago, hoping to highlight an array of internal changes, including offering more graduate programs and setting higher admissions standards. 
 Beaver College turned itself into Arcadia University in 2001 for several reasons: to sever the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to eliminate salacious jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and ''morning zoo'' radio shows. 
 Many college officials said changing a name and image could produce substantial results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's SAT score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadia spokeswoman, said.
 Western Maryland College, a small liberal arts college in Westminster, Md., about 30 miles from Baltimore, changed its name three years ago to McDaniel College, in honor of a former trustee. The old name misled potential students in several ways, college officials said; the college is in the central part of the state, not western Maryland, and is not part of the state university system, as many people had inferred. (The college's original name derived from the Western Maryland Railroad, which had an important terminal in Westminster.) 
 ''We couldn't afford to have a confusing name anymore,'' said Joyce Muller, an associate vice president for communications and marketing.
 Fund-raising and applications have increased over the last three years, Ms. Muller said, and the college has been included in college fairs to which it was once not invited. 
 Two New Jersey colleges changed their names in the 1990's, hoping to project new and more ambitious identities. Trenton State became the College of New Jersey, and Glassboro State became Rowan University.
 Both had essentially been local teachers' colleges. Rowan, which received a $100 million gift from a local businessman named Henry M. Rowan, added an engineering program and worked to achieve a significant role in South Jersey's economic development. (Perhaps the most famous instance in which a college changed its name in gratitude to a donor came in 1924, when Trinity College in Durham, N.C., was renamed Duke University after receiving a $40 million gift from James B. Duke.)
 The College of New Jersey reconceived its mission, hoping to attract superior students statewide for its liberal arts curriculum. Two measures show its success. Students in the freshman class that arrives at the end of the month had an average combined SAT score of 1310 and ranked, on average, in the top 8 percent of their high school class, Matthew Golden, a college spokesman, said.
 That compares with SAT scores of 1150 and rankings in the top 20 percent of the class 10 years ago, before the name change, Mr. Golden said.
 Other universities have tweaked their names, nearly always in the hope of becoming more recognizable. The State University of New York at Binghamton, which was known in the 1950's and 1960's as Harpur College, now calls itself Binghamton University, at least informally. 
 The other university research centers in the New York State system have also adopted what they call popular names, in addition to their formal designations. SUNY Albany now calls itself the University at Albany, for instance, while SUNY Stony Brook is known as Stony Brook University.
 Another institution that kept its official designation while marketing itself under a more accessible name is the University of the South, a small liberal arts institution in Sewanee, Tenn. While that has been its name since it was founded in 1857, the university has long been known to students, alumni and others in higher education as Sewanee.
 Because of the familiarity, university officials have essentially given in, said Joe Romano, a University of the South spokesman. On its Web site, the institution is identified as Sewanee in large type, with the University of the South in much smaller type below.
 The New School is also surrendering to common usage, but there is more to its realignment of names. Mr. Kerrey, a former United States senator from Nebraska, said that when he became the university's president four years ago, the board told him to try to unify the university's disparate components. These include the Parsons School of Design, the Mannes College of Music, the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science and five other colleges.
 And so the New School is also changing the components' names to include in each the words ''The New School.'' Parsons, for example, will become Parsons The New School for Design and Mannes will be renamed Mannes College The New School for Music.
 ''I want people, when they hear the name Parsons, to understand that it's part of the New School,'' Mr. Kerrey said.
 He acknowledged that it would take more than revised names to bring together the various colleges. Among other things, he wants to link their libraries more effectively and to encourage more students to take courses outside their own division.
 Of course, renaming the university is ultimately about attracting students.
 ''The competition in higher education is forcing a lot of what appears to be more commercial activity,'' Mr. Kerrey said. ''It sounds a little like it's a pizza business.
 ''It's not a pizza business, but we do think of our students as our most important customers. And if they are unclear about who we are, then we run the risk that we might lose potential students.''

HEADLINE: Former Nassau Parks Aide Arrested Amid Payroll Inquiry

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Aug. 10 

 BODY:
In the latest chapter of a scandal that has clouded the administration of County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, a former assistant to a top Nassau official was arrested Wednesday on charges of grand larceny, accused of stealing county funds by filing time sheets for work he did not perform. 
 The former assistant, Shomwa Shamapande, was charged with taking $12,000 in pay he was not entitled to, said District Attorney Denis Dillon. Mr. Shamapande pleaded not guilty in the Nassau County First District Court in Hempstead and was released on his own recognizance.
The scandal has become a campaign issue for Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat in his first term who is seeking re-election in November. Critics have accused him of breaking promises to clean up government corruption, but Mr. Suozzi has defended his record, saying he does not tolerate wrongdoing. His party is also defending a tenuous 10-to-9 majority in the County Legislature. 
 Mr. Shamapande, a politically connected Democrat who once worked for Bill Lynch, a former deputy mayor of New York, and for Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, was fired in June after Newsday and Republican legislators raised questions about payroll irregularities in the office where he worked. Soon after, Mr. Shamapande's boss, Michael Klein, the deputy county executive in charge of parks, resigned under fire. Mr. Klein had been responsible for overseeing Mr. Shamapande's work and compensation, which totaled about $65,000 last year.
 Mr. Klein has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A deputy district attorney, Marshall D. Trager, said his office was continuing to investigate whether Mr. Klein knew about improper pay claims, whether he signed the time sheets or his signature was forged and whether political activities occurred on county time. Mr. Klein's lawyer, Joseph R. Conway, said, ''Mr. Shamapande acted alone without the knowledge or consent of Mr. Klein.'' 
 The Republican minority leader in the County Legislature, Peter J. Schmitt, credited his staff and Newsday for uncovering the irregularities. He accused Mr. Suozzi of acting ''only after he got caught -- it's just damage control.''
 Mr. Suozzi's spokeswoman, Arda Nazerian, said the administration fired Mr. Shamapande as soon as it learned of the irregularities, and referred the matter to the district attorney's office.
 Mr. Klein was the second of Mr. Suozzi's deputies to resign under a cloud. Two years ago, Peter T. Sylver, the deputy county executive for economic development, quit amid investigations into mismanagement in the agencies he supervised. He later pleaded guilty to billing the county for personal expenses and to harassing a female subordinate.
 At the time, Mr. Suozzi announced new rules to prevent waste and corruption. But Mr. Schmitt said the latest scandal showed that the effort had failed.
 The Republican candidate for county executive, Gregory P. Peterson, accused Mr. Suozzi of failing to mind the store because, Mr. Peterson said, he is preoccupied with exploring a run for governor next year. ''This all stems from Mr. Suozzi's voracious appetite for higher office,'' Mr. Peterson said.
 Mr. Peterson also charged that Mr. Shamapande and Mr. Klein had been hired for their political skills. Both men, who live in Manhattan, have been active in New York City and state politics, but have also worked for the city parks and other government agencies. 
 Disputing Mr. Peterson, Mr. Suozzi's campaign adviser, Kimberly M. Devlin, said, ''These comments, made by someone whose party machine brought this county to the brink of bankruptcy, is the height of hypocrisy.''
 Mr. Suozzi, elected in 2001, ran on a platform of rescuing the county's finances and ridding the government of corruption, waste and favoritism.
 Defending his record, the County Legislature's Democratic presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, said Mr. Suozzi had balanced the budget, improved management and decisively cracked down on wrongdoing.
 While stressing that she did not condone any misconduct, Ms. Jacobs said the mistakes involving Mr. Sylver and Mr. Shamapande ''pale in comparison'' to the extent of corruption under Republican county administrations. Those scandals included payoffs to a chief deputy county executive to rig a health insurance contract that cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, and the giveaway of lucrative land rights at Mitchel Field to politically connected developers.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Touches $65; Gasoline Stockpiles Shrink 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices surged nearly $2 a barrel yesterday after a government report rekindled fears that resilient demand from summer drivers and a spate of refinery shutdowns could result in tight gasoline supplies. 
 The gains came against the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East after the United States temporarily closed its diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia this week because of a threat of attacks by militants.
 Futures for light crude oil soared $1.93, to hit $65 a barrel, the highest on record, before settling at $64.90. 
 A government report issued yesterday showed that crude stockpiles in the United States rose last week by 2.8 million barrels because of hefty imports and slower refining activity.
 But the report from the Energy Information Administration also showed a decline of 2.1 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles tied to strong demand from summer drivers and slower domestic production -- leaving inventories 3.7 percent below last year's level.
 Gasoline demand has been running at 1.4 percent more than a year ago over the last four weeks, despite record retail prices at the pumps. 
 ''Those high oil prices are a burden on U.S. families, on firms' production costs,'' Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said this week. ''But the good news is that at least so far the U.S. economy has not been slowed by the high energy prices.'' 
 While crude oil prices are at records in nominal terms, when adjusted for inflation they remain below their 1980 height, which was the equivalent of $82.
 Producers and refiners have struggled to keep up with demand over the last two years, reducing the cushion of spare capacity. 
 Nations in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which control about 40 percent of the world's oil exports, have been pumping at their highest levels in decades. 
 Venezuela's energy and oil minister said yesterday that OPEC had done all it could to increase oil supply, and that global prices would probably hold at current levels.
 ''We have said that this is a structural issue, not a short-term factor, and the price is going to stay the same,'' Rafael Ramirez, the minister, said during a visit to Uruguay.

HEADLINE: Where Rochester Sees a Problem, Preservationists See Potential 

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
In better days, this sagging manufacturing city had a subway. That, of course, means it had a subway tunnel. 
 But the subway, which opened in 1927, hasn't carried any passengers since 1956. And the tunnel has become a pipeline of gloom running beneath downtown, 1.7 miles of rusted track littered with burned-out ticket stations and the detritus of graffiti writers and homeless people. To city officials, the old tunnel is a monument to decay, a big pothole just begging to be filled. 
 Fed up with what they call a chronic liability and a headache, city administrators want to pack the tunnel with tons of dirt and seal it up. The state and federal governments would pay 95 percent of the estimated $21 million cost. City administrators say it is a simple, cheap and permanent fix.
 But the plan has enraged some residents and preservationists. They have started a campaign to stop the fill and force the City Council to consider preserving the tunnel and turning it into a museum, art gallery or a light-rail line. 
 The subway tunnel, which runs east and west beneath Broad Street, lies on the original bed of the Erie Canal, and some residents even advocate flooding the channel and bringing the canal back to the heart of the city. 
 ''We were the smallest city in the country to have a subway,'' said Sandee Lyman, one of a few dozen residents who wear neon ''Chill the Fill'' T-shirts around town. ''It's beautiful and it's historic. So why fill it in with dirt?''
 The tunnel's supporters began circulating petitions and attending City Council meetings this spring. They started talking about how cities like Creede, Colo., and Hutchison, Kan., were converting their old mine shafts into museums. They organized flashlight tours through the Rochester subway until the city found out and put up ''no trespassing'' signs.
 Supporters said refurbishing the tunnel could draw tourists, money and prestige to a city desperate for all three.
 Rochester, a city of 219,773 people on Lake Ontario, has had the highest homicide rate in the state the last 7 of 10 years. Its struggling economy has improved after a sharp downturn during the last recession, but the city's major employer, Eastman Kodak, announced last month that it was planning to cut as many as 10,000 jobs worldwide. That's in addition to the 15,000 job cuts that were announced a year and a half ago, including 4,500 in Rochester.
 The city spends an average of $1.2 million a year to shore up the crumbling subway tunnel, reinforcing corroding supports, columns and steel beams. It sends in the police to investigate reports of trespassing, fights or drug deals. On the street level, crews patch up cracking, sagging sections of road over the tunnel.
 With Rochester projecting a $28 million budget gap for next year, Ed Doherty, the director of environmental preservation, said the city simply could not afford the niggling, piecemeal repair costs.
 Mr. Doherty said the city would pay $1 million to fill the tunnel and collect the rest from government bridge-repair funds.
 ''We've got to do something,'' Mr. Doherty said. ''We've got to repair it or eliminate it.''
 To plug the tunnel, crews would shore up the columns and repair any buckling beams or weak supports, then bulldoze in tons and tons of dirt, working in sections. After that, workers would drill holes through Broad Street and pump in enough dirt to pack the 20-foot-high tunnel completely.
 Though the tunnel has lain fallow for a half-century, several residents said they were opposing the fill because it would be irrevocable. Packing it with dirt, they said, would destroy a landmark that ties the city to its roots.
 After the Erie Canal was rerouted south of downtown in 1919, Rochester covered the canal bed with Broad Street and laid train tracks along the dry canal bed, anticipating population growth that never came. The subway made about a dozen stops, and it linked trolley lines and passenger trains that connected the city to the rest of the state.
 Ridership, which peaked during the Depression, fell sharply during the economic boom after World War II, when more people bought cars and the city grew in directions not served by the subway. In 1956, the city shut it down. 
 ''My one and only time to ride the subway was on its last day,'' said John Curran, a supporter of preserving the tunnel. He could clearly remember the car he rode in. ''It was red, my favorite color. I was 8.''
 Since then, all but one of the subway cars have been scrapped, and the lamps, staircases, stations and columns in the tunnel have wasted away. The tunnels are now havens for about a dozen homeless people. Graffiti writers come down to paint, and teenagers descend to party. Art classes and photographers often visit.
 One recent Sunday afternoon, the smells of rot, garbage and smoke permeated the tunnel from end to end. One graffiti tag declared, ''Jesus Christ is Lord.'' Another said, ''You will die.''
 Old shoes, jeans and bottles lay everywhere, and charred logs indicated someone had made a fire recently. The only person in sight, a man in a blue T-shirt, scurried from the tunnel and up an embankment when he saw a group of visitors approaching.
 On the eastern side of downtown, the subway line emerges from the gloom and becomes an viaduct straddling the Genesee River. This is the most revered portion of the subway line, and city and state officials have secured $3 million in federal money to refurbish the viaduct and make it more accessible to pedestrians. 
 Mr. Doherty said that section of the line would not be touched. 
 The tunnel's fate remains an open question, but Tim Mains, a city councilman, said the subway's supporters seem to have won their first fight. Mr. Doherty had said he wanted to start plugging the tube by early this fall, but politics seem to make that less likely.
 The mayor's office and three Council seats are opening up in the fall, and Mr. Mains, one of five mayoral candidates, said the Council would most likely put off any decision on the tunnel until after the election.

HEADLINE: Trying to Stay a Step Ahead of Murphy's Law

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Don't put it off any longer.
 That is the advice of specialists in planning for disasters, who say too many small businesses are courting ruin by failing to take fuller precautions against fires, floods and, increasingly, the loss of critical data stored in computers that go on the fritz.
 Jane Vitart wishes she had acted sooner. When the Delaware River overflowed behind the French bakery and cafe she owns with her husband, Joel, in New Hope, Pa., last September, a retaining wall protected her shop. That lulled the couple into a false sense of security, and when the flood waters rose again in April, they did not bother to evacuate their equipment or their computer as they had seven months earlier. 
 Big mistake. ''The river rose four feet higher than it did in September and we ended up with 31/2 feet of water in our bakery,'' Ms. Vitart said. ''The kitchen, the store, my entire office was destroyed. This time the river took that retaining wall.'' 
 The flood caused about $120,000 in damage and clean-up costs, but perhaps the biggest blow was the disabling of her computer under three feet of water. ''I ran my whole business on that computer -- all my financial data, inventory, vendor bills, my marketing materials, customer lists, menus,'' she said. ''I was even working on a Web site and had all the photos I had taken on there.'' It wasn't as if she hadn't taken defensive measures. She had backed up a lot of her financial data, but the backup disk turned out to be defective and she was unable to retrieve the information.
 Ms. Vitart's adversity is being repeated with increasing frequency across the world of small business, specialists say. Entrepreneurs, who are often short-staffed and consumed by the problems of the moment, have always been a bit haphazard about preparing for unexpected events that could threaten their firms' survival. But the technology revolution that has made them reliant on computers for storing information and running their companies has made vigilance all the more crucial, contends William G. Raisch, executive director of the International Center for Enterprise Preparedness at New York University, which is financed by the Department of Homeland Security.
 That data can be lost in fires, floods, burglaries, computer malfunctions, virus infections, even terrorist attacks, Mr. Raisch said. ''The reality is that small and medium-sized businesses have less of a capacity to recover from these things because they are generally concentrated in a single site and some disasters can go well beyond their resources,'' he said. 
 Entrepreneurs can hardly be unaware of the dangers. A survey of small-business owners conducted last year by the Gallup Organization for the Research Foundation of the National Federation of Independent Business found that at least 30 percent of respondents had had to shut down for 24 hours or longer in the previous three years as a result of a natural disaster, like a blizzard or hurricane. One in 10 reported hardship from man-made disasters like civil disorders or arson.
 And more than one-third said they had been victims of computer viruses; of those, 28 percent had lost data, 29 percent had had to buy new equipment and 60 percent had had to hire outside help to fix the problem. 
 The sudden breakdown of a computer system can inflict harm beyond just the loss of data. More and more large companies are asking their suppliers to connect with them electronically for ordering and inventory control, so a disruption of Internet access even for short periods can jeopardize a small business's relationship with clients. 
 What concerns small-business experts is the continuing resistance of so many entrepreneurs to bite the bullet and take action. Consider Ms. Vitart's course of action after the flood nearly destroyed her business. She and her husband shut down the bakery for six weeks, losing an estimated $50,000 in sales, and reopened it the week after Mother's Day only by stretching their credit to the limit and using all their personal savings. ''I feel like I'm starting from scratch,'' she said.
 The couple made some changes to make it easier to cope with future floods, like paying a carpenter to rebuild the shop's counters in small units to make them easier to remove. In the future, she says, she will evacuate her computer at the first hint of flooding. But she has no plans to hire a disaster recovery consultant or purchase a service to protect her data. 
 Some specialists say she ought to consider some additional steps. Yossi Sheffi, director of the M.I.T. Center for Transportation and Logistics, said small-business owners like Ms. Vitart should at the least make sure their backup disks are functioning by testing them periodically. He also advised business owners to buy firewall protection and antivirus software, and to consider investing in an off-site data backup service. 
 And do not take anything for granted, he advised. After hiring a firm to store data, business owners should contact the company about three weeks into the process and make sure all their information can be easily retrieved. That means having the company either send a disk with the data or give access to the data online.
 Mr. Raisch of New York University counsels small-business owners to review their important business processes and understand what the business relies on. He suggests reading NFPA 1600, a preparedness standard from the National Fire Protection Association that grew out of an effort by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the early 1990's to create a common backbone for emergency planning. The standard was given a lift in July 2004 when the 9/11 Commission urged its adoption. It offers businesses of all sizes a benchmark and guide for planning everything from protecting employees' safety to identifying natural, human and technological disasters. Copies can be downloaded at NFPA.org.
 Many small businesses have learned the hard way to take steps to protect the stored information that is their lifeblood. Riza Chase-Gilpin, owner of Kitty's WonderBox, a Wellington, Fla., maker of disposable cat litter boxes, was hit with a computer virus last year when she opened an attachment from an unknown source. The virus shut down her only computer and she was unable to gain access to customer information or to place orders on the electronic data interchange, known as E.D.I.
 ''We ended up being late on a couple of deliveries because we couldn't do E.D.I.,'' she said. ''I had to call the E.D.I. company I work with and ask them if any orders had come in and then they would fax them to me. We missed a couple of orders as a result and that could have had a huge financial impact.'' 
 Luckily, when she explained the circumstances to her customers, they were sympathetic. Fixing the computer cost Ms. Chase-Gilpin $600, but she bypassed a larger expense because she had all her information, including invoices and purchase orders, on hard copy. She bought a laptop in January so she's not reliant on a single desktop computer, and she added full virus protection on her computers at a cost of $150 annually. 
 Time is also a critical issue for small businesses. Two years ago, sorting through the spam pouring into the e-mail directories at Shustak Jalil & Heller was wasting upward of an hour a day of the partners' time. Given a billing rate of $300 an hour, the wasted time was becoming a financial burden on the law firm, a boutique firm with offices in New York and San Diego. 
 ''In our business, the only thing we have to sell is our time,'' said Irwin Shustak, managing partner. The solution was quick and cheap. Mr. Shustak turned to a consultant, and based on his advice, subscribed to a spam-and-virus filtering service for $500 a year. As a result, he said, ''We've cut down on virtually all of the junk mail.''

HEADLINE: Adding Social Norms to the Usual Methodology Mix

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (www.dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.''

 BODY:
A RESTAURANT on Honolulu's main drag is soliciting new workers. ''Looking for Aloha Spirited People,'' says the help-wanted sign in the window.
 The restaurant wants friendly employees who will make visitors feel welcome. But there is more to the job than that. The restaurant is hoping to hire people who do not have to pretend to be hospitable. They act hospitable because it is part of who they want to be. The ''aloha spirit'' helps define their identity. 
Conforming to one's self-image, to social expectations, or to a combination of the two, is one of the important ways people seek to be happy -- to ''maximize utility'' in economic jargon. But while economic models have no theoretical reason to exclude the concept, economists have rarely considered it.
 ''The standard methodology in economics is to say that people care about objective things, and they don't care about subjective things'' like how a good woman or a good man or a good Hawaiian should behave, the economist George A. Akerlof said in an interview. Economists may consider goods that money cannot buy, like having friends, but they tend to ignore attitudes or states of mind.
 Yet social norms ''are things that people really have very, very strong views about,'' Mr. Akerlof said. ''Not only do they think that they should do certain things and not do other things, but they also think that their friends and associates and relatives should do some things and not do other things. That's what you don't see in economists' utility functions.''
 In a series of articles published over the last few years, Professor Akerlof of the University of California, Berkeley, and a fellow economist, Rachel E. Kranton of the University of Maryland, have developed economic models that incorporate identity.
 ''Because identity is fundamental to behavior, choice of identity may be the most important 'economic' decision people make,'' they write in ''Economics and Identity,'' published in the August 2000 Quarterly Journal of Economics, adding, ''Limits on this choice may also be the most important determinant of an individual's economic well-being.''
 If taking an Advanced Placement class means being labeled a nerd, for example, a bright high school student may take an easier class, even though the A.P. track promises higher income down the road. Those identity trade-offs may be more extreme for working-class or minority students whose families, neighbors or peers may regard them as traitors to their heritage.
 While other social scientists have long looked at identity, Professor Kranton said in an interview, economists take a different approach. They are more likely to think about trade-offs between identity and other goals, or between one identity (say, as a lawyer) and another (say, as a mother). ''We think about how people strike these balances.''
 Bringing identity into economists' models adds another dimension to the usual trade-offs. In traditional models of schooling, for instance, economists calculate that students will stay in school as long as they believe that the benefits of education -- its effect on future earnings -- outweigh the costs in income lost by not working while in school.
 But staying in school may also have psychological costs and benefits. Someone who feels alienated from school may drop out despite the economic cost, while someone who identifies with school, even as a purely social or athletic institution, may stay to graduate.
 High schools with diverse student bodies, the economists argue, often avoid setting a single standard of course work or behavior, because they want to give students as many ways as possible to identify with the school.
 This ''shopping mall'' approach makes more students happy in the short run. But it reduces academic achievement for at least some students.
 ''The outcome is more 'democratic' in that more students are engaged in the school, but some students acquire lower skills,'' the economists write in ''Identity and Schooling: Some Lessons for the Economics of Education,'' published in the December 2002 Journal of Economic Literature.
 The economists argue that schools should be freer to ''invest'' in shaping students' identities so that they value academic performance and do not feel alienated from school. Reforms that favor ''small schools, with unified programs,'' they suggest, move in this direction.
 In some cases, Professor Kranton said, parents may prefer a school with fewer resources if its environment encourages a certain identity. ''They ultimately want their kid to be this kind of person,'' she said.
 Effective workplaces take a similar tack. While an ''aloha spirited'' restaurant cashier brings an economically productive identity to the job, organizations in many cases work to instill organizational values.
 So a Federal Express driver will do what it takes to get a package ''absolutely, positively'' to its destination overnight. A Southwest flight attendant will be funny and cheerful. A marine will be loyal and brave.
 Building these identities is not cheap and can be more challenging than simply paying people more money. But it creates a resilient, self-motivated work force.
 ''Part of what a good firm does is make those expectations very clear,'' Professor Kranton said. ''Then you want to live up to the expectations both of yourself and of yourself as part of the firm.''

HEADLINE: The Markets Start Quickly, Then Fall as Oil Prices Rise 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices that soared to $65 a barrel choked off an early rally on Wall Street yesterday, pummeling the market's optimism about the economy in the process. The tech-focused Nasdaq composite index also was hurt by a disappointing forecast from Cisco Systems, the maker of networking gear. 
 Analysts said investors had begun the day confident that the economy would stay strong, absorbing both higher short-term interest rates and rising gasoline prices. But the erosion of stocks' early advance -- the Dow Jones industrials had gained more than 100 points, extending a rally from Tuesday -- was proof that many investors remained uneasy and inclined to sell when oil climbs higher. 
 Crude hit an intraday record of $65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before easing to a record close of $64.90, up $1.83 for the day.
 The price of oil ''clearly is the headline, and that's probably causing the market malaise,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
 The Dow fell 21.26, or 0.2 percent, to 10,594.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.25, or 0.18 percent, to 1,229.13 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.38, or 0.75 percent, to 2,157.81.
 The market initially was buoyed by confidence that the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent would not harm the economy.
 The Fed also stated that its interest rate policy was ''accommodative'' and that future rate hikes could continue at ''a pace that is likely to be measured,'' suggesting that the economy should continue expanding.
 But investors turned around when oil prices resumed their climb, despite new estimates from the Energy Department of slower growth in world oil demand, which would put less upward pressure on prices.
 Investors, already uncomfortable with a series of refinery shutdowns, apparently focused on the department's supply report, which showed a 2.1-million-barrel decrease in the nation's supply of gasoline. 
 Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., noted that ''it's somewhat surprising how resilient the economy has been, despite higher energy prices.''
 The concern on Wall Street, however, is that ''eventually, higher gas prices will eat away at consumers' purchasing power,'' Mr. Vitner said.
 American International Group, the insurer rocked by state and federal accounting investigations, rose 82 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $62.24 after it reported strong second-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations.
 Federated Department Stores, owner of such nameplates as Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said its earnings nearly doubled in the second quarter, and predicted sales growth would pick up in the second half of the year. Federated advanced 93 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $73.69.
 But Cisco fell $1.36, or nearly 7 percent, to $18.25. The company posted a higher fourth-quarter profit but said sales in its first fiscal quarter were likely to increase 10 percent, less than analysts were expecting.
 Other technology stocks turned lower, too, with Microsoft dropping 40 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $26.95 and I.B.M. dipping $1.48, or nearly 1.8 percent, to $82.02.
 The Walt Disney Company dropped 67 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $25.47 when third-quarter results showed a rise in profits but revenue came in below expectations.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note closed unchanged at 9729/32 with a yield of 4.39 percent.
 The following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes. 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Entrenched Epidemic: Wife-Beatings in Africa

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria 

 BODY:
It was a typical husband-wife argument. She wanted to visit her parents. He wanted her to stay home.
 So they settled it in what some here say is an all-too-typical fashion, Rosalynn Isimeto-Osibuamhe recalled of the incident in December 2001. Her husband, Emmanuel, followed her out the door. Then he beat her unconscious, she says, and left her lying in the street near their apartment.
 Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe, then 31 and in the fifth year of her marriage, had broken an unwritten rule in this part of the world: she had defied her husband. Surveys throughout sub-Saharan Africa show that many men -- and women, too -- consider such disobedience ample justification for a beating. 
 Not Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe. A university graduate and founder of a French school, she packed her clothes and walked out as soon as she got back from the hospital. So far, although her resolve sometimes wavers and she does not want a divorce, she has not gone back.
 ''He doesn't believe I have any rights of my own,'' she said in an interview outside her French classroom. ''If I say no, he beats me. I said: 'Wow. That is not what I want in life.'''
 Women suffer from violence in every society. In few places, however, is the abuse more entrenched, and accepted, than in sub-Saharan Africa. One in three Nigerian women reported having been physically abused by a male partner, according to the latest study, conducted in 1993. The wife of the deputy governor of a northern Nigerian province told reporters last year that her husband beat her incessantly, in part because she watched television movies. One of President Olusegun Obasanjo's appointees to a national anticorruption commission was allegedly killed by her husband in 2000, two days after she asked the state police commissioner to protect her.
 ''It is like it is a normal thing for women to be treated by their husbands as punching bags,'' Obong Rita Akpan, until last month Nigeria's minister for women's affairs, said in an interview here. ''The Nigerian man thinks that a woman is his inferior. Right from childhood, right from infancy, the boy is preferred to the girl. Even when they marry out of love, they still think the woman is below them and they do whatever they want.'' 
 In Zambia, nearly half of women surveyed said a male partner had beaten them, according to a 2004 study financed by the United States -- the highest percentage of nine developing nations surveyed on three continents. 
 In South Africa, researchers for the Medical Research Council estimated last year that a male partner kills a girlfriend or spouse every six hours -- the highest mortality rate from domestic violence ever reported, they say. In Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, domestic violence accounts for more than 6 in 10 murder cases in court, a United Nations report concluded last year.
 Yet most women remain silent about the abuse, women's rights organizations say. A World Health Organization study has found that while more than a third of Namibian women reported enduring physical or sexual abuse by a male partner, often resulting in injury, six in seven victims had either kept it to themselves or confided only in a friend or relative.
 Help is typically not easy to find. Nigeria, Africa's largest nation with nearly 130 million people, has only two shelters for battered women, both opened in the last four years. The United States, by contrast, has about 1,200 such havens. Moreover, many women say wifely transgression justify beatings. About half of women interviewed in Zambia in 2001 and 2002 said husbands had a right to beat wives who argue with them, burn the dinner, go out without the husband's permission, neglect the children or refuse sex.
 To Kenny Adebayo, a 30-year-old driver in Lagos, the issue is clear-cut. ''If you tell your wife she puts too much salt in the dinner, and every day, every day, every day there is too much salt, one day you will get emotional and hurt her,'' he said. ''We men in Africa hate disrespect.''
 Nigeria's penal code, in force in the Muslim-dominated north, specifically allows husbands to discipline their wives -- just as it allows parents and teachers to discipline children -- as long as they do not inflict grievous harm. Assault laws could apply, but the police typically see wife-beating as an exception. Domestic violence bills have been proposed in six of Nigeria's three dozen provinces but adopted in just two.
 Women's rights activists say that the prevalence of abuse is emblematic of the low status of women in sub-Saharan Africa. Typically less educated, they work longer hours and transport three times as much weight as men, hauling firewood, water and sacks of corn on their heads. 
 Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe does not fit that standard profile. Articulate, with a fashionable haircut and a sociology book in her bag, she speaks in a confident, even assertive tone of voice. Her diary is full of plans for various projects she hopes to undertake. ''I am an organizer,'' she said in a series of interviews. ''I am a leader.'' 
 But that did not save her from a seemingly endless string of beatings during her eight-year marriage to her husband, Emmanuel.
 By Nigerian standards, Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe said, her parents were progressive. Her father occasionally beat her mother, but he also encouraged his daughter, the oldest of seven children, to pursue her studies and, later, her careers as a marketing executive, French teacher and host of a French educational television show.
 She was only about 16 when she met Emmanuel. Like her, he went on to graduate from a university, specializing in accounting. Slim and handsome, he slapped her only once during their long courtship, she said. She thought it was an aberration. 
 It wasn't. Now 35, Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe says that Emmanuel beat her more than 60 times after she married him in 1997. He beat her, she says, while she was pregnant with their son, now 6. He threw a lantern at her. He held a knife to her head, she said, while a friend pleaded with him not to kill her.
 Emmanuel Osibuamhe, 36, now says he was wrong to beat his wife. But in a two-hour interview in his office, which doubles as barber shop, he insisted that she drove him to it by deliberately provoking him. Pacing the floor in freshly pressed pants, polished shoes and yellow shirt, he grew increasingly agitated as he recalled how she challenged his authority.
 ''You can't imagine yourself beating your wife?'' he said. ''You can't imagine yourself being pushed to that level? But some people just push you over the edge, and you do things that you are not supposed to do.''
 ''For God's sake,'' he added. ''You are the head of the home as the man. You must have a home that is submissive to you.''
 To him, that means accepting that he is the head of the household and makes the final decisions. It also means that all property be in his name and that his wife ask his permission before she visits her family, he said. 
 When Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe eventually sought help, others only seemed to support her husband's view. She went to the police. ''They told me I am not a small girl,'' she recalled. ''If I don't want to be married, I should get divorced.'' 
 She told her father-in-law. He advised her that ''beating is normal.'' 
 She told her local pastor, who counseled her that ''I shouldn't make him so angry,'' telling her ''whatever my husband says, I should submit.'' 
 She found support, finally, at Project Alert on Violence Against Women, a nonprofit organization that runs one of Nigeria's two shelters. She lived at the shelter for weeks. She titled her statement detailing the violence ''A Cry for Help.'' 
 Bridget Osekwe, the senior program officer, said the group's files contained 200 cases like Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe's. Even some women who are economically independent like Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe, she said, are loath to divorce their husbands for fear of social disgrace.
 ''In this society, a woman must do everything she can to make her marriage work,'' said Josephine Effah-Chukwuma, who set up Project Alert in 1999. ''If it fails, the woman gets the blame.''
 Since she moved out, Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe said, her husband has hit her a dozen times, once knocking her to the floor of their church. She is torn over whether it is possible for him to change. She worries about how she will raise her son, now living with his grandparents, should she divorce. ''Should I stay because of the baby and then get killed?'' she asked. But at another point she asked a reporter to make sure that in any account of her story, her last name would be hyphenated to include his.
 Her diary is filled with notes on how his views are wrong. ''Marriage to you: A slavery relationship!'' she wrote this January.
 She has now found a new outlet as the creator and host of a local television show on domestic violence. After the first program was broadcast, she said, she was deluged with calls from women like herself. She hopes to pursue their cause through a little foundation she has formed called ''Happy Family.''
 ''An African man believes his wife is like a piece of property, is like a car, is like a shoe, is like something for him to trample on,'' Ms. Isimeto-Osibuamhe said. ''Our men need education.''
 So do ''our mothers, our fathers, our sons,'' she added. ''The whole society needs to be overhauled.''

HEADLINE: Science Park Is Planned At Bellevue

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
A California real estate company has agreed to build a $700 million complex of commercial health care laboratories on the campus of Bellevue Hospital Center, a venture that city officials hope will spur the growth of the biotechnology industry in New York.
 The East River Science Park, as the complex would be named, would cover four and a half acres owned by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation between 28th and 29th Streets and First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. Officials said it was being created to attract the kind of the small start-up companies that are routinely spun off from academic research projects at the city's universities and hospitals and to appeal to established biotechnology companies now clustered in places like Silicon Valley.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who announced the deal yesterday, said Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a real estate investment trust in Pasadena, Calif., that specializes in medical laboratories, had agreed to build the complex even before it had lined up commercial tenants. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city was already a leading center of bioscience research, and could become ''one of the nation's primary bioscience clusters as well'' with the new East Side complex. 
 Work on the first phase of the complex, about 540,000 square feet of laboratories, offices and conference space, is to begin in 2006, with occupancy in 2008, officials said. A second phase of the project, 300,000 square feet of laboratories and offices, is expected to begin after the first phase is complete, and only after a part of the site is vacated by the office of the city medical examiner. 
 Alexandria owns more than 100 commercial laboratories in nine states, and its tenants include Merck, Quest Diagnostics and other health care companies. Andrew P. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said Alexandria was selected from among five large developers that responded to a request for proposals issued in November.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Alexandria is to pay the city about $3 million a year in rent for the Bellevue property, and about $1.7 million a year in other fees, known as payments in lieu of taxes.
 ''This is really a great vote of confidence in the city,'' Mr. Alper said. ''We actually have a developer willing to build on spec, and to pay rent as well.''
 Joel S. Marcus, the chief executive of Alexandria, who appeared at a news conference at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center yesterday with Mr. Bloomberg and other city officials, said, ''We know this market pretty darn well.'' 
 Mr. Marcus said his company would draw upon its broad contacts and experience in biotechnology and health care to attract tenants. He said the Manhattan location, with its proximity to several of the nation's most important academic laboratories, would make it easily marketable to commercial tenants.
 The announcement came after decades of efforts by a succession of mayors and their economic development deputies to lure the kinds of medical research and development that have largely bypassed the city, despite its academic resources.
 Mr. Alper said researchers at the city's teaching hospitals and university laboratories have been creating about 30 new start-up companies a year, but few have ended up in the city, setting up shop instead in less expensive places in New Jersey, California and elsewhere.
 ''We know that biotechs tend to cluster around great academic institutions, so why not New York?'' said Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
 Dr. Varmus added, ''I hope this will change the city's image, and make people feel this is a place where biotech is and wants to be.''
 Mr. Marcus said living expenses and commercial rents in Manhattan, even if they are higher than elsewhere, would not deter biotechnology companies.
 ''Our experience in every major life science market in this country is that the cost of high-quality commercial entities is not the most critical aspect,'' he said. ''It actually is location.''
 He said one reason the city had failed to keep pace with other centers of commercial biotechnology was the degree of caution among New York developers, and their insistence on having committed tenants before buildings go up.
 In other areas where Alexandria has invested, ''there is virtually no such thing as signing a tenant before you build,'' Mr. Marcus said. He said the company would approach its Manhattan project with the idea of building ''a very flexible core and shell for a lab'' that can be retrofitted for tenants' needs.
 Mr. Bloomberg portrayed the project as an important part of efforts to diversify the city's economy and reduce reliance on Wall Street.
 ''Whether it's entertainment or finance or tourism or science, it is a very open world today and we cannot sit back and just say, 'Oh, we're New York, and people are going to come to us,''' the mayor said.
 Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that the city, at least for now, would be at a disadvantage when it came to attracting companies engaged in embryonic stem cell research. Some states, including Massachusetts and California, provide financing for such research, but New York does not.

HEADLINE: Bush Signs Major Transportation Measure

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ill., Aug. 10 

 BODY:
President Bush signed an enormous transportation spending bill into law on Wednesday, and joining him for the event were unusually cooperative Democrats and Republicans, who united behind the $286.4 billion legislation.
 Visiting the suburban Chicago district of Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, whose constituents were among the bill's biggest beneficiaries, Mr. Bush praised the legislation and said it would spur economic growth by creating jobs in the highway and mass transit fields. 
 His advisers said the measure was a balanced piece of legislation, far smaller than the $400 billion some in Congress had sought. Critics deplored it as loaded down with pork.
 ''Our economy depends on us having the most efficient, reliable transportation system in the world, and if we want people working in America we've got to make sure our highways and roads are modern,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking at a Caterpillar plant. The company makes road-building equipment.
 In a bill loaded with more than 6,000 specially designated projects, including highway overpasses, bicycle trails and museum renovations, Illinois fared especially well, ranking second among the states, with $1.3 billion for some 330 projects, according to the group Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
 Joining Mr. Hastert at the event were several of the state's Democratic officials, including Senator Barack Obama and Representative Rahm Emanuel, frequent critics of the Bush administration on other matters. 
 Among the items for Illinois in the bill is $3 million to widen a road, for which Mr. Obama and Senator Richard J. Durbin, also a Democrat, have taken credit. A project championed by Mr. Hastert for his district will provide $70 million for a bridge.
 Only California receives more from the bill than Illinois. New York ranked third, followed by Alaska. Oklahoma, the home state of Senator James M. Inhofe, the lead Republican negotiator on the bill, ranked 10th. Mr. Inhofe joined Mr. Bush aboard Air Force One for the trip to Illinois, the president's second trip outside Texas this week. 
 Mr. Bush had threatened to veto the transportation legislation if its cost was too high, and he had initially set the limit at $284 billion. But when Congressional leaders reached an agreement after more than a year of wrangling over the legislation, the administration embraced it, and Mr. Bush drew significant attention to it with the signing ceremony. 
 Now in the middle of what is billed as a 33-day working vacation at his ranch, Mr. Bush has held several public events since his arrival to underscore the working aspects. On Thursday, he is scheduled to meet with his national security advisers, before attending a Republican fund-raiser at a nearby ranch on Friday and a local baseball game this weekend.

HEADLINE: Just When You Thought Schroder Was History

BYLINE: By Richard Bernstein

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
It is well established in politics that being seen as a sure loser can have its advantages. Or at least, that rule seems to be in play in Germany these days, as the country's presumed sure loser, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, facing elections a bit more than five weeks from now, is suddenly no longer being decreed a sure loser at all.
 And, of course, that means that the presumed sure winner, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, Angela Merkel, has been faltering. The Sept. 18 national election, seen until a couple of weeks ago as a cakewalk to power for Mrs. Merkel, is, Der Speigel proclaimed this week, ''suddenly wide open again.'' 
 Well, maybe not wide open exactly. The poll figures still indicate that Mr. Schroder's Social Democratic Party is something in the neighborhood of 13 or 14 points behind the Christian Democrats, and that, as Richard Hilmer, managing director of the polling firm Infratest dimap, said, ''is really quite a difference.'' Previous polls have shown a wider gap.
 Mr. Schroder may have been talking confidently when he recalled recently that the Christian Democrats ''opened the Champagne early'' in the last election three years ago, only to watch as he engineered a come-from-behind victory. But the main factors behind that victory -- the floods in eastern Germany and the debate about the Iraq war -- are absent from the picture today.
 Moreover, Mrs. Merkel may have been faltering, but she may well recover, benefiting from the same low expectations that are now helping Mr. Schroder. Gary Smith, director of the American Academy in Berlin, a politically independent, privately financed center for advanced study, compares Mrs. Merkel -- often seen as a bit dull next to Mr. Schroder -- to George W. Bush before the first debate with Al Gore, a debate that Mr. Bush, widely expected to be inept, uninformed and inarticulate, won simply by exceeding those expectations.
 Still, at least for the moment, something has swung in the public mood in Germany, and certainly there is a very real possibility that the coalition led by Mrs. Merkel will fail to get a clear majority, forcing it into a murky ''grand coalition'' with the Social Democrats. Two months ago, after major losses by the Social Democrats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Mrs. Merkel seemed virtually indomitable, even surpassing Mr. Schroder in the personal popularity contest -- in contrast to the parties' standings, in which the Christian Democrats have almost always had a big lead over the Social Democrats.
 But now, the same polls that show Mr. Schroder's party losing in September indicate that if the contest for the chancellorship could be head to head, Mr. Schroder versus Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Schroder would get 48 percent of the vote, Mrs. Merkel 39. Another recent poll, by the Forsa Group, shows 51 percent of Germans not wanting a change of government at all, up from 44 percent a couple of months ago.
 So what is going on? In part, there is what many newspapers have described as Mrs. Merkel's lackluster campaign performance, a performance taking place in the context of her sure-winner reputation, and a sure winner's missteps tend to be regarded with less forgiveness than a sure loser's.
 There was her gaffe, made twice in rapid succession, in which she seems to have confused the gross and net incomes of workers, which may not be terribly serious in itself, but was awkward for someone whose main claim to electability is her supposed mastery of Germany's sad economic picture. 
 Other gestures that have cost Mrs. Merkel support include her announcement early on that she would favor a 2 percent increase in Germany's 16 percent value-added tax on all purchases. On its own, the idea is aimed at bringing down Germany's uncompetitive labor costs, and in a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday night, Mrs. Merkel offered many more measures aimed at gaining the same result.
 But, as the pollster Mr. Hilmer said, ''The C.D.U. has always been the party of no tax increases, and the first thing they do is announce an increase in the V.A.T.'' It was an honest gesture by Mrs. Merkel, political commentators have argued, and she deserves credit for being up front about what will she will do if she does become chancellor. But for the moment, it didn't wash.
 It could also be said that Mrs. Merkel has seemed more of a tinkerer with details of the system than a charismatic Thatcher-like leader enunciating a grand alternative vision, and a few weeks ago that did not stop her from looking extremely strong politically. She may, of course, soon look as strong again, especially if she does well in the one televised debate she will have with Mr. Schroder, on Sept. 4.
 The mercurial nature of the German mood may have less to do with this or that Merkelian gaffe and more to do with the Germans themselves, perhaps even a tearing at the collective consciousness. In their heads, the Germans seem to know that the Social Democratic and Green Party coalition has failed to lower unemployment and restart the economy, so they are still for Mrs. Merkel.
 They also seem to feel that reforms are necessary, but reforms also make them deeply anxious, and, when they are anxious, they also yearn for the candidate they know. 
 And so, for months the Germans have been expressing their discontent with Mr. Schroder and the governing coalition. And now that Mr. Schroder has become a sure loser, they appear to be experiencing a kind of anticipatory nostalgia for him, along with an anticipatory disillusionment with his presumed successor, whom they will elect even though they like her less, according to polls. It raises the possibility that public opinion will refuse to coalesce behind any government or any program, whether pushed by a victorious Christian Democratic-led coalition, or, if the fragmented electorate so decrees, a coalition with Social Democrats.
 Chronic public dissatisfaction has plagued Mr. Schroder for much of his second term, so political analysts agree that under whatever circumstances Mrs. Merkel becomes chancellor, she will need a clear mandate to rejuvenate Germany's economic health. But the question is: Is Germany prepared to give her one?


CORRECTION-DATE: August 15, 2005

 CORRECTION:
The Letter from Europe article on Thursday about the increasingly uncertain outcome of the elections in Germany next month misspelled the name of the German news magazine that proclaimed the race to be ''suddenly wide open again.'' It is Der Spiegel, not Speigel.

HEADLINE: America's Summer of Discontent

 BODY:
Yesterday, Unocal shareholders agreed to be bought by Chevron for about $18 billion in the biggest oil acquisition in years. The deal brought to a final close a sad hostile takeover fight in which a Chinese government-owned company, Cnooc, was effectively blocked from the game by a hostile United States Congress. 
 When analysts and economic historians look back, this summer may well prove to be the turning point in Chinese-American relations, the time when America chose short-range paranoia over rational behavior. From the dozen or so proposals in Congress for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports to the Pentagon's rumblings about Chinese military buildups, the rhetoric from Washington keeps escalating. America seems to be on the run, fueled by the false perception that China's rapid economic rise poses an inevitable threat to the United States. By repeatedly demonizing China, Washington risks creating the hostility it fears. 
The Chinese economic surge has been awesome. If America is going to respond to it reasonably, its leaders -- and the public -- will have to acknowledge the obvious: China is no longer a second-level economic power that can be bullied around. America's financial stability rests in no small way on the continued Chinese purchase of the government's debt. And in foreign affairs, China's concerns will have to be part of almost every calculation. Congress had the power to insert a clause in the energy bill that would make it all but impossible for the Chinese to buy Unocal. But Congress cannot stop China's thirst for oil. Its energy consumption has increased phenomenally, up 65 percent between 2002 and 2004. It is now the second-largest oil market in the world, behind the United States. Among the places it has been shopping are Iran and Sudan. 
 Those oil-market relationships have already created considerable problems for the United States. Part of the reason it was so hard for America and Britain to get the humanitarian crisis in Darfur onto the United Nations' Security Council agenda last year was because China resisted calls to pressure the Sudanese government. Similarly, any attempt to impose United Nations economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program now risks running into opposition from Beijing.
 The scheduled visit of China's president, Hu Jintao, to Washington next month is a chance to put Chinese-American relations on a sounder footing. President Bush should seize the opportunity to muzzle the anti-China crowd who are putting flashy sound bites ahead of America's greater global interests.

HEADLINE: Yahoo Is Paying $1 Billion For 40% Stake in Alibaba 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Thursday, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Stepping up its presence in China, Yahoo Inc. said on Thursday that it would pay $1 billion in cash and hand over its operations in China to Alibaba.com in exchange for a 40 percent stake in China's largest e-commerce company.
 The deal is expected to create the largest and most diversified Internet company in China. It will also create a fierce rival for Google and Ebay, which are also trying to expand their operations in China. 
 The deal, which was being announced Thursday afternoon in Beijing, also is the largest foreign investment ever made in a Chinese technology company. 
 And it comes at a time when some of the world's largest technology companies are racing to get a foothold in China's fast-growing Internet business.
 After the deal is completed, Yahoo will become the largest shareholder in Alibaba.com, a privately-held company that also operates the popular online auction site Taobao.com. 
 The management of Alibaba.com, which is based in the city of Hangzhou, will combine the operations of Alibaba.com and Yahoo China. 
 Executives at Yahoo, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that the strategic investment was modeled after the company's investment in Yahoo Japan and that it is a long-term plan to strengthen the company's position in China by offering business-to-business and consumer auctions, online advertising, search engines and electronic e-mail messaging.
 ''We're thinking long-term about the fastest-growing country in the world for the internet,'' Terry S. Semel, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. 
 Alibaba.com was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, an English teacher turned tech entrepreneur. Some of the $1 billion that will be used to capitalize the new company. 
 Analysts say the deal could significantly increase Yahoo's fortunes in China. The Silicon Valley Internet giant was widely believed to be trailing its biggest competitors in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
 The world's biggest technology companies have been moving aggressively over the last year to invest in China's fast-growing Internet and online auction businesses. Yahoo, Google, Microsoft and Ebay have all made sizeable investments here. And Silicon Valley venture capital firms have also ear-marked hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in Chinese technology companies. 
 China already has about 100 million Internet users, second only to the United States. And by 2010, some forecasts project that China will surpass the United States.

HEADLINE: The Price of Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''That Hissing Sound'' (column, Aug. 8):
Paul Krugman thinks that everyone -- not just owners of coastal real estate -- should be worried about the possible end of the housing bubble. It's hard to see why. Current housing prices are completely out of sync with wages. 
 As 30-something prospective first-time home buyers, my wife and I (we have one child) find ourselves completely priced out of the New York market, despite a six-figure household income. And the prospect of affording still more space for an expanded family seems beyond a pipe dream.
 I, for one, hope that the housing bubble bursts, and bursts spectacularly, not with reduced rates of appreciation but with dramatic falls in value.
 When only millionaires can own a family home, we're in desperate need of a major correction.

HEADLINE: Crossing Borders, Crossing Boundaries?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students learn about how the United States government is using biometrics to secure American borders. They then examine the pitfalls of biometrics programs and propose possible ways to strengthen the program. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students learn about how the United States government is using biometrics to secure American borders. They then examine the pitfalls of biometrics programs and propose possible ways to strengthen the program.
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will:
 1. Consider ways that the United States government could use science and technology to secure its borders.
 2. Learn about how the United States is using biometric science to secure American borders by reading and discussing the article "Hurdles for High-Tech Efforts to Track Who Crosses Borders."
 3. Work in small groups to create solutions to current problems in American biometrics programs.
 4. Write a letter to the Department of Homeland Security outlining the problems with the program and proposing solutions. 
Resources / Materials:
-classroom board
 -pens/pencils
 -paper
 -student journals
 -copies of the article "Hurdles for High-Tech Efforts to Track Who Crosses Borders," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050811thursday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students find a partner and brainstorm in response to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: "Brainstorm three ways that U.S. Homeland Security and Border Control could use science and technology to protect U.S. borders from terrorists. Be creative yet practical."
 Allow students a few moments to create their lists, and then have them share their responses with the class. Make sure they mention methods of identifying and tracking people using passports and visas. Ask them if they think there are any ethical limits to using technology to track and/or identify people. Could their technological approaches be used on Americans as well as foreigners? Why or why not? When does technological tracking begin to infringe on privacy, if ever? Are scientific approaches tamperproof? Can you think of any ways of getting around them?
 2. As a class, read and discuss, "Hurdles for High-Tech Efforts to Track Who Crosses Borders" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050811thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:
 a. What is the United States government's biometrics program intended to do?
 b. Why has the United States government been collecting biometric data?
 c. What are Representative Dan Lungren's views on the biometrics program?
 d. How does the Department of Homeland Security defend its record?
 e. What about the biometrics program has been successful so far, according to the State Department?
 f. According to the article, what is the pitfall of the new electronic passports?
 g. According to the article, what is the pitfall of the new program, US-Visit?
 h. What are the costs of US-Visit? Why are they so high?
 i. On what unique human characteristics does the science of biometrics rely?
 j. What is the process of biometric enhanced screening?
 k. What biometric tool is being used in rural Kentucky?
 l. How have facial recognition systems been effective, according to the article?
 m. Where and what has been the "most effective effort so far"? 
 n. For what purpose may facial recognition technology eventually be used?
 o. Why have relatively few airline passengers taken part in the automatic fingerprint and eye scan program known as Registered Traveler?
 p. What do critics say about the visas that transmit radio signals?
 q. What is Rep. Lungren's view of the use of birth certificates as proof of identity for passport applications?

 3. Make sure that students understand the basics of biometrics. Ask them which unique human characteristics are examined in biometrics. Make sure they mention, as the article does, "fingerprints, facial dimensions or the rings and furrows in the colored tissue of the eye." Inform students that now that they understand the basics of biometric technology, they will be acting as a citizens review board brought in by Homeland Security to assess the strengths, weaknesses and ethical dilemmas of the biometrics program, and to make recommendations for strengthening it.
 Divide the class into 5 groups and explain that each group will focus on one weakness of the biometrics program discussed in the article and try to create solutions to the problem.
 Group 1: Lack of a computer-based biometric analysis available within passports that can be checked against the passport holders' eye, fingers and/or facial structure.
 Group 2: The US-Visit program can track only people's arrivals into the country, not visitors' departures.
 Group 3: Air travelers opt not to use the Registered Traveler program because they see no benefit.
 Group 4: Because there is no biometric check on visas with radio signals, people can give their visas to others to carry across the border.
 Group 5: The State Department uses easily forged proof of identity documents like birth certificates to issue biometric passports, making it easy for people to get "tamperproof fake IDs."
 Each group should create responses to the following questions (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):
 -What exactly is the problem?
 -What is missing from this aspect of the biometrics program?
 -What are three possible ways to change this aspect of the program to make it more effective? Which do you believe is the most effective option? The most cost-effective option? The most practical option?
 -What steps would need to be taken in order to initiate these changes?
 -What obstacles would arise if Homeland Security or Border Patrol attempted to make these changes? How would you suggest dealing with these obstacles?
 -What ethical guidelines should biometrics experts keep in mind when using this biometric technology? When do people's privacy rights begin to be compromised or violated?
 Before the end of class, have each group present its proposed changes. Allow discussion about other problems that might arise after implementing their proposed changes. Ask students if they think that all of the proposed changes are ethical. Why or why not?
 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write a letter to the Department of Homeland Security outlining the problems that they see with the biometrics program and proposing the solutions discussed in class. Students should focus on the particular problem that they worked on during class. They should feel free to suggest additional solutions that their group did not develop during class.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Do you think that the government is using taxpayers' money effectively in their implementation of biometrics programs? Why or why not?
 -If you had the choice to use a fingerprint scanning machine in an airport, would you use it? Why or why not?
 -What other programs besides biometrics do you think the American government should be developing to protect American borders?
 -Do you think that securing its borders is the most important thing for the United States to be focusing on when trying to protect against terrorism? Why or why not?
 -Besides securing borders, what other types of programs do you think the United States should implement in order to ward off terrorism? 
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their responses to the Warm-Up exercise, participation in small group discussion and presentation, and thoughtful completion of a letter to the Department of Homeland Security.
Vocabulary:
biometrics, repositories, subsequent, mandates, provoking, ambitious, marginal, formative, dimensions, furrows, enhanced, ineligible, comprehensive, fraudulent, tamperproof
Extension Activities:
1. Research the technology behind computer-based biometric analysis. Design a flow chart that describes how biometric information is encoded into passports and visas and how it is read by government officials.
 2. Research the growing relationship between obtaining a visa and biometrics. Begin from the moment a foreigner applies for a visa and show every step that applies to biometrics until they have entered the country. Create an informational pamphlet for people who might wish to apply for a visa.
 3. Research the human eye. Create a poster that outlines the parts of the eye and covers diseases that can affect the health and structure of the eye. What are the best protections against eye diseases? Can any of these diseases affect the rings and furrows of the eye that are examined in biometrics?
 4. Read the novel "1984" by George Orwell. Write a short story, in the style of "1984," about a world in which biometrics are taken to the extreme. What kind of control can a government gain by using biometrics? 
Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History - Research the history of border security in the United States. Create a timeline that notes all important events and legislation regarding border security. Which groups of people have historically had trouble visiting the United States?
 Economics - Research the amount of money that has been spent on biometrics in the last few years. Look into how private corporations are involved in the development of biometrics. Using a series of charts that describe the costs and benefits of the program, construct an argument about whether or not you believe the government is using security funds effectively.
 Geography - Research what nations are on the United States' list of 27 visa waiver nations. On a world map, add a few sentences about each country that explains why the United States might have granted them visa waiver status.
 Media Studies - Watch a Hollywood film that focuses on government tracking methods (examples include "Gattaca" [1997] and "Enemy of the State" [1998]). Pay particular attention to fact versus fiction. Write a review of the movie that discusses what technology in the film is real and what is Hollywood imagination.
 Teaching with The Times - Read the Times for two weeks and collect all the articles you can find that touch on United States security. Once you have a collection of articles, write an Op-Ed about the state of United States security today. What do you think the United States is doing well? How do you think it can improve its efforts?

HEADLINE: Racial and Ethnic Minorities Gain in the Nation as a Whole

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The nation as a whole is moving in the direction of its two most populous states, California and Texas, where members of racial and ethnic minorities account for more than half the population, the Census Bureau said Thursday.
 Non-Hispanic whites now make up two-thirds of the nation's total population, the bureau said, but that proportion will dip to one-half by 2050, according to the agency's latest projections.
In a new report, estimating population levels as of July 1, 2004, the Census Bureau said Texas had a minority population of 11.3 million, accounting for 50.2 percent of its total population of 22.5 million. 
 Texas is the fourth state in which minority groups, taken together, account for a majority of the population. But no one racial or ethnic group by itself accounts for a majority of the total population there. 
 Steven H. Murdock, the state demographer for Texas, said, ''In some sense, Texas is a preview of what the nation will become in the long run.''
 ''Our future in Texas is increasingly tied to our minority populations,'' Mr. Murdock said. If their education and skills continue to lag, he added, the state will be less competitive in the global economy. 
 Members of racial and ethnic minorities also make up more than half the population in Hawaii (77 percent) and New Mexico (56.5 percent). In California, state officials said minorities had accounted for more than half of the population since 1998, and the Census Bureau said they now made up 55.5 percent of the total. Minorities accounted for about 40 percent of the population in each of five other states: Maryland, Mississippi, Georgia, New York and Arizona.
 New York had the largest black population, 3.5 million, while California had the largest Hispanic population (12.4 million) and the largest Asian population (4.8 million).
 Mr. Murdock said immigration accounted for half of the recent increase in Texas's minority population, while half was because of the excess of births over deaths. Hispanic women, who are having children at a rate of 3 per woman, had a significantly higher fertility rate than blacks, with an average of 2.3, and non-Hispanic whites, with an average of 1.9, Mr. Murdock said.
 In the four-year interval from the last census, in April 2000, to July 2004, the bureau reported, the total population of the United States grew 4.3 percent, to 293.7 million, and the black population increased by 5.7 percent, to 39.2 million. But, it said, the Asian population increased 16.2 percent, to 14 million, and the Hispanic population rose 17 percent, to 41.3 million. Hispanics can be of any race.
 In the same four-year period, the bureau said, the non-Hispanic white population grew 1.1 percent, to 197.8 million, while the rest of the nation -- the ''minority population'' -- grew 11.6 percent, to 95.8 million.
 Cecilia Munoz, a vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group, said: ''This great diversity and constant demographic change make us a dynamic country. They do not cause unrest or commotion. They are part of a process that's intrinsically American.''
 Ms. Munoz said ''the political strength of Latinos takes a while to catch up with our demographic strength,'' in part because one-third of the Latino population is under the age of 18 and many Hispanics are not citizens.
 Among counties, the Census Bureau said, Los Angeles had the largest Hispanic population, 4.6 million, and the largest Asian population, 1.4 million. Non-Hispanic whites accounted for just 30 percent of the county's total population of 9.9 million.
 Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, had the largest black population, 1.4 million.
 The Census Bureau figures show that Hispanics account for 36 percent of the total population in the nation's five largest counties: 9.1 million of the 25.4 million people who live in Los Angeles, Cook County, Harris County, Tex. (Houston), Maricopa County, Ariz. (Phoenix) and Orange County, Calif.
 In Texas, as in many other states, said Mr. Murdock, a professor at the University of Texas, San Antonio, ''the white population is growing very slowly, while other racial and ethnic groups are growing quite rapidly.'' 
 Officials in California and Texas said Hispanics had fanned out across their states, while the black population tended to be more concentrated in urban areas.
 Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in four of the five largest cities in Texas, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and El Paso, Mr. Murdock said. But, he said, they also account for much of the population growth in rural counties.
