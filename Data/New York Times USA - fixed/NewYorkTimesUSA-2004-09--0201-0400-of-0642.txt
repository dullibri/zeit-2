HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees More Traction In Expansion

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that the economic expansion had ''regained some traction'' after the slowdown this summer and suggested that the central bank could be expected to keep raising interest rates, including at its next meeting later this month. 
 ''The most recent data suggest that, on the whole, the expansion has regained some traction,'' Mr. Greenspan told the House Budget Committee. 
 ''Consumer spending and housing starts bounced back in July after weak performances in June,'' he said, while consumer prices are climbing more slowly than they did last spring. 
 The Fed chairman again described the recent slowdown as a ''soft patch'' that stemmed largely from a surge in oil prices. Though he expressed concern that oil prices could remain high for some time, he was cautiously optimistic that higher prices would drive down demand and encourage oil producers to expand capacity.
 Taken together, Mr. Greenspan's remarks did nothing to dissuade investors from their widespread expectation that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates by another quarter point, to 1.75 percent, at the next policy meeting on Sept. 21.
 But his comments also helped assuage fears that the Fed might be inclined toward a more aggressive policy of raising interest rates. In response, the bond market rose as the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.16 percent from 4.24 percent on Tuesday. 
 The Federal Reserve's beige book, which compiles reports of business conditions and was released on Wednesday, reported that consumer spending softened in July and August but noted that overall economic activity remained healthy. [Page C4.] 
 ''One can certainly draw the conclusion that the Fed will continue its program of small rate increases, at least until the elections,'' said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at ABN Amro North America. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Greenspan distanced himself a bit more from the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans on the issue of reducing the federal deficit. As he has before, the Federal Reserve chairman urged lawmakers to reinstate rules that expired in 2002 that required Congress to pay for both tax cuts and new spending programs by either spending cuts or tax increases in other areas.
 President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress have opposed applying any such ''pay-as-you-go'' restrictions on tax cuts, insisting that restrictions should apply only to new spending programs.
 Mr. Greenspan said the federal government needed to act quickly, because it will begin to face much bigger fiscal problems in the next few years as the nation's baby boomers begin to reach retirement age and start demanding Social Security and Medicare benefits.
 ''I would prefer to have lower taxes and lower spending,'' Mr. Greenspan told lawmakers. 
 In contrast to previous testimony, when Mr. Greenspan strongly urged Congress to resort to tax increases only as a last resort to reduce the deficit, he placed more emphasis on Wednesday on the need to address the long-term fiscal imbalances as quickly as possible. ''You should not be borrowing for your tax cuts,'' he said.
 But a leading House Republican bluntly told the Fed chairman that there was no willingness among Republicans to reinstate the old budget rules.
 ''You cannot manufacture a consensus for statutory controls when the consensus for budget discipline is not strong enough,'' said Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
 ''I do not believe, unfortunately, there is a broad enough consensus necessary to enact budget controls into law.'' 
 After a brief period of budget surpluses that ended in 2001, the government has run progressively bigger shortfalls every year.
 The deficit is expected to exceed $420 billion this year, and the Congressional Budget Office predicted on Tuesday that deficits would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years if existing laws remain unchanged.
 If President Bush succeeds in making his tax cuts permanent, and making other tax changes he has supported, the debt would rise by more than $2 trillion on top of that.
 Economists and investors had been anxiously awaiting Mr. Greenspan's testimony about the economy, because a raft of data has shown that the rapid growth from last fall and early this year abruptly abated in June. 
 That left the Federal Reserve, which began in June to systematically raise rates in a series of small moves, in the uncomfortable position of raising borrowing costs even as the economy was slowing.
 Mr. Greenspan admitted that job creation and consumer spending slowed sharply in June, but he said more recent signs pointed to a rebound in growth. Business investment is on ''a solid upward trend,'' manufacturing has continued to expand and job creation picked up in August, he told lawmakers.
 Mr. Greenspan expressed more unease than in the past about high oil prices, which recently rose to nearly $50 a barrel, but have fallen back to around $43.
 ''Future balances between supply and demand will remain precarious,'' Mr. Greenspan said. 
 ''The growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of China and India, have propelled prices of distant futures to levels well above their ranges of recent years.''
 Few analysts were surprised that Mr. Greenspan signaled that the Fed would continue gradually raising interest rates. Even after back-to-back rate increases in June and August, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks remains so low that it still represents a policy of relatively cheap money, by almost any measure.
 But some analysts were startled at Mr. Greenspan's apparent conviction that the ''soft patch'' is almost over. 
 ''As much as we would like to be optimistic,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a newsletter to clients, ''we found Mr. Greenspan unconvincing.''

HEADLINE: Give the Chechens a Land of Their Own

BYLINE: By Richard Pipes. 
Richard Pipes is an emeritus professor of history at Harvard and the author of ''A Concise History of the Russian Revolution'' and, most recently, of ''Vixi: The Memoirs of a Non-Belonger.''

 BODY:
The terrorist attack in Beslan in Russia's North Caucasus was not only bloody but viciously sadistic: the children taken hostage by pro-Chechen terrorists were denied food and drink and even forbidden to go to the bathroom, then massacred when the siege was broken. It is proper for the civilized world to express outrage and feel solidarity with the Russian people. But to say this is not necessarily to agree with those -- including President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia -- who would equate the massacre with the 9/11 attacks and Islamic terrorism in general.
 In his post-Beslan speech, Mr. Putin all but linked the attack to global Islam: ''We have to admit that we have failed to recognize the complexity and dangerous nature of the processes taking place in our own country and the world in general.'' Reports that some of the terrorists were Arabs reinforce that line of thinking. But the fact is, the Chechen cause and that of Al Qaeda are quite different, and demand very different approaches in combating them. 
 Terrorism is a means to an end: it can be employed for limited ends as well as for unlimited destructiveness. The terrorists who blew up the train station in Madrid just before the Spanish election this year had a specific goal in mind: to compel the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq. The Chechen case is, in some respects, analogous. A small group of Muslim people, the Chechens have been battling their Russian conquerors for centuries. 
 At the close of World War II, Stalin had the entire Chechen nation exiled to Kazakhstan for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. Khrushchev allowed them to return to their homeland but they continued to chafe under Russian rule. Because Chechnya, unlike the Ukraine or Georgia, had never enjoyed the status of a nominally independent republic under the Communists, the Chechens were denied the right to secede from the Russian Federation after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And so they eventually resorted to terrorism for the limited objective of independence.
 A clever arrangement secured by the Russian security chief, Gen. Alexander Lebed, in 1996 granted the Chechens de facto sovereignty while officially they remained Russian citizens. Peace ensued. It was broken by several terrorist attacks on Russian soil, which the authorities blamed on the Chechens (although many skeptics attributed them to Russian security agencies eager to create a pretext to bring Chechnya back into the fold). A second Chechen war began in 1999, of which there seems no end in sight.
 This history makes clear how the events in Russia differ from 9/11. The attacks on New York and the Pentagon were unprovoked and had no specific objective. Rather, they were part of a general assault of Islamic extremists bent on destroying non-Islamic civilizations. As such, America's war with Al Qaeda is non-negotiable. But the Chechens do not seek to destroy Russia -- thus there is always an opportunity for compromise. 
 Unfortunately, Russia's leaders, and to some extent the populace, are loath to grant them independence -- in part because of a patrimonial mentality that inhibits them from surrendering any territory that was ever part of the Russian homeland, and in part because they fear that granting the Chechens sovereignty would lead to a greater unraveling of their federation. The Kremlin also does not want to lose face by capitulating to force.
 The Russians ought to learn from the French. France, too, was once involved in a bloody colonial war in which thousands fell victim of terrorist violence. The Algerian war began in 1954 and dragged on without an end in sight, until Charles de Gaulle courageously solved the conflict by granting Algeria independence in 1962. This decision may have been even harder than the choice confronting President Putin, because Algeria was much larger and contributed more to the French economy than Chechnya does to Russia's, and hundreds of thousands of French citizens lived there.
 Until and unless Moscow follows the French example, the terrorist menace will not be alleviated. It is as impossible to track Chechens scattered throughout Russia as it is to intimidate the suicidal fanatics among them. Worse, the continuation of Chechen terrorism threatens to undermine the authority of Mr. Putin, whose landslide victory in last spring's presidential election was in good measure due to the voters' belief that he could contain the Chechen threat. Russians respect strong authority, and there are new signs that Mr. Putin's inability to wield it over Chechnya makes them wonder whether he is fit to rule them. After the school siege, there was much muttering in the streets that under Stalin such atrocities would not have occurred. 
 Unfortunately, he seems determined not to yield an inch. ''We showed weakness, and the weak are trampled upon,'' he said on Saturday. This may seem like a truism to Russians, but in this case it is wrong. Russia, the largest country on earth, can surely afford to let go of a tiny colonial dependency, and ought to do so without delay.

HEADLINE: Cheney and the Politics of Terror

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney want us to fear everything. Fear the terrorists, fear Muslims, fear gays. 
 I am sick and tired of living in fear. I'm tired of plastic bags and duct tape. I'm tired of alerts telling me whether or not I can walk outside. In America, we celebrate freedom and hope, not fear. 
 The sky is not falling, but the economy is. Terror alerts aren't rising, but our health care costs are. 
 America should be a bastion of hope. Jobs, affordable health care and respect from the world -- these will bring hope, and hope is what prevents terrorism.

HEADLINE: Unraveling Kerry's Iraq Plan

 BODY:
Nobody gets angrier about Senator John Kerry's complicated position on Iraq than his own supporters. The Democratic base would love to see him lashing out at President Bush over the war. But for all of his current tough talk about Mr. Bush's ''wrong choices,'' Mr. Kerry has blurred his message, particularly with his recent statement that he would have voted for the Senate's war resolution even if he had known that Saddam Hussein had no significant cache of weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Kerry also basically agrees with the president that it is now necessary to stay the course -- something that will require a continued American military presence in Iraq for years. It's no wonder the issue hasn't provided the Democrats much traction.
 Despite our own grave misgivings about the chances of a happy outcome in Iraq, this page has also argued that as long as there is even a modest hope of making things work, the United States and its allies should continue to provide economic support and security. So it's hard for us to criticize Mr. Kerry for his similar stance, especially since this is not his war. People who are unhappy with the way Iraq is going may be frustrated by Mr. Kerry, but they should direct their real anger at Mr. Bush. 
 Still, voters need a much clearer sense of what Mr. Kerry would do differently. His advisers provide a to-do list that is not exactly full of dramatic new ideas. Much of the Democrats' counterpolicy for Iraq involves the conviction that as president, Mr. Kerry could still get the broad international support that Mr. Bush failed to rally before the invasion. They also argue that if the administration were willing to offer allies a broader share in reconstruction contracts, the allies would be more willing to help with things like providing financial aid, training security forces and guarding Iraq's borders. 
 None of that would address the need for more international combat troops. That train has left the station, and nations with the capacity to help will be unlikely to sign on for what looks like a very unpromising enterprise, no matter who is in the White House. Still, Mr. Kerry's proposal is a sensible one.
 Many of Mr. Kerry's other ideas on Iraq are similar to the current administration's, but he says he'd do a much better job of providing more security for the United Nations workers who are attempting to organize the coming elections, fixing Iraq's infrastructure and, above all, training more Iraqi soldiers and security guards, doing it faster and more effectively. Those are important points, underscored by two bits of very bad news this week: the Marines have largely abandoned the Sunni triangle, and the toll of American dead has now passed 1,000, with many times that number grievously wounded. If the mission in Iraq is doable, the Bush administration can certainly be faulted for failing to do it well.
 But Mr. Kerry has to make his arguments with urgency. Simply promising that things will turn around under a new administration isn't enough. If there is a moment for turning Iraq around, it will have passed by the time the next president is inaugurated in January. National elections are scheduled in Iraq by the end of that month. If things continue as they seem to be going now, Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south will be able to vote, while large chunks of the Sunni community will be unable to participate because of the violence in the middle of the country. 
 That is a recipe to splinter Iraq in just the way the first President George Bush feared in 1991, when he decided not to attempt to march on Baghdad. The world would be left with two new nation-states, one in the south, probably dominated by Iran, and one in the north, in constant tension with Turkey. The middle of the country would be an angry no man's land without financial resources or a stable government, which would be a haven for terrorists and a perpetual grievance for the Sunni-dominated Arab world.
 Mr. Kerry's advisers say it is critical to provide security for elections in the Sunni region -- without saying that their candidate would go any farther than Mr. Bush in attempting to subdue rebellious towns like Falluja. The Democrats do not want to go on record as supporting military actions that would kill more Americans -- particularly since the Bush administration was right in not pursuing a strategy that would lead to house-to-house battles in an area filled with civilians.
 One thing Mr. Kerry should certainly be stressing is the way Iraq has drained the nation's attention away from imperative antiterrorism missions. It is outrageous to hear Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney boasting about American successes in Afghanistan at a time when the Taliban is gaining a new foothold in the country, the warlords are in the ascendant and supporters of international terrorism are playing important parts in the American-supported government in Kabul. Mr. Kerry should also be pressing the Bush administration to get back into the game when it comes to pushing the Israelis and Palestinians to restart the peace process -- a move he is unfortunately reluctant to make, given his anxieties about the Jewish vote in states like Florida. 
 Although Mr. Kerry's agenda for change in Iraq lacks drama, if he truly believes that many of the problems there are caused by ineptitude in the training of local security forces, he should say so forcefully every day, while there is still a little time to improve the situation before voting begins in January. If he sincerely believes that other nations can be brought into the effort there, he should be much more forthright in explaining how he could do it.
 Given the political corner Mr. Kerry has painted himself into, it's not surprising that his advisers are urging him to start concentrating on the economy. But Iraq is still the great crisis confronting the United States. While the temptation to dodge it at this point is natural, Mr. Kerry should resist.

HEADLINE: China Poised For Decision On Raising Interest Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
With a slew of important economic statistics due for release in the next several days, China's central bank is in the final stages of deciding on what could be the country's first increase in interest rates in nine years, economists and government-controlled media said on Wednesday.
 China faces rising inflation and signs that speculative investments have increased steeply in the last few weeks. Since last spring, Beijing has been trying to rein in many building projects, especially those financed with loans obtained by dubious means from government-owned banks and proceeding without zoning or environmental approvals.
 Numerous reports in the government-controlled media have said that the central bank, the People's Bank of China, has already decided to raise the benchmark rate for one-year corporate loans at the end of the month. Senior bank officials denied the reports on Wednesday. 
 ''There is no such thing -- the central bank has not issued anything like that and the reports have completely no basis,'' said Yi Gang, the bank's monetary policy director.
 The official New China News Agency reported on Wednesday that Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, had said that a decision would have to wait for the release of economic statistics for August, expected in the next few days.
 The one-year lending rate, which stands at 5.31 percent, is used as the base for calculating interest rates for a variety of corporate loans.
 Expectations that a rate increase could come soon were fed by a report on Tuesday in Securities Market Weekly, an official newspaper controlled by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China's version of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Citing an unidentified official at a big commercial bank, the report said that the one-year rate would be raised to 5.76 percent during the weeklong National Day holiday at the start of October. Bank deposit rates, also regulated, would not rise, the report said.
 Frank Gong, an economist with J.P. Morgan, said in a research report on Wednesday morning that rates would rise. ''We believe the debate on the rate hike is closing, and the first rate hike is expected in late September,'' he said.
 Mr. Gong said that the People's Bank of China was likely to act only after the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 21 and decides whether to raise short-term interest rates in the United States. 
 An American increase would make an increase in China more likely because the yuan is pegged to the dollar.
 China's consumer price index has risen 5.3 percent in the year through July, meaning that a company that borrowed money at 5.31 percent a year earlier could pay it back essentially without interest, after adjusting for inflation.
 But even that situation understates the incentive for companies to borrow heavily and to plow the money into investments or stockpiles of raw materials in short supply. The government regulates prices for many consumer goods and services, to avoid upsetting the public, and this has held down increases in the consumer price index.
 Industrial prices are less regulated, however, and those climbed 14 percent in the first seven months of the year. 
 That figure is a better indicator of the business conditions facing companies, and a sign that China's interest rates have actually been deeply negative.
 Still, there have been a few signs that administrative measures, like restrictions on bank loans, have slowed the economy somewhat in the last few months.
 Industrial output climbed 15.5 percent in July compared with a year earlier, down from a peak of 23 percent growth in February. An official at the National Bureau of Statistics said that the industrial production figure for August should be released on Friday, and the consumer price index for August should come out on Monday.
 The People's Bank of China had been expected to release the August figures for money supply and domestic credit on Friday as well. 
 But a bank official said that it was still awaiting figures from the statistical bureau, and that the numbers would be released by next Wednesday instead.
 While interpreting bureaucratic maneuverings in China is always difficult, many economists and bankers with connections in Beijing have said in recent weeks that an economic policy tussle is under way there. 
 The skirmish pits Western-trained economists at economic policy agencies like the central bank and the securities commission against political bosses who are leery of higher interest rates, fearing they could halt or even reverse China's upward-spiraling property prices.
 In the Chinese government's weekly auction of one-year Treasury notes on Tuesday, interest rates climbed to 3.46 percent from 3.41 percent a week earlier. But demand for the notes was very strong and the government nearly quadrupled the volume of bills auctioned, to $1.8 billion worth.
 Interpreting such auctions is difficult in China. 
 In the United States, such strong demand for bills and a fairly modest increase in interest rates could be a sign that investors were confident that inflation would not rise much in the next 12 months.
 But in China, where four deeply troubled, government-owned banks dominate the financial system, the strong demand could be another sign that the banks remain awash with cash. 
 Foreign investment has been flowing rapidly into China for the last two years, and the central bank has swapped the incoming dollars for yuan, sharply expanding the money supply and feeding inflation.
 China was suffering from deflation just two years ago, but annual growth of 15 percent to 20 percent in the supply of yuan created an inflation problem instead. 
 China's initial efforts to slow the economy last spring caused Chinese stocks to lose more than a quarter of their value in a month, and they have only begun showing faint signs of recovery in the last several weeks.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline as Companies Cut Estimates for Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as lower profit forecasts from the McKesson Corporation, the Dean Foods Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises overshadowed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments about the economy. United States Treasury notes rose.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,116.27, retreating from a two-month high. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 29.43, or 0.3 percent, to 10,313.36, as a gain in I.B.M. limited the decline. The Nasdaq composite index slid 7.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,850.64. The three benchmarks dropped for the second time in three days. 
 About seven stocks fell for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.25 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, the busiest day in three weeks.
 Benchmark indexes reached their highs for the day, with the S.&P. 500 gaining as much as 0.2 percent, after Mr. Greenspan's speech was released at 10:30 a.m. Washington time. The advances faded within 10 minutes.
 ''The most recent data suggest that, on the whole, the expansion has regained some traction,'' Greenspan said in testimony to the House Budget Committee. ''Despite the rise in oil prices through mid-August, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.''
 The decline in the S.&P. 500 was led by McKesson. The stock fell $4.85, or 15 percent, to $26.98, a 16-month low. The company, a major United States drug wholesaler, said earnings in the second quarter ending Sept. 30 would drop by more than half, to 20 cents to 25 cents a share, because of fewer price increases. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 50 cents, according to Thomson Financial.
 Dean Foods, the nation's largest milk producer, sank $6.73, or 18 percent, to $30.40. The company said 2004 earnings would be $2 to $2.05 a share, less than its forecast of $2.21 to $2.26 in August.
 Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest soft-drink distributor, shed $1.11, to $19.48. Earnings this year will fall more than it had expected because higher prices and cooler weather are hurting sales, the company said. Profit will be as low as $1.21 a share, less than its forecast in July of about $1.43.
 The Coca-Cola Company, which owns more than a third of the bottler's shares, slumped $2.20, or 4.8 percent, to $43.45, for the biggest decline in the Dow average.
 Pepsi Bottling Group Inc., the largest distributor of PepsiCo Inc. beverages, lost $1.34, to $25.80. An index of food and beverage stocks slid 2.1 percent, for the steepest drop among the S&P 500's 24 industry groups.
 I.B.M., the world's biggest computer maker, added 89 cents, to $85.86, rising the most in the Dow average. 
 United States Treasuries rose to their highest in three weeks after Mr. Greenspan, although optimistic in some areas, also expressed some caution about the economy. An increase in demand at the government's auction of $15 billion of debt also lifted Treasuries.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 20/32, to 100 23/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.16 percent, from 4.24 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Says Arrests Disrupted Trade in Stolen or Expired Medicine

BYLINE: By JASON GEORGE

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Federal agents conducted raids in New Jersey, New York and three other states on Thursday to break up what they said were operations that distributed more than $56 million worth of expired or stolen medicines in the past 15 months.
 Criminal complaints against 17 men, filed in Federal District Court in Newark on Thursday, said 29 drugs were involved, including the allergy medicine Clarinex, and others that are used to treat heart problems, cancer and H.I.V. Some of the drugs are believed to have been sold to the public, F.B.I. officials said.
 The authorities said that the schemes included changing expiration dates, mislabeling some medicines and storing drugs without proper temperature controls, possibly reducing their effectiveness. 
 Fourteen men were arrested in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Summonses were issued for one man in Georgia and another in Missouri. Another defendant, who was in Tennessee, is scheduled to turn himself in on Friday. Four others were arrested earlier.
 Six of the men charged are licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers, two worked in the shipping department at pharmaceutical companies and one is a pharmaceutical broker. Not all of the men knew one another, said Tom Hauck, the F.B.I. agent who led the investigation, although many of them worked together.
 One criminal complaint says two Schering-Plough employees stole medicine from a New Jersey warehouse. Other complaints say drugs were sold without the proper paperwork and by unlicensed merchants.
 Charges against the men include conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, introduction and delivery of misbranded pharmaceuticals and unlicensed wholesaling, the complaints said.
 The raids were conducted by 116 F.B.I. agents, said Joseph Billy Jr., special agent in charge of the Newark office, which led the inquiry.
 Press officers for five pharmaceutical corporations -- AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer and Schering-Plough -- said they were cooperating in the investigation. 
 One of the men charged, Steven J. Freifeld of Merrick, N.Y., is a pharmacist licensed in New York and the owner of Economy Drug and Surgical at 221-21 Jamaica Avenue, in Queens Village, Queens. In December 2003, Mr. Freifeld asked two men to find deeply discounted prescription drugs: Celebrex, a medication for arthritis; Zoloft, an antidepressant; and Zyrtec, an allergy drug, according to a court document. 
 These two men, who were not licensed as pharmacy wholesalers, were arrested on Dec. 29, 2003, the F.B.I. said. Two other men suspected of being in the ring were also arrested before Thursday, although officials would not supply the exact date.
 The complaint said Mr. Freifeld was coordinating the purchase on behalf of Philip Defonte of Morganville, N.J., a licensed wholesaler, who was also arrested on Thursday.
 An employee at Mr. Freifeld's pharmacy said no one there could comment on the arrest. A woman who answered the telephone at his house and would not give her name said, ''Steven is a good man who has done nothing wrong,'' and hung up. 
 A man who answered the telephone at Mr. Defonte's home said no one there wanted to comment.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop; Imports and Inventories Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Far fewer Americans than expected applied for first-time unemployment benefits last week as the effects of Hurricane Charley faded, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other data, import prices reached an 18-month high and inventories grew.
 Initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped 44,000, to 319,000, in the week ended Saturday from a revised 363,000 the week before. It was the steepest weekly decline since a plunge of 77,000 in December 2001, three months after the terrorist attacks. A Labor Department analyst said the drop partly reflected a fall in claims from Florida after a surge the previous week because of Hurricane Charley. 
 But the figure still widely surpassed Wall Street forecasts of a fall in claims to 346,000.
 The four-week moving average of claims, which tends to smooth out weekly fluctuations, fell 3,750, to 339,250. Economists noted that the four-week average had been in a range of 330,000 to 340,000 for months. 
 Employment has been a weak aspect of the economy, which grew strongly last year without creating much work, though the situation brightened somewhat in August when payrolls increased by 144,000. 
 Economic growth has also driven commodity markets higher worldwide, and the Labor Department reported sharply higher import prices in August, particularly high oil costs. Import prices rose 1.7 percent last month, the largest monthly increase since a similar rise in February 2003, suggesting that inflation pressure might be building even though the pass-through to consumers remains restrained for some products. Wall Street had forecast a milder advance of 0.7 percent.
 Export prices fell 0.5 percent in contrast to a revised 0.5 percent increase in July. 
 The cost of petroleum imports increased 9.6 percent in the month, while nonpetroleum prices increased 0.4 percent. On a year-over-year basis, import prices were up 7.2 percent in August while imports excluding petroleum climbed 3.2 percent. The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 1.3 percent in July compared with 1.1 percent in June, well ahead of analysts' forecasts of a 0.7 percent rise. 
 ''Activity in the manufacturing sector is still very strong and businesses are still restocking their inventories,'' Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist with Banc of America Securities, said. ''Wholesale sales are up 0.5 percent over a range of industries, and that is a pretty solid performance.''

HEADLINE: Our Father The Modernist

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The two bronze figures are meant to be encountered at the end of the ''Alexander Hamilton'' exhibition that opens today at the New-York Historical Society. They are its biographical climax, their tragic impact amplified by what has been already seen: portraits of Hamilton's contemporaries, rare documents, handwritten letters, artifacts of an era in which the nation was coming into being. But since the figures are also just inside the newly opened Central Park West entrance to the venerable institution, they are more likely to be the first things to catch a visitor's attention. This, too, has an effect: they cast a shadow over what is yet to be seen. 
 The life-size sculptures, barely 5 foot 7 inches in height, stand sideways at floor level, just 10 paces apart. Out of the corner of one's eye, they can inspire double takes, as if they were a pair of oddly dressed gallerygoers. Except that they are pointing pistols at each other. 
 A spectacled Hamilton, nonchalantly rests one arm on his waist while leveling an English-made pistol with the other. But his aim is off; he is pointing high and to the right. Aaron Burr, on the other hand -- for indeed it is he -- is absolutely focused. His pistol is aimed dead on. A few seconds later on that morning of July 11, 1804, Hamilton will be carted from the duel site in Weehawken, N.J., across the river to Greenwich Village, where he will die at the age of 47 -- a former secretary of the Treasury of the United States murdered by the country's vice president. 
 Kim Crowley's sculptures are so vivid that one is tempted to intervene in this twisted drama -- to quiet the unbridled passions and prideful sense of honor that led to this moment. But the bronze figures stand immobile and the lobby area between their pointing pistols seems like some endangered, charged space, through which one warily walks. 
 Charged space: that is what this exhibition has come to inhabit as well. It marks an ambitious transformation of the financially troubled New-York Historical Society. It has also inspired its own controversies as some historians and Society staff members have worried over a possible conservative tilt. The exhibition's curator is the historian Richard Brookhiser, author of ''Alexander Hamilton, American'' (1999) and a senior editor at the conservative National Review. As it turns out, politics is not the problem. There are serious flaws in the exhibition. But they seem caused mainly by its designers; the irony is that these flaws may not be totally unrelated to some of Hamilton's ideas. 
 Controversy, at any rate, may be unavoidable given the subject, for Hamilton always weaved between opponents' volleys as the federal government was formed and American political culture took shape. 
 But his accomplishments can almost seem effortless. A Caribbean-born orphan, Hamilton was appointed to Gen. George Washington's staff in the Revolutionary War at 20; he became a lawyer and a New York delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention; with James Madison and John Jay, he wrote the classic ''Federalist Papers.'' As Washington's Treasury secretary he created the American banking and tax systems. And in his construction of financial institutions, his defense of a strong executive, his arguments against slavery, his belief in a diverse manufacturing economy, he could plausibly be called, as the exhibition's subtitle puts it, ''The Man Who Made Modern America.'' 
 But his enterprise was neither effortless nor preordained. Hamilton was ambitious, argumentative, relentless. He was himself a party to 10 different challenges that involved the threat of duels. A few years before his death, his son was killed in a duel defending Hamilton's honor (using the same pistols). Hamilton confessed to an adulterous affair while secretary of the Treasury, an affair that led to his paying hush money to a conniving swindler. And he was roundly detested by some of the most considerable figures of the day. John Adams said Hamilton was ''the most restless, impatient, artful, indefatigable and unprincipled intriguer in the United States, if not in the world.''
 Hamilton was accused of being a monarchist, of plotting to restore British rule, of harboring disdain for democracy. In fact, Hamilton's successes as Treasury secretary may well have been the catalyst for the two-party system in American politics leading to a decade of vituperation and machination that makes the current era look pastoral. 
 The exhibition, in claiming a central role for Hamilton, also takes a stand in the charged space of contemporary American politics and does so on a big scale. More than $5.7 million was raised for the exhibition; two-thirds of its items come from the Society's own collection, with materials on loan from such sources as the Library of Congress, the Museum of the City of New York and even Credit Suisse First Boston. 
 The show is also meant to have an expansive presence. The Society is offering a series of lectures by major Hamilton scholars. A traveling exhibition (displaying reproductions, not originals) will be seen in 40 cities over the next three years. A Hamilton curriculum will be distributed to 40,000 teachers along with a gallery guide, a documentary by Ric Burns, a DVD of a play about Hamilton by Don Winslow and copies of Mr. Brookhiser's book along with the Library of America's Hamilton volume. A Web site, alexanderhamiltonexhibition.com, provides information and will expand over time.
 By Society standards, the show, which will run through February, is a blockbuster, all the more imposing because it is being presented by an institution that once faced financial ruin and has been reconstituting itself with a new board and a new president, Louise Mirrer. 
 Some of the controversy, though, has arisen over that new direction. A year ago, Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman, wealthy businessmen, joined the board, lending the Society their extraordinary collection of historical documents, building a $1 million vault to store it and moving the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History into the building. James G. Basker, the president of the institute, is the Hamilton exhibition's project director. 
 This has led to concern over undue influence, as if the donors, like Hamilton with his establishment of the American banking system, were instituting an economic regime in which capital was displacing more genteel forms of commerce. And indeed, the Society's financial goals have increased; so have ambitions for attendance. 
 And just as Hamilton's views inspired political opposition, so too has Mr. Gilder's and Mr. Lehrman's involvement; they have been accused of steering the society toward their version of political conservatism even in the choice of subject. Hamilton, partly because of his creation of the institutions of American capitalism and partly because of his philosophical ideas, has become the favored Founding Father for contemporary conservatives. 
 But all this has very little to do with the achievements and failings of the exhibition. The achievements, in fact, aside from the sheer accumulation of artifacts and portraits, are in Mr. Brookhiser's thematic outline of Hamilton's career and its influence. The failings have everything to do with a populist ideology and a straining for sensation that the designers of the exhibition, Ralph Appelbaum Associates, have brought to bear. 
 This gives the exhibition a somewhat schizophrenic quality. Its central gallery, for example, is lined with sober, thematically titled display cases. ''Immigrant'' includes a copy of Hamilton's school exercises, with Greek sentences from ''The Iliad.'' ''Soldier'' includes such items as a July 1776 printing of the Declaration of Independence; ''Lawmaker,'' a drawing of a float honoring Hamilton in the parade celebrating New York's ratification of the Constitution.
 But on the opposite wall of this gallery, as if drumming home the point that ''we live in the world he made,'' are gargantuan video screens, each of which also heralds a theme like ''Rule of Law,'' ''A Free Press,'' ''The Economy.'' The videos are little more than stock film of newsprint presses, commuters in Grand Central Terminal and Times Square stock tickers. It is as if by simply overwhelming the senses, Hamilton's influence could be established. 
 In such a duel between media, what hope do old documents have, particularly when textual explanation is deliberately minimized? Even in the portrait gallery -- in which the paintings are not laid out to be easily viewed and glare reflects off many -- the labels are so compressed that one doesn't often understand how these Hamiltonian ghosts interact. There, too, videos fill up two screens with actors reading quotes about Hamilton by historical figures in the portraits, providing little context. And bafflingly, despite the exhibition's treasures on display, there are no printed transcriptions of the handwritten documents.
 As a result some of the most subtle debates in American history have to be elliptically suggested on brief cards that provide too little for the knowing and not enough for the less informed. One display tells us that Hamilton supported a strong central government, but why was it opposed? Such an explanation would have required more words, indeed an exhibition organized around words, not around flashing images. And that, presumably, would not have satisfied the organizers nor would it have promised sufficient attendance. 
 But this may, inadvertently, touch on one of Hamilton's great themes. Men, Hamilton writes, ''are ambitious, vindictive and rapacious.'' And most famously, in Federalist No. 15, he asks: ''Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint.'' Indeed, Hamilton, like many of the Founders, feared democracy because of the risk that passions would be left with few restraints. 
 But his preoccupation with this theme, at a time when popular passions were most directed toward the overturning of authority, made him seem more anti-democratic than he was. At the same time, though, by arguing against slavery, by devising institutions that acknowledged both authority and passion, he ended up giving the democratic citizen more respect than some of his colleagues. 
 Unfortunately, this exhibition, championing democratic taste, actually respects the citizenry less than Hamilton did. It is designed against its texts. It wants to be an unbounded celebration of sensation and democratic sensibility, free of Hamilton's somberness while still invoking his aura for authority. But Hamilton, who relished the drive of argument and bore no illusions about the struggle required, would probably blanche at this aesthetic and its inherent condescension. 
 So one has to come to this exhibition already prepared. First read Mr. Brookhiser's elegant book or Ron Chernow's engrossing biography of Hamilton and then work through the displays. The issues will become clear. As for sheer sensation, only one image will deservingly endure: the dueling bronze figures and their contested space.

HEADLINE: Falling Bodies: A 9/11 Image Etched in Pain

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN and JIM DWYER

 BODY:
Three years later, they remain open questions, and many people wonder if firm answers would lead to more pain or less, to practical lessons for society or to just a spectacle for the morbidly curious.
 How many people jumped from the upper floors of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11?
 Why did so many more people jump from the north tower than the south?
 What floors did they come from? 
 Who were they? 
 The attack on the World Trade Center was one of the most observed catastrophes in history, and those who fell or jumped from the towers were, briefly, its most public victims. They emerged one or two at a time from a blanket of smoke and fire that rendered mass death virtually invisible. Nearly all the others killed that day -- whether high in the trade center, on board the hijacked airplanes or deep inside the Pentagon -- were beyond the sight of survivors and witnesses. 
 Those who came through the windows of the towers provided the starkest, most harrowing evidence of the desperate conditions inside. Since then, though, they have largely vanished from consideration. Newspapers rarely publish images of the falling people. Evacuation studies concentrated on the accounts of survivors.
 The 9/11 Commission, which has compiled the most detailed history of the day, mentioned those who jumped only as they affected the people on the streets below. 
 Even now, there has been less fact-finding than guesswork. Some researchers say more than 200 people most likely fell or jumped to their death. Others say the number is half that, or fewer. None have been officially identified.
 For the families of those who died, these uncertainties are bound to a sprawling spectrum of contradictory sentiments, impulses, and reluctance about examining this specific wound. Some raised questions about the manner of a loved one's death in meetings at the medical examiner's office, during the identification process, and continue to ponder it; others never pursued the matter in any public fashion.
 ''I want to know everything,'' said Liz Alderman, whose son, Peter, was last seen at a breakfast conference in the north tower. Peter Alderman sent out an e-mail at 9:25 a.m., reporting intense smoke on the 106th floor. What happened after that remains a mystery.
 ''The most important thing I will never know,'' Ms. Alderman said. ''I won't know how much he suffered and I won't know how he died. I travel back into that tower a lot and I try to imagine, but there is no imagining.''
 Still others say they have learned to live with such uncertainties. They are not convinced that exploring the question of who jumped, and from where, is likely to produce anything more than sorrow. 
 Bill Doyle, the outreach director for WTC United Family Group, whose son Joseph died in the north tower, said many people cannot bear the topic. ''A lot of them are still suffering,'' he said. ''They don't want to be reminded that someone might have jumped.''
 A number of families discussed the question in interviews, but asked not to be quoted, concerned with what children might think of a lost parent, or worried about causing distress to other families, or believing that any words would be inadequate.

Gauging the Fires
 As part of the major federal investigation into the collapse of the towers, investigators from the National Institute of Standards and Technology are reviewing amateur and professional videotapes that recorded many of the people who jumped or fell. ''What data we have in this area are being used to better understand the movement and behavior of the fire and smoke in the towers, and that analysis will be in our final report in December,'' said Michael Newman, a spokesman for the agency.The researchers are not trying to track individual identities, but to gauge the strength and speed of the fires. The number, location and time that people jumped could provide important clues on where the heat had grown particularly intense, according to Glenn Corbett, a professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
 Those who dropped from the windows provide powerful testimony on another major line of inquiry: the adequacy of the exits. Each floor had three exits to serve an acre of space -- or roughly the area occupied by a football field, perched more than 1,000 feet above the ground. In the north tower, all three stairways became impassable from the 92nd floor and up after the plane hit. As for the south tower, two of the three stairways were destroyed around the 78th floor. 
 ''In the south tower, did they jump because they didn't know the stairwell existed, or because the path to the stairwell was blocked?'' said Dr. Robyn Gershon, director of an evacuation study being done by Columbia University. ''If the communications that day had been better, what might have been different?'' 
 More than 1,000 people who survived the plane crashes, many on floors distant from the impact, had no way out.
 Federal authorities reported that during the designing of the towers, the Port Authority dropped plans to use an earlier building code that would have required six stairways in each tower, and turned for economic reasons to the more lax requirements of a later code that required only three stairways. By building fewer staircases, it could make more of each floor available for rent.
 Apart from the implications for public safety and policy, it is not difficult to understand why people have been loath to confront the topic.
 Police helicopter pilots have described feeling helpless as they hovered along the buildings, watching the people who piled four and five deep into the windows, 1,300 feet in the air. Some held hands as they jumped. Others went alone. As the numbers grew, said Joseph Pfeifer, a fire battalion chief in the north tower lobby, he tried to make an announcement over the building's public address system, not realizing it had been destroyed.
 ''Please don't jump,'' he said. ''We're coming up for you.'' 
 Almost instinctually on Sept. 11, people recognized that they had an unfortunate view into an intensely private matter, an unseemly intrusion not just into someone's death, but into the moment of their dying. American broadcast networks generally avoided showing people falling. A sculpture that depicted a victim, known as ''Tumbling Woman,'' was removed from display at Rockefeller Center after one week.
 Some commentators later remarked that those who had fallen had made one brave final decision to take control of how they would perish. Researchers say many people had no choice. Witness accounts suggest that some people were blown out. Others fell in the crush at the windows as they struggled for air. Still others simply recoiled, reflexively, from the intense heat.
 A spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said the city agency had not classified any of the dead as ''jumpers,'' a term used when people jump to their deaths, because the people were forced from the buildings.
 ''This should not be really thought of as a choice,'' said Louis Garcia, New York City's chief fire marshal. ''If you put people at a window and introduce that kind of heat, there's a good chance most people would feel compelled to jump.''
 Temperatures in pockets of the buildings rose to more than 1,000 degrees, sufficient to weaken steel, according to researchers. The first people jumped or fell from the upper floors of the north tower just minutes after the impact of American Airlines Flight 11. The heat reached people on the upper floors long before the flames. Some of those trapped reported that the floor itself had grown so hot they had to stand on their desks, according to a fire official.
 ''The heat was absolutely phenomenal,'' said Dr. Guylene Proulx, who studies human behavior in fires for the National Research Council of Canada. ''If you have ever burned your finger, you know how much that hurts and how you pull away. In the trade center, it was such a hot fire. It was impossible to think you might survive. Why suffer a minute longer when it is so unbearable? It may have appeared to be the best thing to stop the pain, when the window is shattered and the opening is there.''
 Last week researchers who study human behavior in fire gathered for a three-day conference in Belfast, Northern Ireland. While five of the major papers presented at the conference dealt with the fires in the towers, none of them touched on the subject of people who fell or jumped, said Dr. Proulx. ''The focus is on the survivors and what made them successful or impeded their evacuation,'' she said.
 Dr. Proulx noted that people rarely die by falling or jumping from high-rise fires. Far more common, she said, is that people will find a refuge where the heat can be endured. And indeed, in scores of phone calls that continued until the last minutes, people reported that they had gathered in conference rooms or offices that were protected from fire by walls. In areas with few or no walls, the flames burned for about 20 minutes before moving to the next space, the National Institute of Standards and Technology reported in June: ''This spread was generally continuous because of the even distribution of combustibles throughout the floors and the lack of interior partitions.''
 While the institute has made public more than 1,000 pages of documents from its continuing investigation, it has not yet had any public discussion of the people who dropped from the building. ''There will be reference to it in the final report,'' Mr. Newman said, acknowledging the delicacy of the topic. ''I don't know how exact the count will be.''
 On March 25, 1911, at one of the worst fires of the early 20th century, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory blaze in Greenwich Village, young women and men jumped to their deaths from windows on the ninth floor because they were unable to reach or open any of the three exits. Witness accounts of the desperate scenes transformed American politics. 
 Even so, officials never specified how many of the 146 victims died in falls. ''There was not even a reliable list of the dead,'' David Von Drehle writes in ''Triangle,'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003) an acclaimed account of the fire and its aftermath. William Gunn Shepherd, a reporter who happened to be in Washington Square when the fire started, counted 54 people who had jumped or fallen to the sidewalk.

Seeking the Cause
 In catastrophic high-rise fires, investigators typically seek the cause of death, whether from burns, smoke or falling. Of the 85 people killed in 1980 at a fire at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, for example, one jumped from the building, according to a report by the medical examiner for Clark County, Nev. The fire at the Schomburg Plaza apartment complex in Harlem in March 1987 killed seven people, including three young people who fell from their apartment on the 33rd floor.
 Several organizations have tried to estimate the number of people who fell or jumped on Sept. 11. In 2002, reporters for The New York Times, using a collection of videotapes, counted 50 people who fell or jumped. That tally did not include falling shapes that could not be identified with confidence as human. Later that year, USA Today, using a method that included eyewitness accounts, said the number was probably greater than 200.
 A vast majority of those who fell or jumped came from the north tower, perhaps because many more people were trapped on far fewer floors than in the south tower. The north tower was hit first, from the 93rd to the 99th floor, about 15 floors higher than the south tower.
 The 16 minutes between plane strikes gave large numbers of people from the south tower time to flee, an opportunity that many took, survivors said, after being frightened by the sight of people falling from the north tower. In addition, the south tower, though hit second, collapsed first, just 57 minutes after being struck, before deterioration had spread as widely.
 In both towers, the people and debris that fell forced officials to reroute the evacuation, away from the plaza between the buildings. Two of the three stairwells in each building ended at the mezzanine level, where people were supposed to exit onto the plaza. With the plaza no longer a safe option, officials were forced to direct thousands of people down an additional level to the underground shopping concourse. Once there, they were steered by police officers and security guards along the improvised escape route.
 Whatever form future research takes, it is unlikely to try to identify those who died by falling from the buildings. No one survived from the floors where people jumped. Photographs were typically taken from too far away to capture faces. The medical examiner's office said it was hard to distinguish the sorts of injuries suffered in a fall from those received by people who were crushed in a collapse.
 Families on their own, however, have pored over the pictures that show people marooned on the upper floors. At times, they have seized on a feature of dress or mannerism as a clue to identity. In the months after Sept. 11, The Times published a picture of people visible at broken windows in the north tower. Two women who saw the picture said they believed strongly that a man in the photograph, the same man, was their husband.
 Two years ago, Mr. Doyle recalled, he tried to help two other women who felt they, too, had recognized their husbands in a picture of the north tower's upper floors. Mr. Doyle happened to know the photographer and he took the women to a studio in Chinatown, where they studied a blown-up version. They did not know the men, after all.
 ''I don't know what these wives would have done,'' he said, ''if that had been their husbands hanging out the window.''
 Suzanne McCabe, whose brother, Michael, worked on the 104th floor of the north tower, says she has no idea what happened to him. She has heard he may have tried to get to the roof. She says she tries to absorb new information at a measured pace. For her, detailed knowledge about what happened to her brother, even painful knowledge, would ultimately serve as balm. ''The truth hurts,'' she said, ''but it also heals.''

Two of the three stairwells in each building ended at the same level as the plaza that ran between the buildings and, in an evacuation, people were supposed to use the exits there to flee onto the plaza. When that option became too dangerous, and the stairs threatened to back up, rescuers began sending people down escalators to the next level. There they escaped by rushing through the underground shopping concourse that ran beneath the plaza.When people ascended from the concourse onto Church and Liberty streets, ambulances were waiting and the evacuees were a safe distance from the falling people and debris.Map of World Trade Center highlighting evacuation routes.(Sources by Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

HEADLINE: Lost Fruit in Central Florida Means Lost Jobs for Migrants

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

DATELINE: WAHNETA, Fla., Sept. 8 

 BODY:
The citrus trees, once pregnant with fruit, have been stripped by the winds. The grapefruits and oranges, which once held the promise of months of steady wages, lie scattered in the muddy ground like brightly colored spherical pebbles. 
 ''What are we going to pick now?'' asked Hugo Gonzalez in Spanish, as the 22-year-old agricultural migrant worker sat at the door of his trailer two nights after Hurricane Frances rattled his home. ''You can't see oranges on the tree any more.'' 
 The eyes of both Hurricanes Frances and Charley passed through Central Florida's Polk County, one of the state's top citrus producing areas, destroying as much as 90 percent of the local grapefruit harvest and as much as 50 percent of the orange crop. Statewide, the losses to the citrus crop are estimated at 20 percent. 
 ''It's not worth staying here, because you don't make enough to pay expenses,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who has worked for the last two years as one of Florida's estimated 25,000 citrus pickers and 150,000 agricultural workers. About 70 percent of them are illegal immigrants, according to the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project of Florida Legal Services. 
 Mr. Gonzalez said he came to central Florida from Mexico three months ago to wait for the beginning of the orange-picking season, which stretches from October to May. As he sees the promise of work decomposing in the fields, he wants to leave, but he said he could not afford to relocate. He said he paid smugglers $2,200 to bring him into the United States in a three-day desert walk. Now, he said, he barely has enough money to cover the $230 bus ticket back to his hometown, Pachuca, Mexico. 
 ''Right now if I left, I would leave with just the fare and no money to eat,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. He plans on working odd jobs over the next few weeks. 
 The discussions about the oranges swirl around the taco cafe, the Winn-Dixie supermarket and the coin laundry here. The talk in other migrant agricultural communities is much the same. Where to go? What type of work to do? 
 Some migrants have begun to leave Central Florida for Mexico, others in search of work elsewhere in the United States -- Michigan for blueberries, Georgia for watermelons, Kentucky for tobacco.
 Still others are scraping together work after the storm. Construction jobs pay $8 an hour and up. Collecting fallen branches off the streets brings in $4.50 a cubic yard. Collecting and selling scrap aluminum can be lucrative. But all this work is temporary at best.
 Mr. Gonzalez said he had hoped to take home as much as $5,000 to help build the four-bedroom house he plans for his wife-to-be, who is waiting for him. This year, he said, he will leave with almost nothing but debt. 
 The force of the hurricanes created a foot-wide split in the floor of the mobile home that Mr. Gonzalez shares with another Mexican worker, but many other trailers in Polk County fared much worse. 
 County inspectors have put red condemned stickers on trailers crushed by trees or stripped by winds, like those at THE Christmas Tree Mobile Home Park. The isolated park, which is predominantly Mexican-American, was neglected for days by the outside world after it was devastated by Hurricane Charley. 
 It was days after Fort Meade residents received ice, water and other goods before neighbors realized the destruction at the park. ''They were pretty much fending for themselves,'' said Angel Catano, an area resident who was among the first outsiders to go to the park after the hurricane. Mr. Catano took 40 cases of water, 90 bags of ice and 15 boxes of food, then called his daughter, who works for the sheriff's office, for additional help. 
 Florida's agricultural workers, many who originally come from Mexico, are among the most vulnerable victims of the double hurricanes. ''Not only are many migrant workers out of a job, they have lost what little they have,'' said Cheryl Little, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.
 The Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, using state surveys, estimates that the winds and rain destroyed about 40 percent of the migrant housing that was legally occupied in Hardee and Desoto Counties. The destruction is expected to worsen an overstrained housing market for migrant workers. Only a small fraction of migrant housing has legal permits, the justice project said. Fears among some workers of revealing their illegal immigration status, along with cultural barriers, make many reluctant to come forward to ask for help. ''They don't want to give their information because they feel immigration is going to get a hold of it, and they're going to be deported,'' said Bernard Pita, a Spanish-speaking code inspector for Polk County who has been working with the Christmas Tree community. ''They usually are self-sufficient. They have a lot of pride.'' 
 Rob Williams, director of the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, who has been pushing to liberalize immigration laws governing agricultural jobs, said of the illegal immigrant workers, '''They are an essential part of our economy, but when there is a storm, when they are at risk, we say, 'Well you are on your own now, you shouldn't have been here.''' 
 Churches have tried to fill in the social safety net gap. ''For one thing, we don't ask who has documents or papers, who is illegal or not,'' said the Rev. Tom Rush, a pastor with First Baptist Church in Fort Meade. ''All of us have political opinions, but the issue of ministering to people in need isn't a political issue.''
 Those who cannot leave will cope, said Carmen Escobar, 15, who has been helping her family pick oranges on weekends since she was 6. Ms. Escobar, who dropped out of junior high school, shrugs at the destruction. Already, her boyfriend's family has converted the orange truck to hauling fallen branches. They earned $100 for one truckload recently. 
 ''You don't need to be cutting down anything,'' she said. ''You just need to put it in the truck. It's easy.''

HEADLINE: Hearing Confronts Insurers Who Market to Soldiers

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The chairman of a House subcommittee that is investigating the sale of life insurance and mutual funds to young soldiers and other military members unleashed a scathing attack on Thursday on financial companies active on military bases. The chairman, Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, challenged not only the sales practices of their agents but also the fundamental merits of their products.
 Mr. Baker led a four-hour hearing through a review of how life insurance and mutual funds are sold on military bases, opening with testimony from Specialist Brandon Conger, a soldier who said he was misled into buying an expensive insurance policy he did not want or understand, and ending with promises of swift, bipartisan action to address the problems. 
 Mr. Baker questioned whether the life insurance industry had done enough to root out agents who prey on young soldiers and indicated that the Pentagon might have a future date with Congress to explain its failure to adequately police the agents it allows on bases.
 But Mr. Baker's fiercest criticisms fell on the companies that package and sell the high-commission products. He singled out the complex form of insurance sold to Specialist Conger by the American Amicable Life Insurance Company in Waco, Tex., and a type of mutual fund marketed by First Command Financial Services, in Fort Worth.
 The product combines an expensive insurance policy that provides a low death benefit with an interest-earning savings fund that can accumulate cash value over 20 years. The mutual fund, called a contractual plan, imposes sales charges that consume half of an investor's first-year contributions.
 Mr. Baker relentlessly questioned whether either product was ever suitable for military families living on fairly limited means. His doubts were echoed by the leader of a mutual fund shareholders' group and by the president of a national group of financial planners, both of whom said that far more appropriate options were available to help military families achieve the same insurance and investment goals.
 Executives of both companies defended their products, saying that they are appropriate and intended to allow members of the military to accumulate retirement savings.
 Joe Dunlap, executive vice president for American Amicable, said that it was unfair to compare his company's Horizon Life product -- which charges $900 in first-year premiums for death benefits of $20,950 -- with forms of insurance that do not provide cash accumulation. He said the product was intended to supplement, not replace, a soldier's low-cost military insurance, which provides $250,000 in death benefits for premiums of about $240 a year.
 But that argument was challenged at the hearing by Elizabeth W. Jetton, an independent financial planner in Atlanta and the president of the Financial Planning Association.
 Cash-value life insurance ''is often pitched as a retirement solution,'' Ms. Jetton said. ''In the case of the military in particular, we believe this approach is misguided and misleading. The primary rationale for purchasing life insurance must be to protect one's family from the economic consequences of the breadwinner's death. Any reference to retirement planning only confuses the issue.''
 Specialist Conger, a member of the 82nd Airborne Division who served in Iraq and is now at Fort Bragg, N.C., acknowledged that he had confused the insurance policy he bought with a mutual fund.
 ''This has been an extremely disappointing ordeal for me and for some of my fellow soldiers,'' Specialist Conger said. He was upset, he said, not because he lost money but because he had been misled by former soldiers who used their contacts ''to gain the trust and confidence of young soldiers.''
 The chief executive of First Command, Lamar C. Smith, agreed that the rules governing contractual plans could be changed to give investors who withdraw early a larger refund of sales fees. But he said that the discipline that the high fees imposed had helped thousands of First Command customers in the military to build substantial assets.
 ''These plans are only recommended to investors who have long-term goals for wealth accumulation -- such as most of our clients -- who will likely enjoy many years of steady employment,'' Mr. Smith said, noting that the company's customers express a very high level of satisfaction with the service. 
 Mr. Baker and several other members of the capital markets subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee repeatedly expressed doubts that the fee structure of contractual plans, which have been around since 1930 but have virtually disappeared from the civilian fund market, made them suitable for any investor, especially military families of limited means.
 ''The question we need to ask ourselves today is: If contractual mutual funds are such a great product, why aren't they sold to civilians anymore?'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois.
 Representative Max Burns, Republican of Georgia, who was invited to join the subcommittee that held the hearing, asked Ms. Jetton whether she thought it was ever suitable to recommend contractual plans to investors. She answered: ''I really cannot think of the time when there is not a better alternative that will address more efficiently the goals these plans are supposed to address.''
 Both Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Burns have proposed legislation that would prohibit the sale of contractual plans and strengthen state regulation of on-base insurance marketing. Mr. Emanuel's proposal would also raise to $500,000 the amount of coverage available under the military's low-cost insurance plan. In addition, Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, has proposed legislation that would require the Pentagon to pay for that low-cost insurance.
 Mercer Bullard, the founder of Fund Democracy, a fund shareholders' advocacy group, said a simpler way for Congress to deal with contractual plans would be to repeal the parts of federal law that have exempted the plans from the limits that securities regulators already impose on other mutual fund fees.
 It will be far more difficult, Mr. Bullard said, to end the abusive sales practices that regularly crop up in the military market. ''The insulated command nature of the military life is a double-edged sword,'' Mr. Bullard said. ''It creates a unique opportunity for government to protect our soldiers from abusive sales practices. But for sales people, it provides the opportunity to more easily exploit unsophisticated investors.''
 The only way to stamp out sales abuses on military bases is for the Pentagon to change the way it deals with those incidents, argued Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma and the president of the American Council of Life Insurers. He called on the Pentagon to set up a central command that would oversee financial services, handle complaints, administer investigations and act as a liaison with the appropriate state and federal regulators.
 Only then, he said, can incidents like the one Specialist Conger experienced become more than ''an isolated incident receiving an arbitrary evaluation.'' When a complaint is made to multiple regulators and to multiple base commanders, he said, ''it could result in license revocation or penalties that sting.''
 ''The cracks in the system become sealed and this behavior is rooted out, not to find fertile ground on another installation or in another state or foreign country,'' Mr. Keating said.

HEADLINE: Opening the Ears to the Exciting Soundscape of World Music

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
This is not a column about the World Music Institute, which is celebrating the opening of its 20th season this weekend. The institute is the subject of an exhibition starting today that runs to Nov. 27 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and is jointly presenting a concert of Colombian and Mexican music at the Central Park SummerStage on Sunday afternoon.
 Nor is it a column about Music From Japan, which opened its 30th season Wednesday night at Zankel Hall. Nor about the noble efforts of those organizations' founders and directors: Robert and Helene Browning of the institute, Naoyuki Miura and Mari Ono of Music From Japan. Nor about their struggles -- especially those of the Brownings, given their worldwwide reach -- to overcome the visa barriers imposed after 9/11. 
 The column, instead, is about the very notion of ''world music'' -- what it was, what it is, what it means.
 Innocently, one might think the term means music from all over the world. And that really is what it means. Historically and parochially, however, it has meant music heard in the West from all over the non-Western world. Including Japan, which is part of the Western world economically and politically but not in its traditional music.
 The term world music has provoked grumbling among citizens of non-Western cultures and among the politically correct here at home. For someone from Thailand or Senegal, the complaint runs, Beethoven counts as much as a ''world musician'' as Senegal's Youssou N'Dour counts as a world musician for us. Any effort to carve out a special, superior place for Western music amounts to naked neocolonialism.
 Such ideas have triggered their own neoconservative counterattack. How can we have standards if everything is of equal value? If a Pigmy thumb-pianist is to be equated with Beethoven, civilization has ended and the sky has fallen. 
 The answer to such fretting is the application of common sense. Of course there are perceptible differences between different kinds of music. Those differences are based on the history of the genre, on the relation between composition and performance, on the social status of the music within the society, on the actual sound of the music.
 There is the Indian raga tradition, fostered by the Moguls, and there is Bollywood pop. There is ancient Japanese traditional music and there is Japanese pop. There are Western-trained classical musicians in countries all over the world, and there are efforts by those musicians (and by Western composers, too, of course) to build bridges from the classical to their own indigenous traditions.
 One of the most fascinating examples of the relation between the Western and non-Western worlds has been how an immersion in Western values and traditions can awaken an interest in a composer's own native music. That happened to the Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, whose own study of traditional Japanese music, and his subsequent use of that music in his compositions, came after his training in Western composition. He may have come to regret his own lack of knowledge of his country's music. But he was surely also inspired by the world-wandering musical imagination of the West.
 It is hardly just classical composers, Western or ''world,'' who immerse themselves in, or are inspired by, non-Western traditions. Contemporary popular music worldwide is a quilt of influences, with Anglo-American electrified rock and pop blending seamlessly with continental European dance music and folk traditions, Indian music, African music, Jamaican music, Latin music and on it goes. In miscegenation lies strength.
 Some impresarios, like Mr. Miura, concentrate on the classical, high-art traditions. Music From Japan offers a range from traditional artists, like the gagaku ensemble Reigakusha that performed on Wednesday, to Japanese classical composers to compositions created for traditional artists. Like those heard on Wednesday from Reigakusha.
 In the pop world, musicians like Peter Gabriel in England and David Byrne and Bill Laswell in the United States have tirelessly collaborated with third-world musicians and, most dramatically in Mr. Gabriel's case, created an entire infrastructure of concerts and tours and recordings and festivals that help spread the (pop) news.
 Mr. Browning has covered all the bases, presenting artists in all genres from all countries (including folk and American Indian traditions from within the United States). And not just music, since world dance is very much part of his self-created mandate.
 World travel is ubiquitous today, and so is emigration -- in general, as even the most homogeneous countries encourage the importation of cheap labor, and as citizens of one-time colonies migrate to their former colonial rulers. Thus the extraordinary West African pop music scene in Paris a few decades back, and the continuing excitement of the music and art created by British citizens of South Asian descent.
 Not to speak of black music in America. A proudly polyglot country like the United States is home to musicians from nearly every world tradition, and the World Music Institute has presented them as readily as he has imported musicians from abroad.
 Westerners travel, too, with hordes of backpackers coursing about the planet. Their appetites have been whetted electronically, through recordings (like Mr. Gabriel's Real World label or, in years long past, the Nonesuch Explorer series) and radio and television. I remember once a few years ago running into Mr. Byrne outside the office of his own world-music label, Luaka Bop. He had just come back from South America and had a big bag full of cassettes that he had picked up along the way and that he proudly displayed on the sidewalk.
 It is easy to pontificate on the role of musical cross-fertilization in the fostering of world understanding. The Brownings have been assiduous, insofar as our security watchdogs will permit, in importing music from Muslim countries. Sufi songs and dance as practiced by the ''whirling dervishes'' of Syria have been especially popular, and loving their art and appreciating the depth of their culture provides perspective on the current bloodshed in the Middle East. The dervishes will be at Zankel Hall on Nov. 5, followed the next night at the Skirball Center by a program called ''Illuminations: Jewish Mysticism to American Roots.''
 But you don't have to justify world music by adducing a sociopolitical component. Maybe the Western classical tradition has hit a dry spell (though I'm not so sure about that), and maybe a lot of Western pop sounds imitative of itself. But musicians aren't just seeking out non-Western music for easy novelty. They are genuinely excited, thrilled even, by what they hear out there. It doesn't demean the Western tradition to open it up to exciting new inspirations and to revel in the cross-breeding that will inevitably and happily result.

HEADLINE: Nokia Sends Tech Shares Higher; Dow Falls on Oil Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Technology stocks gained yesterday after Nokia raised its earnings forecast, but blue chips slipped as oil prices climbed almost $2 a barrel, increasing concerns about future corporate profits. 
 Finland's Nokia, the mobile phone maker, raised its third-quarter sales and earnings outlooks because of strong demand, giving a boost to Texas Instruments, a maker of chips for cellphones. 
 Texas Instruments, which counts Nokia as its largest customer, trimmed its third-quarter revenue outlook Wednesday but said it would meet its profit forecast. 
 ''Texas Instruments has probably had the biggest effect -- with the outlook there not as bad as people expected it to be,'' said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the United States equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. 
 ''That's helping a tech rally with people rotating into the sector,'' he added. 
 Meanwhile, the analog chip maker National Semiconductor helped spur technology gains when it posted a higher quarterly profit yesterday. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 24.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,289.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,118.38, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 19.01 points, or 1 percent, to 1,869.65. 
 An increase in oil prices had a limited effect on stocks, said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's, hurting ''some of the more conservative defensive, industrially orientated stocks that had done well as oil had fallen.'' 
 Higher oil prices, which have roiled markets all summer, usually spell bad news for stock prices, as investors worry about the effect of higher costs on companies' profit margins. October crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up $1.84, or 4.3 percent, at $44.61 per barrel.
 Industrial stocks under pressure included Boeing, which was down 79 cents at $53.26, and General Motors, which fell 39 cents, to $42.82. 
 Pharmaceuticals were also under the gun, with Pfizer declining 33 cents, to $32.44. 
 Meanwhile, data yesterday on weekly jobless claims showed the steepest decline in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department.
 Procter & Gamble weighed on the Dow after the company, a consumer products manufacturer, backed its quarterly profit outlook but disappointed investors who were accustomed to Procter & Gamble raising its forecast midway through the quarter. Procter & Gamble fell 64 cents, to $56.09. 
 But Corning rose 94 cents, or 9.3 percent, to $11.09. Corning raised its forecast on Wednesday for fiber-optic cable sales. 
 Texas Instruments gained more than 10 percent, up $1.94 at $20.77.
 Nokia's shares traded in the United States rose $1.06, to $13.77. National Semiconductor rose more than 12 percent, up $1.48, to $13.48. 
 Treasury prices fell yesterday as an auction of government debt drew almost no private demand, leaving the dealer community holding a pile of paper. 
 ''It was an extremely ugly auction. And that's something nobody wants to see, not the Street and certainly not Treasury given the amount of borrowing they have to do,'' said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer. 
 The sale of $9 billion in reopened 10-year Treasury notes went at a high yield of 4.195 percent, well above expectations, and drew bids for only 2.12 times the amount on offer, down from August's 2.90 level. 
 The 10-year Treasury note declined 8/32, to a price of 10015/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.195 percent from 4.16 percent on Wednesday.
 Results of yesterday's auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Industry and Labor Step Up Fight Over China's Currency

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
With many American manufacturers still shedding jobs, a new coalition of industry groups and labor unions petitioned the administration on Thursday to take the unorthodox step of suing China for keeping the value of its currency fixed against the dollar.
 Citing economic and trade data that they claimed showed China's currency was undervalued by as much as 40 percent, the group said that Bejing's policy amounted to currency manipulation that provided a huge subsidy to China's exports and should be considered a violation of international trade laws.
 ''With this currency manipulation, my customers, my employees, are being slaughtered by unfair competition,'' said Bill Hickey, president of Lapham-Hickey Steel Corporation of Chicago, who attended a news conference here. ''It's like running in a 100-yard dash against a team that starts on the 50-yard line.'' 
 But the Bush administration immediately rejected the idea, saying it was already treating the currency issue seriously and was pleased with the progress it was making in negotiations with China to encourage greater flexibility in setting its currency rate.
 ''Due to our engagement with the Chinese on the currency issue, they are moving in the right direction,'' said Rob Nichols, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department.
 Economists say that China would have to let its currency rise against the dollar by a large amount for it to have any significant effect on the bilateral trade imbalance between the United States and China, which hit a record deficit of $14 billion in June. Even then, China enjoys other economic advantages deriving from its ability to produce increasingly sophisticated goods with cheap labor, which suggests that several American industries will be hard pressed to stand up to Chinese competition in any event.
 The petitioners, which include the representatives of the steel and textile industries, as well as the A.F.L.-C.I.O., were asking the World Trade Organization to support a 40 percent increase in the value of the yuan.
 While many industries have won protection in the past after complaining of unfair trade practices, no petition involving currency actions has ever advanced very far. In the past, American auto manufacturers have complained that Japan was controlling its currency to help its exporters, but Washington has always taken action to affect the dollar's value on broader concerns. 
 Moreover, the International Monetary Fund, not the trade organization, is the global body responsible for dealing with disputes over currencies. But the petitioners said that after nearly two years of asking for relief, neither the administration nor the I.M.F. had persuaded China to revalue its currency.
 In this election year, with Democrats pointing to the loss during the Bush administration of more than a million jobs, many of them in manufacturing industries concentrated in critical battleground states, the issue of competition from China carries a powerful political resonance. 
 Senator John Kerry said that the White House was wrong to reject the petition outright.
 ''George Bush has made it clear,'' Mr. Kerry said in a written statement, ''that he wants to continue taking America in the wrong direction by refusing to enforce our trade agreements and continuing to allow China to manipulate its currency.''
 For the past year many members of Congress have been pressing the administration to act against China if it fails to revalue its currency, which it pegs to the dollar rather than allowing it to float in foreign exchange markets. Lawmakers from both parties have argued that the undervalued yuan enables Chinese manufacturers to flood the United States with products at prices that domestic companies could never match.
 China says that its currency policy is intended to maintain domestic stability as it makes the transition from communism to capitalism and that it played a crucial role in preventing the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990's from seriously infecting the Chinese economy and the rest of the world.
 Some independent economists agreed with the petitioners that the Bush administration has not pressed China aggressively on the currency issue.
 ''We've gotten a lot of 'look busy' activity from the administration but nothing has happened,'' said Morris Goldstein, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a group in Washington that generally favors economic globalization and describes itself as a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution with an audience including government officials and legislators. The Institute released Mr. Goldstein's paper ''Adjusting China's Exchange Rate Policies'' on Thursday.
 For its part, the monetary fund declined to comment on the petition. It has been encouraging China to show flexibility in how it values its currency since 1998, once the Asian currency crisis faded and the threat of an economic meltdown was over.
 In its latest statement, issued last month, the executive board of the monetary fund remained circumspect, saying ''it would be advantageous for China to make an initial move toward greater exchange rate flexibility without undue delay.''
 China's currency rate is expected to be discussed at the annual I.M.F. meeting in Washington next month. Those discussions, however, will be held behind closed doors and the petitioners said they expected meager results.
 ''American workers, employers and communities are angry and frustrated,'' said Richard L. Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., ''because our own government is simply failing to manage our important trade relationship with China in a way that gives our businesses and workers a fighting chance of competing fairly.''
 The National Association of Manufacturers, a critic of China's currency policy, declined to join the petitioners because it said it feared the petition was part of ''election-year politics.''

HEADLINE: A Farsighted New Fortress Mentality on Wall St.

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
In May, senior executives from Wall Street's top investment banks gathered at a conference center with a cadre of federal and local law enforcement authorities. Their task for the day was to simulate, down to the last detail, the aftermath of an explosion of a bomb in Midtown followed by others in Lower Manhattan.
 Their scripts, distributed to them that day, read like a Hollywood screenplay: electricity was out, telephone lines had been severed, employees were evacuating buildings and the markets were down -- what do you do?
 The searing events of Sept. 11, 2001, when 1,400 employees of securities firms were killed, prompted some changes in and around Wall Street that are easy to see. Morgan Stanley, for instance, which lost 1.2 million square feet in the south tower of the World Trade Center, is now moving employees to a new corporate installation in Westchester with the capacity to house 3,000 people. Lehman Brothers, whose headquarters in the World Financial Center was destroyed during the attacks, is comfortably ensconced in a new office building in Midtown. 
 But the more profound effects are less evident -- like war games played by managing directors of Wall Street firms. In the wake of the loss of 32,000 financial jobs in New York State of the 211,000 before the attacks and the billions of dollars spent since on security, business continuity and disaster-recovery planning, there is a prevailing sense of wariness, both with regard to the uncertain security environment and the future direction of the markets.
 ''People are cautious and 9/11 did not pass unnoticed,'' said Roy Smith, a former Goldman, Sachs partner and a professor of finance at New York University. ''We have had a bubble, and there is political uncertainty. Yes, firms have let a lot of people go, but firms are adaptive and have made money other ways, such as by trading.''
 To be sure, many of the lost jobs have resulted from trends that predate Sept. 11, 2001, like industry consolidation, more automated trading, weak equity markets and, most significantly, the migration of jobs to other places. But economists note that the attacks have hastened these trends, especially with regard to firms moving their operations.
 ''9/11 has accelerated and expanded the need for geographic dispersion for Wall Street firms,'' said Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association. ''The result is job losses for New York City.'' 
 Not all firms have moved away. Merrill Lynch, which was forced to evacuate one of its buildings at the World Financial Center, has moved back into the building. And Goldman, Sachs, long an anchor in Lower Manhattan, is expected to start construction this year on a global headquarters in Battery Park, with its completion planned in 2008. 
 Wall Street firms are still making billions in profits, thanks mainly to the bull market in bonds that was further spurred by the Federal Reserve's reduction of interest rates right after the attacks. 
 But as the third anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, an air of extreme caution pervades Wall Street -- symbolized best, perhaps, by the phalanx of machine-gun toting police officers that stand guard at the New York Stock Exchange.
 Indeed, of all the institutions on Wall Street, the exchange -- which was forced to close for four business days after the attacks and was said in August by the Bush administration to be a target of a terrorist threat -- has enacted the most significant and far-reaching security and contingency plans. 
 Since the attacks in 2001, it has spent more than $100 million to prevent or recover from a market interruption, with a contingency trading floor, capable of trading all exchange-listed stocks immediately, as the centerpiece.
 The exchange has also put in place a new communications system linking its data centers to its member firms through a secure network that skirts traditional phone lines. 
 Nasdaq, the stock exchange's electronic competitor, was affected less by the attacks -- it says it could have started trading on Sept. 11 -- because its main trading facilities are in Connecticut, with a backup installation in Maryland. Still, it now has a contingency program that would enable it to trade all New York Stock Exchange stocks in the event of a major disruption.
 Wall Street firms have also upgraded their backup trading facilities, making sure they are a significant distance from their headquarters. Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch have backup operations in New Jersey, while Morgan Stanley has its new building in Westchester, which will house the retail brokerage division, to use in an emergency.
 The increase in spending on security, business continuity and disaster recovery has been striking. This year, analysts at the Tower Group, a consulting firm, estimate that Wall Street firms will spend $3.8 billion -- up from $1.8 billion in 2001 -- for contingency planning and security measures, with more than 60 percent of that dedicated to information technology and the rest going toward new building and the hiring of personnel. Spending is expected to level off in the coming years, analysts say.
 As for the exercises in May, they were successful, allowing the 13 broker-dealers that took part to test employee evacuation strategies and the activation of their backup sites as well as their ability to prepare for a market opening the next day. ''It was intended to be as real as it could be,'' said Howard Sprow, the Securities Industry Association's director of business continuity planning.
 While Wall Street's cautious mood can, in some ways, be attributed to security concerns that linger three years later, it is also true that the wave of accounting scandals and the explosion of regulatory investigations into research and mutual fund trading abuses since the attacks have left deep marks. And while 4,000 jobs were added this summer, economists do not expect job growth on the Street to continue, especially in light of the wan markets and the strides that firms are taking to automate their trading desks, making them less dependent on labor.
 ''Yes, you had a geopolitical event,'' said David Trone, a securities analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, ''but you also have a weak economy, automated trading in equities, regulatory issues and accounting fraud. They all hit at the same time and have changed the business in a permanent way.''

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

''ALIEN VS. PREDATOR,'' starring Sanaa Lathan. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (PG-13, 110 minutes). Set in a Jules Verne world beneath the earth's surface in an incalculably ancient pyramid buried 2,000 feet beneath the Antarctic ice cap, Mr. Anderson's film imagines an apocalyptic conflict between two of 20th Century Fox's franchise monsters, on loan from ''Alien'' (1979) and ''Predator'' (1987). The humans don't have much to do in ''Alien vs. Predator'' but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them. Though Mr. Anderson does have an idea for creating a rooting interest, it's too far-fetched even for fantasy, and the film turns into a cold but occasionally impressive special-effects extravaganza (Dave Kehr).

''ALMOST PEACEFUL,'' starring Simon Abkarian, Lubna Azabal and Zabou Breitman. Directed by Michel Deville (not rated, 90 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). Movies about survival often divide between those that grimly insist on the triumph of the human spirit and those equally grim testaments to absolute despair. In ''Almost Peaceful,'' a gently observed film about Holocaust survivors from this French director, survival means something other than choked laughter and sentimental bromides or brute, animal struggle. Survival also means the modest, faltering steps the not-dead take toward the resumption of everyday normal life. Based on an autobiographical novel by Robert Bober, a French writer and filmmaker who worked as an assistant director on a few early Francois Truffaut features, ''Almost Peaceful'' opens in the summer of 1946. In an upstairs apartment on an anonymous Parisian street, Albert (Mr. Abkarian) and his sad-eyed wife, Lea (Ms. Breitman), are raising two young children and running a modest tailoring shop where most of the employees are other survivors. Amid the warm, enveloping hum of steady work and clattering machines, Jews who survived the death camps work side by side with Jews who evaded their horrors, fashioning a new world for themselves stitch by careful stitch (Manohla Dargis).

''ANACONDAS: THE HUNT FOR THE BLOOD ORCHID,'' with Johnny Messner. Directed by Dwight Little (PG-13, 93 minutes). A research team goes in search of an exotic orchid containing an enzyme that offers eternal youth. The only thing standing in the way: dozens of giant anacondas, grown to gigantic size because they've been eating those orchids themselves. Mr. Little and his no-star cast have delivered a competent programmer that has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season (Kehr).

* ''THE BOURNE SUPREMACY,'' starring Matt Damon. Directed by Paul Greengrass (PG-13; 120 minutes). It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11 this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies and counterspies from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Mr. Damon as Jason Bourne, the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The thriller reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a film that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride (Stephen Holden).

''THE BROWN BUNNY,'' starring Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. Written and directed by Mr. Gallo (not rated, 92 minutes). Neither an atrocity nor a revelation, ''The Brown Bunny'' is a very watchable, often beautiful-looking attempt by Mr. Gallo to reproduce the kind of loosely structured mood pieces that found American and select foreign-language cinemas of the 1960's and 70's often at their most adventurous, with Monte Hellman's 1971 ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' the most obvious touchstone. Mr. Gallo plays Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer (and the title's symbolic bunny) on his way back home to Los Angeles from a New Hampshire meet. As Bud racks up miles, he stares moodily at the road, visits a childhood haunt, eats a lonely meal, sleeps a lonely motel sleep, takes his motorcycle for a spin and exchanges small talk with a few women, all of whom have the soft, bruised look of chronic disappointment. Eventually Bud hits Los Angeles, where he checks into a hotel, and where yet another flower of femininity, Ms. Sevigny's Daisy, gives the film its back story and furnishes what the porn industry calls, in rather more direct language, its economic raison d'etre (Dargis).

* ''COLLATERAL,'' starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 115 minutes). In ''Collateral,'' the edgy new thriller from Mr. Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Mr. Foxx), and the assassin Vincent (Mr. Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously made commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith (Dargis).

''EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING,'' starring Stellan Skarsgard and James D'Arcy. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 114 minutes). Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's army boots are nowhere to be found in ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to ''The Exorcist,'' William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Mr. Skarsgard as the character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks. But when push comes to demonic shove, hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup, just as surely as some producers have no shame. Despite Mr. Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, however, the film singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly, it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh (Dargis).

''HERO,'' starring Jet Li. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 99 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In Mr. Zhang's ''Hero,'' an ambitious period epic about the birth of the first Chinese empire, warriors fly through the air like birds of prey, their swords cutting through enemies and lovers alike. Set during the third century B.C., the story of an assassination plot unfolds with such dazzling bursts of color and blurs of furious action that it might be easy to miss the nationalistic message tucked amid the visual enchantments. The martial-arts film star Jet Li is the title's nameless warrior, who claims to have vanquished the king's most feared enemies, Sky (Donnie Yen), Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and the powerful Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). In time, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang signals with shifts of color that flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen. Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool (Dargis).

* ''THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE,'' starring Denzel Washington, Jon Voight, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Demme, updating John Frankenheimer's classic exercise in cold war liberal paranoia, wisely treats the original as a touchstone rather than a template, and this movie, in spite of some narrative flaws, stands on its own as a witty, anxious thriller for a new age of political uncertainty. Mr. Washington plays Ben Marco, a veteran of the Persian Gulf war of 1991. Haunted by nightmares, he tries at once to hold on to his sanity and unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Mr. Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Ms. Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly. Which may be a good thing, since this ''Candidate'' is, in the end, a breathless and intricate thriller about the continuing need for campaign finance reform (A. O. Scott).

''OPEN WATER,'' starring Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Written and directed by Chris Kentis (R, 79 minutes). In this minimalist, digital video thriller, a tourist couple spend their vacation trying not to be eaten by sharks. ''I wanted to go skiing,'' complains Susan (Ms. Ryan), and you can hardly blame her. She and Daniel (Mr. Travis), her boyfriend, out for a morning of scuba diving, have been left behind by the charter boat, and they bob up and down, fighting panic, exhaustion and each other in a desperate struggle to survive. The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too underdramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort. Susan and Daniel are so bland that they could be anybody, which is the problem, and your sympathy for them is fleeting, as if you had encountered them in a short, grisly item on the local evening news (Scott).

''THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2: ROYAL ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Anne Hathaway, Chris Pine and Heather Matarazzo. Directed by Garry Marshall (G, 120 minutes). In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for this new feature-length fairy tale, the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Ms. Hathaway), a onetime San Francisco teenager turned Old World pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Mr. Marshall, who has been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in ''Pretty Woman,'' and written by Shonda Rhimes, ''The Princess Diaries 2'' combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake, too (Dargis).

* ''RED LIGHTS,'' starring Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet. Directed by Cedric Kahn (not rated, 106 minutes; in French with English subtitles). This brilliant, sinister French thriller is a twisty road movie in which every sign points toward catastrophe. As night falls during the journey of an unhappily married couple from Paris to Bordeaux, the clogged highway takes them into descending levels of psychosexual hell. Mr. Darroussin's Antoine is a mousy, balding insurance salesman who hates his job and resents his more successful wife, a sleek corporate lawyer. The movie is a study of male passive aggression that comes up with a malicious Hemingwayesque solution to Antoine's masculinity crisis. When his wife, fed up with his drinking on the road, deserts him to take the train, he picks up a hitchhiker he knows might be a dangerous escaped convict and courts the redemptive (and grisly) male rite of passage he's been seeking. Following Jean-Luc Godard's ''Weekend'' and Claire Denis's ''Friday Night,'' ''Red Lights'' uses the traffic jam as a potent screen metaphor for something bigger (Holden).

''SUSPECT ZERO,'' starring Aaron Eckhart, Ben Kingsley and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by E. Elias Merhige (R, 100 minutes). Finally, a serial killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic that it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre. Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by Mr. Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, ''Suspect Zero'' involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think ''Seven'' minus the talent. Soon after the agent, Thomas Mackelway (Mr. Eckhart), lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cactuses and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where the twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Mr. Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. As Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, it soon appears the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not (Dargis).

''VANITY FAIR,'' starring Reese Witherspoon and James Purefoy. Directed by Mira Nair (PG-13, 141 minutes). Her eyes snapping like tiny firecrackers, Ms. Witherspoon makes an appealingly crafty Becky Sharp in Ms. Nair's bland but color-drenched screen adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel. The star, as usual, conveys a bristly, determined spunk. But if her performance emits enough sparks to hold the screen, it never ignites a dramatic brush fire. You long for more Scarlett O'Hara and less Elle Woods. Her Becky comes across as a lightweight schemer about as formidable as an aspiring trophy wife on a daytime soap. In compressing a novel that spans three decades of the early 19th century, the movie becomes increasingly hurried and eventually loses track of time, and in trying to mix satire and romance it proves once again that the two are about as compatible as lemon juice and heavy cream. It flashes to comic life in those scenes that convey Thackeray's disdain for the preening foolishness and snobbery of early 19th-century English society and the crass symbiotic relationship between money and aristocracy (Holden).

''THE VILLAGE,'' starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Shyamalan remains our leading cinematic rug-puller, but the carpet grows ever more threadbare. This time, he populates a preindustrial Pennsylvania village with an impressive cast of elders and youngsters, who almost never use contractions and who live in fear of some scary creatures in the surrounding woods. Mr. Shyamalan uses the classic techniques of movie suspense to conjure an atmosphere of mystery and dread, which vanishes even before the big plot twist sends the picture spinning into silly, pretentious allegory. Don't worry, I won't spoil the surprise. It spoils itself (Scott).

HEADLINE: Cost of Insuring Workers' Health Increases 11.2%

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The cost of providing health care to employees has risen 11.2 percent this year, according to the results of an authoritative national survey reported yesterday. 
 It was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases in health insurance premiums, which has resulted in a steady decline in the number of the nation's workers and their families receiving employer health care coverage. 
 The annual survey of 3,000 companies, conducted between January and May by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered a reliable indicator of health care costs paid by companies and their workers.
 Perhaps the only good news in the report was its indication that the rate of increase slowed from the record 13.9 percent in 2003, turning down for the first time since 1996. But this year's jump was still more than five times the national 2.2 percent increase in wages from the spring of 2003 to spring 2004, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Small businesses are being especially hard hit as the average family coverage in preferred provider networks, the most common type of health plan, has risen to $10,217, with employees paying $2,691 of the total. In response to the soaring costs, many small companies are simply no longer offering coverage of a worker's spouse and children.
 ''Small employers just cannot afford to spend the bulk of $10,000 on a family health plan for a $30,000 employee,'' said Kate Sullivan Hare, the executive director of health care policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce. That same family coverage ''used to cost $4,500 about six years ago,'' she noted.
 The survey found that the share of companies of all sizes offering health benefits to their workers declined to 61 percent, down from 65 percent in 2001. As a result, an estimated five million fewer workers have access to employer health care coverage than the 127 million reported in 2001, said John Gabel, vice president of Health Research and Educational Trust. 
 With health care high on the list of voter concerns in election year polls, the Bush and Kerry campaigns quickly jumped into the fray.
 Senator John Kerry blamed Bush administration policies. ''It's wrong to allow skyrocketing health care costs to choke off new jobs, eat up family incomes and leave millions uninsured,'' Mr. Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, said yesterday during a campaign stop in Des Moines.
 The Census Bureau said last month that the nation's total number of uninsured people had risen by 1.4 million in 2003, to a record 45 million. 
 Reed Dickens, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign, said: ''This administration has helped slow the rate of increase for the first time in seven years. The president's approach to this is a consumer-driven approach, and John Kerry's philosophy is to shift the decision-making power to the federal government and shift the financial burden to the taxpayer.'' 
 But Ms. Sullivan Hare at the Chamber of Commerce said that ''neither presidential candidate is really talking about government policies to control health care inflation.'' She added that most employers feel frustrated by the problems but they do not see ''any magic bullets to help bring down costs.''
 Health premiums are rising faster than the underlying cost of doctor and hospital care, as consolidation in the insurance industry has given insurers greater clout. The monthly cost of two-person coverage for workers and their spouses increased 23 percent, to $836.78, this year at the John G. Shelley Company, a distributor of industrial products with 26 employees in Wellesley Hills, Mass. Monthly premiums for individuals rose 13 percent, to $418.39. 
 Full family coverage at Shelley is now $1,255.17, with the company offering to pay nearly half. Kara Connaughton, the financial controller at the Shelley company, said nobody signed up. ''They all have their children covered under their spouse's plan,'' she said.
 Frank Ciotola, an owner of Da Vinci Ristorante in northwest Columbus, Ohio, is another employer grappling with premium inflation. 
 ''It's the same story with everybody I talk to,'' Mr. Ciotola said. ''We got 31 percent increase last month to renew our insurance.'' He said he erased the increase by changing to a health savings plan, with a $1,700 annual deductible, for the three owners and four full-time employees in the plan.
 The Kaiser report said that a growing number of employers were familiar with the health savings approach, a centerpiece of President Bush's health care program that combines pretax savings accounts and high deductibles. But the report said that only 3.5 percent of the employers in the survey had adopted the plans. The favorable tax feature took effect last January.
 Megan Hauck, deputy policy director of the Bush campaign, said that a survey by Fortis Health, a company that sells the health savings plans, reported that about one-third of the early recruits were ''previously uninsured.'' 
 For years, employers have been paying about 84 percent of premium costs, with workers picking up the remaining 16 percent, the survey said. But in dollar terms, that now means the average employee's share has risen by more than $1,000 since 2000, said Drew Altman, the chief executive of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
 The rising cost of health insurance is not only affecting the current working population. 
 The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced last week that Medicare premiums deducted from Social Security checks of elderly and disabled people would rise 17.4 percent next year to $78.20 a month. Meanwhile, Social Security payments are expected to rise by only 2 to 3 percent, according to the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group for Medicare beneficiaries.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Enlist Big Names to Set Debates' Details

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
In the Kerry corner there are two of the most powerful lawyers in Washington, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Robert B. Barnett, not to mention the sitting governors of Michigan and Arizona, Jennifer M. Granholm and Janet Napolitano.
 In the Bush corner there is a former secretary of state, James A. Baker III, not to mention the hard-knuckled lobbyist turned governor of Mississippi who once headed the Republican Party, Haley Barbour, and one of the party's sharpest media personalities, Mary Matalin. 
 The campaigns of President Bush and Senator John Kerry are putting forward their most seasoned and formidable proxies to take part in the quadrennial face-off over establishing the particulars of the presidential and vice-presidential debates. Never have the presidential debate teams been this big or this prestigious, say officials at the bipartisan commission planning the debates, the first of which is scheduled for Sept. 30.
 In a measure of how critical the debates have become in the view of the campaigns, both sides have turned their attention to details like the number of debates and whether the candidates will sit or stand -- details that in the past were relegated to smaller, less high-profile teams. 
 Mr. Bush has not agreed to any debates, and though his campaign says nothing is final, some aides have indicated that they would like the president to participate in no more than two. Mr. Kerry's aides, who have already agreed to the one vice-presidential and three presidential debates the debate commission scheduled, have said he would like to do even more.
 For all their negotiating talent, the debate teams are likely to be able to affect only so much. The bipartisan commission has said it will not negotiate its selections of moderators, locations and dates, meaning that except for a few issues like how many debates the candidates will actually participate in, the assembled power brokers could spend much of their time arguing over camera angles and lighting.
 But some of the negotiators have a history of tangling. Less than four years ago, Mr. Baker was running the Bush recount operation in Florida, while Ron Klain, who is helping Mr. Kerry's team, was a leader of Al Gore's Florida operation.
 Now they are facing off again -- with the outcome, perhaps, likewise hanging in the balance. 
 That may sound like hyperbole. But that might be the point. 
 Members of both parties and outside experts agree that the predebate debates have become so sophisticated that the naming of the debate negotiation teams has turned into an end in itself, becoming the first phase in a dance, expected to last days, in which the campaigns try to gain leverage over each other while setting expectations for the public. 
 Mr. Kerry named the leader of his team, Mr. Jordan, a close friend of former President Bill Clinton, back in June, as a way to show he was ready to debate whenever Mr. Bush was. Mr. Bush, on the other hand, did not name his team until this week, a signal that he will take his time in granting Mr. Kerry time on the same stage as him. 
 When Mr. Kerry's team noticed this week that Mr. Bush's new team included Karen P. Hughes, the longtime Bush confidante and message maestro, it added the former White House press secretary and message guru Mike McCurry to its team. Campaign officials acknowledged that they brought in Mr. McCurry in large part to send a signal to Mr. Bush's campaign that it was ready for a battle in the news media, if there needed to be one.
 The posturing is incalculably frustrating to officials at the commission, who have been planning the debates for nearly two years. They are still waiting for Mr. Bush to join with Mr. Kerry in agreeing to the schedule, format and moderators it announced weeks ago.
 ''If they want to get in each other's faces and do the little playground routine, O.K.,'' said one person involved in the debate preparations, ''But there's an event waiting to happen.''
 The commission's first debate is set for Sept. 30 at the University of Miami, with the PBS anchor Jim Lehrer as moderator; it is to focus primarily on domestic policy. Two more presidential debates are to follow soon after: a town-hall-style meeting in St. Louis with the ABC News anchor Charles Gibson as moderator and a traditional debate in Arizona focusing primarily on foreign policy, with the CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer as moderator. A vice-presidential debate is scheduled for October in Cleveland, with Gwen Ifill of PBS as host.
 While Mr. Kerry's negotiating team may be formidable, debate experts said that Mr. Bush, with incumbency and the latest polls on his side, has the greater leverage. ''The challenger needs that platform where he's on an equal footing with the president of the United States, which means Kerry really needs it more than Bush does,'' said David J. Lanoue, chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama. ''President Bush can't get away with saying no altogether but he certainly can call the shots in terms of which debate he wants to show up at.''
 Officials with Mr. Bush's campaign said that though some strategists had made it clear they would like the president to participate in no more than two debates, the decision would ultimately be made by Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker did not return calls seeking comment.
 ''Most people that are discussing this will not be the ones deciding this,'' said Reed Dickens, a Bush campaign spokesman. ''And the people who are going to decide have just begun discussing this.''
 Mr. Baker met to discuss the debates for the first time with Mr. Bush on Wednesday, and Kerry campaign officials say Mr. Baker and Mr. Jordan have spoken informally a few times since.
 Though Mr. Bush's aides say they have ruled nothing out, the team does not seem as if it is preparing to do anything so radical as it did in 2000, when it announced that it would forgo two of the three commission debates in favor of debates on ''Larry King Live'' on CNN and ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. Mr. Bush relented after coming under withering criticism. (The NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw has put out word that he is interested in moderating a noncommission debate this year, but NBC News officials say he will not formally propose one until both campaigns work out the details of the commission debates.)
 Democrats say they do expect the debate negotiators -- primarily Mr. Jordan and Mr. Baker -- to go to the mat on some issues. Mr. Kerry's campaign aides say they are girding for Mr. Bush's team to try to shorten the proposed debates to 60 minutes from 90 minutes and perhaps to bypass the town-hall-style debate, at which the candidates are to field questions from undecided voters from the St. Louis area picked by the Gallup polling organization.
 ''If there's one debate they want to avoid it's the town-hall setting,'' Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry, said of the Bush campaign. ''He's been on the campaign trail for close to a year and he hasn't had to answer one tough question about Iraq, health care and the economy.''
 Mr. Dickens said Ms. Cutter was jumping to conclusions about what Mr. Bush would or would not do, adding, ''John Kerry is the candidate who hasn't finished the debate with himself, but at the appropriate time the president looks forward to a vigorous debate on the issues.''
 Still, one Republican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the perception that Mr. Bush was ducking the debates did serve a purpose, by helping to lower expectations for Mr. Bush, who exceeded all expectations in his debates with Al Gore in 2000.

HEADLINE: Kerry Invokes the Bible In Appeal for Black Votes

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN; Randal C. Archibold contributed reporting from Nashua, N.H., for this article.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry turned to the Bible on Thursday to go after President Bush, warning a black Baptist audience here to ''beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing.''
 ''For four years, George W. Bush may have talked about compassion, but he's walked right by,'' Mr. Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, said, comparing Mr. Bush to the passer-by who ignored a desperate man in the New Testament parable of the good Samaritan. ''He's seen people in need, but he's crossed over to the other side of the street.'' 
 In a speech to thousands of cheering, swaying members of the National Baptist Convention, laden equally with Scripture and slogans, Mr. Kerry made a blunt appeal for black votes. American cities, he said, ''are being torn apart by forces just as divisive and destructive as Jim Crow.''
 With the Rev. Jesse Jackson at his side, Mr. Kerry lamented ''a million African-American votes not counted'' in the 2000 election; spoke of dire unemployment, poverty and dropout rates among minorities; and noted that the Supreme Court had upheld affirmative action by just one vote.
 Civil rights leaders' ''dream of one America'' is ''dim and denied in the Washington of today,'' Mr. Kerry said. He added, ''The president who turns away from African-American needs across the school districts and the communities of our country, who scorns economic justice and affirmative action, who traffics in the politics of division, and then claims he is a friend of black America, cannot conceal his identity no matter what clothes he wears.'' 
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, said the speech ''was filled with misleading, baseless attacks.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's speech here followed a health care forum in Des Moines where he used a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which reported an average rise in health care premiums of $3,512 per family over the past four years, to attack the Bush administration. He told the invited audience of 250 that the ''health care system is imploding on itself'' and that Mr. Bush ''chose to take money out of your pocket'' by opposing the importation of drugs from Canada.
 Mr. Kerry's aides announced over the weekend that they would be concentrating on health care and jobs, and Thursday was the first day since then that the candidate kept that focus. He mentioned Iraq only in passing, as the worst example of what he called the president's ''wrong choices.'' 
 As if on an endless tape loop, Mr. Kerry played off Mr. Bush's middle initial. ''That's 'W,' that's wrong: wrong choice, wrong direction, wrong leadership,'' he said at every turn.
 ''President Bush for four years has had an opportunity to try to deal with this, and he has no plan at all for America to lower the health care costs and to bring the people in -- he's been busy losing people's coverage,'' Mr. Kerry said, citing premiums that have risen as much as 50 percent.
 Mr. Schmidt of the Bush campaign responded that health care costs were not controlled by the federal government and had been rising for decades. He pointed out that the Kaiser study cited by Mr. Kerry said that premiums had been rising for seven years -- beginning in the Clinton administration -- and that the rate of growth had recently slowed. 
 As Mr. Kerry hammered Mr. Bush on health care, his running mate, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, sharply criticized Vice President Dick Cheney for his recent remark that the United States was more likely ''to get hit again'' by terrorists if Mr. Kerry was elected. 
 At a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Mr. Edwards also suggested that Mr. Cheney had orchestrated lenient treatment for Halliburton, the energy company he once ran, for overcharging the military for contracts in Iraq. He also criticized the vice president for conducting secret meetings with energy executives.
 When asked about high gasoline prices, Mr. Edwards again brought up Mr. Cheney, saying, ''The big oil companies' profits go up, whether it's Halliburton or somebody else, their profits go up -- and these are the kind of people, these lobbyists Dick Cheney met with to set our country's energy policies.''
 Anne Womack, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, responded: ''The reality is that Senator Kerry has been unable to articulate where he stands on the liberation of Iraq, having taken his eighth position just yesterday, and he's been unable to explain how he will pay for his laundry list of proposals other than by raising taxes. It's no wonder they are lashing out.''
 Mr. Kerry also swung back at Mr. Cheney's comments, made earlier this week.
 ''George Bush refused to contradict that comment or walk away from it yesterday,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press after his Des Moines forum. ''George Bush and Dick Cheney are engaging in shameful and irresponsible and outrageous behavior in trying to play the politics of fear and exploit the war on terror.''

HEADLINE: In Flatbush, 2 Challengers Work to Unseat a State Senator Before He Really Settles In

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
There is widespread agreement among politicians in New York, where state legislators are rarely defeated once they get into office, that the best opportunity to beat an incumbent is in his or her first re-election campaign.
 That strategy appears to be playing out in a heated and emotional Democratic primary for the State Senate in a district anchored in Flatbush and East Flatbush. In that race, State Senator Kevin S. Parker, who was first elected two years ago, is facing two opponents, including a well-known candidate who has raised more than five times as much money as the incumbent has. 
 That challenger, Noach Dear, was a member of the City Council for nearly 20 years before term limits forced him out of office. And there is a third candidate: Wellington Sharpe, a businessman who ran for the State Senate in an adjacent district two years ago. 
 Winning the primary next Tuesday is tantamount to winning the election in the overwhelmingly Democratic district.
 Mr. Dear made a name for himself not only during his years in the Council but also in national Democratic circles as a master fund-raiser who collected millions of dollars on behalf of Bill Clinton's and Al Gore's presidential campaigns.
 And for the Senate race in this district, which also includes Borough Park, Kensington and Ditmas Park, Mr. Dear has raised more than $300,000, compared with the $55,000 raised by Senator Parker and $26,000 by Mr. Sharpe. Added to that is the fact that he is a proven vote-getter: in the five-candidate Democratic primary for State Senate two years ago, Mr. Dear came in second, with 29 percent of the vote to Mr. Parker's 35 percent.
 Beyond fund-raising, race has also been a underlying issue in this Democratic primary. The population of the 21st State Senate District is 57 percent black, 23 percent white, 10 percent Hispanic and 5 percent Asian.
 Some Brooklyn Democrats, including Mr. Parker, have suggested that the presence of Mr. Sharpe in the race is intended to divide the black vote, as both men are black. That could benefit Mr. Dear, who is white.
 At every turn, Mr. Parker, 37, has trumpeted what he describes as significant achievements for a first-term official in the minority party in the Senate. ''We have started a local development corporation with the aim of building more economic development in this area,'' he said.
 And he points to another accomplishment, having worked to establish a business development center in cooperation with Brooklyn College to help people who want to start new businesses or develop their entrepreneurial skills. 
 ''I have been fighting for increasing the money that Albany sends to fund New York City schools,'' Mr. Parker said. ''And I have been fighting for increases in the minimum wage. I've been busy trying to make sure the needs of the people in this district are met.''
 That is precisely the point challenged by Mr. Dear, 47, who said that Mr. Parker had been slow to act and was light on accomplishments.
 ''There are no youth centers in this district, and there are some of the worst reading scores in the city in the schools in East Flatbush,'' Mr. Dear said. ''The people in this district are so disappointed because they are looking for someone to turn things around. And they remember the way I delivered to my district when I was in the City Council.''
 Mr. Parker has also warned that Mr. Dear might sit with the Republican majority if he is elected, saying that Republican lawyers have advised him in his campaigns. He also contends that Mr. Dear ''doesn't share the values of the party in that he is against a woman's right to choose.''
 Mr. Dear says that he is an opponent of abortion and an advocate of school vouchers and that those views are not discordant with those of many residents in the district. He added that he had ''no ties whatsoever to the Republicans; I am a Democrat, and I always have been.''
 In an unusual twist, Mr. Dear's campaign literature refers to him with the first name Noah rather than Noach, the name he has used throughout his political career. He explained the shift as one that would make his name easier for many of his Caribbean constituents to pronounce.
 But some of the bitterest sniping has occurred between Mr. Parker and Mr. Sharpe, who accused the senator of assaulting him after an argument. ''He came up to me at a public ceremony and slammed his chest against my chest because he was angry that I was running against him,'' Mr. Sharpe said. ''A leader should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. And he has shown that the completely lacks leadership.''
 Mr. Sharpe, 60, said that there had been no collusion with Mr. Dear with regard to the Sharpe candidacy and added that he had sued Mr. Parker in the State Supreme Court for defamation over Mr. Parker's charges that Mr. Dear had paid off Mr. Sharpe to enter the race. The suit, which has not been heard, says Mr. Sharpe had no involvement with Mr. Dear concerning their candidacies.
 Mr. Parker dismissed the candidacy of Mr. Sharpe, pointing out that Mr. Sharpe had moved into the district since the last election, when he ran in another area and lost the Democratic primary to Carl Andrews, who is now the minority whip in the Senate. ''He has no support in this community,'' Mr. Parker said of Mr. Sharpe.
 Mr. Parker has been endorsed by most of the Democratic officials from Brooklyn, from United States Senator Charles E. Schumer to Brooklyn's borough president, Marty Markowitz. Still, he said, he is taking nothing for granted.
 ''This is a tough race, and we have to work hard,'' Mr. Parker said. ''But, in the end, I know the people will recognize the work that I have done in the last two years.''

HEADLINE: Powell Says Rapes and Killings in Sudan Are Genocide

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell declared Thursday that the United States viewed the killings, rapes and destruction of homes in the Darfur region of western Sudan as genocide, and he called on the United Nations Security Council to recognize that the situation required urgent action.
 While the declaration has no immediate effect on the role or obligations of the United Nations, said Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, it could be viewed as tantamount to invoking Article 8 of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide -- the first time that any nation had invoked that provision calling upon the United Nations to take action. 
 In toughly worded testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Powell said he had concluded that genocide had occurred after studying the findings of experts who had interviewed victims of violence in western Sudan, where attacks have been carried out by government-backed militia known as the Janjaweed. 
 ''When we reviewed the evidence compiled by our team,'' Mr. Powell said, ''we concluded -- I concluded -- that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility, and that genocide may still be occurring.''
 After Secretary Powell's testimony, the White House released a written statement from President Bush echoing his determination that the violence in Sudan amounted to genocide. ''We urge the international community to work with us to prevent and suppress acts of genocide,'' Mr. Bush said in the statement.
 But even as Mr. Powell delivered the administration's verdict on genocide, there were signs of trouble for a draft Security Council resolution on Sudan threatening penalties if Khartoum did not rein in the militias and permit an outside force to secure Darfur.
 Objections were raised by the ambassadors of both Pakistan and China, two countries that have warned that threats of sanctions will backfire and make Sudan more intransigent.
 ''We want to concentrate on keeping the government of Sudan engaged and not go down a path that could terminate that engagement,'' said Munir Akram, the Pakistani ambassador. The Chinese ambassador, Wang Guangya, suggested that China might veto such a resolution.
 Mr. Powell's call for action was aimed at underscoring a sense of urgency at the United Nations, State Department officials said. But there was also a political dimension to his testimony.
 Some critics of the Bush administration, including Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, have called on the United States to take a more assertive role in ending the conflict in Sudan. There has also been criticism from African-American groups, including a group of ministers who support the White House on other matters.
 Congress has passed a resolution declaring the Sudan situation genocide, and last week Mr. Kerry called on the administration to follow suit. But until now, Mr. Powell has said that he did not want to use the word without examining the facts, and furthermore said that using the word by itself would not accomplish very much.
 Mr. Powell repeated the point on Thursday, but he said the United States and others would continue to put pressure on Sudan by threatening economic sanctions and encouraging a settlement of the rebellion in Darfur that prompted the Janjaweed to retaliate.
 Talks to bring about such a solution, including sending at least 3,000 troops led by Nigeria, have been taking place in the Nigerian capital of Abuja. 
 ''Some seem to have been waiting for this determination of genocide to take action,'' Mr. Powell said. ''In fact, however, no new action is dictated by this determination. We have been doing everything we can to get the Sudanese government to act responsibly. So, let us not be too preoccupied with this designation.''
 A moment later, he added: ''Call it civil war. Call it ethnic cleansing. Call it genocide. Call it 'none of the above.' The reality is the same. There are people in Darfur who desperately need the help of the international community.'' 
 The Sudan conflict, which erupted last year, has led to tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of 1.5 million people. The term genocide has long been a sensitive and emotional one in international conflicts. 
 In 1994, in a situation that some critics say was similar to the current one in Sudan, the Clinton administration at first resisted using the word genocide to describe atrocities in Rwanda. It was only after 800,000 people had been killed that the word was applied. President Clinton later expressed regrets for not acting more quickly.
 Secretary Powell, however, has said the administration has been acting even while not using the word. Aides say Mr. Powell waited to use the word, in part because he wanted the State Department report to be completed, and also out of concern that its use would merely antagonize the Sudanese government.
 Mr. Powell has said several times that even threats of sanctions can backfire in certain situations, and he has instead tried to meet with Sudan's leaders and apply more low-key pressure. He visited the affected area in June.
 ''There's an overall reluctance to impose severe sanctions against Sudan at the moment because people are unsure as to whether they would have the desired effect,'' Mr. Powell told the Senate panel, referring to the Security Council. ''So I think we've got a lot of work to do before we could get the kind of sanctions that would actually change behavior of the authorities in Khartoum.''
 The administration is also concerned that threats and punishments against Sudan would antagonize the Arab world, which already sees the Bush administration as being tooeager to punish it. The conflict in Sudan is waged by an Arab-dominated government against non-Arab people in Darfur.
 The decision to use the word genocide on Thursday brought praise from some who have called on the administration to do more.
 Richard C. Holbrooke, a former United Nations ambassador in the Clinton administration, said using the word was the correct thing to do. ''Should he have done it earlier?'' Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview. ''Probably. But the important thing is to put maximum pressure on the government in Khartoum, and this is a significant step.''
 On Thursday evening, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, John C. Danforth, expressed impatience with the resistance to sanctions from China, Pakistan and others. Any country that vetoes a resolution calling for sanctions, he said, ''would have to explain the continuing tragedy of Darfur'' and explain why it favored ''stepping back and letting people die and be shot down by helicopters and raped.''

HEADLINE: Bush Attacks His Opponent Over His Record on Taxes

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Rick Lyman contributed reporting from Cincinnati for this article.

DATELINE: COLMAR, Pa., Sept. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush began a new attack on Senator John Kerry's economic record on Thursday, terming the senator a wastrel who would raise taxes on ordinary Americans and significantly increase government spending.
 ''If you drive a car, Senator Kerry has voted for higher taxes on you,'' Mr. Bush told an invited Republican crowd in the Philadelphia suburb of Colmar. ''If you have a job, he's voted for higher taxes on you. If you're married, or have children, he's voted for higher taxes on you.'' 
 On a day when disputes over Mr. Bush's three-decades' old service in the National Guard were again dominating the presidential race, Mr. Bush went on the offensive over the bread-and-butter issues that Mr. Kerry has sought to make a new focus of his campaign.
 Vice President Dick Cheney echoed the campaign's economic assault on Mr. Kerry. At what the Bush campaign billed as a town-hall meeting in a large convention center in Cincinnati, Mr. Cheney said Mr. Kerry and his running mate, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, were ''much more oriented towards enacting a lot of new taxes.''
 Mr. Cheney did not repeat the explosive accusation he made on Tuesday in Des Moines that the nation was more likely to ''get hit again'' by terrorists if Mr. Kerry was elected president. Instead, he reverted to language he had used in the past to justify the war in Iraq by linking Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda. Mr. Hussein, he said, ''provided safe harbor and sanctuary'' to Al Qaeda.
 In recent speeches, Mr. Cheney had merely said a relationship existed, but he did not speak of sanctuary or safe harbor.
 Thursday night, his aides said there is not necessarily a contradiction between the vice president's position and the conclusion of the Sept. 11 commission that there was no evidence of a ''collaborative, operational relationship'' between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda. 
 Mr. Bush, in Colmar, said that over two his decades in Washington Mr. Kerry had voted to raise taxes on incomes, Social Security, small businesses and gasoline, and now had an economic plan that would raise taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of the population.
 ''There's just one problem with that,'' Mr. Bush said. ''My opponent's tax increases would bring only about $650 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, see. And he wants to spend over $2 trillion. So you do the math. The plan leaves him more than $1.4 trillion short. And guess who would wind up paying the bill?''
 The Kerry campaign responded that Mr. Bush was falsifying the senator's record and that it was the president who had increased government spending to huge levels, turning a surplus into a projected $422 billion budget deficit for this year. 
 Mr. Kerry, his campaign said, had voted for middle-class tax cuts and had voted to cut taxes on small businesses for health care, investment, research and development. The senator's campaign also said that the president, in attacking Mr. Kerry for raising taxes on small businesses, was using a definition of small-business people that included multimillionaires like himself, Mr. Cheney, doctors, lawyers and management consultants.
 ''George Bush's false attacks are just another desperate attempt to cover up his wrong choices that have taken the country in the wrong direction,'' said Phil Singer, a Kerry campaign spokesman. 
 Mr. Bush made his remarks at Byers' Choice Ltd., a company that makes Christmas figurines. He was interrupted early in his speech by six hecklers who were quickly removed and charged with disorderly conduct. 
 One heckler, Jennifer Cohn, was pulled by her hair and marched out of the room by a supporter of Mr. Bush. ''How did you even get in here?'' another man said angrily to Ms. Cohn as he helped remove her from the room.
 In an interview afterward, Ms. Cohn said that she wanted Mr. Bush to spend $30 billion fighting AIDS rather than the $15 billion he has promised. When Ms. Cohn tried to shout that the president is a liar, the crowd drowned her out with loud chants of ''four more years.''
 In his remarks on the economy, Mr. Bush cast his economic record in a bright light: The nation, he said, has enjoyed 12 straight months of job gains, adding 1.7 million jobs in the past year, and seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.4 percent. In addition, he said, the public had profited from a tax cut that meant the average family of four with a $40,000 income paid $2,000 less to the Internal Revenue Service.
 Despite the job gains over the past 12 months, the nation has lost one million jobs since Mr. Bush took office. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent when he became president.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Call to Scrap One House Of Legislature

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
A small group of Democratic state lawmakers called Friday for amending the State Constitution to eliminate one house of the State Legislature, abolish the state's public authorities, overhaul a budget process that has produced 20 late budgets in a row and put an end to the gerrymandering of legislative districts.
 If their call for change is currently the longest of long shots in a state capitol known for its inertia and inaction -- they do not yet have the blessing of the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, let alone support in the Republican-led Senate -- it is nonetheless notable because it is being made by Albany insiders. 
 ''That there is a genuine breakdown in the process of state government, and that there is a crisis of public confidence as a result of that, can no longer be argued,'' Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said as he made the proposal at a news conference here. ''It is clear and obvious to everyone.'' 
 The state passed the tardiest, most-expensive budget in its history this year; it was the 20th year in a row that it failed to pass the budget on time. State leaders deadlocked on most of the major issues that confronted them, and failed to comply with a court order requiring them to overhaul the way the state pays for education. An academic study this year found that New York had the worst legislature in the nation. Mr. Brodsky, who is preparing to run for state attorney general, said that six other Assembly Democrats had signed on to his proposal, and added that he had sent copies of the proposal to the rest of the Legislature. He said that he wanted his proposal to serve as a starting point for a debate on how to change the way state government works. 
 ''The consequence to the people of the state is not just late budgets, but a growing failure to address long-term social and economic issues,'' he said. 
 He proposed replacing the 150-member State Assembly and the 62-member State Senate with a single, 100-member body, which he said would streamline lawmaking and make New York the only state besides Nebraska with a one-chamber legislature. He also called for eliminating the state's public authorities, which do the work of government without its accountability, and called for their budgeting -- and borrowing -- to be included in the state's budget, to present a more accurate picture of state finances. 
 And he said that nonpartisan commissions should be used to draw legislative district lines, replacing the current partisan system that has helped keep the Senate in Republican hands and the Assembly in Democratic hands for three decades.
 The state could amend its Constitution by having two successive state legislatures vote on a package of reforms, which would then be put on a ballot before voters. Or the state could hold a constitutional convention. The last time a constitutional convention was proposed, in 1997, it was opposed by many groups who feared that progressive-era language protecting the poor and the rights of workers would be jettisoned. Mr. Brodsky said these fears could be allayed by trying to limit the convention to government reform and by improving the process for selecting delegates. 
 Mr. Brodsky said that much of the paralysis afflicting state government was systemic, noting that recent court decisions had sharply limited the Legislature's power to amend the governor's budgets, thereby paving the way for constant stalemate.
 In ruling two years ago that the Legislature could not amend the language in budget bills that set policy, a State Supreme Court justice wrote that the Legislature ''can simply fail to enact into law the governor's appropriation bills and the resulting deadlock, if a compromise cannot be reached, will cause public pressure to build to the point where these political questions will be settled in the voting booth and not in the courtroom.''
 Mr. Brodsky proposed overhauling the budget process to give the Legislature more power to amend the budget, while letting the governor keep the line-item veto.

HEADLINE: Key Gauge of Prices Drops; Trade Deficit Narrows

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Producer prices dropped unexpectedly in August as the cost of gasoline plunged and prices of food and vehicles fell, according to a government report Friday that showed inflation pressures under wraps. 
 A separate report said the nation's trade deficit narrowed more than expected in July as imports declined for the first time in 10 months and exports rose. Still, at $50.1 billion, it was the second biggest gap on record. 
 The producer price index, a gauge of prices received by farms, factories and refineries, fell 0.1 percent in August, the Labor Department said. The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, also dropped 0.1 percent, the first decline since February. Economists had expected both figures to be up 0.1 percent. 
 Prices domestic producers received for crude oil jumped 12.5 percent, but gasoline prices fell 5 percent as supplies remained ample as the summer wound down. 
 Overall energy prices at the finished goods level edged up 0.2 percent, an abrupt slowdown from a 2.3 percent jump in July, as the gasoline price drop partly offset rising costs for other energy products. 
 Food prices fell 0.2 percent, the third monthly decline, after gains in the spring. The report also showed drops in prices for cars and light trucks and sport utility vehicles.
 In the report on trade, the Commerce Department said the deficit narrowed nearly 9 percent, the biggest monthly drop in two and a half years. Analysts had expected the deficit to narrow but not so sharply. 
 Imports dipped 1.4 percent, to $146 billion, with the import bill helped by a drop in oil import prices to $33.28 a barrel after eight consecutive monthly increases. Exports increased 3.0 percent, to $95.9 billion, a $1 billion shy of the record set in May. The rebound included a rise in civilian airplane sales, which had fallen sharply in June.

HEADLINE: From 1814, Tales Keep A-Comin'

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The War of 1812 has lain mostly dormant in the American imagination for generations, its memory invoked only rarely, as in Johnny Horton's 1959 hit version of ''The Battle of New Orleans'' (''we fired once more, and the British kept a-comin''') or in periodic retellings of the story of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Otherwise, the war remains an overlooked episode in American history, perhaps because it ended in a draw.
 But the History Channel has been doing its best to make Americans remember the conflict, heavily promoting ''First Invasion: The War of 1812,'' a two-hour documentary that it will show at 9 tomorrow night. Why this obscure war now? The key lies in the first part of the title. It is the documentary's contention that the War of 1812 teaches a lesson about the invasion of the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 That connection is explicitly drawn in the opening moments of the documentary when the words ''September 11'' fill the black screen over the sound of explosions and alarm bells and the voiceover intones ominously, ''America is on the brink of annihilation.'' The screen then brightens to show cannon and soldiers in period costume, and the title changes to ''September 11, 1814'' -- the date British forces advanced on Baltimore after burning Washington.
 According to the documentary's view of the war, the fledgling republic perseveres against the enormous odds stacked against it by the powerful British military and its own disorganization. And if ''First Invasion'' backs off the Sept. 11 parallel soon after the opening, it does see the war as an inspiring lesson for Americans in a time of crisis. 
 ''It is a story of courage, endurance and a little bit of luck,'' the narration says. ''Forged by fire, united by will, a young nation defied the odds -- and won.''
 But the documentary, from Native Sun Productions, tells the story of the War of 1812 selectively, leaving out large portions that would show American conduct in the war in a less successful and less glorious light. 
 ''First Invasion'' details the British seizure and impressment of American seamen into the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, a direct casus belli for the United States. But it only fleetingly mentions American designs on Ontario and Quebec and efforts to drive Indian tribes allied with the British out of the western Great Lakes. It discusses New England's opposition to the war because of its commercial ties to Britain, but fails to discuss Southern congressmen's staunch support for the war, perhaps tied to fears that abolitionist Britain might curtail the slave trade. 
 And while the documentary goes into great detail about the destruction wrought by British forces on Washington and Baltimore in 1814, it glosses over the unsuccessful and bloody American campaign in Ontario in 1812 and 1813, which included the burning and sacking of several towns. (The British burning of Washington was retaliation for the Americans' burning of York.) Indeed, the narration refers to the American incursion not as an invasion but as merely an attack.
 In the end, as much as anything about the war that is its subject, ''First Invasion'' teaches a lesson about the uses to which history can be put.
 ''In Canada, we learn that we successfully resisted your invasion, and that laid the groundwork for what would eventually become our nation,'' said Jack Granatstein, the former director of the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. ''We won the War of 1812 by not losing.''
 Stephen Clarkson, a professor of political economy at the University of Toronto, remembers being surprised the first time he encountered the American view of the war. ''A student showed me an American book on it about 15 years ago,'' he said, ''and it conveyed the idea that it had been this glorious victory when, in fact, it was a defeat in an attempt to conquer Canada.''
 While the American failure in the north meant that the United States would never seriously threaten British interests in North America again, it also meant that Washington would direct its expansionist energies more fruitfully westward and southward against the Indians, Spain and Mexico. 
 ''The war confirmed certain American messianic views about the continent, views the U.S. still holds,'' Professor Clarkson said. 
 The documentary shares this opinion, although it puts it in a more admiring light in speaking of leaders who would ''lead the nation to its manifest destiny.'' Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore hints at an even greater measure of divine inevitability to the American war effort when he tells in ''First Invasion'' of a storm that extinguishes the fires in Washington and batters the British troops there. 
 ''We now know a tornado actually touches down, like the wrathful hand of God from the Old Testament,'' Mr. O'Malley says, ''and inflicts more casualties in the middle of that British column.''
 So, rather than the American defeat that Canadians see or the draw that was the actual result of the war -- the peace treaty restored the prewar status quo and laid the foundation for the demilitarization of the American-Canadian border -- ''First Invasion'' posits an American victory, possibly aided by the deity himself. It is an uplifting message for a post-Sept. 11 American audience.
 ''We'd been working on this since 1988,'' said Gary L. Foreman, the director of ''First Invasion,'' ''and we'd already identified Sept. 11, 1814, as the key date when Americans finally came together to defend their country. But I remember soon after the 9/11 attacks, all the television commentators referencing the War of 1812 as the last time a foreign power attacked the territorial U.S., but they couldn't articulate anything about it. That's when the History Channel saw the relevance of our project and the idea that not only does history repeat itself, but that we live on a fragile thread of existence.''
 Others also found a morale-boosting lesson in the War of 1812 after Sept. 11.
 In The New York Times Magazine two weeks after the attacks, the novelist Caleb Carr saw the British expeditionary force of 1814 as a direct precursor to the Sept. 11 hijackers. 
 The British, he wrote, attacked the United States and burned Washington ''because of a deep anxiety over the spread of American democratic republicanism.'' Similarly, ''it is the spread of American values,'' he continued, ''that terrorist groups and the traditionalist, socially repressive societies that support them now fear. This fear has driven them to emulate the British forces of 1814 by damaging and destroying a group of structures that are among the most familiar symbols of contemporary American power.''
 If it is true that the War of 1812 somehow provides a geopolitical lesson for today, the nature of that lesson may not be as clear-cut as Mr. Carr or ''First Invasion'' sees it. 
 ''What does 1812 teach us?'' asked Wesley Turner, the Canadian author of ''The War of 1812: The War That Both Sides Won.'' ''Well, that you think you can conquer little countries, and it's not so easy.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Saturday about a History Channel documentary on the War of 1812 misstated part of the refrain of ''The Battle of New Orleans,'' a 1959 song cited as an example of a rare invocation of the war in American culture. The refrain starts, ''We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'.'' (''We fired once more'' occurs later in the refrain).

HEADLINE: Floridians Are Left Weary by Threat of Another Hurricane

BYLINE: By SARA KENNEDY

DATELINE: FORT MEADE, Fla., Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Battered by Hurricane Charley, deluged by Hurricane Frances and with yet another huge hurricane, named Ivan, approaching from the south, residents of this town of 6,000 are getting pretty weary of multiple climatic assaults.
 If Hurricane Ivan turns toward Florida in the next few days after deadly head-on blows to Grenada and Jamaica, it will be the first time in 40 years that three hurricanes have made landfall here in a single season, according to statistics provided by the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
 ''We're sick enough, we're heading out,'' said Stu Myers, 43, a maintenance rating program specialist for the Florida Department of Transportation, who on Friday was planning to flee with his wife and children to South Carolina in his new Chevy truck. ''That's what we do now: hurricanes. We're calling this 'hurricane leaving.' This ain't no vacation.'' 
 Officials have not issued evacuation notices for this part of the state; only the 79,000 residents of Key West have been urged to flee. 
 Fort Meade sits close to where the paths of Hurricanes Charley and Frances crossed, in Central Florida 58 miles east of Tampa. Piles of brown, splintered trees and brush line every street; City Hall, its windows boarded up for protection when Hurricane Frances came through on Sunday, still wears its pocked armor, should yet another hurricane visit.
 ''The people are stressed with the multiple storms,'' said Mayor Robert Elliott, 51, whose own home was flattened by a gigantic oak from the winds of Hurricane Charley.
 ''Through the first storm, everybody was pretty upbeat and thankful; they had tree damage, maybe shingle damage, but not a loss of life,'' Mr. Elliott said. Then, he continued, ''another one came -- that's where the psychological effect is.''
 He said more than 60 percent of Fort Meade's homes were damaged in the storms. Adding to the burden is serious damage to the town's economy and the area has lost 40 percent to 60 percent of its most important crop, citrus.
 In addition, residents have endured prolonged power failures, flooding, mud and clouds of mosquitoes. On top of that are the rodents, snakes and raccoons, whose natural habitat is underwater. ''Weary is the term,'' said Susan Walker, 49, who was working at The Strawberry Patch, a florist and gift shop along Fort Meade's main street. ''It's been an emotional roller coaster. You wonder what else can befall you.''
 Ms. Walker said stressed friends and relatives are depressing enough, but minor irritations are equally maddening, like her permanently dark home, which survived the two storms but whose windows remain boarded up with plywood. 
 ''You wake up, you're all boarded up and you don't want to get up. The inside of the house is dark,'' she explained. ''My husband said, 'I'm going to paint you some stars on the inside of that plywood,' so I'll know when it's nighttime.''

U.S. Weighs Import Limits on China
Brushing aside Chinese warnings of a possible challenge to the World Trade Organization, Grant Aldonas, left, the undersecretary of commerce for international trade, said that the United States would limit apparel imports if American manufacturers provided evidence that such restrictions were needed.

Another Charge for Tribune
The Tribune Company said that it would take a pretax charge of $45 million to $60 million in the third quarter to compensate advertisers for overstating circulation figures at two of its newspapers even more than initially reported.

HEADLINE: Ruling Class War

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There are two sorts of people in the information-age elite, spreadsheet people and paragraph people. Spreadsheet people work with numbers, wear loafers and support Republicans. Paragraph people work with prose, don't shine their shoes as often as they should and back Democrats.
 C.E.O.'s are classic spreadsheet people. According to a sample gathered by PoliticalMoneyLine in July, the number of C.E.O.'s donating funds to Bush's campaign is five times the number donating to Kerry's. 
 Professors, on the other hand, are classic paragraph people and lean Democratic. Eleven academics gave to the Kerry campaign for every 1 who gave to Bush's. Actors like paragraphs, too, albeit short ones. Almost 18 actors gave to Kerry for every 1 who gave to Bush. For self-described authors, the ratio was about 36 to 1. Among journalists, there were 93 Kerry donors for every Bush donor. For librarians, who must like Faulknerian, sprawling paragraphs, the ratio of Kerry to Bush donations was a whopping 223 to 1.
 Laura Bush has a lot of work to do in shoring up her base. 
 Data from the Center for Responsive Politics allows us to probe the emerging class alignments, but the pattern is the same. Number people and word people are moving apart.
 Accountants, whose relationship with numbers verges on the erotic, are now heavily Republican. Back in the early 1990's, accountants gave mostly to Democrats, but now they give twice as much to the party of Lincoln. Similarly, in the early 1990's, bankers gave equally to the two parties. Now they give mostly to Republicans, though one notices that employees at big banks, like Citigroup and Bank of America, are more likely to give to Democrats.
 But lawyers -- people who didn't realize that they wanted to be novelists until their student loan burdens were already too heavy -- are shifting the other way. This year, lawyers gave about $81 million to Democrats and about $31 million to Republicans.
 Media types are Democratic, of course, but one is dismayed to learn that two-thirds of employee donations at Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation went to Democrats. Whatever happened to company loyalty?
 If you look at the big Kerry donors, you realize that the days of the starving intellectual are over. University of California employees make up the single biggest block of Kerry donors and Harvard employees are second, topping folks from Goldman Sachs and others in the supposedly sell-out/big-money professions.
 Academics have had such an impact on the Democratic donor base because there is less intellectual diversity in academia than in any other profession. All but 1 percent of the campaign donations made by employees of William & Mary College went to Democrats. In the Harvard crowd, Democrats got 96 percent of the dollars. At M.I.T., it was 94 percent. Yale is a beacon of freethinking by comparison; 8 percent of its employee donations went to Republicans. 
 It should be noted there are some professions that span the spreadsheet-people/paragraph-people divide. For example, lobbyists give equally to both parties. (Could it possibly be that lobbyists don't have principles?) And casino people split their giving, with employees at Harrah's giving mostly to Democrats and employees at MGM Mirage giving mostly to Republicans.
 Why have the class alignments shaken out as they have? There are a couple of theories. First there is the intellectual affiliation theory. Numerate people take comfort in the false clarity that numbers imply, and so also admire Bush's speaking style. Paragraph people, meanwhile, relate to the postmodern, post-Cartesian, deconstructionist, co-directional ambiguity of Kerry's Iraq policy.
 I subscribe, however, to the mondo-neo-Marxist theory of information-age class conflict. According to this view, people who majored in liberal arts subjects like English and history naturally loathe people who majored in econ, business and the other ''hard'' fields. This loathing turns political in adult life and explains just about everything you need to know about political conflict today.
 It should be added that not everybody fits predictably into the political camp indicated by a profession. I myself am thinking of founding the Class Traitors Association, made up of conservative writers, liberal accountants and other people so filled with self-loathing that they ally politically with social and cultural rivals.
 Class traitors of the word, Unite! You have nothing to lose but your friends -- and a world to gain!

HEADLINE: Diversity as Policy, Not as Window Dressing

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
AMERICAN workers are willing to accept diversity in their workplaces, but they fault top management for not promoting diversity in the right way, according to a national survey of 5,500 workers by the National Urban League. Following are excerpts from a conversation with Marc H. Morial, president and chief executive of the league:

Q. What were the main findings of your survey?

A. Workers embrace diversity, feel comfortable with it and believe in it. But less than one-third feel their companies have an effective diversity program or a diversity initiative. Workers are a little bit ahead of management in their thinking on this issue.
 In terms of advertising, it's a question of, ''Do you use minority and niche press for print ads?'' For television and radio advertising, the consumer goods companies are far more sophisticated than anyone. They'll have different kinds of commercials for maybe a political convention and different commercials for the very same product for sports events. It's different commercials for the young, for African-Americans, for Latinos or for a daytime audience of stay-at-home moms. It may be surprising that employees and workers place a great premium on marketing, but that's the company's most visible manifestation externally.

Q. Have discrimination lawsuits like those at Coca-Cola and Eastman Kodak helped or hurt the cause of diversity?

A. The right of people to pursue their remedies in court is just a part of the American system that we've got to respect, even if it sometimes is irritating. But I will say that those companies that do nothing are much more likely to be exposed to litigation than those companies that do the right thing.

Q. Do certain industries or companies do a better job on diversity?

A. Many of the larger companies with large work forces that span many regions and diverse markets, in both urban and rural areas, tend to be the most aggressive about diversity. They tend to be more global in nature or large national companies.

Q. But fewer than half the workers who responded to your survey believe that diversity is very much a part of their company's culture. Could this be the time when more top executives become serious about it?

A. The climate has changed. There are still many who don't get it, but there are those who do get it and do understand it. One of the things the employees we surveyed indicated was that a company that embraces diversity is more productive. There is a business case for diversity. When you get this right, you don't have the drag or the tension.

Q. Do the best companies manage diversity from the human resources department or do they create a chief diversity officer or a diversity committee of some sort?

A. We've seen a move toward chief diversity officers. It's a recognition that diversity is larger than simply human resources. It also involves procurement, philanthropy, marketing and other parts of the company that are beyond the purview of the H.R. department. It's a recognition that the C.E.O. wants to elevate the issue.

Q. It's interesting that you found a clear regional pattern, with the western part of the country more open to diversity than the north central part. Why?

A. It may reflect the fact that there's typically been more diversity in the West. The West has probably had, for a longer time, both African-American and Latino populations. It suggests there are parts of the country where, philosophically, they embrace the idea more.

Q. What do you hope to communicate with this survey?

A. What we've been focusing on saying is that by the time we get to 2050, the country will no longer have a majority ethnic group. Inculcating diversity as a core value in the institutions of this country is so important to our ability to grow and thrive as a nation. Secondly, the world in which we have to navigate is much more global from an economic and political standpoint. That's why embracing diversity is important to our ability to continue being a power on the world stage.


Q. What kinds of top management initiatives fail?

A. If top management sees diversity just as a P.R. thing, as a way of putting lipstick on a pig, it will fall flat. They have to recognize that to do it right, you've got to make it a core value of your company. You've got to work from the minute you hire an employee to instill in them that it's important, that you give ongoing training and that you really have a level playing field. Some companies also evaluate managers partly on the basis of how effective they are in implementing diversity policies.

Q. Why do 63 percent of workers say marketing is the most important area for diversity?

A. It's in marketing where the image of the company is translated and where the image becomes most visible. You see a growing recognition that there's a strong business case for diversity, given the fact that customer bases are dramatically changing.

Q. So this means advertising in different languages or with different messages?

A. Yes, different languages and different messages. Where you market and how you market are also important. Marketing by larger companies is not only television and radio advertising, but it's also soft marketing and relationship building. It's the community causes that a company embraces, the trade associations and the organizations at whose shows they exhibit.

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:

All times are Eastern. All dates and times subject to change.

September

FATHER OF THE PRIDE -- The people at DreamWorks who brought you ''Shrek'' here bring you a family of lions in the Las Vegas show (now canceled in real life) of Siegfried and Roy. The comedy is edgier than viewers have often seen from animation, which may surprise parents who think this is for kids. It's meant to be a young-adult show -- only with talking lions. Among those doing the talking are John Goodman, Cheryl Hines and Carl Reiner, and there will be a parade of guest voices, including Eddie Murphy reprising his Donkey character from the ''Shrek'' films. NBC, Tuesdays at 9.

FILM SCHOOL -- A reality series involving a competition among student filmmakers, who are shown going through the process of writing screenplays, raising money, casting and production. A group of graduate students at New York University compete for an award that will presumably set them on the road to a career in film. IFC, Fridays at 10:30.

HAWAII -- A tough police unit battles serious crimes under swaying palms. Why not? ''Hawaii Five-O'' did it for CBS for years. Michael Biehn (''The Terminator'') is the star. NBC, Wednesdays at 8.

IN SEARCH OF THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY -- A highly original concept for a reality series: singers and actors try out for parts in a remake of the campy show from the 70's. The seven-episode series (which began last Sunday) will show the auditions and then the eight finalists for each part going through a performing boot camp, with some of the original cast -- David Cassidy, Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones -- acting as judges. VH1, Sundays at 9.

JOEY -- The burden of great expectations falls heaviest this season on an actor once considered the most expendable member of the cast of ''Friends.'' Matt LeBlanc carries over his Joey character from the NBC monster hit in this spinoff; he moves to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career while trying not to let his preternatural dumbness derail him. He reunites with a previously unseen sister, played by Drea de Matteo, the late lamented Adriana of ''The Sopranos.'' NBC, Thursdays at 8.

KITCHEN ACCOMPLISHED -- The latest in the television remodeling craze: a complete kitchen makeover in three days. Food Channel, Fridays at 10.

MEDICAL INVESTIGATION -- ''C.S.I.'' in scrubs. A team of brilliant doctors, made up of the usual beautiful young actors, fights against time each week to solve a baffling medical mystery using the latest scientific breakthroughs. It stars Neal McDonough (''Boomtown'') and Kelli Williams (''The Practice''). NBC, Fridays at 10.

THE NEXT GREAT CHAMP -- The show that brought the television industry to blows -- even before any of its boxers got onto television. Fox commissioned this boxing reality show after it lost out on ''The Contender,'' a show set for NBC in November. Both shows feature aspiring boxers vying for a television championship, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at their lives. Oscar De La Hoya, a multiple boxing champ himself, is the host. Fox, Tuesdays at 9, moving to Fridays at 9 in October.

RENOVATE MY FAMILY -- We've seen people made over, houses made over, even cars made over. Now comes a complete family makeover, involving all of the above. The moms, dads, kids, houses, cars, rooms, even pets get made over in this reality series. The host is Jay McGraw, whose claim to fame is that his father is Dr. Phil. Fox, Mondays at 9.

JACK AND BOBBY -- A quirky, time-traveling drama that traces the coming of age of two brothers, one of whom is destined to be the president of the United States -- but it's not a historical series. These are not the Kennedy brothers, though the connection is far from unintentional. The boys, Jack the born leader and Bobby the introspective misfit, are being raised in a small Missouri town by a dynamic single mother who is a college professor (Christine Lahti). In flash-forwards 40 years ahead, we see the impact of events in their youths. The boys are played by the newcomers Matthew Long and Logan Lerman. WB, Sundays at 9 starting tonight. A related article is on Page 80.

A SEPARATE PEACE -- A new film version of the classic John Knowles novel set in an elite boys' school during World War II. Hume Cronyn gives his last performance. Showtime, tonight at 7:30.

THE BENEFACTOR -- First in what will probably be a long list of descendants of ''The Apprentice,'' this reality series features Mark Cuban, the eccentric owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, leading a pack of would-be moguls through adventures in which he dispenses advice and money. ABC, Mondays at 8 starting tomorrow.

LAX -- How much drama really happens at an airport? NBC thinks it's enough to build an entire series around, which most likely means a lot of security threats, as well as missing children and drug smuggling. The idea is to make the airport locale as exotic as that of the show it follows, last year's surprise hit ''Las Vegas,'' though there are limited opportunities for showgirls to appear in the airport lounge. Two familiar television faces, Heather Locklear and Blair Underwood, play rival security officers. NBC, Mondays at 10 starting tomorrow.

RATED R: REPUBLICANS IN HOLLYWOOD -- How do confirmed conservatives function in the liberal stronghold of show business? That question is examined in this documentary by a former Democratic speechwriter, Jesse Moss. He produces a number of outspoken right-wing entertainers, including Patricia Heaton of ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' the comic Drew Carey and, of all things, a game-show host, Pat Sajak. AMC, Tuesday at 10.

WEDDING VIDEOS REVEALED -- A collection of horrible moments from people's wedding videos -- all in good fun, of course. Lifetime, Thursday at 11.

COMMANDO NANNY -- As if Mark Burnett doesn't already have enough success as the producer of ''Survivor'' and ''The Apprentice,'' now he has a sitcom about his early life as a former British special forces soldier who becomes a nanny for three spoiled kids in Beverly Hills. If it ever gets on the air, that is: first Owain Yeoman replaced Philip Winchester, who broke his foot just before the series began filming, in the title role; then production was delayed again two weeks ago when Gerald McRaney, who plays the nanny's boss, underwent lung surgery. Originally scheduled for Fridays at 8:30 starting this week on WB; now on hold.

FAMILY BONDS -- A reality series, HBO style. A big, boisterous Long Island family, the Evangelistas, work together as bounty hunters, tracking down bail jumpers with a brutal bluntness matched only by their conversations with one another. And all of it is on camera. HBO, Sundays at 10 starting next Sunday.

THE WIRE -- A new season of one of the most challenging -- and rewarding, for the dedicated -- dramas on television. Once again flawed cops trace the underground drug economy of Baltimore, with political machinations stirring in the background. Most of the cast, led by Dominic West, returns. HBO, Sundays at 9 starting next Sunday.

SECOND TIME AROUND -- A young couple are enjoying newly married life -- several years after their divorce. A real-life couple, on their first marriage, play the pair: Nicole Parker and Boris Kodjoe, both alumni of the series ''Soul Food.'' UPN, Mondays at 9:30 starting Sept. 20.

LISTEN UP -- The sportswriter Tony Kornheiser's life is funny enough, apparently, to inspire a sitcom -- if ''inspire'' is a word that can be used for this show. Jason Alexander comes back to television comedy to play Mr. Kornheiser (here named Tony Kleinman), who is also known for his appearances on ESPN arguing with his Washington Post colleague Michael Wilbon (here named Bernie Widmer and played by Malcolm-Jamal Warner). Much of the show is about family life and raising daughters. CBS, Mondays at 8:30 starting Sept. 20.

RODNEY -- ABC, which specializes in blue-collar comedy, offers up Rodney Carrington, a stand-up comedian, playing a regular guy who keeps getting fired from jobs while he's trying to be a stand-up comedian. His humor runs toward walking into department stores naked. The show also stars Amy Pietz (''Caroline in the City'') as his wife. ABC, Tuesdays at 9:30 starting Sept. 21.

LOST -- One of the few groundbreaking new series, a drama written by the creator of ''Alias,'' J. J. Abrams, and set on an island where a plane crash has left a group of survivors facing unusual hardships. ABC, Wednesdays at 8 starting Sept. 22. A related article is on Page 80.

VERONICA MARS -- A 17-year-old girl turns out to be a crackerjack detective in this well-thought-of drama series, in which she ferrets out the dirty secrets of an affluent oceanside community. It stars Kristen Bell, who made a searing impression as a young hustler who came to a brutal end in HBO's ''Deadwood'' this season. UPN, Tuesdays at 9 after a Sept. 22 premiere.

C.S.I. NEW YORK -- The most anticipated new series of the year and the most likely to be a hit, reflecting the success of the two ''C.S.I.'' shows that preceded it. And the franchise's creator, Anthony Zuiker, will be at the helm. The graphically depicted action shifts to the forensic unit of the N.Y.P.D.; the impressive cast is led by the busy film actor Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes (''Providence''). CBS, Wednesdays at 10 starting Sept. 22.

COMPLETE SAVAGES -- The chaotic life of a father raising five sons alone, with all the crude activity that implies. The Savage family can't keep a decent housekeeper, because no one wants to contend with such a loutish bunch; of course, they're a sweetly loving brood at heart. From Mike Scully of ''Simpsons'' fame. Keith Carradine plays the patriarch. ABC, Fridays at 8:30 starting Sept. 24.

DR. VEGAS -- The city that seems to have enough drama for an endless number of TV series now spawns a show that mixes medicine and poker chips. Rob Lowe plays the house doctor at a hotel and casino, whose cases reflect the city's most outre behavior. With Joe Pantoliano (''The Sopranos'') as the hotel manager. CBS, Fridays at 10 starting Sept. 24.

CLUBHOUSE -- The adventures of a boy living out his dream of being a batboy for the New York Empires, a team closely modeled on the Yankees. How many stories this premise can yield is probably as big a question as who will start in the playoffs for the real Yankees. It stars the newcomer Jeremy Sumpter, with the class act Mare Winningham as his mom and Dean Cain (''Lois and Clark'') as a star player he idolizes. CBS, Tuesdays at 9 after a premiere Sept. 26 at 8.

THE WORST WEEK OF MY LIFE -- A seven-part comedy about the endless indignities suffered by a couple (Sarah Alexander and Ben Miller) heading for their wedding day. Each episode covers a single day in the growing chaos. BBC America, Sundays at 9 starting Sept. 26.

McCALLUM -- A murder mystery as only the British do them, with John Hannah playing a forensic pathologist in London who favors motorcycles and demanding women. BBC America, Mondays at 9 starting Sept. 27.

CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE -- A new sitcom vehicle for the often-employed John Goodman, here playing the steady guy at the center of an aggressively wacky family, which includes a father (Ed Asner) obsessed with sex and a mother (Olympia Dukakis) too loopy to notice. CBS, Wednesdays at 9:30 starting Sept. 29.

KEVIN HILL -- One of the biggest shocks of the season: perhaps the most talked-about, and best, new series is on the once-marginal network UPN. UPN, Wednesdays at 9 starting Sept. 29. A related article is on Page 80.

WIFE SWAP -- Once destined to be a much-talked-about new series, now relegated to spouse-swap-come-lately status, thanks to Fox's getting its ''Trading Spouses'' onto the air first this summer. This is still a highly produced example of social study as reality show, with two women of differing backgrounds exchanging lives for 10 days. ABC, Wednesdays at 10 starting Sept. 29.

October

BOSTON LEGAL -- It's not the same old ''Practice'' anymore, though some of the crew are the same. David E. Kelley has totally remade his legal series from drama to comedy, more akin to ''Ally McBeal.'' But he continues to have the invaluable asset of James Spader as the incomparably weird Alan Shore. ABC, Sundays at 10 starting Oct. 3.

COLD TURKEY -- All reality shows have an element of cruelty to them; this one wears it on its sleeve. A group of unsuspecting chain smokers think they are being recruited for a typically silly reality series, only to find they are in a contest to quit cigarettes in pursuit of a cash prize. Sequestered in a house, they must endure the throes of withdrawal to outlast their competitors. Comedy and torture combined -- a sure ratings draw. PAX, Sundays at 10 starting Oct. 3.

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES -- Beyond the catchy title, there are elements herein of the classic soap. In a wealthy suburb, one of the wives commits suicide. Nobody knows why, but as the women in the community start to talk, more and more dirty little secrets spill out. A feast for all lovers of dirty little secrets. Among the stars: Teri Hatcher (''Lois and Clark'') and Felicity Huffman (''Sports Night''). ABC, Sundays at 9 starting Oct. 3.

AND YOU DON'T STOP: 30 YEARS OF HIP-HOP -- A comprehensive history of a musical and cultural movement that has had worldwide impact. The five-part documentary series, produced by Russell Simmons, will include interviews with a wide range of stars including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, OutKast, Ice-T, Kid Rock and the Beastie Boys. VH1, Oct. 4 to Oct. 8 at 10.

RFK -- A documentary from the filmmaker David Grubin that looks at the life of the doomed younger Kennedy brother; the first hour is devoted to his days as the ferocious aide-de-camp of his big brother Jack, the second to the wounded, suddenly empathetic man of the little people, who would also be cut down in his prime. A long list of historians and journalists contribute commentary to this ''American Experience'' installment. PBS, Oct. 4 at 9.

TANNER ON TANNER -- The creative team behind the fondly remembered 1988 HBO series ''Tanner '88,'' Robert Altman and Garry Trudeau, bring back many of the same characters for an update on the increasingly loony world of American politics. Among the many big names participating in this mini-series: Robert Redford, Martin Scorsese, Madeleine Albright and Mario Cuomo. Sundance, Tuesdays at 9 starting Oct. 5.

PROOF POSITIVE: EVIDENCE OF THE PARANORMAL -- A weekly battle between the true believers of science fiction and those who insist on little things like facts. Each week, three tales of seemingly extranormal phenomena (ghosts and aliens will be frequent participants) will be tested by teams of scientists to see which tale is real. Sci-Fi, Wednesdays at 8 starting Oct. 6.

GHOST HUNTERS -- Real-life ghostbusters investigate alleged haunted houses around the country. The group, called the Atlantic Paranormal Society, is made up of ordinary souls -- plumbers, teachers, factory workers -- all trying to solve unexplained disturbances. Produced by the team that does the hit ''American Chopper'' series. Sci-Fi, Wednesdays at 9 starting Oct. 6.

LIFE AS WE KNOW IT -- Teenage boys and their raging hormones. The series, which seems like the flip side of ''My So-Called Life'' -- and some of the same people are involved -- tries to capture what it's like to be a boy in high school thinking about sex at virtually every moment. The cast includes new names like Sean Faris, Jon Foster and Chris Lowell. ABC, Thursdays at 9 starting Oct. 7.

DIARY OF A POLITICAL TOURIST -- Alexandra Pelosi (''Journeys With George'') makes another film for a presidential year, this time looking at the field of Democratic contenders over the two years they chased the nomination. HBO, Oct. 11 at 8.

I HATE MY JOB -- Surely one of the most original ideas of the year for a reality show: eight guys quit their jobs and are given three months to chase the job they have always wanted. Of course, bringing along a camera crew might help. In some highly original casting, the Rev. Al Sharpton will serve as the host, a kind of career counselor and motivational coach. Spike, Tuesdays at 9 starting Oct. 12.

THE CLUB -- Another fresh take on the reality genre. The producer Ben Silverman, who has taken behind-the-scenes looks at the creation of a restaurant and a beauty salon, here offers Ice, a Las Vegas nightclub undergoing a complete makeover in order to compete with the big hotels on the Strip. Spike, Tuesdays at 10 starting Oct. 12.

MANHUNT: THE SEARCH FOR AMERICA'S MOST GORGEOUS MALE MODEL -- Well, why not? There's already a female model show, and it's a hit. In this one, men will be plucked from the street (literally) and put through their paces. The winner gets a contract from the IMG agency. Bravo, Tuesdays at 10 starting Oct. 12.

THE LOST PRINCE -- The story of an obscure member of the British royal family, Prince John, uncle of the current Queen Elizabeth, who was hidden from society because he had epilepsy and learning disabilities. From his sequestered isolation the prince observes the world of the 19th century melting away during the cataclysm of World War I. Written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff (''Perfect Strangers''); the cast includes a host of well-known British actors, among them Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Bill Nighy. A two-part ''Masterpiece Theater.'' PBS, Sundays at 9, Oct. 17 and 24.

THE OFFICE SPECIAL -- One more chance to see the incomparable cast of characters that made the British comedy ''The Office'' a true water-cooler show. The special picks up where the series left off, with David Brent (Ricky Gervais) begging to stay employed. (An American version of the series has been made by NBC and is expected to be on the air by next summer.) BBC America, Oct. 21 at 9.

AMNESIA -- John Hannah plays yet another detective, this one a bit less the hero, in a psychological thriller. His Inspector Stone is trying to solve the disappearance of his wife on their fifth anniversary, but another missing-person case, which involves a suspect possibly faking amnesia, complicates matters. BBC America, Oct. 25 at 8.

DRAWN TOGETHER -- Billed as the first animated ''reality'' series, the show features a cast of cartoon characters of differing styles who are thrown together in the same cartoon house, where their interactions become a cartoon adventure. Comedy Central, Wednesdays at 10:30 starting Oct. 27.

LONG WAY ROUND -- The adventures of the actor Ewan McGregor and his pal Charley Boorman as they basically circumnavigate the globe on motorcycles. They traverse nearly impossible terrain equipped with hand-held cameras to document their efforts. Bravo, Thursdays at 10 starting Oct. 28.

PEEP SHOW -- Cringe inducing, but deliberately so; comedy as only the British can do it. Two young losers' thoughts are audible, and excruciatingly embarrassing. BBC America, Thursdays at 9:30 starting Oct. 28.

November

THE YOUNG VISITERS -- An adaptation of a much-loved Victorian novel written (and misspelled) by a 9-year-old-girl, Daisy Ashford. Two men compete for the attentions of a sweet young lady. Jim Broadbent stars. BBC America, Nov. 3 at 8.

HENRY VIII -- Yet another look at the infamous monarch, this one made distinctive by an extraordinary cast headed by Ray Winstone (''Sexy Beast'') as the king and Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn. Another ''Masterpiece Theater'' entry. PBS, Sundays at 9, Nov. 7 and 14.

HUFF -- A drama series centering on a troubled psychiatrist named Craig Huffstodt. After the suicide of a patient, for which he partly blames himself, Huff re-examines all aspects of his life, his family and his career. Hank Azaria stars, with Blythe Danner as his mother. Showtime, Sundays at 10 starting Nov. 7.

THE PARTNER -- A competitive reality show in which lawyers seek a job as partner in a top firm. Two teams, one from ''elite'' schools and the other a bunch of ''street-smart'' types, compete in mock court cases that eliminate the losers. Fox, Sundays at 9 starting Nov. 7.

THEY MADE AMERICA -- Based on the book by Sir Harold Evans, the three-part series explores American innovations, ranging from jet engines to rap music to brassieres. PBS, Mondays at 9 starting Nov. 8.

THE BILLIONAIRE -- That would be Sir Richard Branson, the British tycoon of Virgin fame. In another spin on ''The Apprentice,'' he takes a group of would-be entrepreneurs on a trip around the world, dumping the losers as he goes. The format leans heavily toward the Donald Trump hit as the contestants face business challenges geared to test their mettle -- and succeed or fail on whether they impress Sir Richard. Fox, Tuesdays at 8 starting Nov. 9.

HOUSE -- More medical drama, more unexplained mysteries, another show much like others. This one focuses on an individual doctor, played by Hugh Laurie, who is part curmudgeon and all genius. His faithful team would follow him anywhere. Fox, Tuesdays at 9 starting Nov. 16.

THE CONTENDER -- Two months after Fox stole a march on NBC with its boxing series (''The Next Great Champ''), more snarling between the two networks is guaranteed as this offering goes head to head with the Branson show. It has an impressive pedigree, with the reality guru Mark Burnett, the DreamWorks mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, Sylvester Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard overseeing a boxing tournament that incorporates the personal stories of the competitors. NBC, Tuesdays at 8 starting in November.

December

PROJECT RUNWAY -- Another reality competition, this time among would-be fashion designers. They get their chance to design their way to fame and fortune, with a panel of judges from the industry, led by the model Heidi Klum, deciding their fate. Bravo, Wednesdays at 10 starting Dec. 1.

HEADLINE: Memories in High Relief

BYLINE: By JAMES E. YOUNG. 
James E. Young, chairman of the department of Judaic and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is the author, most recently, of ''At Memory's Edge.'' He served on the World Trade Center Memorial design jury.

 BODY:
WHILE a lot of attention has been paid to the 9/11 memorial in Lower Manhattan, not enough has been focused on the memorials that are springing up throughout Long Island, Westchester and New Jersey. That's a shame, because each has a special importance. And with each new design or proposal, more questions arise: When are there enough memorials? Does every town have to have its own? 
 In the face of difficult, even combative discussions about the design and location of memorials, some even voice the fear that the very memorials they hope will unite a community around its grief have actually become divisive and alienating, an unseemly airing of local political laundry. 
 Take Chappaqua, N.Y.. While the town has now decided to build a memorial to the three residents who were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, it took a year, a lawsuit (which was eventually thrown out) and much discussion for the townspeople to come to that decision. Naturally, no one wanted to be seen as against a memorial, but many had legitimate concerns about the proposed location and the traffic it might bring. Others argued that the proposed design, which included steel beams from the World Trade Center, was too graphic and offensive. 
 It might be helpful for those feeling bruised by the Chappaqua debate to remember that memorialization is a long and sometimes agonizing process, one that began immediately after the towers fell back in September 2001. The first memorials to the 9/11 attacks and their victims came in the posted fliers of the missing, the candles and vigils at Union Square, on the Esplanade in Brooklyn Heights, and elsewhere around the city. These photos and descriptions of loved ones were the first spontaneous commemorations of loss and grief. With their pictures and descriptions of loving fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, these fliers read almost as epitaphs on paper instead of stone, as perishable and transitory as the hope that inspired them. These families' missing loved ones were, in turn, remembered and mourned by all who came across these ''found memorials.'' 
 Further stages of memorialization included the ever-changing landscape of destruction at ground zero. Where the seven-story mountain of tangled and jutting ruins stood literally as a remnant of the ferocity of the attack and mass death, the gigantic hole in the ground now stands literally for the immeasurable void left in our lives and hearts, an open wound in the cityscape.
 The feverish pace of attempted rescue and cleanup leading to the brink of rebuilding downtown bespeaks the need of all to remember this terrible breach by repairing it. Indeed, many still feel that the best memorial to those who died on Sept. 11 is the rebuilding of the site itself, a place where lives lost would be commemorated by new buildings and new lives lived. 
 From the outset, however, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has wisely taken a long and capacious view of its mission, which might be summarized in its motto, ''Remember, Rebuild, Renew.'' What has also become clear in all of these memorials -- from Michael Arad and Peter Walker's winning design for ground zero to Frederic Schwartz's sublime sculptural assembly of ascending steel rods in Valhalla, N.Y., to the commemorative scattering of petals in the surf at Point Lookout Park on Long Island's South Shore -- is that the memorialization of the 9/11 attacks and their victims must be seen as a process, a process that is in many ways the life-blood of memory itself. 
 For as a process, every memorial demands its own space and time, its own competition, its own debate and negotiated result. As a process, the memorial is animated and sustained by the public give and take, the debates, the constant working through. 
 In this view, the welcome advent of memorials to the victims of the 9/11 attacks in every borough of the city, as well as in nearly every neighboring suburb, is perfectly understandable. From New York City to Westchester to Long Island and New Jersey, every community deserves its own memorial, one that reflects its particular losses, ways of mourning and understanding of these terrible events. 
 Memory is necessarily repetitive, but these memorials are anything but redundant. Each should have its own process, one that is as messy and noisy as the next. Despite the well-intentioned offers to unify the necessarily disparate memories of different regions with 9/11 icons (like the twin beams or steel fragments of the towers), every community must take the time to find its own expression, on its own terms. 
 Some will conduct full-scale competitions, and others will invite native artists to help them articulate their grief. But if all see their memorials as processes, each a part of an overarching process larger than themselves, all will give themselves room to remember as they see fit. 
 After all, these 9/11 memorials are both personal and public, individual and communal. In the spaces of these memorials, mourners come to remember the victims of 9/11 together -- and separately. There will always be room in these memorials for both kinds of memory.

HEADLINE: College Bound Doesn't Mean Far From Home

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
FOR decades, when the state's high school graduates went off to college, most headed out of state, going to Boston, New York and Washington. But in the last few years that exodus has slowed and now more graduating high school seniors are attending colleges in the state than out, boosting admissions at such colleges as the University of Connecticut, Quinnipiac University and at community colleges.
 At UConn, for example, where in-state tuition is $14,894 (including room, board and fees), Connecticut students have been applying in record numbers in the past few years, making it their No. 1 destination. Quinnipiac attracted a greater number of state students than any private college in the state, with about 20 percent, or 300 students, of its current freshman class of 1,350 coming from Connecticut.
 In all, of the 24,689 graduating high school students who planned to go to college in 2002, the latest year numbers were available, 13,935, or 56 percent, planned to stay in Connecticut, according to the State Department of Education. In 2000, 52 percent stayed local, the first time since officials began tracking students about 20 years ago that more remained in Connecticut than left. And state education officials said the trend is continuing. 
 ''The face of higher education has been restored in Connecticut,'' said Valerie Lewis, commissioner for the State Department of Higher Education. ''What you see makes an impression. Our whole higher education system is working toward quality to back up the good impression. But what UConn has going for it, besides being bigger and better, is its national branding by virtue of its basketball success.'' 
 According to the education department, Central Connecticut State University is second to UConn in the number of incoming freshmen from the state. The other state public colleges in the top five are Southern Connecticut State University, Eastern Connecticut State University and Gateway Community College.
 The top five private in-state colleges for Connecticut high-school graduates are Quinnipiac, the University of Hartford, the University of New Haven, Fairfield University and Sacred Heart University. Northeastern University in Boston was the top out-of-state college for state residents.
 Community colleges have also been gaining students over the past several years. Statistics from the education department showed a 5 percent increase in the number of state students attending community colleges in the state, rising from 4,181 in 2002 to 4,401 in 2003. For example, at Housatonic Valley Regional High School in Falls Village, a school that covers six towns, the largest geographic region of any high school in the state, 19 students, almost 15 percent of the 126 seniors who graduated from the school this year, are attending Northwestern Connecticut Community College in Winsted. 
 ''I think students nowadays are a little bit more mature about finances in their family,'' said Ronnie Santorelli, director of guidance at the high school. ''They're making more informed decisions and they are being more practical. Many students are working part-time jobs to help pay for their education and still continue to go on.''
 But not only economically diverse schools are filling the state's community college campuses. Greenwich High School, which saw about three dozen of its 533 graduates in 2003 attend Ivy League schools, also sent 57 to Norwalk Community College. 
 Ms. Lewis said she attributed the increase in interest in community colleges as part of a trickle-down effect relating to college attendance in general.
 ''There is more competition to get into the most selective colleges, and this business of seeing more full-time traditional-aged students in the community colleges suggests that fewer students are able to pay for their places in our four-year institutions,'' she said. ''We have one of the highest college-going rates in the nation. More people want a college education and more people need a college education to survive in the workplace. We've turned a corner in Connecticut: We have the highest number of community college students and the highest number of full-time students attending community college than we've ever seen.''
 According to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, Connecticut ranked sixth, tied with Rhode Island, in 2002 for the percentage of high-school graduates who attended college. North Dakota was first.
 Yale University, the state's one Ivy League college, has pretty consistently accepted fewer than 100 state students to its freshman class over the last few years. Although Yale, where tuition (including room, board and fees) is $38,850, came in at No. 45 on the list of colleges where Connecticut students wanted their SAT scores sent this year, 86 state students were accepted to its freshman class of 1,312. In 1995, 88 students from Connecticut were accepted, 87 in 1998, and 98 in 2001, according to statistics from the university's public information office.
 Quinnipiac, the private college with the most state students, said more people are hearing about the school and that has increased applications.
 ''We've held that distinction for a few years, and part of that reason is that Quinnipiac has become much better-known in the state,'' Joan Isaac-Mohr, dean of admissions at Quinnipiac, said. ''It is all as a result of our marketing efforts, increased awareness, and familiarity with the college through things like our polling institute.''
 Jessica L. Garcia of Shelton, recently graduated from Notre Dame Catholic High School in Fairfield, chose Quinnipiac. She had considered the University of Connecticut, Southern Connecticut State University and Eastern Connecticut State. As an only child, she wanted to stay close to home. ''I like that Quinnipiac is growing, and I like its academics,'' said Ms. Garcia, who plans to major in sociology. ''And I like that it was popular among my fellow students.''
 Guidance counselors also said a shift from a focus on a liberal arts education to one that combines the liberal arts and co-op education, involving practical experience, is one reason that an increasing number of students are choosing Quinnipiac and Northeastern. 
 ''I think students are looking for value, for the school that is going to give them experience that can be translated into the job market shortly after graduation,'' said Carolyn Baker, a veteran guidance counselor at Greenwich High School. ''You're finding a lot of students choosing the business field who want good internship and co-op work experiences, and that's the pull that Northeastern has. It was one of the first schools in this area to really promote the co-op experience, so when a student graduates they actually have a resume.'' 
 Northeastern, where tuition is $36,946 (including room, board and fees) a year, drew 276 students from Connecticut to its incoming class, out of a total of 2,800 freshmen, the top out-of-state choice for Connecticut students. The university, which was for many years primarily a Boston-area commuter college, added 10 new residence halls and is building more. The focus on housing and on co-op education, along with the university's location by the Museum of Fine Arts, down the street from Symphony Hall and a few blocks from Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox, has increased the number of freshman applications, said David Hautanen, senior associate director of admissions at the university.
 ''The campus has undergone an amazing renovation,'' Mr. Hautanen said. ''Our educational model of practice-oriented education and the fact that we're located in America's college town with the ability to guarantee housing for three years has changed the perception of this university. When people come to visit, they are blown away.''
 Steve Lin, who graduated this year from Glastonbury High School, applied to Harvard, Boston University and the University of California at Berkeley. He chose Harvard, partly because of its Boston location.
 ''I wanted to be in a place where there were a lot of other schools,'' Mr. Lin said. ''I'd say Harvard is in the ideal location, with the ability to interact with other colleges. There are just so many schools in Boston.''
 Jan Fuller, who until recently was director of college counseling at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, noticed that students were leaning in the past few years toward urban campuses.
 ''Students cited an abundance of cultural offerings all the way to better internship opportunities as reasons,'' Ms. Fuller said. ''The most competitive city universities are trendy, at least among the most recent Miss Porter's graduates.''
 Lisa Swanson of Manchester is a 2004 Miss Porter's graduate who wanted to attend college in a large city with a diverse population. She chose George Washington University, a few streets from the White House, the only school outside the New England-New York area that ranked in the top 45 for attendance by Connecticut high-school graduates. 
 ''I concentrated on New York, Philadelphia, Washington,'' Ms. Swanson said. ''Neither of my parents had gone to college, so this was brand-new to me and to them. They basically let me go with what I wanted. They wanted me to stay close to home, and they were a little uncomfortable with my choice at first, but they realized I loved the school.''
 George Washington University does have a Connecticut connection, which may partly explain its popularity with Connecticut students, said Michael J. O'Leary, the senior associate director of undergraduate admissions at George Washington. Its president, Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, is a former president of the University of Hartford. 
 ''Students typically will go away to school within a 300-to 500-mile radius from home,'' Mr. O'Leary said. ''We draw heavily from the Northeast corridor, but we get 100 freshmen from California as well. Our reputation, our location, our scope of academic programs are attractive to students from Connecticut who may think that Boston and New York are too close to home.''
 Still, George Washington University is an anomaly for Connecticut high school graduates, who tend to stay near Connecticut, if not in Connecticut.
 ''Kids are not as adventurous as I saw 15 years ago, when they were willing to pick a school in Iowa,'' said Ms. Baker of Greenwich High School. ''Although we have a number of students choosing schools in those areas, I think that students are a little bit more concerned about maintaining that close tie to family, being able to get home quickly. That could be reflective of the state of our society today, that students are a little bit more anxious. I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Benefit From the Cooling of Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Falling oil prices helped buoy the stock market in four days of trading last week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest point since July 2. 
 All three major indexes gained for the week, which was shortened by the Labor Day holiday on Monday. 
 Crude oil fell on Friday to $42.81 a barrel in New York, its lowest level since August. That encouraged stock traders, as did a government report that showed that the producer price index, a measure of inflation, declined unexpectedly last month. Earlier in the week, on Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the economic expansion had ''regained some traction,'' which some investors took to signify an extended period of restraint by the Fed, which has begun to raise short-term interest rates. 
 The biggest gainer for the week in the S.&P. 500 was Calpine, the electric power producer. It rose 14.5 percent. 
 For the week, the S.&P. 500 rose 10.29 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,123.92. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 52.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 10,313.07. The Nasdaq composite index gained 49.83 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 1,894.31. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.19 percent from 4.29 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Employment by Dogma? Lay Teachers Challenge Catholic Church

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Church has a long history of supporting the rights of workers in fields and factories around the world. But in Brooklyn and Queens, teachers at five Catholic schools insist that the church has ignored its own tenets of social justice by engaging in unfair labor practices against their union, and New York State has backed up the charge with a complaint against the Brooklyn diocese.
 The Federation of Catholic Teachers has accused officials of the Diocese of Brooklyn with negotiating in bad faith after failing to reach a contract despite more than 62 bargaining sessions over the last two and a half years. The union persuaded state labor officials to issue a complaint against the diocese, and faced with the possibility of sanctions, the diocese agreed on Thursday to third-party mediation.
 The impasse in the Brooklyn Diocese, where about 145 other Catholic schools remain without a union, presents a problem for a church with a tradition of social justice teachings that uphold not only the right to unionize, but also an employer's duty to pay a just wage. Those ideals are bumping up uncomfortably against the economic realities of declining enrollments, shrinking budgets and closings. 
 From Brooklyn to Boston and St. Louis to Philadelphia, labor groups representing teachers and other employees at Catholic schools accuse the church of holding secular employers to a higher standard than its own. They say the church makes major workplace changes with little consultation, as if it were issuing decrees. In some cases, church officials have insisted that the separation of church and state exempts them from government oversight. 
 ''The way we're being treated negates everything they say,'' said Maura Nolan, a teacher at St. Gregory the Great in Bellerose, Queens. ''If they can't treat their own people in a respectful manner, who are they to preach to other companies and employers about worker rights?''
 Teachers at several schools in Brooklyn and Queens said that they reached out to the union, the Federation of Catholic Teachers, in late 2001, after the diocese had summoned them to meetings in which they were told their share of health care costs was to increase. The union, which already represented about 3,500 teachers in the neighboring New York Archdiocese, eventually won elections in five schools.
 But from the beginning, union officials said, the negotiations were far from smooth, as the diocese first insisted on individual bargaining sessions at each school. The talks, which teachers and union officials said began with dire warnings of school closings, broke down over health care costs and salary increases. 
 Frank de Rosa, the spokesman for the Brooklyn Diocese, faulted the union for being inflexible, and warned that its demands could make it impossible to keep some schools open. 
 ''The schools want a fair contract,'' he said. ''But it has to be reasonable. In any negotiation, the objective is to keep the schools open. These are critical issues.'' A continuing decline in religious vocations has resulted in a greater reliance on lay teachers, whose salaries and benefits cost more than those for members of religious orders who teach as part of their mission. Building upkeep and other operating expenses can present a burden to less affluent parishes, too. And as with many employers in the secular world, the church is challenged by increased health care costs.
 Mr. de Rosa added that while some may have accused the church of not heeding its own teachings on social justice, he was confident that the diocese was consistent with its teachings. ''In terms of social justice, what is required is that all parties work out something reasonable,'' he said. ''Keep in mind, too, the parents of the kids need to have their concerns met so they are not priced out of a school.''
 The union has taken as its beginning position that the teachers not be asked to contribute to their health coverage. At the same time, they said they would be flexible if a salary increase were sufficient to cover any additional health care contribution. Teachers with 15 years of experience earn a little less than $40,000 a year. The union's latest proposal seeks a raise of a little more than 7 percent. 
 The union said the diocesan proposals not only offered less money, but made greater demands on teachers' time and duties compared with teachers in non-union schools. 
 ''We believe they wanted to set up a circumstance where we had inferior conditions,'' said Richard Lanigan, the secretary treasurer of Local 153 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union, which is bargaining for the teachers. ''It is basic union busting.''
 Frustrated by the delays, the union successfully petitioned the New York State Employment Relations Board to issue a complaint against the diocese for unnecessarily dragging out the negotiations and offering less to the union than to other teachers.
 While church teachings do not mandate unions, they have supported the right to join them as a way of both ensuring the dignity of employees and giving them a level of bargaining power. Stephen J. Pope, who teaches moral theology at Boston College, said that much of it was laid out in 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, whose encyclical on capital and labor, ''Rerum Novarum,'' tried to show how capitalism could produce a just economic system. The centerpiece, Mr. Pope said, was the concept of a just wage. ''A worker has to be able to support himself and his family,'' Mr. Pope said. ''That includes not only wages now, but also an array of benefits and rights including health care, dental care, a right to occupational work safety.''
 Redefining that to keep up with today's economy has not been easy. Mr. Pope speaks from experience, since his wife teaches in a Catholic school in Boston, as he once did.
 ''If I still did we would not be able to afford a house,'' he said. 
 Georgette Adams, who taught physical education at St. Bartholomew's in Elmhurst, Queens, said most experienced teachers make tremendous sacrifices to stay in Catholic schools because they want to teach in a system that places a premium on religious values. But the financial demands of maintaining a family can discourage teachers after a few years.
 ''As you stay in the system you start to feel that they really don't want you to stay,'' she said. ''Your salary does not go up. When it comes close to retirement there is no more medical coverage. So after years of putting in a career, you retire and the pension is very small, so you can't even afford medical coverage.''
 While American bishops have called for equitable health care in general, it does pose a challenge in practice within the church. 
 ''By any reckoning, people who have given 30, 40 years of their lives to the Catholic schools shouldn't be abandoned by the church when they come to a point of their lives most in need of medical care,'' Mr. Pope said. ''Hopefully, the diocese is not just committed to teachers as employers but as human beings, so the relationship does not end as soon as the person stops teaching.''
 Some religious orders have realized that the question of offering salaries and benefits similar to public schools is not just a question of justice but of quality and survival. Doing so could render moot the question of whether or not to unionize. The Rev. John Coleman, a Jesuit who teaches social justice at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, said his order came to realize that the success of its educational mission depended on its lay faculty.
 ''We may not be able to give everything, but we have to have commensurate pensions, benefits and salaries,'' he said. ''The point being that to keep good high school teachers demands that you provide that sort of thing. The employer, the Jesuits, saw that for these schools to flourish, having a turnover of good teachers every four years is not a good thing.''

HEADLINE: The Best Film With the Smallest Release

BYLINE: By NATHAN LEE

 BODY:
WHEN historians of the future look back on the current movie scene, they will note the presence of giants among us, and marvel that they passed by so little noticed. On the film festival circuit and in the pages of serious film magazines, the names are already legend, but in what remains of the art-house culture in America, their reputations are barely a whisper. Wong Kar-wai, Jia Zhangke, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Ming-liang: the great foreign filmmakers of our time sound more foreign than ever.
 If we have learned, at least, the first name in this pantheon -- no one who has seen ''In the Mood for Love'' could ever forget the man behind such voluptuous romanticism -- we're still fumbling with Jia Zhangke, whose piercing vision of young Chinese negotiating cultural shift on the mainland (''Platform,'' ''Unknown Pleasures'') humbles the Sundance solipsism of our home-grown independents. There is a good reason an ardent coterie speaks of Hou Hsiao-hsien as passionately as they might of Hitchcock: ''Flowers of Shanghai,'' his dreamlike evocation of a 19th-century brothel, is an obsessive masterpiece to rank with ''Vertigo.'' And there's an even better reason this remains a minority view: Mr. Hou has seen exactly one of his films properly distributed in the United States. 
 Tsai Ming-liang, whose latest film opens Friday, has fared slightly better. About a year after its highly acclaimed local premiere at the New York Film Festival, ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' is finally getting a commercial run, at the Cinema Village. Almost all of Mr. Tsai's features have received limited theatrical runs, and the adventurous distributor Wellspring keeps them available on DVD. 
 Will ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn,'' arguably the greatest film ever made about moviegoing, finally imprint those four syllables in the minds of moviegoers? It's certainly not his most accessible picture. Like the methodical ''Platform'' and the hermetic ''Flowers of Shanghai,'' this subtle work makes unusual demands on the viewer.
 Clocking in at just over 80 minutes, the modestly scaled ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' doesn't sound like much of a challenge to audiences. Set almost entirely inside a decrepit Taipei movie house during its final show (a screening of the classic swordplay flick ''Dragon Inn''), the film is steeped in pleasant melancholia and wistful cinephilia. But with no more than a sprinkling of dialogue, the slimmest of plots and scarcely a camera movement in sight, it prizes quiet over clamor, stillness over spectacle and reflection over stimulation.
 Yet, for all of the demands of its style, it is immediately recognizable as a variation on a familiar genre, the study in ''urban alienation.'' What slowly becomes apparent is that ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' is many other things as well: a poem of erotic triangulation, a deadpan comedy paced like peeling wallpaper, a subtle Buddhist ghost story. The cumulative effect is far from alienating; Mr. Tsai's sixth feature is as gentle and generous as movies come -- once you've learned to speak its language.
 The first step toward fluency is to adjust your sense of rhythm and tone: ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' brings to perfection one of the most exacting visual styles in contemporary movies -- it's minimalism to the max. Mr. Tsai arranges his material into meticulous horizontal compositions (not unlike certain late Jasper Johns paintings), then contemplates them over several minutes from a medium-to-far distance. His first four films, at least, are full of movement, but the glacial elegance of his pans and tracking shots gives an overall impression of stasis.
 Once you've become accustomed to Mr. Tsai's voice, it might help to look into his previous usage: complete in itself, ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' nevertheless gains significant resonance through familiarity with the faces, themes and ideas of the Tsai oeuvre. ''Rebels of a Neon God,'' ''Vive l'Amour,'' ''The River,'' ''The Hole,'' ''What Time Is It There?'' and ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' constitute a beguiling achievement -- a suite of tragicomedies about metropolitan life from the mind of a scrupulous gay minimalist with Buddhist tendencies and an obsessive fixation on the metaphorical possibilities of water. Taken together, they create an irreducibly strange yet coherent universe.
 At the center of this universe rests the actor Lee Kang-sheng. Usually playing the reticent, beleaguered Hsiao Kang, he serves as a surrogate for the director, an object of contemplation and something of a pinup (Mr. Lee in tighty whities is one of Mr. Tsai's most dependable motifs). Hsiao Kang has been compared to that better-known directorial surrogate, Antoine Doinel in the semiautobiographical films of Francois Truffaut. But this listless, impassive hero deadpans his way through these pictures more like a busted Buster Keaton.
 In ''Rebels of the Neon God,'' he is a troubled dropout acting under the influence of his simmering sexual identity; among other things, Mr. Tsai's debut film is a not-quite-coming-out story. In ''Vive l'Amour'' Hsiao Kang is a salesman of crematorium urns who finds himself caught up in a kind of low-rent slow-motion sex farce; among other things, Mr. Tsai's second film is an oblique study of the marginally employed.
 Hsiao Kang goes from anxious to agonized in the third film, Mr. Tsai's bold masterwork ''The River.'' Hsiao Kang, now unemployed (or so it seems: the films are structured around absences and ambiguities), becomes afflicted with an excruciating neck condition. Various cures prove ineffective until he seeks alleviation in the dark, steam-filled chambers of a gay bathhouse, where, in a nightmare tableau, he grapples with his own father.
 True relief finally (almost?) arrives with the song and dance numbers of ''The Hole,'' an apocalyptic musical -- you heard right -- about two lonely neighbors joined in unexpected intimacy by a plumber's goof.
 And the fifth film, ''What Time Is It There?,'' finds Hsiao Kang dividing his time between vending cheap watches on a pedestrian skywalk and obsessively setting every clock in Taipei to Paris time in a kind of abstract solidarity with one of his vacationing customers. 
 Mr. Lee is only the most persistent figure in Mr. Tsai's stock company. The squinty actor Miao Tien has three times played Hsaio Kang's implacable father. Together with Lu Yi-ching as his superstitious mother, an enormous tropical fish named Fatty and a couple of cockroaches, they form an entropic nuclear family that Mr. Tsai returns to again and again.
 Although the father character dies in the first scene of ''What Time Is It There?,'' there's every reason to suspect he'll be back, in one form or another, in Mr. Tsai's next feature, ''A Cloud at the Edge of the Sky.'' After all, in the final image of ''Time,'' he has rematerialized poolside in a Paris park, with a mischievous glint in his eye.
 Mr. Tsai's characters are never far from water. It pours down from clouds, gurgles up from drains, nourishes potted plants, oozes rot into shabby sheetrock walls. People drink it, bathe in it, monitor its evaporation rate (to check for the presence of thirsty ghosts) and urinate it with memorable on-screen frequency. Mr. Tsai never lets us forget that we're largely made up of the stuff: Simply put, his movies are about thirsty people trying to stay dry, and that's about as sly a way of expressing the human condition as a filmmaker has come up with. 
 In ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn,'' the movie theater provides shelter from the storm outside -- an indication that Mr. Tsai is addressing his audience with newfound directness. His characters are often encountered in movie theaters, as well as public restrooms, elevators, cheap hotels, hallways and other anonymous zones in the urban landscape. As Kent Jones notes in his perceptive essay ''Here and There: The Films of Tsai Ming-liang,'' the director's observation of city life is focused on places where the public and private commingle and the psycho social energies that course through them. ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' adjusts this attention to a laser point, stepping outdoors only once, in the final image.
 As the film begins, a silent cashier (Chen Shiang-chyi) sits sequestered in her box office plucking morsels off a pink pork bun. After carefully wrapping the unfinished half, she tramps through the damp corridors of the theater, her clubfoot sounding a rueful click-clomp against the muffled soundtrack of the movie playing on the screen. Ascending to the projection booth, she finds it empty and leaves the gift behind. This takes the better part of 10 minutes and constitutes one of the film's major plot developments: ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' attenuates narrative incident until it nearly evaporates off the screen. Mr. Tsai's famously long takes now stretch a tentative hand toward eternity -- all of which is appropriate for a ghost story set in a movie theater. 
 As the cashier completes her miniature odyssey, a young Japanese man (Kiyonobu Mitamura) squirms in his seat, not watching ''Dragon Inn.'' He's distracted by two lipsmacking patrons on his left, a pair of bare feet dangling over the seat to his right and the various gay men cruising the room. The art of cruising -- a silent seduction of the glance, fraught with anxiety, sent out to clarify identity -- is another of Mr. Tsai's original themes. The extraordinary insight of ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' is to conflate this erotic mode with the tender supplication of moviegoing itself.
 Careful eyes will note that the film begins with a shot of a capacity audience that has mysteriously vanished when we next peek inside. This is a room full of ghosts. Present in the audience are several of the actors who are on screen in ''Dragon Inn,'' including, of all people, Hsiao Kang's father, Miao Tien. There is also a woman who appears to have been eating sunflower seeds forever, to judge by the evidence scattered on the floor. And Hsiao Kang? It wouldn't do to spoil one of the most delightful ideas in all of Tsai. Suffice it to say, he ends up the ''hero'' once again. 
 Is it all so difficult? No one goes into an exhibit of abstract art grousing about the lack of subject: you won't get much from this delicate movie if you wonder why nothing's happening. Relax your expectations of how fast a plot should move -- or, really, whether there must be a plot at all -- and you may feel your imagination reaching deep into the quiet, open spaces of ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn.'' And what you find there is your self, in the act of watching a movie -- and maybe the cute person checking you out across the aisle.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, part of the final sentence was omitted in an article last Sunday about the Taiwan director Tsai Ming-liang, whose film ''Goodbye, Dragon Inn'' is set in a theater that is showing its last movie. The article should have ended: ''Relax your expectations of how fast a plot should move -- or, really, whether there must be a plot at all -- and you may feel your imagination reaching deep into the quiet, open spaces of 'Goodbye, Dragon Inn.' And what you find there is your self, in the act of watching a movie -- and maybe the cute person checking you out across the aisle.''

HEADLINE: Memories in High Relief

BYLINE: By JAMES E. YOUNG. 
James E. Young, chairman of the department of Judaic and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is the author, most recently, of ''At Memory's Edge.'' He served on the World Trade Center Memorial design jury.

 BODY:
While a lot of attention has been paid to the 9/11 memorial in Lower Manhattan, not enough has been focused on the memorials that are springing up throughout Long Island, Westchester and New Jersey. That's a shame, because each has a special importance. And with each new design or proposal, more questions arise: When are there enough memorials? Does every town have to have its own? 
 In the face of difficult, even combative discussions about the design and location of memorials, some even voice the fear that the very memorials they hope will unite a community around its grief have actually become divisive and alienating, an unseemly airing of local political laundry. 
 Take Chappaqua, N.Y.. While the town has now decided to build a memorial to the three residents who were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, it took a year, a lawsuit (which was eventually thrown out) and much discussion for the townspeople to come to that decision. Naturally, no one wanted to be seen as against a memorial, but many had legitimate concerns about the proposed location and the traffic it might bring. Others argued that the proposed design, which included steel beams from the World Trade Center, was too graphic and offensive. 
 It might be helpful for those feeling bruised by the Chappaqua debate to remember that memorialization is a long and sometimes agonizing process, one that began immediately after the towers fell in September 2001. The first memorials to the 9/11 attacks and their victims came in the posted fliers of the missing, the candles and vigils at Union Square, on the Esplanade in Brooklyn Heights, and elsewhere around the city.
 These photos and descriptions of loved ones were the first spontaneous commemorations of loss and grief. With their pictures and descriptions of loving fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, these fliers read almost as epitaphs on paper instead of stone, as perishable and transitory as the hope that inspired them. These families' missing loved ones were, in turn, remembered and mourned by all who came across these ''found memorials.'' 
 Further stages of memorialization included the ever-changing landscape of destruction at ground zero. Where the seven-story mountain of tangled and jutting ruins stood literally as a remnant of the ferocity of the attack and mass death, the gigantic hole in the ground now stands literally for the immeasurable void left in our lives and hearts, an open wound in the cityscape.
 The feverish pace of attempted rescue and clean-up leading to the brink of rebuilding downtown bespeaks the need of all to remember this terrible breach by repairing it. Indeed, many still feel that the best memorial to those who died on Sept. 11 is the rebuilding of the site itself, a place where lives lost would be commemorated by new buildings and new lives lived. 
 From the outset, however, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has wisely taken a long and capacious view of its mission, which might be summarized in its motto, ''Remember, Rebuild, Renew.'' What has also become clear in all of these memorials -- from Michael Arad and Peter Walker's winning design for ground zero to Frederic Schwartz's sublime sculptural assembly of ascending steel rods in Valhalla, N.Y., to the commemorative scattering of petals in the surf at Point Lookout Park on Long Island's South Shore -- is that the memorialization of the 9/11 attacks and their victims must be seen as a process, a process that is in many ways the life-blood of memory itself. 
 For as a process, every memorial demands its own space and time, its own competition, its own debate and negotiated result. As a process, the memorial is animated and sustained by the public give and take, the debates, the constant working through. 
 In this view, the welcome advent of memorials to the victims of the 9/11 attacks in every borough of the city, as well as in nearly every neighboring suburb, is perfectly understandable. From New York City to Westchester to Long Island and New Jersey, every community deserves its own memorial, one that reflects its particular losses, ways of mourning and understanding of these terrible events. 
 Memory is necessarily repetitive, but these memorials are anything but redundant. Each should have its own process, one that is as messy and noisy as the next. Despite the well-intentioned offers to unify the necessarily disparate memories of different regions with 9/11 icons (like the twin beams or steel fragments of the towers), every community must take the time to find its own expression, on its own terms. 
 Some will conduct full-scale competitions, and others will invite native artists to help them articulate their grief. But if all see their memorials as processes, each a part of an over-arching process larger than themselves, all will give themselves room to remember as they see fit. 
 After all, these 9/11 memorials are both personal and public, individual and communal. In the spaces of these memorials, mourners come to remember the victims of 9/11 together -- and separately. There will always be room in these memorials for both kinds of memory.

HEADLINE: Downside As Deficit Deepens

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A GOVERNMENT report on Tuesday about the current account deficit for the second quarter is likely to prompt new concerns about the value of the dollar. 
 The current account measures the country's balance of trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. It is expected to be a deficit of $158 billion for the second quarter, raising the total for the first six months of the year to about $303 billion, more than 11 percent higher than the deficit for the first six months of 2003. 
 At that rate, the deficit could top $600 billion for the year, swamping the record of $531 billion set last year.
 Currency strategists worry that the deficit must be covered by money from abroad, and that if this flow slows down, interest rates may go higher and the dollar lower.
 Despite the growth in the deficit, the dollar has been relatively stable for the last several months; it is actually up for the year against both the euro and the Japanese yen -- maybe because the foreign funds flow into the United States has been speeding up, not slowing down. 
 In the first six months of the year, foreigners bought a net $440.5 billion of American stocks and bonds, up from $326.3 billion in the first six months of 2003, according to Treasury Department figures adjusted to fully reflect the net inflow of foreign money.
 That flow is well ahead of the size of the current account deficit. But one major concern is that a large part of this money is coming from foreign central banks, especially those in China and Japan.
 So far this year, official foreign institutions, which include central banks, have bought 30 percent, or $150.6 billion, of the $504.3 billion that foreigners spent on United States Treasury, agency and corporate bonds, before special adjustments. That is up from $56.1 billion, or 15.6 percent, in the first six months of 2003.
 Just going back to the 2003 pace would lower the adjusted inflow to about $370 billion, so a change in the appetite of other foreign investors could quickly make the current account deficit very troubling.

DATA RUSH -- This week's data will provide a broad measure of the economy's well-being. A report on Tuesday on August retail sales is expected to show a decline of 0.1 percent, according to Bloomberg News, but that is mostly because of a slowdown in auto sales. Retail sales, excluding autos, are expected to rise 0.2 percent, matching the July gain.
 Industrial production for August, to be reported Wednesday, is expected to show a jump of 0.5 percent, after a 0.4 percent climb in July. The Consumer Price Index for August, due on Thursday, is predicted to rise 0.2 percent, after a 0.1 percent decline in July.

LOOT: And Other Stories, by Nadine Gordimer. (Penguin, $14.) This structurally diverse collection, Gordimer's first since 1991, the year she won the Nobel Prize, offers portraits of characters bowed by the complicated burden of loss. In the title story, set in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, tragedy and opportunity present themselves in equal measure. ''At times ironic, at others enraged, defiant or rueful, the work gathered here reflects the unflinching ferocity of its author's imagination,'' Claire Messud said in the Book Review last year.

WHERE I WAS FROM, by Joan Didion. (Vintage International, $13.95.) In a radically revisionary book, Didion combines history and reportage, memoir and literary criticism, to reassess her home state, California. She now sees the state's past, which she once mythologized, as a saga of ruthless self-sufficiency. Thomas Mallon, writing in the Book Review in 2003, called it ''a fascinating gloss'' on Didion's earlier writings, ''something that will be appreciated especially by longtime admirers.''

ON THE NATURE OF HUMAN ROMANTIC INTERACTION, by Karl Iagnemma. (Delta, $13.) Art imitates oddly specific lives in this debut collection of short stories. Iagnemma, a recipient of a Pushcart Prize, is also a robotics researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; his characters, all scientists, wrestle with love and life outside academia (one tries unsuccessfully to diagram his relationship with his girlfriend). Last year our reviewer, Jim Holt, found these stories ''richly imagined and laced with delicate ironies.''

CITY OF GLASS, by Paul Auster. Adaptation by Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli. (Picador, $14.) Ten years ago Karasik and Mazzucchelli reinvented Auster's 1985 existentialist mystery as a graphic novel, which deepened its noir-inflected darkness. In a 1998 essay in the Book Review, Tom De Haven called Mazzucchelli's blunt, bold lines ''formally brilliant.'' This edition includes a new introduction by Art Spiegelman.

JUST WAR AGAINST TERROR: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World, by Jean Bethke Elshtain. (Basic Books, $14.) Elshtain, a professor of ethics at the University of Chicago, advocates an ethic of responsibility in pursuing a ''just war'' on terrorism. Her treatise leaves behind ''a well-trimmed swath of intellectual clarity,'' Paul Berman wrote in these pages last year.

IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD: Tough Choices From Wall Street to Washington, by Robert E. Rubin and Jacob Weisberg. (Random House, $16.95.) As a steward of the long economic expansion of the 1990's, Rubin may be the best-known Treasury secretary since Andrew W. Mellon. This memoir recounts his early days on Wall Street before turning to the economic crises during the Clinton administration's second term. In 2003 our reviewer, David Warsh, called this ''a gem of a book.'' Rubin's isn't the only commentary on President Clinton's tumultuous second term. In THE CLINTON WARS (Plume, $18), Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential adviser from 1997 to 2001, staunchly defends the former president and first lady against the ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' that, the author argues, was all too real. Blumenthal ''brings a reporter's keen eye for telling detail and a columnist's talent for considered analysis and unmistakable opinion,'' Robert Dallek said here last year.

EMPIRE: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power, by Niall Ferguson. (Basic Books, $17.95.) The author, an eminent British historian, sees America as both the offspring of and heir to Britain's global domination and traces key features of the modern world -- capitalism, education, parliamentary democracy -- to four centuries of British expansion. ''Ferguson writes with his usual verve,'' Margaret MacMillan wrote in the Book Review last year, ''and takes a few swipes at sacred cows along the way.''

MASTER OF DREAMS: A Memoir of Isaac Bashevis Singer, by Dvorah Telushkin. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Telushkin captures the evolution of her 12-year apprenticeship to Singer -- from secretary to editor and translator -- in this series of poetic vignettes. The author, a storyteller by profession, shares the great moments in Singer's public life (as well as his private torments). Her ''lovely prose evokes the atmosphere of a vanishing way of life,'' Andrea Cooper wrote here in 1997. Ihsan Taylor

HEADLINE: In California, Students Find Housing Lucrative

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS GRUDIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
FOR about a year or so, Efren Ramirez, 20, a pre-med student at Santa Monica College, had been paying $900 a month for a small studio apartment and shared bathroom. Knowing that he had many years of school ahead, Mr. Ramirez decided that spending money on rent didn't make sense, and he started looking for an alternative. 
 Last summer, with financial assistance from his parents and his fiancee at the time, Mr. Ramirez bought a condo a mile from the U.C.L.A. campus, where he will enroll this winter. Today, because of the hot Southern California market, his modest one-bedroom unit, for which he paid $240,000, already has appreciated $110,000, and when he finds a roommate, his $1,700 mortgage payments will be halved. 
 ''A couple of years from now when I have to afford medical school, this will make it a lot easier,'' Mr. Ramirez said, strolling across the parquet flooring he recently installed in his living room. 
 Real estate agents say that parent-student buyers make up a notable contingent of the area's business. ''I get them all the time; smart people do that,'' said Coco Clayman-Cook, the assistant manager at Prudential California Realty's Beverly Hills office, who found Mr. Ramirez his condo.
 Here, and in other cities throughout the country where real estate has been a good investment, the practice seems to be growing more popular as more people decide that its economics are compelling. 
 In Westwood, the U.C.L.A. college town not far from Bel Air, Brentwood and Beverly Hills, rents for one-bedroom apartments are now about $1,500 a month. And while university administrators hope to guarantee campus housing for all undergraduates who want it, a plan to add thousands of rooms by the end of the decade could still leave about 23,000 students, graduate and undergraduate, looking for housing in Westwood and its pricey surroundings, according to Michael Foraker, director of housing at U.C.L.A. These factors, combined with California's rapidly appreciating housing market, have led real estate-savvy students and their parents to change their perspective on student housing. Instead of viewing it as a draining but necessary expense, they consider it a lucrative investment opportunity.
 ''It makes so much sense; you don't pay any rent and you make money on your investment -- you might be able to pay to put your kids through school,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, who has witnessed the same phenomenon in downtown Los Angeles near the University of Southern California.
 Likewise, a few hundred miles north, around the University of California at Berkeley, where housing prices have also skyrocketed, many students are now living in what are essentially investment properties, according to William Ktsanes, director of research and analysis for RealFacts, an apartment market research firm. ''Families looking at paying $1,500 a month for their child's apartment start considering buying a home and feel like it's a secure investment partially because it is in a college town and there will always be students that need housing there,'' he said.
 With today's low interest rates, the math works out well, provided that parents can afford the down payment on a condo, which for a one- or two-bedroom unit around U.C.L.A. would cost $350,000 to $500,000. Other considerations include homeowner's dues, property taxes and maintenance, but those expenses can be offset if the student is willing to live with a roommate or two. 
 Although Westwood real estate's recent appreciation of about 15 percent a year makes the decision to buy look particularly easy in retrospect, the market needs only moderate growth for the investment to pay off, according to Suzanne Frank, owner of Abbot Kinney Real Estate in Venice.
 Parents ''can go get a place and put in a down payment and put a few other kids in there and the other students' parents are paying their mortgage,'' said Ms. Frank, who has sold real estate on the west side of Los Angeles for 20 years. ''Not only are they going to get tax benefits, but they get the benefit of having their child living in a nice place -- their own home with their own kitchen -- and they're making money.'' 
 Emi Yoshida, 22, who graduated from U.C.L.A. in June with a double major in business economics and sociology, spent her junior and senior years living with three friends in a two-bedroom condo that her father, Michael Yoshida, bought in 2002. All of her roommates paid below-market rent and lived two to a room, just as they would have in dorms, but in this case their rent offset Mr. Yoshida's monthly costs.
 ''I was clearly comparing the numbers between paying rent versus ownership, with the potential for a selling price that would make it a smart move at the end of a couple of years,'' said Mr. Yoshida, a San Francisco architect. ''I just went through the math on my own, and given the trend of how real estate is going down there, it made sense to do this.''
 For Ms. Yoshida, who is planning to move to New York City and seek work in public health, the arrangement was not only a good investment -- her condo has appreciated more than 30 percent since 2002 -- but also her first experience as a homeowner, acting as the de facto landlord, often dealing with renters who were people she knew. ''There's a business relationship that develops that's different from a friendship,'' she said. ''There were ups and downs to having it, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.''
 Naysayers are quick to point out that students like Ms. Yoshida are missing out on an important aspect of college -- campus life. But the young homeowners are gaining a different type of education, according to Richard Pon, 24, who is working toward a doctorate in electrical engineering at U.C.L.A. In May, Mr. Pon bought a condo eight miles away, in Culver City. His one-bedroom condo looks surprisingly similar to a dormitory room, complete with dead potted plants flanking a barbecue grill on his patio and a TV blocking the fireplace.
 Mr. Pon is already beginning to understand the responsibilities, and rewards, of owning a home.
 ''If something breaks, you can't just write a letter to the management,'' he said. ''When I clean something up, I'm cleaning it up for myself. It's like, would you wash a rental car?'' 
 So far, it seems worth it to him. ''It's a lot more work,'' he said, ''but there's a lot more personal value, too -- it's exciting.''

HEADLINE: P.S.: They Left a Big Tip

BYLINE: By MARGY ROCHLIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
NO one could ever say that the Argentine actress Mia Maestro, who stars in the new movie ''Motorcycle Diaries,'' is not willing to try new things. Since she moved to Los Angeles five years ago from Buenos Aires, she has taken up boxing and barge fishing and has gone scuba diving with a school of 60 feeding sharks. 
 ''I get, like, obsessed,'' Ms. Maestro, 26, said, as she and her boyfriend, Ned Benson, 27, an actor and director, drove in their black S.U.V. from their West Hollywood apartment toward the quiet streets of downtown Los Angeles. ''When she falls in love with something new, it's incredible how much work she puts into mastering it,'' Mr. Benson said. 
 Fans of the spy series ''Alias,'' in which Ms. Maestro plays Jennifer Garner's long-lost half-sister, Nadia, already know she can sprint breathlessly and survive a mysterious green goo injection, but they might be less familiar with her cultural side. Ms. Maestro's singing became the subject of debate a half-hour later as she and Mr. Benson sat in a nook at the Golden Gopher lounge having before-dinner drinks with their friends Sarah Watson, a director at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills, and her husband, Hardy Ophuls, a television producer.
 Mr. Benson suggested that Ms. Maestro's classically trained pealing-bell soprano -- featured in movies like ''Tango'' (she also dances) and ''Timecode'' -- defines karaoke buzz kill. Ms. Maestro took a brave stab at defending her amateur-hour credentials. ''The key is always wrong,'' she said. Mr. Benson groaned affectionately. ''At least you know what a key is,'' he said.
 Five minutes later, Ms. Maestro and her gang stood tentatively in the entryway of Kokekokko, a noisy Japanese restaurant in Little Tokyo, where she had a reservation. Ms. Maestro, twice one of Maxim magazine's 100 Sexiest Women, has often played pillow-lipped hot aristocrats, like the girlfriend of Che Guevara in ''The Motorcycle Diaries.'' But when the young maitre d' kept delaying her seating, she went straight into take-charge Nadia mode.
 Striding past packed wooden tables, she peeked into an empty rice-paper-walled room, then returned for some persistent finagling. The owner acquiesced, but only very reluctantly. Off came the shoes, and on came the charm. 
 ''I so desperately want them to like us,'' admitted Ms. Watson, who took pains to say, ''Thank you!'' each time a waitress entered the private room with trays of beer, hot sake, pickled radish and skewers of vegetables and poultry. Though Kokekokko's house specialty, chicken sashimi, might sound inedible to some people, Ms. Maestro has ''bring-it-on'' taste buds. ''I've eaten grasshopper tacos, ant eggs and maguey worms,'' she said cheerfully.
 She closed her brown eyes and heaved a blissful sigh. ''I've been dreaming of eating this,'' she said, biting into chicken liver (cooked, not raw) on a stick.
 Suddenly, a loud rap was heard on the door, and the maitre d' appeared. A few minutes of tense silence passed. Later, Ms. Watson said she thought he had come to throw everybody out.
 But no. Eyes fixed on Ms. Maestro, he confessed that he had given her table to a regular customer. Then his knees hit the tatami mat for a deep, apologetic bow.
 ''It's O.K.,'' Ms. Maestro said reassuringly as he stumbled out the door. Then the room exploded in relieved laughter.
 By 11, Ms. Maestro and Mr. Benson were speeding back to West Hollywood. Ms. Maestro had to be up early enough the next day to walk her dog, River, before reporting at 5 a.m. to the set of ''Alias,'' now taping its new season. Just blocks from home, talk turned to -- what else? -- parents. Ms. Maestro's mother is a former economist; her father is a businessman in Argentina.
 Do they like her movies?
 Mr. Benson laughed, a fond yet significant laugh.
 ''They're cinephiles,'' Ms. Maestro said, ''so they critique everything, scene by scene, what they like, what they don't. I actually try to forget what they tell me.''

HEADLINE: Keeping Up With the Krogers

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
TARUNI SETH, a mother of two who lives in Berkeley Heights may not know it, but she is a hot commodity in New Jersey grocers' circles. Her family's monthly grocery bill may seem insignificant in an industry that sells tens of millions of dollars in products statewide, but because she divides her time between Stop & Shop, Whole Foods and Kings, her shopping dollars are at play. 
 And in one of the country's most hotly contested markets, not being loyal to one store is akin to being an undecided voter during an election year. Only instead of two major parties, there are at least half-dozen stores trying to gain her good graces. And instead of stump speeches, there are limitless incentives.
 If Ms. Seth made it out to the Branchburg ShopRite, for example, she would find that children under 9 who spend time in the store-staffed playhouse can get manicures. Or if she were in the Tom's River area, she would be able to use her shopping dollars at Foodtown to earn enough points for a waffle maker or a pearl necklace. 
 A bit closer to home, the Raritan Stop & Shop offers convenience rather than freebies: drivers can maneuver their minivans past the store entrance and wait while groceries that were ordered online are loaded in the back.
 These stores are no exception. Grocery stores and supermarkets across the state are seeking to lure and retain customers with promotions that go well beyond listing markdowns on store circulars. Tidy aisles have sprouted a surplus of bells and whistles, seeking to establish themselves as suburban centers where everything from day care to banking to cooking lessons are available. 
 While regional grocery retailers in other states were swallowed in the late 90's by supermarket giants like Kroger, New Jersey's powerhouse grocers -- Kings, A.&P., Pathmark, ShopRite and Foodtown all are headquartered here -- were spared, clearing the way for a statewide, share-hungry battleground among the holdouts in a state that experts say has a particularly tight market. Larger chains with headquarters elsewhere have joined the fray as well in a bid to outdo their New Jersey-based competitors. The result: a dizzying flurry of supermarket enhancements that shows no sign of letting up. 
 While that may be something of a victory for the shoppers, it is a sign that the battle continues among a crowded field of grocery store and supermarket owners.
 ''It's become way more difficult,'' said Phil Scaduto, a vice president of marketing for Foodtown, a cooperative that has 52 outlets throughout the state. Mr. Scaduto's grandfather John Azzolina opened the first Foodtown market in Highlands in the 1920's. ''There are bigger players now, and the larger chains are moving in, so that a lot of groups like us have gone by the wayside.''
 Not only do the state's grocers face competition from supermarket giants such as Stop & Shop, a Quincy, Mass.,-based company whose 53 stores in New Jersey make up more than a seventh of its total, and from ACME, based in Malvern, Pa., which has 61 of its 138 stores in the state. Big box stores are also encroaching on the grocers' traditional turf. 
 ''We can't just myopically look at ShopRites, because we're also in competition with non-supermarkets,'' said Rich Savner, director of public affairs for Pathmark, based in Carteret. ''We have to consider the Walgreens, the Rite Aids, Costco, Sam's, Target and Wal-Mart and also the dollar stores that sell some of the same things we do.''
 Meredith Adler, senior equity analyst for Lehman Brothers, pointed out that such a highly splintered market is peculiar to the state. ''When you look at the market share data, it's very fragmented,'' she said. ''There are many players, and there's no big market shares.''
 But if there is any advantage to the regional chains' position, it is that they are in a part of the country where sprawling sites necessary to open stores like Wal-Mart are expensive, Ms. Adler added. Nationally, she said, the growth of nontraditional food sellers in New Jersey, ''is nothing compared to the rest of the country.'' 
 ''The economics make it hard for new players to come in, so there's a bias toward people who are already in the market,'' she said. 
 Regionals are trying hard to keep that bias tilted in their favor. Leading the pack, according to Mark Hamstra, retail and financial editor at industry trade magazine Supermarket News, is ShopRite. Wakefern, the co-op's supplier, which scans more than $7 billion in sales each year, ''is strong on its own -- historically on the cutting edge.'' '' 
 For ShopRite customers, that means a panoply of services few would associate with grocery stores. In addition to the Scrunchy's Playhouses, or in-store day care centers available at no cost to parents at a handful of stores, six New Jersey ShopRites have begun offering online ordering in the last year, with pick-up that does not require drivers to leave their vehicles. There are also self-checkout lanes, Dunkin' Donuts counters, T-Mobile cellphone dealers, North Fork Bank branches, dry cleaners, cigar shops, Chinese and pizza takeout counters, ''culinary workshops'' and loftlike seating areas for in-store dining. Foodtown, the smaller of the co-ops, lags by comparison. After an unsuccessful foray into self-checkouts in the early 90's, the company scotched the high-tech approach to drawing regulars. The focus is now on an incentive program that gives customers 10 points for every $100 spent; the points can be used toward food discounts or for products in a catalog that sells everything from bicycles to hairdryers.
 Cheryl Good, manager of community relations at Kings touted the chain's four cooking schools, in Bedminster, Hillsdale, Short Hills and Verona. The five-week intensive ''principles of cooking,'' which costs $150, mom-and-tot classes and demos by cookbook authors draw an affluent customer base, one attuned to ''the things that cost us a little bit more to operate, like higher standards for sanitation and quality.'' 
 Despite the emphasis on incentives and enhancements, where both co-operatives throw banana peels in the paths of their national competitors, said Ms. Adler of Lehman Brothers, is in their pricing. The regional stores can manage to keep their prices low. ''They can afford to do that because they have individual owners -- they're not trying to generate good profits every quarter,'' she said. ''They don't have any shareholders to please. Some of the owners are public, but they're very small.'' But the incentives may not pay off in the long run. Mr. Hamstra of Supermarket News noted: ''I don't have any data to show that any of these are working for the regionals. The thing is, they're competing with each other -- once one chain starts offering something they all feel they need to offer something. Nobody wants to let the other guy get a hand up.''
 It is unclear whether such promotions even figure in to shoppers' decisions. 
 Ms. Seth, the Berkeley Heights resident, favors Kings and Stop & Shop because ''they have special kids' carts the kids love.'' 
 But she responds to the old-fashioned way of netting customers. ''If they have a great sale at ShopRite or Pathmark, like a great deal on Coke, I'll end up going and buying 10 other things,'' she noted.
 Jill Johnson of South Orange, who regularly shops at ShopRite -- with occasional detours to Whole Foods -- seems to favor more high-tech incentives. ''I also do online ordering from the ShopRite in Clarke -- that's the closest one that has online ordering -- out of convenience. It's a lot easier to order food online and just go pick it up than to bring kids in the store,'' she noted.
 If Mr. Hamstra of Supermarket News's dire forecast for the regional grocers is true, shoppers should enjoy the scramble over their grocery dollars while they can. He suspects that modern-day New Jersey cart-pushers will wind up feeding at the same superstore trough as the rest of the country, and soon. 
 ''What's different about New Jersey that's not the case for most other states is that Wal-Mart Supercenters haven't opened here yet, and they're considered one of the main competitive threats to the industry.
 ''But eventually, it'll happen,'' he said. ''They'll come.''

September

LEONARD BERNSTEIN -- There are worse ways to open a season than with a wave of Bernsteiniana, new and old. While a new recording of Bernstein's ''Mass'' waits in the wings (Kent Nagano conducts the Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin on Harmonia Mundi France, October), the Miller Theater at Columbia University opens its season with a Composer Portrait concert devoted to him. The violinist Jennifer Koh, the soprano Amy Burton and others join George Steel and the Gotham City Orchestra in works including the ''Serenade'' and excerpts from ''A Quiet Place'' and ''On the Town.'' Also this month -- lest in remembering Bernstein the composer we forget Bernstein the conductor and educator -- Kultur International Films is to release 25 of his celebrated Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic on nine DVD's: a great boon at a time when music education is disappearing from schools. Next month Amadeus Press follows with a new printing of Bernstein's book ''The Joy of Music,'' accompanied by a DVD presenting two of his programs from the ''Omnibus'' TV series of the 1950's. Also next month, the WFMT Radio Network is to broadcast a new 11-part documentary series, ''Leonard Bernstein: An American Life,'' narrated by Susan Sarandon. That should all be as much talk and music as even the most avid Bernsteinian can ingest in a two-month period. But if anyone needs another fix long about, say, March, look for ''Candide'' at the New York City Opera. Composer Portrait, Saturday. Miller Theater.

SILK ROAD PROJECT -- Zankel Hall has proved mightily impressive since it opened a year ago, in both its acoustics and its amenities. Now, to open its second season, it begins to show how versatile it can be, going beyond the standard concert configuration, with the stage moved to the center and seats all around. But just as important as the hall's qualities is the direction its programming took in its first season, carrying its parent, Carnegie Hall, well beyond the standard repertory of Western classical music. So it is virtually tailor-made for the Silk Road Project, a venture Yo-Yo Ma set in motion several years ago to foster collaboration between Eastern and Western musicians. Here -- after a weeklong workshop on mentoring, creating and communicating at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass. -- the project offers a concentrated festival, with four evening concerts and various discussions. (Mr. Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble also perform in the Stern Auditorium at Carnegie on April 10.) Mr. Ma acknowledges no boundaries, and neither, it would seem, does his energy. Saturday-next Sunday. Zankel Hall and Weill Recital Hall.

'KOL NIDRE THROUGH THE AGES, AROUND THE WORLD' -- This event, under the artistic direction of the baritone Sanford Sylvan, is the flagship of both the 92nd Street Y's concert season and its season-long festival, ''Celebrate 350: Jewish Life in America, 1654-2004.'' Kol Nidre, a prayer central to the service for Yom Kippur, is performed in settings representing various traditions by cantors, a choir and instrumentalists. Next Sunday. 92nd Street Y.

'OTELLO' -- The Metropolitan Opera has restructured its season, with an earlier opening, a two-week break in January and a later close. The season begins in dead earnest here, as Ben Heppner sings the demanding title role of Verdi's opera for the first time at the Met. Barbara Frittoli sings Desdemona, Carlo Guelfi is Iago, and James Levine conducts. Opens Sept. 20. Metropolitan Opera House.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC -- The orchestra's season is mildly adventurous, but its opening night, typically, is not. Lorin Maazel conducts Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist, and Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony. The rest of the week (Sept. 22-24) ups the ante slightly. Mr. Vengerov switches to the Mendelssohn Concerto and Mr. Maazel to Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, but Mr. Maazel also adds Messiaen's ''Offrandes Oubliees.'' Opening night, Sept. 21. Avery Fisher Hall. www.nyphil.org

CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER -- The society begins a new season and a new era, with the pianist Wu Han and the cellist David Finckel taking over as music directors. Not that their arrival will affect this season's programming, which was pinned down long ago. The motley opening concert includes Stravinsky's ''Renard,'' a chamber version of Wagner's ''Siegfried Idyll'' and Berlioz's ''Nuits d'Ete'' and features a variety of performers. Sept. 22. Alice Tully Hall. www.chambermusicsociety.org. A related article is on Page 73.

'ELIJAH' -- Franz Welser-Most opens his third season as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra with a blockbuster, Mendelssohn's grand oratorio, with Thomas Quasthoff, a baritone of biblical authority, in the title role. Sept. 23, 25. Severance Hall, Cleveland, (216) 231-1111. www.clevelandorchestra.com

'DIE WALKURE' -- With Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle still resounding from the spring, the Met brings back the heart of its production, with a significant twist. Having taken over ''Parsifal'' last year, Valery Gergiev, the company's principal guest conductor, continues his incursion into repertory once the personal preserve of James Levine, as Mr. Levine turns some of his attention to the Boston Symphony. Olga Sergeeva makes her company debut as Brunnhilde, and Placido Domingo lends continuity as Siegmund. Opens Sept. 25. Metropolitan Opera House.

'NEW SOUNDS LIVE' -- John Schaefer of WNYC-FM is the host of a program of politically oriented music: Phil Kline's touching ''Zippo Songs,'' which take their texts from inscriptions by G.I.'s on their cigarette lighters in Vietnam; and excerpts from Scott Johnson's ''How It Happens,'' which applies sampling techniques to pronouncements of the journalist, political philosopher and provocateur I. F. Stone. Sept. 28. Merkin Concert Hall.

WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL ORGAN -- A central feature of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's kicky new hall, designed by Frank Gehry, is a kicky new organ, with pipes that look like pick-up sticks. It is now evidently completely installed and ready to rumble. Frederick Swann gives the inaugural recital. Then the instrument is used in orchestral works that should tell just as much about its power and coloristic possibilities: Saint-Saens's ''Organ'' Symphony (Oct. 2-3) and Strauss's ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' (Oct. 7, 9). Recital, Sept. 30. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000. www.laphil.org

October

NEW YORK EARLY MUSIC CELEBRATION -- Understandably weary of perennial laments from critics (including me) and others about the lackluster state of the early-music scene in New York, organizations and individuals in the area have decided to band together and show off their wares in some 60 events. Alas (here I go again), it's mostly small-bore stuff, and the festival has done little to get the word out to the public. Early Music New York, which spearheaded the effort, will perform at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue on Oct. 2, presenting Handel's original festive orchestrations of the ''Royal Fireworks Music'' and the ''Water Music,'' with 58 players (12 of them oboists). (And what is it about early-musickers and puns? Whoever devised the title ''Lawes in Order'' should be roughed up by Detective Tutuola.) Oct. 1-10. Various locations. www.nyemc.org

BEAUX-ARTS TRIO -- Having celebrated his 80th birthday at the Met Museum last season with a variety of events, the revered pianist Menahem Pressler continues full steam ahead, leading his younger colleagues in a three-year survey of Beethoven trios and sonatas. Oct. 1, Dec. 10, April 1. Metropolitan Museum.

BRADLEY BROOKSHIRE -- For the last few years, this excellent harpsichordist has been experimenting with multimedia presentations of Bach's ''Art of Fugue,'' providing color-coded projections of the score, so listeners can follow the many bouncing balls. Presumably the operation is well oiled by now, with some of the early kinks worked out, and Mr. Brookshire presents it again on Oct. 20 at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue. In addition, he has recorded ''The Art of Fugue'' for release on an interactive CD-ROM with a crash course on the work. But first he expands on the experiment with a multimedia presentation of other keyboard fugues by Bach as part of the New York Early Music Celebration. Oct. 5. CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street. www.nyemc.org

PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA -- Hey, no pressure, folks, but remember, as you grapple with contract negotiations, you're supposed to open the Carnegie Hall season. Barring a strike, Christoph Eschenbach will conduct a program of Strauss, with Renee Fleming singing the ''Four Last Songs'' and Yo-Yo Ma playing ''Don Quixote.'' (At press time, in fact, with negotiations also looking dire at the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra and elsewhere, one is tempted to ask not whether there will be a strike this season, but how many there will be.) Oct. 6. Carnegie Hall.

'SUN RINGS' -- Taking his cue from sounds discovered in deep space, Terry Riley, a founding father of Minimalism, has conceived a multimedia meditation on the beauties of outer space and celestial harmonies. The Kronos Quartet is joined by the Dessoff Choirs, and Willie Williams supplies visual images. Oct. 6, 8, 9. Brooklyn Academy of Music.

'ROMEO AND JULIET' -- What Lorin Maazel does well he often does supremely well. For my money (and I've had to buy the thing several times when copies lent to grateful friends were never returned), his 1973 recording of Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet'' with the Cleveland Orchestra is one of the great recordings ever made. Unfortunately, Mr. Maazel is doing only excerpts here with the New York Philharmonic (along with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and Violin Concerto No. 1). He should perform the work complete again, and someone should record it. Oct. 7-9. Avery Fisher Hall.

'BACH IN CONTEXT' -- The pianist Christopher O'Riley joins the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in ''Bach and the Classical Concerto,'' with works by C. P. E. Bach and Mozart, to open a six-concert series at the Miller Theater. The violinist Fabio Biondi and his ensemble Europa Galante follow with ''Bach and the Baroque Concerto.'' The Trigon String Trio then offers three concerts combining Bach with Purcell, Mozart and composers of the 20th century. And Alexandre Tharaud, a French pianist, makes his New York recital debut in a program of Bach, Couperin and Rameau. Oct. 7, 14, 29; March 18, 23; April 29. Miller Theater.

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' -- '' 'Magic Flute' Meets 'The Lion King' '' MusicalAmerica.com trumpeted in the headline to a review of Adrian Noble's production of the beloved Mozart opera at the Glyndebourne Festival last May. Perhaps, but here it does for sure. Julie Taymor, of ''Lion King'' fame, is both director and costume designer of a new production in her debut at the Met. James Levine conducts, and Matthias Goerne, who triumphed as Papageno five years ago in Achim Freyer's production at the Salzburg Festival, wearing balloonlike circus pants, repeats the role, wearing . . . well, who knows what? Opens Oct. 8. Metropolitan Opera House.

BEETHOVEN PIANO SONATAS -- Symphony Space has taken new directions in recent years, but it maintains a distinctive part of its franchise: marathon concerts. Here present and former students of the piano guru Leon Fleisher play all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Oct. 9. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. www.symphonyspace.org

'MONTEVERDI EXTRAVAGANZA' -- As part of the New York Early Music Celebration, the vocal and instrumental ensemble Artek presents works by the Italian master, including ''Beatus Vir'' and duets and trios from the Seventh and Eighth Books of madrigals. There will also be a touch of dance (something Artek has done well before), set to Carlo Farina's ''Capriccio Stravagante.'' Oct. 9. Church of St. Francis of Assisi, 135 West 31st Street, (212) 967-9157. www.artekearlymusic.com.

ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTREAL -- You almost never hear Shostakovich's powerful cantata ''The Execution of Stepan Razin'' in concert. But Leon Botstein conducted it at the Bard Music Festival last month, and now James Conlon presents it again, along with another big choral work rare on the concert stage, Rachmaninoff's ''Bells.'' Oct. 10. Carnegie Hall.

'THE ROMANTIC GENERATION' -- If it's an illuminating combination of performance and intelligent discussion you're looking for, you won't do better than Charles Rosen, bringing his book of the same name to life. Today it's Chopin; later, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Brahms. Oct. 10, 24, Nov. 7. 92nd Street Y.

JOHN HARBISON-DAWN UPSHAW YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT -- Here is an intriguing concept. In a workshop begun last May and to be completed Oct. 7 to 10, young singers and composers have been paired off to write and perform pieces for voice and chamber ensemble under the watch of Mr. Harbison and Ms. Upshaw. Now those works are presented in concert. Oct. 10. Weill Recital Hall.

'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES' -- New Yorkers haven't seen a major new production of Poulenc's great opera in a long time, partly because the Met's 1977 staging, by John Dexter, has been such a success. But now the City Opera, which gave the New York stage premiere of the work in 1966, presents a fresh concept by Tazewell Thompson in a production unveiled at the Glimmerglass Opera in 2002. The cast includes the formidable Joyce Castle, and George Manahan conducts. Opens Oct. 12. New York State Theater.

MIKHAIL PLETNEV -- If you're looking for fireworks to kick off your season (as the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center undoubtedly is), this explosive Russian pianist is sure to provide them, even in a relatively subdued program of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Oct. 13. Avery Fisher Hall.

'WINTERREISE' -- The recording just arrived from EMI Classics, and it is every bit as eloquent as you might expect. Expect the same from the concert, as the distinctive tenor Ian Bostridge makes his Carnegie Hall recital debut in Schubert's great song cycle. The pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, who follows (or leads) Mr. Bostridge's every nuanced turn on the recording, presents this event to open his season-long Perspectives series at Carnegie. Oct. 16. Carnegie Hall.

DEBORAH VOIGT -- Whatever the physical qualities that offended the Royal Opera in London when it bounced her from a production of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' last season, this radiant and compelling soprano suffers from no lack of energy and stamina. Here, with the Vancouver Opera, she adds a new role, seemingly a natural, to her repertory: the Marschallin in ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Soon after, with Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, she performs Schoenberg's haunting monodrama ''Erwartung'' (Oct. 28-30), and on the night of the last performance, she also dashes to the Lyric Opera of Chicago to take part in a gala concert celebrating the company's 50th anniversary. Then she comes to New York, singing Elisabeth in ''Tannhauser'' at the Met (starting Nov. 18). Between performances, she appears in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Statue of Liberty float. Next year looks much the same, with no end of gleaming notes and phrases. ''Rosenkavalier'' opens Oct. 16. Vancouver Opera, (604) 683-0222. www.vanopera.bc.ca

ANDRAS SCHIFF -- The pianist plays chamber and solo works by Janacek. Oct. 18, 22, 28. Zankel Hall and Carnegie Hall. A related article is on Page 74.

GEWANDHAUS ORCHESTRA OF LEIPZIG -- When Lincoln Center, for whatever reason, declares it a Brahms season, it's a Brahms season. New Yorkers of a certain age will remember when this orchestra came calling with Brahms under its longtime music director, Kurt Masur. Now, to kick off the series ''The Classical Romantic,'' Herbert Blomstedt, the current music director, conducts the Second and Fourth Symphonies and the two piano concertos in a pair of concerts, with Mikhail Pletnev as, undoubtedly, a commanding soloist. Oct. 18-19. Avery Fisher Hall.

NANCARROW FESTIVAL -- Not content with great Lisztian or Rachmaninoffian handfuls of piano sound, the inventive American Conlon Nancarrow wanted complex patterns that he was sure would elude the grasp of live performers. So he turned to the player piano, imprinting the music onto piano rolls for mechanical reproduction. But the piano duo of Helena Bugallo and Amy Williams has been trying to reclaim some of these pieces for live performance in four-hand arrangements. In the first concert here, they play 12 studies for player piano as well as Stravinsky's duo arrangement of ''The Rite of Spring.'' In three other concerts, the pianist Christopher Taylor and the ensemble Alarm Will Sound will perform much of Nancarrow's music written for live performance as well as pieces by composers who influenced him and whom he influenced. Oct. 21, Nov. 11, Dec. 3, Feb. 19. Miller Theater.

BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- The venerable ensemble installs a new music director for the first time since 1973. And James Levine announces his presence in a big way, with Mahler's ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' first in Boston (Oct. 22-23), then in New York. Oct. 25. Carnegie Hall.

TOKYO STRING QUARTET -- The group performs works by Schoenberg, Eisler and Zemlinsky. Oct. 23, Feb. 12, May 7. 92nd Street Y. A related article is on Page 79.

ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC -- With all the publicity accorded Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra, you might think that this orchestra, with its rich history, had become the B team in St. Petersburg. Don't believe it, at least until you've heard for yourself. Yuri Temirkanov conducts three programs of more or less standard fare. Some very standard: you may think you've heard one too many performances of Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique'' Symphony. But if you haven't heard Mr. Temirkanov conduct it with this orchestra, you've probably heard one too few. Oct. 26, 27, 29. Carnegie Hall.

'LE GRAND MACABRE' -- The San Francisco Opera gives the American stage premiere of an opera by Gyorgy Ligeti. Opens Oct. 29. War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco, (415) 864-3330. www.sfopera.com. A related article is on Page 73.

HOUSTON GRAND OPERA -- The company celebrates its 50th anniversary in the adventurous style to which it has become accustomed in recent decades, with not one but two premieres (its 31st and 32nd). First comes Daniel Catan's ''Salsipuedes: A Tale of Love, War and Anchovies.'' The audience, the brochure says, perhaps rashly, is invited to dance in the aisles. But there won't be much dancing, at least for the sex-deprived men, in the other new work, opening on March 4: Mark Adamo's ''Lysistrata, or The Nude Goddess.'' ''Salsipuedes'' opens Oct. 29. Wortham Theater Center, Houston, (713) 228-6737. www.hgo.com

'HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES' -- Of all the things Charles Wuorinen's music has been called over the years, ''charming'' probably does not rank near the top. Yet that is precisely the quality that will be needed in his new opera, to match Salman Rushdie's delightful novel and James Fenton's artful libretto. Mr. Rushdie's book, a paean to storytelling, engages the art in manifold ways, using almost everything but music. (And it often comes close there, too.) Mr. Wuorinen now leaps into that breach. Or rather, walks into it, for the piece, featured in a series of readings at the New York City Opera in 2000, has seemed on the verge of completion for years. Part of it, in fact, ''The Haroun Songbook,'' is already available on CD, and the City Opera finally presents the whole of it. Oct. 31. New York State Theater.

ENGLISH CONCERT -- This pioneering period-instrument group, big in the 1970's and 80's, seemed to lose steam toward the end of Trevor Pinnock's tenure as founding director. If anyone can re-energize it, it should be the electrifying violinist Andrew Manze, its new leader. Several Vivaldi concertos will afford ample display of Mr. Manze's virtuosity. The other repertory ranges from the overfamiliar (Mozart's ''Kleine Nachtmusik'') to the obscure (a serenata by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer). Oct. 31. Alice Tully Hall.

November

DANIEL BARENBOIM -- This pianist (and conductor and political provocateur and would-be diplomat) has always been a man in a hurry, and he sometimes sounds it in his new Warner Classics recording of the quintessentially mellow preludes and fugues of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book 1. You have to hope that he will relax a bit in this live performance of the work. Nov. 1. Carnegie Hall.

DRESDEN PHILHARMONIC -- Here, a few weeks after the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra concerts, is the other half of Lincoln Center's Brahms team (not to be confused with the better-known Dresden Staatskapelle, which performs Brahms on April 13 at Carnegie Hall under Myung-Whun Chung). Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos conducts the Dresden Philharmonic in Brahms's First Symphony, Violin Concerto (with Julia Fischer as soloist) and ''German Requiem.'' Nov. 7-8. Avery Fisher Hall.

MUSIC AND DANCE OF THE JEWISH WEDDING -- Here is another key component in the Y's festival, ''Celebrate 350: Jewish Life in America.'' This series of three concerts explores various wedding traditions: first the Ashkenazi, then the Bukharan and the Moroccan. Nov. 10, Dec. 8, Feb. 3. 92nd Street Y.

'IN YOUR EAR' -- This weekend festival, curated by the composer John Adams, features Joshua Redman, on saxophone; Kayhan Kahlor, playing Persian music on the fiddle-like kamancheh; the actress and playwright Anna Deveare Smith, in conversation; and others. Nov. 12-14. Zankel Hall.

STEVE REICH -- The American master and his musicians perform three programs of his music, old and new, including the haunting ''Different Trains.'' (Mr. Reich is also the subject of a Composer Portrait concert featuring So Percussion on March 25 at the Miller Theater.) Nov. 13, Jan. 29, April 2. Metropolitan Museum.

TRIO MEDIAEVAL -- Iraq wasn't the only thing handed over this summer. What's more, the handover of hegemony between female vocal groups in the not always placid world of early music was orderly. Anonymous 4 disbanded after last season and a New York farewell appearance at Corpus Christi Church, where it had performed for years. Now the Oslo-based Trio Mediaeval, which made its New York debut last season, takes over in the church's invaluable series Music Before 1800, performing the 13th-century ''Messe de Tournai'' and other works. (The trio will also appear on April 7 at Merkin Concert Hall.) Nov. 14. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, (212) 666-9266. www.mb1800.org

AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- If you have an opinion about Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny, it is probably not favorable, having been formed when you were force-fed his piano exercises as a child. But for good or ill, there is much more Czerny to be had (as witness the opus number of his Symphony in D presented here, 781). Leon Botstein, in his never-ending quest to right musical wrongs, tries to rehabilitate Czerny with a full program of his music. Nov. 14. Avery Fisher Hall.

MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO -- This concert series, like the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont from which it derives, offers a remarkable opportunity to see the torch being passed from veteran artists to gifted younger musicians as they mingle in performance. Nov. 19, Dec. 17, Feb. 25. Metropolitan Museum.

KREMERATA BALTICA -- The superb violinist Gidon Kremer and his crack instrumentalists from the Baltic states play the first of two concerts called ''Shostakovich and After'' -- curiously, since all the music is by Shostakovich. The big works here are the Chamber Symphony (Op. 110a, an expansion of the wrenching Eighth String Quartet) and the equally wrenching Symphony No. 14. Nov. 20, May 3. Carnegie Hall.

'ANDROMEDA LIBERATA' -- You be the judge. Exhibit A is a new Deutsche Grammophon Archiv recording of this operalike serenata, with music by Vivaldi, to be released in early November. The work turned up in 2002, and the first question is how much of the music is by Vivaldi. Scholars are divided. Some say that it is all Vivaldi, others that it is a pastiche to which he contributed in a minor way, much the way Mozart did to ''The Philosopher's Stone,'' unearthed several years ago. The second question is how much it should matter to listeners. Apparently the work is good in its own right. Still, will we insist on putting the cart first, wondering how much we should enjoy the work based on how much is by Vivaldi? Probably. In any case, there will be plenty of evidence to consider. Exhibit B is a live performance of the piece by the musicians who recorded it, Andrea Marcon and the Venice Baroque Orchestra. Nov. 29. Zankel Hall.

'LOST OBJECTS' -- Masterminded and composed by the artistic directors of Bang on a Can, Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe, this purports to be, oxymoronically, a Baroque oratorio for our times. It is described as ''a musical exploration of the meaning of memory,'' a contemplation of ''the grace bestowed upon each thing, person, animal and idea, the ordinary and the not-so-ordinary lost objects of our shared and vanishing culture.'' Well, I guess you have to be there. The army of collaborators includes Deborah Artman, the librettist; Francois Girard, the stage director; DJ Spooky; Concerto Koln, a period-instrument band (but which period?); the New York Virtuoso Singers; and the Bang on a Can Lost Objects Ensemble. Nov. 30, Dec. 2-4. Brooklyn Academy of Music.

'THE OXFORD HISTORY OF WESTERN MUSIC' -- When Richard Taruskin writes a book, he writes a book -- or two, or six. Many who knew that he was writing a Stravinsky book in the 1980's wondered why it was taking so long to come out. When it finally did, in two hefty volumes in 1996, everyone understood why. Mr. Taruskin has since been writing a history of music (while also writing articles for The New York Times, among other publications), and it is about to appear in six hefty volumes. This shapes up as the most important publishing event in classical music since The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which appeared in 20 volumes in 1980 and 29 in 2001. But that was a work of many minds (including Mr. Taruskin's); this is the work of one. What's more, it promises to be a good read, more than can be said for vast tracts of New Grove. November. Oxford University Press.

POPOV'S SYMPHONY NO. 1 -- Before Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony (1936), there was Gavril Popov's First (first performed in 1935), seemingly the model for it. Popov was a worthy foil to Shostakovich at the time, and in a new recording, Leon Botstein and the London Symphony pair that First with Shostakovich's early Theme and Variations (Op. 3). November. Telarc.

December

TILL FELLNER -- This gifted young Austrian pianist's visibility rose considerably recently with his engaging ECM recording of Book 1 of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier.'' Here he plays Bach's French Suite No. 5 amid a hefty load of Beethoven. Dec. 1. Zankel Hall.

'RODELINDA' -- Even before the recent boom in Handel operas, this work had a certain currency, its title role providing a vehicle for divas like Joan Sutherland. The Metropolitan Opera, which has never presented it, puts forth its reigning diva, Renee Fleming. But it also adds touches of up-to-date Handel style, including the use of countertenors: excellent ones, Bejun Mehta and David Daniels. Stephen Wadsworth, a Handelian whose ''Xerxes'' was revived last season at the New York City Opera, directs, and Harry Bicket conducts, both in their company debuts. Opens Dec. 2. Metropolitan Opera House.

'THE TRISTAN PROJECT' -- The Los Angeles Philharmonic performs Wagner's opera in concert, interspersed with later music. Dec. 3-5, 10-12. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000. www.laphil.com. A related article is on Page 78.

SPHINX ORGANIZATION -- This institution, founded in 1996 and based in Detroit, has done excellent work on behalf of young black and Latino string players, trying to steer them toward positions in orchestras through an annual competition and other programs. Now it comes to New York to show off some of its alumni, as well it should. Dec. 8. Carnegie Hall. www.sphinxmusic.org

'A WEDDING' -- After its success with William Bolcom's ''View From the Bridge'' in 1999, the Lyric Opera returns to the same well. Here Mr. Bolcom bases his work on a Robert Altman movie, and Mr. Altman is on hand to direct. Lauren Flanigan takes the lead role (would she have it any other way?), and Dennis Russell Davies conducts. Opens Dec. 11. Lyric Opera of Chicago, (312) 332-2244. www.lyricopera.org

AULOS ENSEMBLE -- After a couple of years' absence from the Met Museum, this sturdy group of early-music veterans returns with what is typically one of the finest Christmas concerts at the museum, and thus one of the finest in the city. The added presence of the baritone Sanford Sylvan can only enhance the evening. Dec. 13. Metropolitan Museum.

'KATYA KABANOVA' -- The soprano Karita Mattila appears in a revival of Janacek's opera at the Met. Opens Dec. 17. Metropolitan Opera House. A related article is on Page 74.

BEETHOVEN'S NINTH SYMPHONY -- Kurt Masur, who brought many touches of Leipzig tradition to the New York Philharmonic during his tenure as music director, continues to do so as laureate conductor, ringing out the old year with this celebration of brotherhood. Dec. 31. Avery Fisher Hall.

January

'NORTHERN LIGHTS FESTIVAL' -- Neeme Jarvi leads the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in its annual winter festival of orchestral and chamber concerts and musical discussions, this time concentrating on Finnish and Scandinavian fare. Sibelius dominates, and the major works include his imposing Fifth Symphony, in its seriously undercooked original version, and his Violin Concerto, though not in its original version, equally raw. Pekka Kuusisto is the violinist. Jan. 6-23. New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, and other locations in New Jersey. www.njsymphony.org

MET ORCHESTRA -- Thematic programming? This is just perverse. After a normal first half (Weber's ''Euryanthe'' Overture and Brahms's Violin Concerto, with Gil Shaham as soloist), all hell breaks loose with the rip-roaring ''Ameriques,'' by Edgard Varese (a Parisian in America): a concert closer if ever there was one. And James Levine follows that with Gershwin's ditzy ''American in Paris.'' Evidently he likes the little joke, because he is ending a Boston Symphony program in Symphony Hall in March with the same odd coupling. Jan. 9. Carnegie Hall.

TAKACS STRING QUARTET -- The first two installments of this group's recording of the 16 Beethoven quartets have received well-earned praise. Here, about the time that the final volume appears from Decca, the players travel the road again, playing all the quartets, though not in chronological order, in six concerts presented by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Jan. 9, 11, 21, 23, 28, 30. Alice Tully Hall.

'KAFKA FRAGMENTS' -- As part of her Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, Dawn Upshaw collaborates with the director Peter Sellars in a staging of a work by Gyorgy Kurtag for soprano and violin. A wild card. Jan. 10, 12, 13. Zankel Hall.

CARNEGIE HALL CHORAL WORKSHOP -- This event, founded in 1990 by Robert Shaw, has pretty much stuck to the mold since Shaw's death in 1999, with nonspecialist conductors picking up where the Shaw acolyte Norman Mackenzie leaves off in preparing the concluding concert. But this year the seasoned choral specialist Helmuth Rilling moves in, undoubtedly with strong ideas of his own about how a chorus (this one larded with choral professionals from around the country) should be prepared. The work at hand is Mozart's unfinished Mass in C minor in the premiere of a new completion by Robert Levin, who has a series of his own, ''Mozart Explored,'' at Carnegie this season. Jan. 10-15. Carnegie Hall.

PAUL O'DETTE -- The lutenist gives a recital as part of Music Before 1800. Jan. 16. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, (212) 666-9266. www.mb1800.org. A related article is on Page 73.

KIROV OPERA -- The stellar company from St. Petersburg, directed by Valery Gergiev, begins a residency in Washington with a ''Kirov Spectacular,'' also involving the Kirov Ballet. Then the opera company presents three performances of Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov.'' Jan 18, 19, 22; 21-23. Kennedy Center Opera House.

'BRAHMS THE PROGRESSIVE' -- Lincoln Center may have the franchise on Brahms the Classical Romantic, but the Miller Theater is searching out forward-looking strains in his smaller-scale pieces, juxtaposing them with works of later masters. The programs all look delicious, but the second is of particular note, with the pianist Christopher Taylor joining the Ying Quartet in Brahms's daunting Piano Quintet as well as quintets by Anton Webern and Peter Lieberson. Jan. 21, Feb. 10, March 5, 19, 26. Miller Theater.

LORRAINE HUNT LIEBERSON -- Pick your event with this superb mezzo-soprano. It could be her performance in Berlioz's ''Romeo et Juliette'' with James Levine and the Boston Symphony at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 6). It could be her rendition of Britten's ''Phaedra'' with Colin Davis and the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall (Dec. 16-18). It could be her Carnegie recital debut (May 8). (No repertory announced yet; it hardly matters.) For me, it's sure to be a performance of Mahler's ''Lied von der Erde'' with the tenor Ben Heppner in a concert with Mr. Levine and the Met Orchestra. What beauties may await in the work's ineffably lingering farewell? Nah, don't pick just one. Jan. 23. Carnegie Hall.

CINCINNATI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Paavo Jarvi, the orchestra's dynamic music director, dutifully supplies an appendage of sorts to his father's ''Northern Lights Festival'' with the New Jersey Symphony, just ended. Or might there be Oedipal rivalry at work? In fact, Paavo, the firebrand of the family, duplicates two works from Neeme Jarvi's festival, Grieg's Piano Concerto (with Lars Vogt as soloist) and Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, and he may just stir greater excitement with them. For good measure, he adds Aulis Sallinen's Symphony No. 8 (''Autumnal Fragments''), in its New York premiere. Jan. 24. Carnegie Hall.

'RENAISSANCE MUSE' -- The stage director Mark Lamos is sure to produce something captivating in this collaboration with the superb countertenor Andreas Scholl in Lincoln Center's acclaimed ''New Visions'' series. Jan. 26, 28, 29. John Jay College Theater, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org

LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Pierre Boulez conducts two programs of his music (''Livre Pour Cordes,'' ''Derive 2'') and that of others (Mahler's Fifth Symphony, Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments and ''Rite of Spring''). But for many, the most attractive concert may well be the middle one, in which Mr. Boulez discusses ''The Rite of Spring,'' with musical examples played live, then conducts the work complete. Jan. 27-29. Carnegie Hall.

LAHTI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Osmo Vanska, who just generated great excitement in his first season as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, visits with the Finnish ensemble that put him on the map. (Or was it the reverse? Or both?) You will probably not hear a more idiomatic reading of a Sibelius symphony this season than the performance of the Second here. The program also includes Tchaikovsky's Third Piano Concerto and Prokofiev's First, with Louis Lortie as soloist. Jan. 30. Avery Fisher Hall.

CARLOS KLEIBER -- Although he hadn't been very active in recent years, this conductor's death in July came as a shock to the music world, abruptly closing out the possibility that he might someday emerge from seclusion and go out in a blaze of glory with a spate of performances and new recordings. So we are left with what we have -- almost. What we have is about to include six new DVD's and a VHS cassette of Kleiber performances, some never before released, and it is a special joy to see as well as hear this magnetic maestro in action. January. Deutsche Grammophon and Philips.

February

CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA -- There is seldom any additional incentive needed to bestir oneself for the splendid Cleveland Orchestra. But here is also a chance to hear Radu Lupu play all five Beethoven piano concertos. Franz Welser-Most surrounds them with a wild array of works, from Schubert's Eighth Symphony (''Unfinished'') to Roy Harris's Third, Shostako-vich's Eleventh (''The Year 1905'') and Henri Dutilleux's Second (''Le Double''); from Berg's Three Pieces for Orchestra (Op. 6) to Harrison Birtwistle's ''Night's Black Bird.'' Feb. 1, 2, 4, 5. Carnegie Hall.

NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Having opened the season with a gala celebration of the 60th birthday of its music director, Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra mounts a minifestival, ''A New America: The 1940's and the Arts,'' part of a larger undertaking by the Kennedy Center. It offers two programs of music by Barber, Bernstein, Copland, Korngold, Schuman and others. (By this time, on Jan. 20-22, Mr. Slatkin will have demonstrated his continuing commitment to new American music with the premiere of Philip Glass's Symphony No. 7, commissioned by the orchestra.) Feb. 3-5, 10-12. Kennedy Center Concert Hall.

RICCARDO CHAILLY -- In his last years with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, an ensemble with a great Mahler tradition, Mr. Chailly was becoming a formidable Mahlerian. Now, in the first of his two weeks with the New York Philharmonic, an orchestra with its own personal connection to the composer, he conducts Mahler's Seventh Symphony. (Beforehand, in November, Decca is to release a new Chailly recording of Mahler's Ninth with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.) Feb. 10, 11, 12, 15. Avery Fisher Hall.

RICCARDO MUTI -- The former maestro of the Philadelphia Orchestra returns for only the second time since his departure in 1992 and for the first time since the orchestra moved to its new home in the Kimmel Center in 2001. And he does so for a single benefit concert to help reduce the orchestra's deficit, responding to a request by the players rather than management. Economic circumstances weigh heavily on the minds of the musicians at the moment, as they negotiate a new contract. The gap between what management is offering and what the players are demanding is said to be considerable. Feb. 13. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999. www.philorch.org

JOSE VAN DAM -- To judge from recent appearances here, there is every reason to believe that this veteran Belgian bass-baritone is still singing with the best of them. The first program consists of French songs; the second, lieder by Schubert and Schumann. Feb. 13, 16. Alice Tully Hall.

EMERSON STRING QUARTET -- This splendid group goes from strength to strength, generally concentrating on one composer at a time, while adding context or contrast. Here, in a four-concert series, ''A Vision of Mendelssohn,'' the context consists of works by Bach, Schubert and Schumann. To end the series, the St. Lawrence String Quartet joins the Emerson in a performance of Mendelssohn's Octet. But in a new recording of the octet -- included in a CD set of the complete string quartets, to be released in February by Deutsche Grammophon -- the Emerson players overdub with the aid of a computer, performing all eight lines. Feb. 15, March 22, April 5 and 19. Zankel Hall.

'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' -- Not just Mendelssohn's incidental music but a substantial representation of Shakespeare's play. Not just once but twice in close succession. Here the accent is English, as Ivan Fischer (well, a Hungarian, but no matter) conducts the London-based Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and Tim Carroll directs actors including some from the Globe Theater in London. Then, on March 17, 18, 19 and 22, to open the New York Philharmonic's festival ''Visions of the Beyond'' at Avery Fisher Hall, Neville Marriner conducts the orchestra and Edward Berkeley directs. Age of Enlightenment performance, Feb. 24. Alice Tully Hall.

March

LORIN MAAZEL -- The New York Philharmonic celebrates the 75th birthday of its music director with a concert of his own music. Though not well known as a composer in these parts, Mr. Maazel is not wholly unfamiliar. One work here, Music for Cello and Orchestra, he conducted with the Bavarian Radio Symphony, and with Mstislav Rostropovich as soloist, at Carnegie Hall in 1996, and it's a good one. How the music stands up in quantity (five works in the program) remains to be seen. March 1. Avery Fisher Hall.

NEW YORK COLLEGIUM -- Andrew Parrott has greatly improved the quality of this early-music group in his two-and-a-half seasons as music director. He has also propagated the suddenly stylish notion of how Bach's choral works would have been performed in his time: basically one voice to a part; not a chorus at all, as we usually think of it. Here he applies that practice to Bach's most monumental creation, the ''St. Matthew Passion.'' One hopes that it will prove an attractive alternative, because for some of us who love terrific massed choral singing, it will probably never be more than an alternative. March 3-4. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 717-9246. www.nycollegium.org

VIENNA PHILHARMONIC -- No orchestra can play the Germanic classics with greater depth and commitment than this one. But because of the very distinctiveness of its Middle European sound and because, as basically an opera orchestra, it plays a limited symphonic repertory, it can seem out of its element in only slightly more exotic fare. Eleven years ago at Carnegie Hall, even the fierce exertions of Georg Solti failed to evoke the incisiveness and harshness needed in Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony. Perhaps the Latvian conductor Mariss Jansons will supply the requisite Slavic touch in that work. Sibelius's First Symphony may be less problematic, and the rest of the works here should provide pure pleasure and edification: Beethoven's Second Symphony, Brahms's First, Mahler's First and Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht.'' March 11-13. Carnegie Hall.

SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Michael Tilson Thomas's and Leif Ove Andsnes's Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall intersect in a performance of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto in the first program. Other works include Mahler's Seventh Symphony, Shostakovich's Fifteenth and Mr. Thomas's own ''Poems of Emily Dickinson.'' March 16-17, Carnegie Hall.

EMANUEL AX AND YEFIM BRONFMAN -- The piano duo version of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' must live vividly in memory for anyone who saw Leonard Bernstein almost elbow Michael Tilson Thomas off the bench in a supercharged performance at Alice Tully Hall in 1981. The two star pianists here are sure to make the work (along with music of Ravel and Debussy) compelling and memorable in their own right. March 16. Avery Fisher Hall.

LE JARDIN DES VOIX -- William Christie, the American who has galvanized the early-music scene in Paris in recent decades, tends his own vocal garden, Les Arts Florissants, meticulously. Now he looks to young shoots, singers selected from major conservatories by audition, presenting them in Baroque music. You can bank on his discernment. March 16-17. Alice Tully Hall.

'VISIONS OF THE BEYOND' -- Berlioz's ''Damnation of Faust'' and Liszt's ''Faust Symphony,'' maybe. Perhaps even Mendelssohn's ''Midsummer Night's Dream.'' But what do those works and Bach's ''Art of Fugue,'' Janacek's Sinfonietta and Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmospheres'' all have in common? Very little, it would seem, except that they are all part of a monthlong New York Philharmonic festival whose concept is not exactly transparent: something to do with a blending of man, nature and the immortal, according to the press release. The title, at least, comes from another entry, Messiaen's powerful ''Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela.'' Undoubtedly all will come clear. March 17-April 16. Avery Fisher Hall.

'ORLANDO' -- With the sturdy countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role, chances are good that the New York City Opera will continue its run of successes in Handel operas. Amy Burton and Jennifer Aylmer also appear in this new production, directed by Chas Rader-Shieber. Opens March 20. New York State Theater.

April

BORODIN QUARTET -- Not many chamber groups survive to celebrate their 60th anniversary. Prospects are good for the Juilliard String Quartet, in 2006 (without, of course, any of its original members). But the Borodin Quartet reaches the wire first, celebrating its six decades with vintage scores by Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. (The group's first cellist was Mstislav Rostropovich, who has gone on to bigger things.) April 2. 92nd Street Y.

KIROV ORCHESTRA -- We have a good idea what to expect from Valery Gergiev and his band in Russian music: in this case, Tchaikovsky's ''Francesca da Rimini,'' the Mussorgsky-Ravel ''Pictures at an Exhibition,'' Borodin's Second Symphony, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Prokofiev's First Piano Concerto and Second Symphony. And the Finnish Sibelius (Violin Concerto, Seventh Symphony) is close to their home in St. Petersburg. But what about Mahler? It should be fascinating to find out in the final program, the ''Resurrection'' Symphony, with Irina Mataeva and Olga Borodina as the vocal soloists. April 4-6. Carnegie Hall.

'PULLING STRINGS: VIOLINISTS ON FILM' -- Great Performers at Lincoln Center provides one of its patented wide-ranging film surveys, including performance clips large and small, featuring almost every past violinist that you've heard of and some that you haven't, as well as documentary material. April 5-19. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org

'WAR REQUIEM' -- Osmo Vanska, the music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, conducts that ensemble in a rare collaboration with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in Britten's great work, in each orchestra's hall. The vocal soloists are Helen Donath, James Taylor and Hakan Hagegard. April 7-8. Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis, (800) 292-4141. www.minnesotaorchestra.org. April 9. Ordway Center, St. Paul, (651) 291-1144. www.thespco.org

OLGA BORODINA -- The Temple of Dendur at the Met Museum may not be the best place to hear this or any other vocalist in songs. On the other hand, where wouldn't you want to hear Ms. Borodina? To clinch the case, she sings Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. April 9. Metropolitan Museum.

'LES PECHEURS DE PERLES' -- In addition to ''Carmen'' in March, the New York City Opera offers ''the'' other opera by Bizet, ''The Pearl Fishers'' for the first time since 1991. In a new production by Andrew Sinclair, Mary Dunleavy sings Leila and Emmanuel Plasson conducts. Opens April 10. New York State Theater.

JORDI SAVALL -- This conductor and master of the viola da gamba is a major force in the international early-music scene, and his colorful and often daring recordings for the Spanish label Alia Vox are always exciting. Here he appears with three groups that he leads, Hesperion XXI, La Capella Reial de Catalunya and Le Concert des Nations, in programs of mostly Baroque music. April 11, 13, 18. Metropolitan Museum.

OLGA KERN -- This Russian pianist, who shared the gold medal at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2001, seems with time to have emerged as the clear winner. She stood out when the foundation presented the four finalists last spring at Zankel Hall, and she gave her Carnegie Hall debut immediately after, substituting for an ailing Krystian Zimerman. Here she kicks off a series of six recitals with other piano competition winners: Severin von Eckardstein (Queen Elisabeth competition in Brussels), Boris Giltburg (Vendome in France), Alexei Grynyuk (Shanghai youth competition), Giuseppe Albanese (Vendome) and Antti Siirala (Dublin and Leeds). Proponents and opponents of musical competitions will surely find much to wrangle about here. April 14-17. Metropolitan Museum.

ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- All eyes and ears are on the orchestra's music director to be (next year), David Robertson, as a star in a new generation of American conductors. This program is all American, with works of Ives (including the Second Symphony), Copland and John Adams. April 16. Carnegie Hall.

'FAUST' -- Roberto Alagna has had almost as many misadventures as triumphs at the Metropolitan Opera, since his debut in 1996 ran aground on ''fourth tenor'' hype. The title role in Gounod's opera should suit him well in this new production, and he is surrounded by fine singers, including Soile Isokoski, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Rene Pape. Andrei Serban directs, replacing the originally announced Elijah Moshinsky, and James Levine conducts. Opens April 21. Metropolitan Opera House.

May

NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG -- The group repeats one of its most popular programs, ''Lost Tribes of Vaudeville,'' exploring the cultures of Jewish and black vaudeville, with composers ranging from Irving Berlin to Eubie Blake and singers including LaChanze and Darius de Haas. May 11. Merkin Concert Hall. www.nyfos.org

'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' -- Metropolitan Opera audiences may vaguely know of Franco Alfano from his 15 or so minutes of fame, as the composer who finished the third act of ''Turandot,'' left incomplete at Puccini's death in 1924. Now adventurous Met-goers can hear a complete Alfano opera, from 1936. (Few are likely to remember the Met's presentation of Alfano's ''Madonna Imperia'' in 1928.) Francesca Zambello directs the new ''Cyrano,'' a collaboration with the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and Placido Domingo will work around the title character's big nose without, you have to hope, sounding unduly nasal. The Met offers just three performances, clearly hedging its bets on how adventurous its patrons may be, even given the draw of Mr. Domingo. (In contrast, the Met's production of ''Turandot,'' which opens on Jan. 3, runs for 14 performances, until May 5.) ''Cyrano'' opens May 13. Metropolitan Opera House.

CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA -- Daniel Barenboim, the orchestra's music director, leads off with an odd coupling: Bach's quirky Second Orchestral Suite, with Mathieu Dufour as flute soloist, and Mahler's agonized Ninth Symphony. For the rest, in a fine bit of symmetry, Mr. Barenboim plays piano in a performance of Bartok's First Concerto in a program conducted by Pierre Boulez and conducts Mr. Boulez's ''Notations'' in a second program of his own. Mr. Boulez adds Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Four Pieces (Op. 12); Mr. Barenboim, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony and the Adagio from Mahler's Tenth. May 13-15. Carnegie Hall.

VAN CLIBURN INTERNATIONAL PIANO COMPETITION -- What to make of this event, which has so often produced winners who have quickly sunk into oblivion? At the last outing, in 2001, it had a genuine talent on its hands, and to judge from concerts given by all the medalists last spring at Zankel Hall, a clear-cut winner in Olga Kern. But it split the gold medal between her and Stanislav Ioudenitch. Can anyone here play this game? May 20-June 5. Bass Performance Hall, Fort Worth, (817) 738-6536. www.cliburn.org

JONATHAN NOTT -- This British conductor makes his New York debut in a big way. First, with the Bamberg Symphony and in combination with the brilliant pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, he offers two concerts devoted to Beethoven, Mahler and Gyorgy Ligeti. May 6, 8. Avery Fisher Hall. Then, with the Ensemble Intercontemporain in the main hall of the new Jazz at Lincoln Center complex at Columbus Circle, he conducts more Ligeti, a work by Wolfgang Rihm and an evening devoted to Benedict Mason's ''ChaplinOperas,'' with music to three silent films. May 24-25. Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org

LOS ANGELES OPERA -- ''A film adaptation of 'Sweeney Todd' is now in preproduction,'' the company announced a few months ago, ''and all theatrical performance rights have been retracted.'' So your ''Sweeney Todd'' production has collapsed, and you have the ebullient baritone Bryn Terfel committed to dates that are suddenly open. What do you do? Happily, you are able to pull a revival of Verdi's ''Falstaff'' out of the hat, and the title role happens to be a Terfel speciality. (In fact, he will just have sung it at the Houston Grand Opera, from April 28 to May 15.) Whew! Opens May 28. Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Los Angeles, (213) 972-8001. www.laopera.com

June

QATSI TRILOGY -- Some of us think that Philip Glass's scores for Godfrey Reggio's high-minded films ''Koyaanisqatsi,'' ''Naqoyqatsi'' and ''Powaqqatsi'' are among his better work. And some of us, often the same people, think that Mr. Glass's scores may be the best parts of those earnest and simplistic films. Here is an opportunity to test those premises, as Mr. Glass performs the music with his ensemble to accompany the films. June 2-4. Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org

LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC -- By all reports, Avery Fisher Hall must seem a comedown after the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, but Esa-Pekka Salonen and the orchestra will presumably cope in two programs of works by Ravel, Stravinsky, Shostakovich and John Adams. June 3, 5. Avery Fisher Hall.

OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK -- This company has made a specialty of concert presentations of operas that are seldom presented in opera houses. In some cases you understand the neglect. In the case of Weber's ''Freischutz,'' you don't (or at least, I don't). Eve Queler conducts a performance with Charlotte Margiono, in her American debut, as Agathe and Johan Botha as Max. (But why Puccini's ''Fanciulla del West'' in a season when the New York City Opera is mounting a new production?) ''Freischutz,'' June 6. Carnegie Hall.

MAHLER'S SIXTH SYMPHONY -- Lorin Maazel ended each of his first two seasons as music director of the New York Philharmonic resoundingly, with a Mahler Symphony. But the two works so far -- the Second and the Third -- made for triumphal farewells. Best not to read anything into the fact that Mr. Maazel and the orchestra end this season on a tragic note, with the pulverizing Sixth Symphony. June 22-25. Avery Fisher Hall.

HEADLINE: Baseball's Origins: They Ain't Found Till They're Found

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
Textbooks once unequivocally stated that baseball was invented in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839, and provided as proof the picture of a dusty, ripped old ball pulled from an attic trunk. It turned out to be a hoax, baseball's first hidden-ball trick.
 The next official version put the origin in Hoboken, N.J., in 1846. That story stood until 2001, when a librarian found two 1823 newspaper references to ''base ball'' games in Lower Manhattan. Then in May, a clerk walked out of a library vault in Pittsfield, Mass., waving a faded ordinance from 1791 that banned the playing of baseball within 80 yards of the big church in the town square.
 Baseball history had a new king in the eternal run home. 
 Until the next discovery usurps Pittsfield, moving baseball's birthplace to another state or era, or both. Which raises the question: How come history can say what John Adams had for lunch on Jan. 24, 1776 (wild goose on a spit), but baseball cannot pinpoint its genesis within hundreds of years or thousands of miles?
 When it comes to baseball, there is no agreement on which century the first game was played. It could have been the 18th century; it could have been the 13th century. There is some record of each.
 There is no agreement on which continent baseball was invented either. Was it North America, Europe or Africa? There is some evidence for all three.
 Historians know more, for sure, about games played in 776 B.C. than they do about the first time someone hit a ball back, back, back, then broke into a preening trot.
 They know more about how Roman gladiators decided who would be first in line marching into the Colosseum than they do about the first time someone made up a baseball lineup, thereby entering the first arena of grandstand second-guessing.
 Recent best-selling biographies have laid bare the most copious details of the American past: Adams liked a nip of hard cider before breakfast; Franklin spent an hour each day nude in his chambers with the windows open; George Washington walked four miles a night.
 ''With a sport like baseball, which so reveres stats and its past,'' the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said, ''you would think that this major stat of the past would be the crown jewel to find. Baseball, after all, is the ultimate sport of figures and dates. The origin of the game is the fabulous treasure.''
 But as hot as the baseball birthplace trail may be, few believe the quest is heading into the final innings. Baseball history, in fact, may forevermore be unconstrained by age.
 ''People ask: when was the first baseball game?'' said John Thorn, the baseball historian who uncovered the existence of the Pittsfield ordinance during a middle-of-the-night Internet search. ''It may be an unanswerable question. That's what makes it eternally fascinating.''
 Tom Shieber, the curator of new media at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, said: ''The answer to the question is philosophical, like an archeologist wondering when man is man. We know there were ballgames going back many centuries. There is a reference to the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock playing ball. But was it baseball as we know it? And what is that?''
 Ted Spencer, the Hall of Fame's longtime curator, added another perspective.
 ''Did you know the Pittsfield ordinance also bans a bunch of other sports, including football?'' Spencer said. ''Did you know nobody cares? But they care that it mentioned baseball. I got calls from reporters all over the country. That's because baseball has a spiritual hold on the American public.''
 The most commonly accepted thesis is that baseball has no specific starting date or place of invention. The game, they say, evolved over time. ''Sprouting like a field of dandelions in the America of the late 1700's,'' Thorn said. Mr. Thorn pointed to the Pittsfield ordinance as evidence that baseball was rampant in 1791. ''They wouldn't have had to ban it to protect the new windows of the new meeting house if it wasn't already a nuisance to that building or others,'' he said.
 And although proud Pittsfield officials have taken to calling their economically waning city ''baseball's Garden of Eden,'' there is an acknowledgement that the city's time in the spotlight of baseball history may be transitory.
 ''The towns east of us in Massachusetts are older, and so are the towns south of us,'' said Dave Potts, a lifelong Pittsfield resident and local baseball historian. ''I'm sure they have good records. It will just take time for someone to find a reference to baseball in those files.''
 Piece by piece, baseball's historical research may progress in this manner for decades, especially as more and more records become available via the Internet. Still, it does lead to the same fundamental questions: Why has baseball's earliest history been so undiscovered? Why is it that the minutiae of the lives of celebrated American pioneers are so public --Ben Franklin failed math as a 9-year-old -- but until recently, little was done to trace baseball before 1823?
 ''Because the daily lives of prominent leaders in the American colonies were deemed important and someone wrote the details down,'' Mr. Shieber, the Hall of Fame's new media curator, said. ''But the games were child's play and often regarded as a wasteful use of time. They weren't documented in the same way.''
 Ms. Goodwin agreed that there have been stages to historical writing and research, with the first stage focusing on the conspicuous historical figures. ''But since then, people have been able to recreate the more unrecorded histories, like slave history and women's history,'' she said. ''So it's not that it is not there to be found. It takes concerted effort, in diaries and letters and writings.''
 David Block, a retired systems analyst and amateur baseball historian, maintained that academic scholarship into the origins of baseball had been lacking until recently.
 ''The research had long been dominated by myth and misconception,'' said Mr. Block, whose book ''Baseball Before We Knew It'' is to be published in January. ''Look at the Abner Doubleday story in Cooperstown. It never happened.''
 Placing the origin of baseball in Cooperstown in 1839 was the work of a turn-of-the-century commission empowered by A.B. Spalding, the sporting goods magnate, who manipulated the commission's findings to ensure the sport had, in his words at the time, ''an American dad.'' That became Doubleday, a Civil War officer, who was supposed to have laid out the first baseball diamond in a Cooperstown dirt field.
 In the latter half of the 20th century, this tale was wholly discredited, especially because Doubleday may have never set foot in Cooperstown. But by then there was a thriving, beloved Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
 The current wave of baseball researchers now focus their energy not on Cooperstown, but on debunking other myths, like the long-held belief that baseball evolved from the English game of rounders.
 Mr. Block, for example, said he has evidence not only that baseball is older than rounders, but also that baseball originated in England. He cited seven references to baseball in 18th-century English documents, and he said he had found a book written in German in 1796 that refers to ''English baseball.''
 ''They give rules of the game and it starts with a pitcher serving the ball to a batter,'' Mr. Block said. ''The batter has three tries to put the ball in play. The batter runs around something like bases. It defies reason that there isn't some linkage between baseball and the game they are describing.''
 The small gaggle of professional baseball historians relish each of these tidbits as they are unearthed, but some are past the point of being surprised. Inside the Hall of Fame, Mr. Spencer, the curator, pointed to a reproduction hanging on a wall. It is a drawing from Spain in 1251 of people playing a game.
 ''There's a bat and there's a ball,'' Mr. Spencer said, looking at the drawing. ''It looks like two guys playing baseball to me.''
 Not far away is another faint reproduction of an Egyptian wall inscription: pharaohs perhaps engaged in another baseball game.
 Some historians are optimistic that baseball's starting point will eventually be nailed down.
 ''In the last five years, we've moved the date of documented evidence back from 1846 to 1791, which is huge,'' Mr. Thorn, who discovered the Pittsfield ordinance, said. ''And we keep finding more clues. There is the evidence that has been cited from the Plymouth Plantation. The prospect of lassoing the origin of baseball more closely is good. Just because we don't have box scores and baseball cards from a team called the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock doesn't mean baseball wasn't happening there.''
 Perhaps there is some link there, and finding baseball's origin will now become a popular crusade, a sister cause to Americans' recent fascination with their historical forefathers.
 ''I guess the searching could go in any direction,'' Ms. Goodwin said, ''though it's hard to imagine John Adams playing baseball. But you never know.''
 You never know. Sort of like the baseball history version of Yogi Berra's ''It ain't over till it's over.''
 On Page 31 of David McCullough's biography ''John Adams,'' Adams describes in his diary his idyllic boyhood activities: ''making and sailing boats'' and ''swimming, skating, flying kites and shooting marbles, bat and ball.''
 John Adams was born in 1735.
 So there.

An article on Sunday about the origins of baseball misstated the middle initial of a sporting-goods entrepreneur who helped create a commission in the early 20th century to determine when and where baseball was invented. He was A.G. Spalding, not A.B.

COOPER UNION, NEW YORK -- The Santa Monica, Calif., firm Morphosis has built an international reputation with projects like the 1999 Diamond Ranch High School, in Pomona, Calif., whose fragmented corrugated-metal forms evoke a landscape that is breaking apart. Morphosis' design for Cooper Union's new academic building at Astor Place represents its first foray into Manhattan. The design, which will replace the school's 1908 Hewitt building, should bring a touch of Los Angeles irreverence to downtown New York. School officials plan to unveil the plan tomorrow. www.cooper.edu

'CIVIC SPIRIT: CHANGING THE COURSE OF FEDERAL DESIGN' -- A look at the federal government's Excellence in Architecture program, which was started in 1994 to raise the abysmal quality of architecture in government building design. The program's results have not always been stellar, but there are works of genuine architectural interest here, including Richard Meier's United States Courthouse building in Islip, N.Y., Antoine Predock's courthouse in El Paso, Tex., and Smith-Miller & Hawkinson's border station in Champlain, N.Y. Tomorrow-Nov. 10. Center for Architecture, New York. (212) 683-0023. www.aiany.org

ARCHITECTURAL BIENNIAL BEIJING 2004 -- The first in that city, the Beijing Biennial covers a spectacular array of projects, many scheduled for completion in time for the 2008 Olympic Games. Among them are the kind of colossal urban planning schemes that have made China one of the most vital centers of architectural experimentation in the world. And then there are major projects by luminaries like Rem Koolhaas, Herzog & de Meuron and Zaha Hadid. But the real reason to see the show is the spotlight it will cast on a rising generation of Chinese architectural talents like Yung Ho Chang, Ai Weiwei, Liu Jiakun and Zhang Lei. Trained in the years immediately following the cultural revolution, they offer a peek into China's future. Sept. 20-Oct. 6. China National Art Museum, Beijing. www.abbeijing.com/eindex.htm

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN, WASHINGTON -- The museum, which is part of the Smithsonian, stands on a prominent site on the Washington Mall just in front of the Capitol. Douglas Cardinal, the architect originally hired to design the project, conceived it as a composition of curvaceous forms that would contrast with the hard-edge limestone of Washington's traditional civic buildings. But the Smithsonian fired Mr. Cardinal in 1998. Mr. Cardinal was replaced by a team of architectural consultants that includes John Paul Jones, the Native American Design Collaborative and the Polshek Partnership. The result, according to Mr. Cardinal, is a serious compromise of the design's integrity. The museum opens Sept. 21. (202) 633-1000. www.americanindian.si.edu

'IMPORT/EXPORT: POSTWAR MODERNISM IN AN EXPANDING WORLD, 1945-75' -- Both the theme and location of Docomomo's eighth international conference, which will be held at Columbia University, could not be more timely. The group was originally founded in Holland to protect Modernist landmarks from the wrecking ball. As it has grown, however, Docomomo's mission has become more nuanced: to explore the uneasy relationship between Modernism's disdain for the past and the desire to preserve it. New York is still struggling to come to terms with such issues, as could be seen in the recent battle to save Eero Saarinen's 1960's-era T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport. Sept. 26-29. (212) 721-9502. Early registration closes on Wednesday and costs $370 for nonmembers. www.docomomo2004.org

CALTRANS DISTRICT 7 HEADQUARTERS, LOS ANGELES -- Another design by Morphosis, this one built. The 1.1 million-square-foot structure is the latest addition to a growing list of high-profile building projects in downtown Los Angeles that already includes Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall and Jose Rafael Moneo's Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. But with a towering, perforated metal facade that looms over City Hall, the design speaks as much of the California transit authority's role in shaping the identity of Los Angeles as of the city's cultural enlightenment. The opening ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 27.

AL-AZHAR PARK, CAIRO -- This vast 74-acre park in downtown Cairo is one of the most spectacular urban renewal projects in the Middle East; a massive urban dump is being transformed into the city's largest green space. The boldness of the scheme, however, lies in its social mission. Conceived by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, its aim is to combine thoughtful design and historic preservation with a broader economic program in an effort to revive one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. Architecture and preservation, in other words, are regarded as more than aesthetic issues; they become critical tools in the reshaping of a culture's social fabric. The park will be opened at a ceremony on Sept. 29.

October

'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING' -- This show traces the couple's long and prolific careers from their early years at the Bauhaus to their later work as part of a wave of emigres who helped carry the Modernist torch to America. It will also take a close look at the creative relationship between the talented husband-and-wife team, who produced a wide array of classic modern designs -- from furniture to textiles and greeting cards -- and who rarely collaborated on artistic ventures. Oct. 1-Feb. 27. Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York. (212) 849-8400.www.cooperhewitt.org

'GLAMOUR' -- Opulence is no longer a naughty word. Or at least that is the message behind an eclectic show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The show looks at how the notion of glamour is reflected in fashion, architecture and industrial design from the 1950's to today. Among the various objects and buildings exhibited will be a 1965 Jaguar E-type Coupe, Edward Durell Stone's 1954 design for the American Embassy in New Delhi, a 1992 ''Cowboy'' corset and chaps by Thierry Mugler, Mark Newsome's 1994 molded plastic chair and Herzog & de Meuron's 2003 Prada shop in Tokyo. Glamour fades, so expect some drearier examples as well. Oct. 9-Jan. 17. San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. (415) 357-4000. www.sfmoma.org

SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT BUILDING, EDINBURGH -- The Spanish architect Enric Miralles's $773 million monument has been attacked for its inflated budget and long construction delays, but it may also offer striking evidence of what architecture lost when he died of a brain tumor four years ago at 45. Miralles said the design was inspired by the small upturned fishing boats that line the Scottish coastline. The building's gently undulating concrete forms make it the most unusual work of architecture built in Scotland in at least a generation. Opening Oct. 9. www.scottish.parliament.uk

LES HALLES, PARIS -- The 1969 demolition of Victor Baltard's famed glass-and-iron pavilions, which housed the city's food halls, is still considered one of the greatest architectural disasters in Parisian history. A decade later, the halls were replaced by the Forum, an underground shopping mall that seemed to point to the city's gradual cultural demise. Now a competition sponsored by the French government seeks to rectify that urban atrocity. The list of architects includes Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, MVRDV/Winy Maas and David Mangin. City officials plan to announce a winner sometime in October. The selection is likely to stir up old ghosts, sparking more controversy and debate. Designs can be seen at: www.projetleshalles.com

November

WILLIAM J. CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL CENTER, LITTLE ROCK, ARK. -- The main feature of the center, set at the edge of the Arkansas River, is a 400-foot-long museum propped up on slender steel columns. The museum is meant to echo a series of old industrial bridges that span the river. Polshek Partnership, which designed the complex, has said the museum's form also acts as a metaphorical bridge to the 21st century. Architecturally, it embodies the progressive values of an earlier era. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to open the center on Nov. 18.
www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org

December

WHITNEY WATERWORKS TREATMENT FACILITY, NEW HAVEN -- A rare venture by a celebrated architect into the world of large-scale public works. Instead of a conventional stucco-clad shed, Steven Holl designed a structure whose curvaceous metal form evokes an apparition from another world. Set in a residential suburb not far from Yale, it is a testament to the level of invention that can be attained when the property values of academics and architects are at risk.

HEADLINE: Farewell to Pets, and to Free Breakfast?

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
RYAN SHERMAN doesn't mince words with apartment hunters. ''When I take a client out, I prepare them for the worst,'' said Mr. Sherman, a broker and executive vice president at Century 21 William B. May. Gone are the days when his clients could look at apartments and have a day to mull over the options. Now he insists that they come armed with bank statements, investment account information, a letter from their employer, at least two personal references and, most important, a checkbook.
 There is a new sense of urgency in the rental market, a marked change from earlier this year when the market was soft and some landlords were dangling a month's free rent and payment of broker fees to fill vacancies. ''Four months ago it might take two weeks, but now I can rent something in three days,'' said Peter Polow Jr., chief executive of P & G Equities, a development company that owns eight Manhattan buildings. 
 The rental market appears to have become tighter because there are simply more people hunting. With the economy improving, there are more corporate relocations, and with apartment prices high, there are more people who figure they just can't buy. In some cases, owners are selling so they can cash in on the high prices, and they are also looking for apartments to rent. ''The sales side of the market has really driven the rental market,'' said Scott Stewart, a vice president at the Corcoran Group. 
 As the rental market gets tougher, prime places, especially those below 23rd Street, don't remain available for very long. ''In midsummer, around July, we saw the inventory tighten up significantly,'' said Daren W. Hornig, chief executive of the Quest Group, which runs Dwelling Quest, a residential real estate brokerage firm. ''It is almost a race to get the apartment and get the application in.'' 
 Or as Chris Devilleneuve, a broker with Citi Habitats in the Upper East Side office, put it, ''It is almost like sales now.'' 
 Avnish Patel's apartment search spanned two and a half months, seven real estate brokers, 35 apartments and several weeks of sleeping on a friend's couch. ''There wasn't the availability that I expected -- it was a real painful process,'' said Mr. Patel, who eventually landed a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea. ''A few of the places had other applicants. Real estate agents would say, 'If it's not you, it's the next guy in an hour.' ''
 Landlords who have not had multiple applicants for apartments since 2000 once again have the luxury of choice. ''A lot of landlords are comparing applicants,'' said Gordon Golub, a broker with Citi Habitats. ''Previously, they weren't able to get one applicant; now they will have two or three.'' 
 Landlords can see how potential tenants measure up on length of employment, credit score, size and makeup of debt, and income. ''Landlords are getting back to what they were doing four and five years ago and asking for two months' security even if everything is perfect,'' Mr. Golub said. 
 Not only are landlords taking a harder look at a renter's financial picture, but more of them are requesting housing court reports that point to any previous litigation. ''That is one of the newer trends,'' said Yuval Greenblatt, manager of the rental department at Douglas Elliman. 
 Building policies also start to change. When the rental market becomes tighter, ''the dogs have to shrink,'' Mr. Greenblatt said. In a tougher market, 40-pound dogs are no longer welcome. Perks that luxury buildings offered to new tenants are also disappearing. ''One building was offering free breakfast five days a week, and that ended,'' Mr. Golub said. 
 When there are many financially stable apartment hunters, including some with a lot of capital from a recent apartment sale, landlords are less inclined to compromise and accept renters who want to carve out an extra bedroom with a temporary wall.
 Brokers report that apartments at the highest end of the market, such as those renting for more than $8,000 a month, still remain available for longer stretches. But over all, landlords are enjoying a boom they haven't seen in years.
 ''Last August every landlord was staying in the city because they were worried,'' said Mark Shemel, president of National Property Management Group, which manages more than 600 units across Manhattan. ''This year they were all away in the Hamptons.''

HEADLINE: Long Term in Drug Case Fuels Debate on Sentencing

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Weldon H. Angelos, a 25-year-old producer of rap records, will be sentenced Tuesday in federal court in Salt Lake City for selling several hundred dollars in marijuana on each of three occasions, his first offenses. He faces 63 years in prison.
 Laws that set mandatory minimum sentences require 55 of the 63 years because Mr. Angelos carried a gun while he sold the drugs. 
 ''It would appear effectively to be a life sentence,'' the judge, Paul G. Cassell of Federal District Court there, wrote in a request to the prosecution and the defense for advice about whether he has any choice but to send the man to prison forever. 
 Judge Cassell, a brainy, conservative former law professor, surveyed the maximum sentences for other federal crimes. Hijacking an airplane: 25 years. Terrorist bombing intending to kill a bystander: 20 years. Second-degree murder: 14 years. Kidnapping: 13 years. Rape of a 10-year-old: 11 years.
 He noted that Mr. Angelos would face a far shorter sentence in the courts of any state. In Utah, prosecutors estimate that he would receive five to seven years.
 The Angelos case may provide a glimpse of the future. The constitutionality of federal sentencing guidelines was called into doubt by a Supreme Court decision in June, but that thinking does not extend to laws that set mandatory minimum sentences. 
 If the court strikes down the guidelines this fall, as many expect, judges will have much greater discretion, to the dismay of many prosecutors and politicians who worry that judges are not tough enough on crime. 
 Sentencing guidelines are set by the United States Sentencing Commission, an agency of the judicial branch. The guidelines were intended to limit judges' discretion without locking them into one-size-fits-all sentences. Mandatory minimums, in contrast, are enacted by Congress and are part of the criminal code.
 ''The guidelines always have some sort of escape,'' said Jeffrey B. Sklaroff of the New York office of Greenberg Traurig, a law firm that represents 29 former judges and prosecutors who filed a brief in support of Mr. Angelos in July. ''A mandatory minimum means what it says: it is mandatory, and it is a minimum.''
 In Mr. Angelos's case, the drug offenses and related money-laundering convictions, for using drug money to buy a car and pay his rent, could subject him to eight years in prison. The mandatory minimums are for the additional offense of carrying a gun while selling drugs. Mr. Angelos carried a Glock pistol in an ankle holster when he sold marijuana on two occasions, though he did not brandish or use it. More guns were found in a briefcase and a safe at his home. 
 According to the indictment, some of the guns were stolen, though Mr. Angelos was not accused of being the thief. Judge Cassell is required to add five years for the gun in the first deal and 25 years each for the second deal and the guns found at his home. 
 The Supreme Court will decide whether to strike down the sentencing guidelines after it hears arguments in October, and some legislators are already signaling their preference for more mandatory minimums if the guidelines are deemed unconstitutional. 
 At a hearing in July on legislation that would increase drug sentences, Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, said, ''It seems clear that mandatory minimums may well take on added importance in assuring appropriate sentences for serious federal crimes as a result of the Supreme Court's actions.''
 Ronald H. Weich, a former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee who opposes mandatory minimums, said they had a political constituency. ''There is a real danger,'' Mr. Weich said, ''that we're heading back to mandatory minimums if guidelines are unconstitutional.''
 The Justice Department supports mandatory minimums, said Monica Goodling, a spokeswoman.
 ''Tough but fair mandatory minimum sentences take habitual lawbreakers off the streets, lock up the most dangerous criminals and help ensure the safety of law-abiding Americans,'' Ms. Goodling said. ''Since these common-sense policies were created, we've seen crime plummet to a 30-year low. The public, the Congress and presidents of both parties have supported mandatory minimums for a simple reason -- they work.'' 
 In June, just days after the Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, which struck down the sentencing system of Washington State, Judge Cassell was the first judge to say the logic of the decision required the voiding of the federal sentencing guidelines as well. In the Angelos case, he wrote that he took ''no joy'' in the ''potentially cataclysmic implications'' of that reasoning. 
 In Blakely, the Supreme Court held that all facts that could lead to longer sentences must be found by a jury. But the Washington law, like the federal guidelines, let judges make some such findings.
 ''There has not been a single case in the history of American criminal law with the immediate impact of this one,'' Frank O. Bowman, an Indiana University expert in sentencing law, said of Blakely. ''The United States Supreme Court has essentially shut down the criminal justice system or at least put it in a state of suspended animation.''
 Still, whatever the Supreme Court decides about how Blakely applies to the federal guidelines, cases like Mr. Angelos's will not be directly affected, for two reasons: a jury did find the facts about the guns he possessed, and another Supreme Court case says judges may find the facts supporting minimum sentences.
 Mr. Angelos's lawyers and the 29 former judges and prosecutors argue that the mandatory sentence in his case amounts to a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court has not been receptive to similar arguments in cases involving three-strikes laws and a first-time offender given life without parole for large-scale cocaine distribution.
 However, Judge Cassell has drawn a distinction in his academic work between the guidelines and mandatory minimums. In a Stanford Law Review article in April, he wrote that ''the federal sentencing guidelines, while tough, are not 'too' tough.'' But mandatory minimums, he wrote, ''can lead to possible injustices.''
 In court papers, prosecutors said Mr. Angelos ''trafficked in hundreds of pounds of high-grade marijuana,'' ''distributed cocaine and synthetic narcotics'' and ''affiliated himself with a violent street gang.'' These assertions, however, were not proved to a jury. 
 Last year, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court told the American Bar Association that ''in too many cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust.'' The association appointed a commission, which recently issued a report urging the abolition of such sentencing.
 ''There are real economic and human costs,'' said Douglas A. Berman, an Ohio State University expert on sentencing law, ''to putting everyone away for as long as humanly possible.''
 Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for Paul M. Warner, the United States attorney in Salt Lake City, said his office had no comment on the Angelos case. In general, Ms. Rydalch said, ''we will continue to enforce mandatory minimums so long as Congress tells us to.''

HEADLINE: 'Silver City'

 BODY:

Written by John Sayles. Opening Friday.
 If Dickie Pilager, the verbally impaired candidate for governor of Colorado played by Chris Cooper in ''Silver City,'' sounds familiar, it's no accident. The writer and director, John Sayles, makes no bones about the fact that Dickie is modeled on George W. Bush. Richard Dreyfuss plays Chuck Raven, his handler, and Maria Bello is Nora, one of the reporters who ambush Pilager near the state capitol.

REPORTER 1 -- With the amount of federal money coming to the state decreasing drastically----

DICKIE -- I'm not raising taxes.

REPORTER 1 -- But the shortfall for social programs----

DICKIE -- I repeat -- I'm not raising taxes. We can't just keep throwing the taxpayers' hard-earned money at these perceived -- and some of them I admit are real -- so-called social problems. We have to get our priorities straight. Education is a priority. Affordable housing for our working people is a priority. Health care is a priority. Our economy is a priority. The environmental -- the whole environmental arena -- that's a big priority. Building new roads and maintaining the present -- keeping the infrastructure in place, where it belongs, that's a priority ----

NORA -- What isn't a priority?

DICKIE -- (stumped) What's not a priority -- is those matters which are of less of a -- not that they're not important but -- if you're going to have a front burner which is where you want your priorities, like, cooking, there needs to be something sitting on the back one. And that's where your other organizations, your church people and -- organizations formed to help these things, will be happy to pitch in if only government would get out of their way.
A tiny amount of silence as the reporters try to unscramble this. Chuck Raven swoops in to the rescue ----

CHUCK RAVEN -- Press conference is at 2 o'clock, people! No fair hijacking my candidate when we're late for a meeting----
He has Dickie's arm and is spiriting him away.

DICKIE -- Where were you?

CHUCK RAVEN -- Gridlocked. Don't ever get caught out in the open like that.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Comeback In Downtrodden Beacon

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
DURING the waning years of the 20th century, even Beacon's spectacular position between a 1,500-foot-high mountain peak and the eastern shores of the Hudson River in southern Dutchess County failed to lure sightseers or shoppers, much less rouse development interest. One of a number of hard-pressed communities along the river, Beacon had sections along Main Street that ''resembled a bombed-out war district,'' the city's mayor, Clara Lou Gould, recalled recently.
 In the late 1960's and early 70's, the city's manufacturers -- hat makers, blanket factories and packaging plants, among them -- began departing. By the 1970's, a once-thriving inn had become a welfare hotel, and slums were proliferating. To this day, scars remain in the form of boarded-up storefronts in some sections of the downtown. 
 But especially on the eastern end of Main Street, a mile-long retail strip, and in patches near the river, there is evidence that the city is experiencing a comeback. New cafes and retail establishments have opened, and real estate brokers report that property values are on the upswing. 
 Although the first stirrings of new economic activity were felt in late 1990's, the strongest impetus for a rebirth came in the spring of 2003, when Dia:Beacon, a new 300,000-square-foot museum, opened on 31 acres next to the river. The Dia Arts Foundation located its shrine to minimalist and conceptualist art in a skylighted former Nabisco packaging factory, which was built in 1929, began shedding workers in the 1980's and ceased operations in 1991.
 Heralding the changes taking place in the city, an article last month in The Beacon Dispatch, a monthly newspaper that recently began publication, reported: ''There is a movement afoot in Beacon: factories are becoming museums; Main Street buildings are becoming art galleries; and the workers that once haunted the vast open spaces of the Nabisco box-printing plant have been replaced by artists of every stripe.''
 There has been more good news for the city, which the folk singer Pete Seeger has called home for 55 years. Developers recently submitted plans for Long Dock Beacon, a 160,000-square-foot mixed-use commercial development with a waterfront park on a 23-acre peninsula near the museum. The $40 million project, a joint effort of the nonprofit Scenic Hudson Land Trust in Poughkeepsie and Foss Group Beacon, a private group, is to include a 140-room hotel, three restaurants, stores and waterfront recreation like kayaking, among other things. It is scheduled to open in the spring of 2007.
 Meanwhile, couples like Patricia and Ben Hiza, graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., who had hoped to open a food-related business near New York City but were priced out of that market, have discovered the city. 
 Earlier this summer, the Hizas found 1,300 square feet of retail space in a turn-of-the-20th-century brick building on Main Street and opened Totis Gourmet, a food market and cafe, there. The couple, who have a 7-month-old son, Alonso, have also bought a two-family Victorian house in the city for about $250,000. ''We had to gain a foothold somewhere,'' Mr. Hiza said. ''And in many ways it's like SoHo here, only much less expensive.''
 He added that when he wants to visit New York City, ''it's really not that far away.'' The train ride to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North's Hudson Line takes about 72 minutes at peak commuter times and close to 90 minutes during off-peak hours. 
 The pair, who are in their late 20's, are typical of a new breed of residents moving to Beacon, said Charlotte Guernsey, the owner of Gate House Realty on Main Street. Miss Guernsey, 29, a fine arts graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, bought a turn-of-the-century brick building in the downtown five years ago. She gutted and renovated the dilapidated structure, and today apartments on the second and third floors that were renting several years ago for about $300 to $450 a month are going for about three times that amount, she said. Some financing for renovating the buildings' facades came from the city as a 10-year interest-free matching loan for $15,000. 
 The broker paid $225,000 for the three-story brick 1890's building with 8,000 square feet in two storefronts and six apartments. 
 Douglas H. Berlin, a New York City developer, has used federal money disbursed by the county to build both market-rate and below-market-rate apartments over stores along Main Street. Storefronts with 1,400 square feet of space, 12-foot-high ceilings, exposed brick walls and hardwood floors are renting for about $2,000 a month, he said, about twice what the space would have fetched five years ago.
 Mr. Berlin also opened his own business, the Piggy Bank, a Southern barbecue-style restaurant, on Main Street in a building that was formerly used as a bank and before that as a flophouse. 
 ''Even though much of Main Street was boarded up and a mess,'' Mr. Berlin said, ''I fell in love with it.'' His tenants today include restaurateurs, art gallery owners and antiques dealers, among others.
 Beacon, about 60 miles north of New York City and about 90 miles south of Albany, was incorporated in 1913, a combination of the villages of Fishkill Landing and Matteawan. It was named Beacon to commemorate historic fires that blazed on the summit of the Fishkill Mountains and warned Revolutionary soldiers of the movement of the British troops.
 ''By the 1930's and 40's, Beacon was being touted as the biggest little city in America,'' said Ori Brachfeld, a locksmith in Beacon since 1987 and chairman of the Beacon Economic Development Task Force, which is affiliated with the Greater Southern Dutchess Chamber of Commerce. ''Then it went into a period of serious decay.''
 Nowadays, with train service to New York City and high-speed highways like Interstates 84 and 87 nearby, Beacon is hoping to tap into a general economic rebirth of the region, Mr. Brachfeld said. In Poughkeepsie, I.B.M. is thriving again, after a downsizing about a decade ago, and the company has opened a chip manufacturing plant in East Fishkill.
 Also, reflecting renewed development in the Upper Hudson area, Metro-North has plans to begin ferry service for commuters from the west side of the river to Beacon, where they can board trains to Grand Central Terminal. 
 But while most communities in lower Dutchess County are attracting mainly a commuter population, Beacon is also seeking to fill another role, said William Ehrlich, a developer who helped to form the Beacon Cultural Foundation, a nonprofit group, in a former high school.
 The 130,000-square-foot yellow brick school building was purchased for $4.25 million and now has 45 artists working there. Studio space in former classrooms at the building, now known as Bulldog Studios, rents for about $6 a square foot a year, including heat and electricity. 
 ''We're not talking Chelsea here,'' said Mr. Ehrlich, who also owns two vacant former hotels, including one that was the Dibble Opera House in the early 1900's.
 He added: ''A postindustrial community like Beacon needs to have an identity and offer things that people can't find elsewhere. The best idea is to brand it as a cultural community.''

HEADLINE: Tastes of India, Tailored for a New Generation

BYLINE: By JEFF GROSSMAN

 BODY:
WHEN Simson Kalathara walks across the street to the Ambadi restaurant, he doesn't always recognize the pastries arrayed in the display case. A meal served in his Bengal Tiger restaurant is prepared just as it would be in India. His three children, who opened Ambadi in White Plains last month, rely on recipes of their own design. Like many business owners in Westchester, the family is adapting to make Indian culture more accessible to a generation that was born in New York.
 ''We're working on different things, like sandwiches and wraps with an Indian kick to it,'' said John Simson, 22, who runs Ambadi with his brother Matthew, 25, and his sister Mary, 19. They offer chicken tikka both as a traditional plate and as a roll, and chicken tandoori as a salad and in a pita. ''We want to bring things together, but at the same time keep the things that people relate Indian food to, like the curries and the breads,'' said Mr. Simson, who took his father's first name as his last name. 
 The Indian population in Westchester is changing, said Parthasaradhi Pillai, owner of the Swami International grocery in New Rochelle. His inventory has been updated to accommodate second-generation adults, who are less likely to spend time preparing meals from scratch. He still sells 13 kinds of rice in bulk, but he has added pre-prepared items like frozen roti wraps and fish curries. 
 In Elmsford, Kirit Sanchala added boxes of ready-to-eat meals to the shelves at his Bhavik Cash and Carry three months ago. They have become the store's hottest-selling items. Customers who want roti bread can make it themselves from five-pound bags of chapatti flour, they can use the newly added ready-to-cook dough, or they can get it already made in whole wheat or regular.
 Everyone chooses the frozen, ready-made bread, because the ''youngsters'' don't have time to make it any other way and never learned how, said Rani Rangraj, a preschool teacher in her 50's and a Swami customer.
 Many of the county's 10,000 residents of Indian heritage came to the United States in the late 1960's, said Bhagvat Jani, president of the Indian American Cultural Association of Westchester and owner of the Jani Pharmacy in Yonkers. ''Now the second generation is coming up very, very rapidly, because they go to school over here, they go to college over here, and they are in the mainstream,'' he said.
 Mr. Pillai, 52, who came to this country from Kerala 26 years ago, said: ''The community is growing, growing, growing economically, educationally and socially too. Before, it was not like this. They came, had a job and made some money to take care of their families in India. Now, when the kids are growing up, they know that there is no way they're going back.''
 At Bengal Grocery and Gifts, Mr. Kalathara's wife, Rosamma, keeps shelves of cookbooks behind the register. If customers are new to Indian cooking, she helps them pick out the right recipe and shows them the spices they'll need. 
 Madhumita Chakrabartti is taking singing lessons at the Asavari dance and music school in White Plains to make up for missed opportunities growing up in Calcutta. While her sisters were studying Indian classical music, Ms. Chakrabartti listened instead to Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and Judy Collins. 
 ''I always had in the back of mind that I loved Indian music, that I would love to get lessons, but once I came here it was very hard to find a teacher and go there on a regular basis,'' said Ms. Chakrabartti, 42, who came to Westchester in 1984. She still sings folk music as part of the Walkabout Clearwater Chorus founded by Mr. Seeger, but she has also been studying Hindustani vocals for just over a year. 
 ''I have a nice balance, so that if at the end of the day, if I don't see one Hindi film or I haven't met anybody Indian in a few days I feel lesser, that's not the case, but I do need to connect,'' she said. ''I think there's always going to be that need to connect.'' 
 ASAVARI specializes in a form of traditional Indian dance called Kathak because it is the most inclusive, said Gargi Bagchi, the school's owner, choreographer and primary teacher. It draws from both Hindi and Muslim cultures, and Ms. Bagchi teaches separate classes in each form. A whirling dance using spins and flaring skirts, Kathak tells stories of Hindi gods and Islamic rulers. Ms. Bagchi is choreographing a recital combining both elements to explain the plight of war-torn Kashmir. The dance will be performed by her students as part of the annual Diwali celebration at the South Street Seaport in early October. 
 Asavari's students include both Indian-born parents and their American-born children. Rene Parmar, 43, took up Kathak along with her 6-year-old daughter, Nidhi Perianayagam. 
 ''I feel like she should grow up understanding the classical aspects of Indian culture,'' said Ms. Parmar, a professor at St. John's University. ''She likes Indian songs and movies, but that's pop. I really wanted her to understand the classical traditions, how beautiful they are and what they have to contribute.''
 In addition to Kathak classes, Asavari offers instruction in more contemporary folk dance and in Tabla, a traditional form of two-drum percussion. The school, which started in 1997, has about 50 students. Lessons range from $20 to $25 on weekdays and from $25 to $30 on weekends. 
 The Kalathara family offers Indian cooking for purists and newcomers alike. Bengal Tiger, their flagship restaurant, has been a fixture on East Post Road since 1975. Mr. Kalathara learned to cook in New Delhi while training to serve in the Indian foreign service. His restaurant employs a chef for appetizers, a chef for desserts and a chef for the spicier cuisine of southern India. 
 A meal at Bengal Tiger is meant to be leisurely, and prices begin at $13 for the lunch buffet. Across the street at Ambadi, the most expensive dishes cost $9.95. Lunch boxes including an entree, rice, vegetables and naan bread are designed to be carried out.
 ''We're trying to make Hindi food more mainstream,'' John Simson said.

HEADLINE: Universal Horror, Local Remembrance

BYLINE: By JAMES E. YOUNG. 
James E. Young, chairman of the department of Judaic and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is the author, most recently, of ''At Memory's Edge.'' He served on the World Trade Center Memorial design jury.

 BODY:
While a lot of attention has been paid to the 9/11 memorial in Lower Manhattan, not enough has been focused on the memorials that are springing up throughout Long Island, Westchester and New Jersey. That's a shame, because each has a special importance. And with each new design or proposal, more questions arise: When are there enough memorials? Does every town have to have its own? 
 In the face of difficult, even combative discussions about the design and location of memorials, some even voice the fear that the very memorials they hope will unite a community around its grief have actually become divisive and alienating, an unseemly airing of local political laundry. 
 Take Chappaqua, N.Y.. While the town has now decided to build a memorial to the three residents who were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, it took a year, a lawsuit (which was eventually thrown out) and much discussion for the townspeople to come to that decision. Naturally, no one wanted to be seen as against a memorial, but many had legitimate concerns about the proposed location and the traffic it might bring. Others argued that the proposed design, which included steel beams from the World Trade Center, was too graphic and offensive. 
 It might be helpful for those feeling bruised by the Chappaqua debate to remember that memorialization is a long and sometimes agonizing process, one that began immediately after the towers fell back in September 2001. The first memorials to the 9/11 attacks and their victims came in the posted fliers of the missing, the candles and vigils at Union Square, on the Esplanade in Brooklyn Heights, and elsewhere around the city. These photos and descriptions of loved ones were the first spontaneous commemorations of loss and grief. With their pictures and descriptions of loving fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, these fliers read almost as epitaphs on paper instead of stone, as perishable and transitory as the hope that inspired them. These families' missing loved ones were, in turn, remembered and mourned by all who came across these ''found memorials.'' 
 Further stages of memorialization included the ever-changing landscape of destruction at ground zero. Where the seven-story mountain of tangled and jutting ruins stood literally as a remnant of the ferocity of the attack and mass death, the gigantic hole in the ground now stands literally for the immeasurable void left in our lives and hearts, an open wound in the cityscape.
 The feverish pace of attempted rescue and clean-up leading to the brink of rebuilding downtown bespeaks the need of all to remember this terrible breach by repairing it. Indeed, many still feel that the best memorial to those who died on Sept. 11 is the rebuilding of the site itself, a place where lives lost would be commemorated by new buildings and new lives lived. 
 From the outset, however, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has wisely taken a long and capacious view of its mission, which might be summarized in its motto, ''Remember, Rebuild, Renew.'' What has also become clear in all of these memorials -- from Michael Arad and Peter Walker's winning design for ground zero to Frederic Schwartz's sublime sculptural assembly of ascending steel rods in Valhalla, N.Y., to the commemorative scattering of petals in the surf at Point Lookout Park on Long Island's South Shore -- is that the memorialization of the 9/11 attacks and their victims must be seen as a process, a process that is in many ways the life-blood of memory itself. 
 For as a process, every memorial demands its own space and time, its own competition, its own debate and negotiated result. As a process, the memorial is animated and sustained by the public give and take, the debates, the constant working through. 
 In this view, the welcome advent of memorials to the victims of the 9/11 attacks in every borough of the city, as well as in nearly every neighboring suburb, is perfectly understandable. From New York City to Westchester to Long Island and New Jersey, every community deserves its own memorial, one that reflects its particular losses, ways of mourning and understanding of these terrible events. 
 Memory is necessarily repetitive, but these memorials are anything but redundant. Each should have its own process, one that is as messy and noisy as the next. Despite the well-intentioned offers to unify the necessarily disparate memories of different regions with 9/11 icons (like the twin beams or steel fragments of the towers), every community must take the time to find its own expression, on its own terms. 
 Some will conduct full-scale competitions, and others will invite native artists to help them articulate their grief. But if all see their memorials as processes, each a part of an over-arching process larger than themselves, all will give themselves room to remember as they see fit. 
 After all, these 9/11 memorials are both personal and public, individual and communal. In the spaces of these memorials, mourners come to remember the victims of 9/11 together -- and separately. There will always be room in these memorials for both kinds of memory.

HEADLINE: Your Ship Just Came In. But What if It's Low Tide?

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
IN 1990, Holly McWhorter, then 20, was badly injured in an automobile accident. She had a series of operations over nine years, and it wasn't until 2002 that she received a six-figure settlement for her ordeal. 
 She had no experience in investing and needed to figure out what do with the cash. ''That accident changed the course of my life,'' said Ms. McWhorter, who is now a studio musician in Manhattan. She was determined to make the most of the money. 
 Her first step was to seek out a financial planner. She interviewed 10 before settling on Lewis Altfest in Manhattan, who put most of the cash into a diversified portfolio of stock and bond mutual funds. While the move panned out well in 2003, a very good year for the stock market, it has been more difficult recently to find good investment opportunities. Ms. McWhorter's portfolio is now 65 percent in stock funds and 35 percent in bond funds.
 ''I don't see much value in the markets for stocks, bonds and commodities,'' said Mr. Altfest, who added that he was struggling to find any attractively priced investments. ''I'm a value player, and there's very little out of favor now.'' 
 The current investment climate can be difficult for all investors, but it poses a particular problem for people who have come into substantial sums of money. Many financial advisers recommend that people in this situation take the first year or two to invest the money gradually, keeping a substantial amount in cash early on. That may help protect them from sudden downdrafts in the markets, and from the urge to suddenly cash out their holdings at a loss. Such quick sales may be a strong temptation for investors who have strong emotions about how they came by the money -- whether it was from an inheritance, a divorce settlement or the sale of a business that took a lifetime to build. 
 Mr. Altfest says he has been trying to protect investors by directing some of their money into the few areas where he sees good deals. For some wealthy investors, these include limited partnerships in natural resources or land, like one that owns Texas farmland outside Dallas; he is also looking into a number of timberland partnerships. He said that undeveloped commercial land, as well as land rich in natural resources, had more potential to appreciate than residential real estate, which has already surged in value. 
 He also said he expected the Japanese economy to continue to strengthen, and he recently raised Ms. McWhorter's stake in mutual funds focusing on Japan to 10 percent of her total portfolio. That share is divided between the Matthews Japan fund and the Sparx Japan fund. 
 ''There's more focus on profitability within Japan,'' Mr. Altfest said. ''The returns on investment, which have been very low the last 20 years, are starting to move up.''
 He bought the Sparx Japan shares for Ms. McWhorter by using the proceeds from the sale of a Manhattan apartment she bought soon after the settlement two years ago. She sold it at a profit in April this year. 
 ''I'd rather have my money in real estate than anything else,'' she said. ''It just seems the smart thing to do. But it's getting harder to find a one-bedroom that needs work.''
 Indeed, many investment professionals counsel against buying residential property now. ''Most people would say that real estate prices might be lower in two years rather than higher,'' said Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York.
 Everything hasn't been smooth sailing for Ms. McWhorter, who has learned some investing lessons the hard way. She bought a small amount of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia stock in January 2000, long before the settlement, because she liked the company; and she acknowledged that she kept it longer than Mr. Altfest had advised. She sold it in December 2002 at a loss of more than 50 percent. ''Martha let me down big time,'' she said.
 Ms. McWhorter's 65-35 split in stock and bond funds is a fairly standard portfolio allocation, but some market analysts have been urging a more conservative approach lately. Standard & Poor's recently recommended that investors lower their position in American stocks and hoard more cash; Merrill Lynch is advising clients to have a portfolio allocation of 45 percent stocks, 45 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
 ''Everyone believes that stocks outperform in the long run,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch. ''But back in the 30's, 40's and 50's, people didn't believe that stocks would outperform; they thought they would go bankrupt.'' Now that most investors think equities are more profitable than bonds, shares are priced accordingly, he said.
 MR. BERNSTEIN expects that stock returns may beat bonds by only one to two percentage points, annualized, over the next three to seven years. And he says he thinks that all asset classes will average returns of 5 to 8 percent, annualized, over the next seven years. ''People have this expectation that they can get 10, or 15, or 20 percent per year if they find the right asset class,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''And that's probably not going to happen.''
 He is recommending a handful of defensive stock sectors: consumer staples, health care, utilities and telecommunications -- but not wireless companies. He says he also thinks investors should favor dividend-paying companies with strong balance sheets. Although foreign markets have prospered over the last year, he said, investors should be wary of emerging markets because they're ''highly cyclical, and it looks like the global economy is going to slump.''
 Of course, people sometimes receive big sums of money at inopportune times for investing. Recipients should think first about how the money can transform their lives, said Lee Rosenberg, a financial planner in Jericho, N.Y. ''Windfalls may happen once in a lifetime, so it has to be meaningful,'' he said. 
 People with a lot of debt, he said, may want to use part of their new money to pay it down. That is a more conservative approach than investing in the markets, but some investors do not seem to understand that reducing their debt is a form of saving, he added.
 He also said that moving too swiftly to invest a windfall, particularly after a long market rally, could jeopardize the intangible benefits of coming into money -- like peace of mind. 
 Ms. McWhorter would tend to agree. ''In light of the traumatic way I got the money,'' she said, ''it has allowed me to slow down if I need a break, to chill out without thinking, 'How am I going to pay the rent?'''

HEADLINE: In a Tidal Wave, China's Masses Pour From Farm to City

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
ANYONE who has visited China's ballooning, chaotic cities cannot help but notice the construction cranes. It is not unheard of to count 50 cranes, maybe more, rising between new concrete apartment towers or thickets of half-built skyscrapers. They twist in the twilight haze like enormous insects.
 Less obvious are the armies of migrant workers toiling below: the soot-faced men in yellow hard hats pouring cement at infinite work sites; the farmers arriving at bus or train stations, often hundreds at a time with possessions bundled in nylon sacks; the girls flooding out of thousands of dying villages to fill the humming factories along China's southern coast. 
 But it is the workers that history is likely to notice. 
 The tide of these migrants, surging for years yet still gathering speed, has now reached historic dimensions: China is in the midst of the largest mass migration the world has ever seen. Not that the rest of the world is paying much attention, because this migration does not involve crossing borders. 
 But its scale already dwarfs the migrations that reshaped America and the modern Western world. China, by official count, has 114 million migrant workers who have left rural areas, temporarily or for good, to work in cities, and that doesn't include tens of millions of family members who moved with them. Government experts predict the number will rise to 300 million by 2020, eventually to 500 million. Today, Shanghai alone has three million migrant workers; by comparison, the entire Irish migration to America from 1820 to 1930 is thought to have involved perhaps 4.5 million people.
 ''This is the largest movement in human history,'' said Cheng Li, a government professor at Hamilton College, in Clinton, N.Y., who specializes in China. ''It is far bigger, and the speed is unprecedented.''
 For now, the government is encouraging migration to promote its immediate goal of providing cheap factory and construction labor and its long-term goal of urbanization. Every wealthy modern nation has had to shift from a rural-based economy to an urban one in order to prosper. China is trying to make this transition -- which involves a fifth of the world's population -- in record time. How well, or poorly, the government handles this migration will determine whether these workers help create a middle-class society or just form a permanent underclass in a country that has already become sharply divided between rich and poor. 
 The Chinese are also trying to do it with a political system that once isolated farmers in a virtual apartheid and remains among the most oppressive in the world. Even as restraints ease, migrants often live as outcasts in cities; they lack full residency rights and are often denied basic services like schooling and health care. 
 In September, Zeng Peiyan, a member of China's state council, or cabinet, announced that migrant workers at thousands of construction projects, many of which are authorized by the government, were owed $43 billion in unpaid wages. ''Some have remained unpaid for up to 10 years,'' he said, according to state media.
 But they keep coming because poverty in the countryside is hopeless. In this way, China's migrants are like the illegal immigrants in the United States. The farmer from Ecuador who pays a trafficker to smuggle him to a job in an American chicken plant is not much different from a peasant from rural Henan Province who follows a construction boss to Shanghai. 
 Both are exploited and work with few legal protections. Both share crowded apartments with other migrants. But both send back much of what they earn to relatives left behind. Last year, China's migrants sent back $45 billion. The countryside would die without it.
 Even as China has succeeded in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, the Asian Development Bank recently estimated that 583 million of its 1.3 billion people still live on less than $2 a day; 203 million of those live on less than $1 a day. Most are in the countryside.
 For America's defining domestic migrations, history has recorded specific triggers: the 300,000 people who headed west in the California Gold Rush were chasing the news that a small gold nugget had been discovered in a valley of the Sierra Nevada. The ''Okies'' who flooded the West Coast during the 1930's were running from the Depression and the Dust Bowl. And the blacks who went north early in the 20th century were escaping Southern prejudice and Jim Crow laws.
 The seminal events in China were Deng Xiaoping's decision in 1978 to focus on economic development, and the booming growth that followed. But the triggers have been small bureaucratic adjustments that have gradually loosened the draconian control levers of the Maoist era, when a system of household registration essentially shackled people to their villages or cities.
 Huang Ping, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said an early step was the introduction in the 1980's of national identification cards, which allowed people to travel and find work more easily. Before, he said, any traveler needed a letter from local officials as well as a household registration card. Later, he said, a system of food coupons that could be used only at local markets was abolished. And, gradually, the household registration system has been loosened.
 During the 1980's, most migrants sought work in midsize cities in their home provinces. These cities still absorb many of the migrants. But millions now travel 1,000 miles or more to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other huge cities, where economic growth is fastest.
 Experts say at least 7 million to 10 million new migrants leave the farm each year, in a trend that is expected to continue. This perception of a limitless labor pool is occasionally contradicted; last month, officials in Guangdong Province, in the south, complained of worker shortages. But some analysts say the problem is not shortages but horrific conditions and unlivable wages that have caused the workers to move on. 
 Technically, this is a ''seasonal'' migration, since most workers return home briefly, once or twice a year, to visit family and plant or harvest crops. But more migrants are moving permanently with their families as the urban transition rushes forward. Of course, allowing people to move has been the easy part. Now China's leaders face the job of providing migrants with legal protections, affordable housing, access to schooling and health care. These expensive building blocks are needed to create a real middle-class civil society. The government has started taking some small steps, but major changes will not come easily for a Communist Party rife with corruption and loath to open its political system. 
 THERE is also the challenge of keeping people employed. If China's economy slowed too much, tens of millions of migrants would be out of work. With so many more people expected to move, the economy will need to roar for a long time.
 Scott Rozelle, a University of California at Davis professor who specializes in China's rural economy, said much credit for China's prolonged growth belongs to migrant workers who have added value to the economy. 
 Rural China, now home to about two-thirds of the population, may one day have barely 10 percent. ''That means about 800 million people have to move,'' he said.
 ''But 150 million already have.''

HEADLINE: Peruvian Train

 BODY:

To the Editor: Regarding ''The High Road in the Andes'' (Aug. 15) by Robin Cembalest, in 2003 the face of extreme wealth became symbolized in the luxury train Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu. This is a $416.50 (round trip), three-and-a-half-hour ride in a land where the descendants of the Incas are either unemployed or live on less than $100 per month.
 Ms. Cembalest does indeed describe well the fringe benefits of the ride and the high costs of hotels nearby. I am the main representative to the United Nations for Yachay Wasi, an indigenous educational organization based in Cuzco. The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development stated in 1999 that ethics should be at the core of sustainable tourism. Sustainable tourism, not to be confused with eco-tourism, would empower indigenous and/or local communities to gradually take control of this rich industry, which currently benefits outside ownerships.
 The current tourism practice at Machu Picchu in Peru mostly benefits the British train company Orient-Express, which operates PeruRail, and enables class segregation.

MARIE-DANIELLE SAMUEL
New York, N.Y.

Filip Boyen, managing director of Orient-Express Peru, responds: Orient-Express provides constant community support in the region, which has a strong focus on environmental protection and local training programs. We feel this clearly demonstrates a responsible outlook by the company, as well as Orient-Express's steady commitment to sustainable tourism in the region.
 In our train and hotel operations in Peru, Orient-Express has a 50/50 partnership with a Peruvian company, and nearly 100 percent of the workforce is Peruvian. 
 Regarding access to Machu Picchu for Peruvians: PeruRail has an entire range of prices on the Cuzco-Machu Picchu route, including subsidized rates to Peruvian nationals to ensure that they have an economical means of access.

HEADLINE: Is Credit Substituting For Rising Wages?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re "The Next Shock: Not Oil, but Debt'' (Economic View, Sept. 5), about the economic risks of increasing personal and government debt:
 High levels of consumer debt are unlikely to drop anytime soon, because abundant credit and rising home prices have allowed employers to avoid wage hikes that would keep pay in line with rising costs for basic needs. The competitiveness of American industry is fueled as much by easy consumer credit as it is by productivity and technological breakthroughs -- not because credit cards make it easy to buy that new television, but because when basic needs become difficult to afford, credit cards, not wage increases, are there to pick up the slack. Saving is difficult when even a minor car repair or a visit to the dentist costs a week's wages, but a $10,000 line of credit eases that stress. 
 We will not yet have to pay for our high debt levels, because it would cost our employers -- not us -- far too much.

Renting a Vacation Condo

Q. My wife and I love to travel, but because of a highly restricted diet, we prefer lodgings with a full kitchen. Is there a Web site or association with listings of so-called travel condos? -- Bill Davis, New York, N.Y.

A. Renting a condominium not only has the advantages of a kitchen, and such amenities as a washer and dryer, housekeeping and other hotel conveniences but also frequently represents a saving compared with a hotel room. One source of information for condos in the continental United States and Hawaii is ResortQuest, founded in 1998 and based in Nashville, which manages 20,000 rental properties at 52 resort areas; (800) 467-3529 or www.resortquest.com.
 Another resource is ResorTime.com, in Carlsbad, Calif., which offers hundreds of timeshare resort condos in North America to the general public with no minimum stay. While you do not have to become a member to book a condo with the company, members get weekly updates on availability, a directory and special rates (a premier membership costs $29.95 annually). Information: (877) 477-7368 or at www.resortime.com. 
 VacationCondos.com, (800) 932-6658, is one of a number of companies that list properties but do not manage them; it specializes in Florida resorts and has listings in Mexico and the Caribbean as well. Condos range from economy (small kitchenettes, limited living spaces, etc.) to deluxe (from self-contained resort to hillside villa with pool). 
 Yet another option is to check with an association of rental managers, such as Vacation Rental Managers Association, whose members represent more than 130,000 properties in the United States, Canada and Mexico; www.vrma.com.

Special Cruises

Q. Are there any cruises that are fully nonsmoking? What about singles cruises and dance cruises? -- Mary Crescenzo, Ossining, N.Y.

A. Finding a fully nonsmoking cruise is difficult; the Paradise, a Carnival vessel once billed as smoke-free, is ending such cruises. Most ships generally confine smoking to port or starboard decks (not both), cabins, casinos and bars; smoking is traditionally banned in restaurants and theaters. Smaller ships on rivers and canals are more likely to ban smoking except in a few designated areas.
 Uniworld Cruises, for example, does not allow smoking anywhere but on the open sun deck of its ships, nor is smoking allowed on any sightseeing vehicles on shore. The line offers river cruises in Europe, China and Russia, and along South America and the Adriatic. Information: (800) 733-7820, www.uniworld.com.
 There are all sorts of theme cruises, but most are charters, with groups chartering all or part of a ship. For singles cruises, a number of organizations buy up a block of cabins, and have a cruise director specifically for that group. For example, SinglesCruise.com, (800) 393-5000, organizes an average of one cruise a month with 200 to 500 singles to the Caribbean, West Coast, Mexican Riviera and Hawaii. 
 One company that does offer exclusively singles itineraries is Escapade Cruises and Tours on Windjammer Cruises ships. This year five were scheduled, with six-day Caribbean cruises departing Nov. 1 and Dec. 6, from $900 and $1,000, double occupancy, respectively, plus port charges. Passengers have the option of being matched with a roommate; single occupancy is double the price. Information: (888) 775-0288, extension 241, or at vacations.singlescruises-tours.com. 
 As for dance, no matter what kind you like, you should be able to find a cruise with like-minded passengers. DanceFun, for example, books a block of cabins, up to 150 passengers, on major cruise lines; it has been offering dance cruises since 1989 and organizes 7 to 10 a year. Its eight-day Jan. 8 salsa cruise aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines' Star out of Los Angeles stops at Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, Cabo San Lucas and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa; from $799, double, including all classes and dances; port tax not included. A seven-day Jan. 23 country dance cruise on Carnival's Pride has a similar itinerary; from $599, plus port tax. Information: (866) 326-2338 or dancefun.com. 
 And the annual Hustle Dance Cruise, on Royal Caribbean's Enchantment of the Seas, departs Fort Lauderdale Jan. 27 for a five-day cruise to Key West and Cozumel. The group expects to book from 250 to 300 dance passengers, and will offer 20 hours of dancing and workshops, with contests and games. Prices start at $400 a person, double occupancy, plus port tax; (954) 431-7771 or www.hustlecruise.com. 
 Generally, to learn about theme cruises, according to Karen Nelson, spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association, your best bet is to contact a travel agent, who has specific, updated information. 

Prague-Vienna Music Tours

Q. Are there companies that arrange travel to Prague and Vienna that would include tickets to concerts and attractions associated with musicians of the 18th to 20th centuries? -- Linda Lewis, New York, N.Y.

A. One company that might fit the bill is Morgan Tours, in Ottawa, which has offered cultural tours since 1979. Next year it is offering a Prague-Vienna-Budapest tour, May 8 to 22, but you may take only the Prague-Vienna part of the tour, May 8 to 18. Included in the shorter trip are eight performances and tours in Prague of the Dvorak Museum; Villa Bertramka, where Mozart stayed; and Vysehrad, where Dvorak and Smetana are buried. Stops in and near Vienna include the home of Janacek in Brno and Figaro House, where Mozart composed ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' The price is $5,445 a person, double, for the Prague-Vienna trip, including all tickets but not air fare. Information: (800) 667-4268; www.morgantours.com.
 Or you might consider Cross-Culture, in Amherst, Mass., which will offer a music-themed Prague, Vienna and Salzburg trip next year, Aug. 4 to 14. The itinerary will include World Heritage Sites, numerous performances and tours of museums and gardens. The price is $3,495 a person, double occupancy, without air fare. In addition, the company offers Prague and the International Music Festival each September, which includes three festival performances as well as tours of the city, with visits to music-related attractions in Prague and in Bohemia, where Mahler, Dvorak, Smetana, Martinu, Mozart and Beethoven spent time. This year's tour, $3,020 a person, double, without air fare, is sold out. Next year the tour is set for Sept. 28 to Oct. 6, with prices available in October.

HEADLINE: To The Lighthouse And Beyond

BYLINE: By Daphne Merkin. 
Daphne Merkin, a novelist and critic, is working on a memoir of depression, ''Melancholy Baby.''

 BODY:
I went to Cornwall to see the lighthouse -- Virginia Woolf's, that is, the one that stands tantalizingly out of reach until the very end of what is arguably her best novel, ''To the Lighthouse.'' The novel is Woolf's most autobiographical. (Transfixed by the portrait of their mother, her sister Vanessa wrote, ''It is almost painful to have her so raised from the dead.'') Set in the Hebrides, it is based on Woolf's recollections of idyllic childhood summers spent at St. Ives on the Cornish coast.
 Unlike the green light that winks at the end of the dock in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby,'' the lighthouse that lends itself to the title of Woolf's novel is not merely a writerly conceit. It actually exists in the form of the Godrevy lighthouse, which you can see off in the distance from the end of the quay that runs along the pier at St. Ives. It was in search of a glimpse of this literary landmark that my 14-year-old daughter, Zoe, and I traveled early in July to the southwestern tip of England, where the country narrows down into a shape approximating a human foot. 
 The stark white Godrevy stands on an island of its own at the head of St. Ives Bay, looking oddly less substantial in real life than as a symbol on the page -- a delicate spire rather than an imposing tower. I had impressed upon my daughter the great significance of this occasion, explaining that it would create a link between me and the writer I most admired, but she looked decidedly underwhelmed. You could hardly see the lighthouse, she pointed out, and wasn't I sick of Virginia Woolf already?
 The sun flashed off the water, which glimmered a deep blue green more reminiscent of the Mediterranean than foggy, rainy England, as the bobbing sailboats clinked gently in the harbor. A narrow stretch of brownish sand in front of the quay was scattered with sunbathers, some of them sitting inside old-fashioned striped tents of the kind you can see in photos taken decades ago. All around us the sea gulls flapped, making their strange cawing sound -- half-angry, half-nostalgic, as if something has been taken away from them. (And, indeed, they have a reputation as scavengers; signs abound warning the unwary not to feed them.)
 St. Ives was the center of the fishing industry throughout the 19th century until its pilchard stocks began to dry up. (Pilchards, which taste like muted sardines, are sold in tins that are decorated with evocative fishing scenes by the painter Walter Langley, who lived in Newlyn, a fishing village across the peninsula from St. Ives.) Since the 1880's, however, when the painter Walter Sickert sought out the area for the vaunted quality of its light -- both limpid and crystalline -- St. Ives has been best known as a mecca for artists and imbibers of artistic atmosphere. Its status as such was confirmed in 1993, when a small, gemlike branch of the Tate Gallery in London opened here.
 The sparkling view of porthmeor Beach from the museum's top floor vies for visitors' attention with the exhibits. These include work by contemporary artists and a sampling of the artists who followed in Sickert's footsteps and came to be known as the St. Ives School. This group included painters like Ben Nicholson, Wilhelmina Barnes-Graham and Terry Frost, and the sculptors Naum Gabo and Barbara Hepworth. (One of them, the painter Patrick Heron, designed the stained-glass window that greets you on arrival.) Inspired by the ancient landscape of rocks, cliffs and Celtic standing stones -- being in touch with primeval life forces created by the promixity of sun, sky and water -- they tended toward an abstract and formalist aesthetic. Other members of the community were the self-taught naive artist Alfred Wallis, a retired Cornish fisherman; Bernard Leach, the pioneering British potter; and painters like Peter Lanyon and Roger Hilton, who eventually veered away from strict abstraction. All of them were struck by the same lilting energy -- the ''general sense of the poetry of existence'' as Virginia Woolf once described it -- that continued to haunt the author of ''To the Lighthouse'' many years after her family stopped going to St. Ives.
 Within five minutes' walking distance from the Tate, along St. Ives's higgledy-piggledy cobblestone streets, is the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden. The gifted and fiercely independent-minded sculptor moved here from London together with her husband, Ben Nicholson, in 1939. Hepworth, who had four young children on her hands, observed that she felt immediately ''nourished'' by the beauty and sense of camaraderie that the village offered. She lived and worked in St. Ives until 1975, when she died in a fire in her studio. The museum displays work from different periods of Hepworth's prolific and celebrated career, including her last major piece, a poignant multipart sculpture in white marble called ''Fallen Images.'' Zoe and I walked through her sparsely furnished house in hushed contemplation, then into the carefully designed yet informal garden, where every few steps we came upon another of Hepworth's organic, elemental forms, carved variously out of wood or stone. Here you can almost feel the artist's consuming dedication as a kind of silent, hovering presence; this impression is heightened when we turn a corner and come upon her workshops, which remain as they were at the time of her death, with unfinished sculptures resting on stands, as if Hepworth herself will shortly return.
 It is impossible for any visitor to Cornwall not to be captivated by its richly atmospheric aspects: the miles of untouched green countryside, dotted with cows and lambs, looking as if at any moment Tess of the D'Urbervilles might come running out in an apron and bonnet; the cliff walks straight out of ''The French Lieutenant's Woman,'' with their suggestion of romantic doom; the little grocery stores and intimate pubs; the winding roads bracketed on either side by hedgerows and wildflowers; the fishing trawlers with their array of weather-beaten ropes; the quiet churches with their impeccably maintained cemeteries, like the one in St. Just, where you can still make out the inscription on a gravestone from 1750; and the cluster of 19th-century thatched ''round houses'' in the tiny gleaming village of Veryan -- built without corners, as local lore has it, so there would be no place for the devil to hide. Even the photo-ready, cheerfully self-marketing spirit that informs the tiny town of Mevagissey, near St. Ives -- a fishing village that is also a destination for day-trippers, chockablock with stands selling cotton candy and ''real'' Cornish ice cream and shops carrying plastic pails and shovels and disposable fishing rods -- has its tinselly charm.
 And yet it is also impossible for anyone who stays for any time in Cornwall not to realize fairly quickly that it is a region at odds with itself, torn between the temptations of progress and the grip of an idealized past. Everywhere you go you can sense the clash between the thrifty, cautious habits of a rural indigenous population -- a spirit characterized by the plain-spoken fishermen, matey pubs and a dismissive attitude toward all that is showy or too openly aspiring -- and the rapacious consumerism of the Londoners (the ''I want people,'' as they are called) with their buy-'em-and-gut-'em mind-set. Locals or transplanted residents who consider themselves locals -- it doesn't seem to matter how briefly one has actually lived here before claiming this part of the world as one's own -- are in the habit of referring mistily to the ''old'' Cornwall as opposed to the ''new'' Cornwall. The past stands for an irreverent and stubbornly isolationist spirit, the sense the Cornish have of being a people unto themselves ever since the days when Cornwall still went by its Cornish name of Kernow.
 The past also stands, although this goes mostly unremarked, for the specter of poverty that marks grim, depleted towns like Camborne and Redruth. Once the center of the defunct tin- and copper-mining industries that were the backbone of Cornwall's economy from the mid-18th to mid-19th centuries, they now can lay claim to one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country. Like St. Austell, the bleak town in mid-Cornwall where our five-hour train ride from London deposited us, these are not places in which one would care to linger. Yet in the last few years, St. Austell, on the verge of dereliction since the decline of its once-flourishing china-clay industry, has begun to rebound, with the beginning of the astonishingly successful Eden Project. This environmental development, built on the site of an abandoned clay pit on the outskirts of town, consists of two enormous biospheres that recreate two of the earth's climates, replete with jungle, waterfalls, whimsical sculptures and all manner of plants.
 The ''new'' Cornwall -- its present and future -- is embodied by the tourists the locals refer to (even as they assure me that no one uses the derogatory term) as ''emmets'' -- the local word for ''ants.'' Starting with the arrival of Easter and continuing though November, throngs of visitors pour in from other parts of England, bringing with them a much-needed infusion of income to a part of the country that remains, in spite of its breathtaking landscape and inarguable seductions, one of the most economically depressed. They come, like the two jolly retirees from Kent my daughter and I meet down on the dock in Megavissey, to breathe in the fresh sea air, reel in a fish or two and get their fill of ''cream teas'' (showcasing the artery-clogging clotted cream the region prides itself on). The doughy specialty with crimped edges known as as the Cornish pasty is also to be had here; originally devised as a one-stop meal for the men working down in the mines, with a bit of sweet and savory nestled together under the same crust, pasties put me in mind of overgrown apple turnovers.
 And now, I suppose, is as good a moment as any to admit the truth: I came to Cornwall to see Virginia Woolf's lighthouse -- which belongs to the old Cornwall, when lightkeepers still roamed the earth (these days the lights go on automatically) -- but I succumbed to the enchantment of two tiny villages, whose pristine, ungussied-up essence is largely underwritten by emmets, I mean tourists, like me. Both of these villages are within an hour or so from St. Ives and have first-class hotels that helped put them on the map.
 The allure of St. Mawes, where we stayed at the Tresanton, and Portloe, where we put in at the Lugger, is precisely the time-true quality that, like all authentic experiences of place, requires an element of affluent elitism to preserve that very picturesqueness. Both towns are set in the lush section of Cornwall known as the Roseland Peninsula, much of which is under the domain of the National Trust. 
 St. Mawes is a singularly captivating mix of the pastoral and coastal. It has drawn wealthy summer visitors and holiday vacationers since Edwardian times hawking nothing other than its own natural assets, which include the climate (reputedly the warmest in England), a glorious setting on Falmouth Bay, with palm trees no less, and a sense of easeful respite. The Tresanton, originally created in the 1940's as a yachtsmen's club, is made up of a cluster of whitewashed old houses on different levels that give little clue from the outside to the casual elegance within. The hotel was bought in 1997 by Olga Polizzi, who first came to St. Mawes at the urging of her husband, the writer William Shawcross, who summered here as a child. The 29 rooms, most with views of the sea, are invitingly done up in tawny colors, Frette sheets and eclectic pieces. The hotel has brought a not entirely unappreciated glamour to quiet St. Mawes (Prince Charles was a guest here just a few weeks before my visit) that is not matched by the more basic accommodations that line Lower Castle Road alongside attached seafront houses.
 The remarkable part of St. Mawes is that it manages to have the best of all worlds: think a bit of Capri tossed together with a scattering of Maine and a dollop of East Hampton, and then deduct the crowds. Within a few doors of one another there are a sophisticated gallery, a sleekly designed food emporium, Chalmers & Short, and the dusty, serenely outdated-looking Fashion Center, which seems straight out of a William Trevor story. James Wood, whose family runs the Waterside Gallery, which carries woodcarvings, ceramics and jewelry by Cornwall residents, undertakes to explain the town's magic to me. ''In nice weather,'' he says, ''I've never known a nicer place. I think people who come here find what they're looking for. They don't get homesick.''
 Finally, there is dreamy, reclusive Portloe, which is a mere 20 minutes away from St. Mawes if you know your way around the hairpin roads. A slip of a fishing village with nothing in it but a post office, a pub and the Lugger, it makes St. Mawes look positively bustling by contrast. There is nothing to do in Portloe but take walks along the cliff, hole up in your pricey but infinitely chic room in the Lugger or hang out in the Ship Inn, which has been described to me as the best pub in Cornwall. The owner and barkeeper is Andrew Tregunna, much the friendliest person I met in the area. Andrew, who has a wife and two young children, recently renovated two upstairs rooms, which he showed me with shy pride. He plans to charge a fraction of the price of the Lugger and the Tresanton, which would make his rooms the only bargain left on Roseland.
 As I watched him greet a regular who seated himself at the bar with a hearty ''How the devil are you, sir,'' I could understand why his cozy place does such a brisk business. My last night in Cornwall, I decided to forego the Lugger's tony cuisine for an excellent piece of sole cooked with capers and butter sauce at the Ship Inn.
 Zoe and I sat at our table, and, while we waited for dinner, I finished off a pint of west country scrumpy (cider). The waitresses and 16-year-old pastry chef from the Lugger dropped in for drinks and a chat with friends. They hand-packed the tobacco in the cigarettes they deftly rolled; no worry about secondhand smoke in these parts.
 It was nearly midnight by the time we reluctantly bade Andrew good night and made our way down the road in pitch-blackness. It occurred to me belatedly that I should have thought to take a flashlight; there were no streetlights and the only illumination was provided by the stars blinking up in the night sky. The next morning, we were booked to take the train to London, and after that we returned home.
 Meanwhile, back in New York, I found myself daydreaming about waking up to the briny smell of the sea and the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks. Cornwall had cast its spell on me, as James Wood had predicted. There's something about the place -- maybe it comes back to the light, which really does have a sheen to it, almost like a curtain of glass beads -- that works its way into your bones.

HEADLINE: San Francisco

BYLINE: By Stephen McCauley. 
Stephen McCauley's fifth novel will be published next year.

 BODY:

Few cities have inspired better epigrammatic praise than San Francisco. Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane described it as ''49 square miles surrounded by reality.'' John Steinbeck claimed the city was ''a golden handcuff with the key thrown away.'' And H. L. Mencken wrote that, upon arrival, he was immediately thrilled by the ''subtle but unmistakable sense of escape from the United States.''

THE MOOD
 It's been said that San Francisco is a city where the young go to retire. But in the middle of the 1990's, a lot of young people went to San Francisco to get rich, and many of them succeeded. Armed with a vague cyberconcept and the eerie self-confidence endemic in the generation reared by baby boomers, they flocked to the city from around the world, just as gold rushers had roughly 150 years earlier. In terms of prices, parking and latte consumption, the results were seismic.
 But even in San Francisco, reality sometimes intervenes, and before the autumn of 2001, economic downturn and dot-com overload brought the party to an end. These days, almost everyone you meet in San Francisco talks about the boom years as if they're discussing a locust invasion or some other natural disaster they've survived. They'll tell you how pleased they are the bubble finally burst. Once again, they recognize their beloved home. 
 They'll send you to South Park, a leafy enclave in SoMa, the South of Market district (and the birthplace of Jack London), to illustrate their point. It's a hidden corner of the city between Bryant and Brannan Streets, where some of the only buildings to survive the 1906 quake and fire hug a grassy oval that appears more Old Europe than California Contemporary. Previously the traffic-clogged, hypercaffeinated core of Silicon Alley, it had, at noontime on the June day I visited, the sleepy atmosphere of a village green. A languid couple was nursing iced drinks at the modest South Park Cafe. Hair stylists were smoking on the sidewalks. The only crowd to be found was at Jeremy's, a spacious store that sells overstocked and damaged designer clothing at significant discounts. Later that night, I went to Tallula, a restaurant in the Castro neighborhood with the kind of architectural eccentricity that's distinctly San Francisco: small, haremlike rooms connected by steep staircases. There, a young poet sipping a sake cocktail flavored with tamarind and cherries claimed that now it's not uncommon to find personal trainers or -- still more gratifying -- pizza deliverers who once were worth $10 million on paper.''That whole computer frenzy,'' she says, ''was like a weird dream.'' 
 San Francisco has always seemed to me like a weird dream. With its mysterious winds and unpredictable fog, its tolerance for hippies, heights and homosexuals and its unrivaled and improbable physical beauty, it strikes me as too pretty and benevolent -- too good, in other words -- to be true. An atmosphere of whimsy shrouds the cottages accessible only by wooden boardwalks off the switchback Filbert Steps pasted to the side of Telegraph Hill. The sight and sound of cable cars at twilight transport you to a storybook city from another century. 
 Like many great beauties, San Francisco has suffered: earthquakes and fires, the AIDS epidemic and the energy crisis. Despite Mayor Gavin Newsom's creation of a ''cabinet'' to deal exclusively with the problem of homelessness and a compassionate get-tough policy called Care Not Cash, ragged street dwellers are ubiquitous in most neighborhoods. But the city is unusually adept at recovery, and just as physical evidence of the 1989 earthquake has all but vanished, so the scars of the latest gold rush have started to fade. Restaurant prices have become more sensible. In-town traffic isn't as severe. Deals on hotel rooms are relatively easy to negotiate. Last February, Mayor Newsom allowed city officials to perform same-sex marriages in violation of a California ballot initiative passed in 2000. Before the courts halted the issuance of licenses, thousands of couples wed, and city residents of all ages and sexual leanings came to City Hall to toss flowers and pass out baked goods. It was a return to traditional values -- San Francisco style. 

THE FOOD
 In this food-obsessed, restaurant-rich city, entrees can easily loom in the $40 range, as at the Fifth Floor, an intimate French restaurant in the hip and comfortable Hotel Palomar near Union Square. The chef is award winning and the prices are almost as impressive as the plush purple draperies, the zebra-striped carpeting and the atmosphere of updated 1930's glamour. At Millennium -- a warm restaurant that glows with the light from chandeliers draped in golden netting -- the chef's tasting menu starts at $60. And there, everything offered, from appetizers to dessert, is 100 percent vegan. 
 More representative of what the current economic climate has wrought at table is Luna Park on Valencia Street at 18th in the Mission district. It's one of a number of restaurants that have opened up in this thriving neighborhood that offer simple, moderately priced meals and superb cocktails. (Admittedly, the mojito is minutes from joining the croissant sandwich and tiramisu in the cliche bin, but at Luna Park, this specialty of the house is strong, cold and thick with fresh mint.) The cuisine is the familiar culinary United Nations gathering: a little Italian, a little French, a little Asian fusion, all wrapped up in a blanket of American comfort food. (Macaroni and cheese, anyone?) Entree prices rarely climb above $15. With its blood-red walls, the dining room has a bordello atmosphere, and the huge crowd is young. The affable hostess apologized to my party of 40-somethings for a delay in seating, explaining confusion with a group that had come in ahead of us. ''They're also elderly,'' she said. Despite that appetite suppressant, a warm goat cheese appetizer and a salade nicoise were flavorful, fresh and satisfying, even if, ultimately, the noise level was more memorable than the food. 
 If you're not tempted by Luna Park's dessert offerings -- kitschy, high-carb Make Your Own S'Mores are a signature -- you might stroll down Valencia Street to the Bombay Ice Creamery where, in a grimy storefront that sells homemade samosas and curried stews, you'll find ice cream flavored with, among other things, rose water, saffron, cardamom, fig and litchi. It's the most exotic in the city and some of the most delicious. Or you might get dessert out of the way before dinner at the Tartine Bakery on Guerrero and 18th Streets. This casual French bakery and cafe is a popular hangout for locals sporting everything from tie-dyed T-shirts and campy 1940's soft hats to pinstriped business suits. With its growing reputation, it's fast becoming a destination for tourists as well. One taste of the almond-and-lemon poundcake, the brioche bread pudding or a flaky frangipani croissant and you'll know why. 
 Perhaps the best place to get a handle on the food scene in San Francisco is at the farmer's market in and around the newly restored Ferry Building on the Embarcadero at Market Street. At 8:30 on Saturday mornings, vendors open up scores of stalls selling fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, flowers and prepared food, almost all grown without the assistance of modern chemistry, and every bit of it so ripe and juicy as to be nearly pornographic. By 10 on the morning of my visit, the market was swarming with food aficionados in sun hats and boating shoes, carrying straw baskets heaped with fresh eggs, apricots, organic beef and huge bunches of intensely fragrant lavender. A sign reading ''Tasting Mandatory'' was propped up in front of a display of five varieties of sweet nectarines. You could make a meal on the samples of everything from cheese to imaginative salsas, but it would be a shame to pass up breakfast at one of the tents where restaurants serve treats like huevos rancheros with corn tortillas and pumpkin-seed pesto, paper-thin buckwheat crepes or BLT's complemented with wild salmon. 
 If you haven't sated your appetite for an entire day, you'd be well advised to linger in the neighborhood, enjoying the views of the Bay Bridge or wandering through the galleries along nearby Steuart Street, and then head back to the northeast corner of the Ferry Building for dinner at the new home of the Slanted Door. This restaurant, with its stylish but unaffected decor, its outrageously delicious California-meets-Vietnam cuisine and its emphasis on ingredients that are local and chemical-free exemplifies the very best of what's cooking in San Francisco.

THE STYLE
 While a $200-million building, sheathed in 7,200 panels of dimpled copper, is being constructed in Golden Gate Park, a selection of objects from the collection of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum is on display at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, a Beaux-Arts spectacle strategically placed on a hill in Lincoln Park. With its clean rows of columns, its verdant setting and its views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pacific, the Legion of Honor has long qualified as the most beautiful museum in the city. The first serious challenge to this distinction came in March of 2003 when the new home of the Asian Art Museum was unveiled -- a brilliant rehabilitation of the old public library in City Hall Plaza by the architect Gae Aulenti of Musee d'Orsay fame. It's a masterpiece of preservation, with sunlit staircases and airy galleries that lead you from one exhibit to the next with the logic and inevitability of a strong narrative. 
 Some friends and I planned to visit an Art Deco show at the Legion of Honor, but we took our time getting there. We first strolled through Haight-Ashbury, a neighborhood that, despite deep gentrification, still looks in many places like an LSD-inspired set from ''Yellow Submarine.'' On Stanyan Street, we rented bicycles and spent hours pedaling through Golden Gate Park, visiting the Conservatory of Flowers -- reopened last year after a five-star face-lift that includes iron and etched glass signage nearly as beautiful as the plants -- stopping at the Buffalo Paddock and rowing a leaky boat around Stow Lake. Bicycling through San Francisco might not seem like a pleasant way to spend a day, but if you're hugging the flat(ish) coastal periphery of the city, there's no more exhilarating way to get around.
 From Golden Gate Park, it's a short trip to the ocean, and from there, a moderately challenging ride past the Cliff House (currently closed for renovations), the haunting ruins of the Sutro Baths (seemingly one of the few sites in San Francisco not slated for renovation) and on to the Golden Gate Bridge. Crossing the bridge on a bicycle, with tankers and cruise ships passing beneath you, is the best way to appreciate the magnificence of this landmark piece of sculpture as well as the engineering and construction feat it represents. 
 By the time my friends and I arrived at the Legion of Honor, it was late afternoon. People were pulling up in polished cars for a demonstration of 30's-style ballroom dancing being held, to tie in with the Art Deco theme, in the museum's cafe. Two women stood out in the crowd: one a tall, curvy blonde in a sheath of clinging material that shimmered subtly in the fading sunlight, the other a short African-American woman in an embroidered black silk kimono and a white picture hat. Both were radiant, but for San Francisco, their coifs and couture were surprising. 
 According to Sunhee Moon, one of several clothing designers who've opened boutiques in the Mission district, San Francisco's dominant style is relaxed. The boat-necked T-shirts and flared jackets lined with soft bridal satin in her 16th Street shop are casually elegant and named after Moon's friends. ''You can wear what you want in San Francisco. To work, to restaurants. It's an accepting place.''
 Even in the city's chicest spots, it's hard to feel underdressed. Take the Redwood Room, off the lobby of the Clift Hotel. When the hotel was given the full Philippe Starck treatment a few years ago, there was much fretting over the fate of this legendary 1930's cocktail lounge. But the result is respectful and dazzling -- soft amber sconces, sleek bar stools, low, glass-topped benches lighted from within and shifting digital artwork displayed on framed plasma television screens. Two married businessmen I met explained that they always stay at the Clift despite ''cramped rooms'' because the lounge is the place to meet women. For this activity, they'd donned loud polo shirts and didn't look especially out of place. By the time I'd finished my overpriced gin and tonic, they were nuzzling a pair of look-alike blondes in capri pants and skimpy tops. As for the elegantly attired women at the Legion of Honor, both turned out, on closer inspection, to be men. In San Francisco, that fact made a great deal of sense. And raised nary an eyebrow.

HEADLINE: Forget It?

BYLINE: By Walter Kirn. 
Walter Kirn, a frequent contributor to the magazine, is the author, most recently, of ''Up in the Air,'' a novel.

 BODY:
A friend of mine said something horrible recently: ''I'm just so over 9/11.'' We'd been watching TV -- a fluffy gossip show featuring models as reporters -- and during a long commercial break I'd picked up the channel changer and happened across a cable-news discussion of the war on terrorism. One of the experts used the phrase ''twin towers.'' Another mentioned the ''hunt for Osama.'' Their language seemed dated, musty and faintly embarrassing, and I quickly switched back to ''Extra.'' That's when my friend made her comment, adding this: ''I'm ashamed of myself, but it's true. I'm totally over it.'' 
 I told her she was right to be ashamed, but as our evening of TV viewing wore on -- a succession of Darwinian reality shows and lurid explorations of Britney's love life -- it occurred to me that my friend had merely been honest about an undeniable phenomenon: through some gradual process of cultural mummification, the attacks of three years ago have become a symbol, a cluster of stuffed and mounted official images, and as such they must now compete with fresher images for the country's interest and attention. I don't live in New York now, though I used to, and I understand fully that for those who do, such an attitude may seem blasphemously insensitive. But it wouldn't shock me if the attacks and their iconographic halos were soon the stuff of magazine ''in-out'' lists. In: ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' Out: 9/11.
 Just as the arrival of the wedding photos represents the formal emotional terminus of the celebration itself, the publication of the 9/11 commission report marked the end of 9/11. On the surface, the aim of the report was to find out exactly what happened that bloody morning and offer sober suggestions for preventing similar attacks, but at a deeper, more fundamental level the goal seemed to be to box and wrap the whole big mess so that it could be psychologically mothballed. The report became a best seller, I suspect, not because people truly wanted to read it but because they craved the satisfaction of physically placing the volume on a bookshelf and then going into the kitchen to fix dinner.
 In the months that followed the attacks, when the president was advising people to dust themselves off and head out to the malls, I consciously resisted complacency. I understood, of course, that the day would come when my brain would stop flashing on scenes of burning skyscrapers, plummeting bodies and smoking, twisted girders, but I hoped that it wouldn't happen for a long time and that I would be one of the last people it happened to. The sense of pure victimization I felt back then, untainted by guilt and uncut with self-reproach, was powerful, pervasive and oddly intoxicating. I suspected that I'd miss it once it passed.
 And then it did pass, sometime last spring, after John Kerry won the primaries and the presidential campaign kicked off in earnest. The visceral memories of falling buildings were supplanted by thoughts on the ''issue'' of terrorism and which candidate could best confront its ''challenge.'' A little later, when Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism official, pointedly blamed the Bush administration for taking the threat of Al Qaeda too lightly, I felt a twinge of nostalgia for the lost unity of a couple of years before. The war in Iraq had made such unity hard, of course (which was one of the reasons I resented it), but I was disappointed nonetheless. I liked it better when everyone was crying together and when the rest of the world was crying for us.
 From tragedy to policy. How sad.
 What pained me most, though, was how unfocused I'd grown, how frivolous, how silly, how distractable. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, I'd made a number of somber resolutions that I now had to admit I'd never make good on. I hadn't stopped going out to fancy restaurants and sent the money I would have spent in them to a charitable fund for Afghan orphans. More damningly, I hadn't stopped watching MTV, which I was too old to be watching anyway. The brain cells in which I'd vowed to store the names of the heroes of United Flight 93 were occupied now by the face of Jessica Simpson.
 If this was the healing process, it felt sinful. It felt more like the betrayal process, in fact. Couldn't my mind, and the media that feeds it, preserve just one sacred space, one permanent prime-time slot for tragedy?
 But wouldn't you know that just when I'd moved on, the presidential candidates (especially one of them) would ask me to rekindle my memories? Once, it had been my duty to calm down and re-enter the economic hurly-burly; now it was my duty to get worked up again before re-entering the voting booth. So which was it? Forget? Remember?
 The signals were mixed. What the politicians wanted, it finally seemed, was the right to revive 9/11 on command, whenever it served their own ambitious purposes. If they could, they'd implant a 9/11 chip deep in the limbic region of my brain and activate it by remote control.
 Getting over the attacks is my way of refusing them access. Sure, I feel guilty about it, but so be it. Some emotions, some memories, some pictures are just too combustible to walk around with, especially when certain people are waiting to toss a match into my soul. That's why I've begun to bury that awful morning in a spot that only I can locate, under layers and layers of pop ephemera. I'll dig up those images if and when I choose to, but not before then. The passage of time has made them truly mine -- mine to bring out and mine to set aside. 

 ''Don't let your children see the images, especially on Sept. 11, when you know it'll probably be on television again and again -- the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling,'' Mrs. Bush said.
 ''Parents who decide to allow their older children to watch television on the anniversary should limit the time they spend in front of the set,'' Mrs. Bush said. The Associated Press,''First lady advises families to turn off TV's during anniversary,'' Sept. 6, 2002

HEADLINE: Depression, a Frequent Visitor to Wall St.

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
EARLY one afternoon in July, Dennis J. Bertrum, a former top brokerage executive at Prudential Securities, leapt out of the bedroom window of his 26th-floor apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
 No note was found, but the police said the death was a suicide.
 In and out of work since 1996, Mr. Bertrum, a pioneer in the managed account business who was described by friends as a bon vivant, had been on a persistent quest to return to the brokerage business that he had loved since his days selling stocks for E.F. Hutton in the 1970's, colleagues say. But for Mr. Bertrum, an unemployed 55-year-old who friends say had a history of Jekyll-and-Hyde-type mood swings, few doors were opening. 
 Just weeks before he took his own life, he had been interviewing for a senior job in the private wealth management division of Merrill Lynch but he and the firm could not come to terms, friends said, adding that they do not blame the firm for what ultimately happened. Merrill declined to comment.
 Instead, his friends and family described a man who for years had been in therapy for a bipolar condition and who had quit taking his medication, Wellbutrin, just three weeks before his death. Mr. Bertrum was twice divorced and in the process of ending a relationship, and family members say that with no income, he was feeling financial pressure. His brother, Carl A. Butrum, who called him a week before he died, said he was on a down swing. 
 For a man who had achieved financial and professional success in the 1990's, the letdown of not securing the Merrill job could have been brutal, his friends and family said.
 ''It's pretty traumatic when you are in your 50's, you are skilled and can operate at a high level but your expectations don't pan out,'' said Stephen C. Winks, a financial consultant and a former colleague of Mr. Bertrum's at Prudential. ''I think it weighed heavily on him.''
 Suicides in the brokerage industry are rare, and those that can be documented have been linked in the public mind to wiped-out portfolios and plummeting markets like those of 1929, 1987 and even 2000. But the chronic depression associated with suicides is not rare on Wall Street.
 A survey conducted in 2000 -- the only known study of its kind -- concluded that 23 percent of a small sampling of male brokers and traders at seven of the largest firms on Wall Street suffered from clinical depression, a rate far above what was then the national average of 7 percent for men. And that was before the market fell by one-third from its record high, before Wall Street firms shed 30,000 jobs and before an explosion of investor lawsuits and arbitration cases. 
 All of this has led some experts to conclude that the rate of depression among brokers and traders is related more to the grinding pressures of a rapidly changing industry than to the vicissitudes of the markets.
 ''Brokers have little control over their jobs or the outcomes of their trades,'' said Alden M. Cass, a licensed clinical psychologist who wrote the study and now coaches Wall Street traders and brokers on coping with the psychological travails of their professions. ''These frustrations can lead to a form of 'learned helplessness,' or a feeling that you are in a prison with no way out. Such feelings have been linked to levels of clinical depression.''
 Relatively few brokers and bankers appear to be seeking professional help to cope with the pressure, according to data collected by insurance companies. Experts say many brokers fear that doing so would be seen by their employers as a sign of weakness in a high-testosterone industry like finance. So brokers bottle up their feelings and soldier on -- until they crack, health professionals say.
 ''I would have predicted higher rates of behavioral health claims for stock brokers because of the high stress,'' said Dr. Ronald S. Leopold, the national director for group disability at MetLife, who collected the data. ''But what we see in jobs where there is a combination of tremendous stress and opportunity is the work-until-you-drop phenomenon. There is no question in my mind that these people have high rates of depression, and it is no wonder that we are seeing some of them crash.''
 MR. BERTRUM'S story -- a terrible piece of life-altering news causes a man already close to the edge to teeter off it -- bears an eerie similarity to that of Raymond J. Foster, a broker and branch manager in the Cleveland office of Prudential Securities.
 Three years ago, Mr. Foster, 60, a 10-year veteran of the firm, was abruptly fired, denied any severance and barred from returning to his office. Shocked by the news, he returned -- glassy-eyed and quiet, according to a police report -- to his home in the suburb of Shaker Heights and put an end to his life with one blast from a shotgun.
 Hours later, his wife, Patricia, discovered his body slumped over in a chair in the family's garage. In the kitchen, she found a hastily scribbled note, but it offered no explanation for what he had done.
 According to former colleagues, Mr. Foster was facing escalating pressures at the office, where he was struggling to please a new regional supervisor. A spokesman for Wachovia Securities, formerly Prudential, declined to comment. 
 Mr. Foster was not an introspective man, or prone to revealing his innermost feelings, colleagues said. Voluble at the office, where he was by all accounts a respected branch manager who liked to talk about his collection of Porsches, he had become more withdrawn at home and offered his wife no window into his black moods. ''In retrospect, it's apparent that Ray was able to mask his deepest feelings of depression and rage,'' Mrs. Foster said.
 Mr. Foster apparently never sought help, according to his wife, even though some of his colleagues recalled how the mounting burden of his job had led to the occasional outburst. ''This job comes with pressure,'' said Terrence Diehl, a former broker at Prudential who worked for Mr. Foster. ''I have seen guys in tight places. Some guys work through it and some guys lie down.''
 Keeping his clients from pursuing the second option has been Mr. Cass's mission for two years. After completing his study on broker depression, Mr. Cass, 28, built a private practice called the Catalyst Strategies Group where he offers executive coaching sessions -- distinct from traditional therapy sessions -- to a small but growing number of frazzled brokers and bankers. They have spurned the in-house counseling services offered by their employers, choosing instead to pay $250 an hour for coaching from Mr. Cass, who earned his doctorate at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Other professionals counsel brokers, but few market themselves as aggressively as Mr. Cass, who has a Web site with testimonials from the bankers he has helped.
 With a management consultant's style and his deep summer tan, Mr. Cass does not come across as the typical psychologist. He also brings a knowledge of banking and finance, honed while hanging out in Wall Street bars when he was studying for his doctorate in the late 1990's. 
 He offers his clients a variety of options so that they may be more productive at the office: straight-up coaching sessions, 24-hour phone access and a special program, called ''back in 45,'' in which he meets a client for a 45-minute lunch and strives to lift him up from the slough of his despond. (Lunch is on the client.) 
 HE takes special care, as well, to talk the language of Wall Street, spurning clinical terms -- including the word ''depression'' itself -- that may conjure up in wary brokers' minds the specter of a couch and a ticking clock. Instead, he prefers a more accessible vernacular, encouraging clients to ''think bullish,'' ''don't be bearish'' and ''don't aim, just throw the ball.''
 His approach is not the only unorthodox aspect of his practice. His office is a cramped suite in an anonymous office building near Madison Square Garden, not the neighborhood that jumps to mind for a psychologist. 
 On a recent evening, he had one of his original clients in for a coaching session, a broker who has worked in the industry for more than 20 years, switching from one job to another, from large Wall Street firms to smaller operations. Battling a history of depression, he had reached out to health professionals at his companies as well as independent therapists, but could find no succor before finding the name of Mr. Cass in an Internet search.
 The broker earned as much as $250,000 a year during the bull market, but his salary had shrunk to $75,000 by the time he was fired, just a day before the coaching session. Jumpy and angular, with cufflinks that glimmered in the dim light of Mr. Cass's office, the broker recounted his firing as a miniature waterfall gurgled soothingly in the background. ''He was screaming at me,'' said the broker, who asked not to have his name disclosed but did let a reporter sit in on his session, as he presented the details of his dismissal. ''It was a complete dressing-down.''
 Sitting on a couch, the broker needed no prodding to plunge into his past neuroses and brutally analyze his current psychic state. Mr. Cass asked him how the dismissal made him feel.
 ''It was gut-wrenching,'' he said. ''But I knew there was truth to what he was saying.'' The broker said he thought, ''Let him fire me,'' and he asked the boss to pay him. ''He said he would,'' the broker added, ''but only after I gave him the keys to the office.''
 He paused, his eyes darting around the small office, crossing and uncrossing his legs. ''It was a difficult day,'' he added. ''My stomach was churning. I had headaches, a lot of psychological paralysis.''
 Nodding his head, Mr. Cass asked, ''How does your wife take this?''
 ''We live in the age of the dot-com billionaire, and she wonders when it's going to happen to me,'' he said, bitterly. ''It's just so hard to make a living on Wall Street.'' The broker's voice rose as he railed against the rising tide of complaints from customers and the relentless move toward online trading that was making it harder and harder to bring home a decent paycheck.
 ''You are a victim of circumstance,'' Mr. Cass said as he urged his client toward more bullish thinking.
 ''I've been on Wall Street for 20 years -- I don't have an M.B.A. or a C.P.A.,'' the broker said. ''I have experience in getting customers, but now I feel emasculated, isolated. You are a man without a country.''
 Given his shrinking salary, the broker, who lives in a leafy New York suburb and has two children, wondered how he was going to make ends meet.
 ''I'm a lousy provider, an underachiever,'' he said, spitting out the words as if they were poison pellets. ''We can't make it on my wife's income alone. What is going to become of us?''
 He paused and spoke of the rage and the self-destructive thoughts that he said were consuming him that day. ''You don't have your foot on the ledge,'' he added, letting his words trail off. ''But I didn't want to be in traffic or in a crowded place. I didn't have a lot of control.''
 Taking it all in, Mr. Cass asked, ''So what's the bullish thought?''
 Again, the broker revisited the day of his firing. ''He was screaming at me and I felt myself get smaller and smaller, like I was shrinking in a cartoon,'' he said before stopping himself. ''But then I had the bullish thought: how silly this guy looked; I mean he looked like a raving idiot.''
 A smile tugged slightly at his lips.
 Leaning forward, Mr. Cass responded: ''Now you are in control. You are no longer in a cycle of bearish thoughts.''
 The broker told Mr. Cass that on the same day he was fired, he called an old colleague who offered him a job on the spot -- in a new supervisory position. ''I really have to be on my game now,'' he said. ''But it's encouraging. At least I'm not lying in bed with two sheets over my head. That is what I did in the past.''
 Nodding with encouragement -- rooting him on, it seemed -- Mr. Cass said: ''Look at you. You are starting fresh; now you can reset your business goals.''
 While the broker said the sessions with Mr. Cass had helped him, he conceded that at any time, events at the office could send him back into the kind of depressive fugue that sometimes leads to suicide.
 ''The act of suicide is an act to grasp control,'' he said. ''I've been there. You are looking for a path but you begin to wonder whether the people around you might be better off without you. I remember there was a time when I would be driving to work, feeling the rigidness of my musculature at 7 a.m. And I forced myself to put a picture of my child's face in front of me. That's the only way I could keep going.''

HEADLINE: Canada Looks for Ways to Fix Its Health Care System

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WHITBY, Ontario, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Esther Pacione needs a family doctor. At age 56 she is afflicted with severe ataxia, a neurological condition that causes her acute pain, choking and loss of consciousness. The walls of her home are scuffed from the times she fell and hit her head.
 Her regular doctor suffered a stroke a year ago, and all the local doctors she has contacted say they cannot take new patients, so now Ms. Pacione goes to a walk-in clinic whenever she has an emergency. At the clinic, she waits hours and sees a different doctor and no one there is familiar with her medical history and what drugs she has been taking. 
 Ms. Pacione, a retired bookkeeper, said she would like to be at the table when Prime Minister Paul Martin meets with the provincial premiers on Monday for a three-day televised meeting to find ways to alleviate the lengthening waits for basic care in Canada. 
 ''If you are not bleeding all over the place, you are put on the back burner,'' Ms. Pacione said, ''unless of course you have money or know somebody.'' 
 The publicly financed health insurance system remains a prideful jewel for most Canadians, who see it as an expression of communal caring for the less fortunate and a striking contrast to an American health care system that leaves 45 million people uninsured. But polls indicate that public confidence in the system is eroding, although politicians remain reticent to urge increasing privatization of services.
 During the recent closely fought election campaign, Mr. Martin promised to fix Canada's health care system ''for a generation,'' focusing on trimming waiting times for diagnostic tests, cancer treatment and elective surgery like hip replacements. He is eager to use this televised gathering, billed as a health care summit meeting, to reverse the current view among many Canadians that his government is vacillating and may well fall next year.
 But medical professionals and local officials say a major reason it may not be easy to address the problem of slow access to treatment is because doctors who do preliminary diagnostic work, refer patients to specialists and monitor the care of chronically ill people are less and less available -- especially in small towns and rural areas. 
 A 2002 report from the Canadian Senate said that the actual number of family doctors had decreased only slightly in recent years but that the demands of an aging population were growing. Meanwhile, several recent studies have shown that family doctors are working shorter hours.
 Young doctors are more likely to seek the most lucrative work in cities or go to the United States rather than start more modest practices in small towns because of growing debts when they leave medical school. That has set off an increasing competition among small towns to attract doctors.
 Ms. Pacione's predicament is surprisingly common even in this upper-middle-class community on the north shore of Lake Ontario that seems to have everything going for it: immaculate lawns, a yacht marina, a downtown graced by vintage Victorian architecture and quaint parks and fruit markets.
 Despite all its attractions, Whitby has trouble attracting enough doctors to take care of its residents. The town has only 63 family doctors to care for its 110,000 people (medical officials and local officials say at least 16 more are needed), and many residents drive 45 minutes or more to Toronto for basic medical care. Whitby is one of 136 communities with a total of a million people in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, that are not adequately served by family doctors, according to the Ontario Medical Association. That is up from 100 communities in 2000.
 Whitby officials estimate that 22,000 people here have no doctor at all, forcing them to go to emergency rooms at overcrowded local hospitals to wait in line for up to four hours simply to refill a prescription, get a doctor's note for an employer or care for their flu symptoms. 
 ''It's like winning the lottery to get in and see the doctor,'' Mayor Marcel Brunelle said. ''This is a very wealthy country. What happened to bring the situation to this point?''
 The government statistical agency estimates that more than 3.6 million Canadians, representing nearly 15 percent of the population, do not have a family doctor. That remains better than in the United States, where an estimated 20 percent do not have a regular doctor.
 But there are signs that the doctor shortage in Canada is worsening. The Canadian Medical Association estimates that the country requires 2,500 medical graduates annually but is producing only 2,200 a year. 
 Mayor Brunelle formed a task force in June to recruit young doctors by introducing them to real estate agents and giving them advice on how to start new practices, and the town government is considering building a municipal clinic. The town of Peterborough is offering large monetary incentives and a grab bag of perks, including memberships at the Y.M.C.A. and cable television. Other municipalities offer moving expenses and the inside track on real estate next to golf courses.
 But experts say those efforts may not be enough. ''If the current trends continue we can anticipate a crisis,'' warned Joseph D'Cruz, a University of Toronto business school professor who specializes in health care. ''People will actually find it impossible to get general medical services in their towns.''
 The doctor shortage is hurting the economies of small towns seeking to attract businesses. But it is also taxing the energies of the doctors who do live in those towns, as well as the resources of local hospitals -- and patients often complain that their treatment is rushed.
 Administrators at the nearby Lakeridge Health Oshawa, an acute care hospital, estimated that more than 30 percent of the patients who went to the emergency ward would go to a family doctor instead if they could do so quickly. It is a burden on the hospital's staff, space and financial resources.
 One patient who went to the emergency ward recently, Crystal Bentley, 22, complained of cysts behind her ears. She said she would prefer to see her family doctor but would have to wait in his office for hours. She said she went to the hospital because the emergency room was faster.
 ''Seeing a doctor and not having to pay is phenomenal,'' she said, ''but here I am taking up emergency time from doctors. I really do wish I could see my family doctor instead of coming here and talking to a total stranger.''

HEADLINE: President? Forget It. Who Should Win The Corner Office?

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Look at it this way: Workers pay taxes, taxes finance government, and the president heads the government. So, like it or not, you are working for the president for part of each day. 
 But what if, instead of picking a distant president, Americans had to decide something far closer to home: Would John Kerry or George W. Bush make a better boss? According to a survey conducted a month or so ago by Ajilon Finance, a recruiting firm, and the Opinion Research Corporation, 45 percent would favor Mr. Kerry and 41 percent would choose Mr. Bush. 
 But wide gaps emerged when people were asked about specific traits. Half of those who picked Mr. Bush did so primarily for his leadership, but just 4 percent for his intelligence. Some 29 percent of aspiring employees of Mr. Kerry cited intelligence first, but just 16 percent chose leadership. 
 And compassion? Just 14 percent cited that first for Mr. Kerry, 10 percent for Mr. Bush. 
 Better not call in sick. Hubert B. Herring

HEADLINE: Afghan Government Removes A Powerful Regional Leader

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The Afghan government on Saturday announced the removal of the powerful governor of Herat, in western Afghanistan, one of the country's longest standing warlords. The move appeared to be intended to undercut the governor, one of the major opponents to President Hamid Karzai, before the Oct. 9 presidential elections.
 The removal of the governor, Ismail Khan, is momentous for the central government, which has tried without success to reduce his power or remove him for the last two years. Following Mr. Karzai's removal of the defense minister, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, from the presidential ticket last month, the action on Saturday was one of the boldest moves by Mr. Karzai in nearly three years in office to reduce the power of the warlords. 
 The government announced the removal as a promotion, saying Mr. Khan was being appointed the new minister of mines and industries, but the governor was clearly reluctant to leave and told local radio that he would not accept the ministerial post but would remain in Herat.
 Mr. Khan has dominated western Afghanistan for more than 20 years --as a mujahedeen commander fighting the Soviet Army and later the Taliban, and as undisputed ruler of Herat for a period in the 1990's and for nearly three years since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. He has resisted any control by the central government and has kept a tight hold on the local political and economic scene.
 Weakened by two military attacks against his soldiers this year and the assassination in March of his son, Mirwais Siddiq, the minister of civil aviation, he finally relented to government pressure this week. 
 He told a local radio station on Saturday that he had accepted the government's decision to replace him but probably would not go to Kabul because it was not a post for which he was qualified, said Muhammadullah Afzali, chief of the government's foreign department in Herat. 
 ''He has said that he will stay where he is right now, not as a governor but as a private citizen, and that he will work for the security and prosperity of Herat,'' said a Western diplomat, who was in telephone contact with Mr. Khan on Saturday. Discussions would continue about a future post, the diplomat said. 
 ''It is also true that he is disappointed, he's unhappy,'' the diplomat said. Mr. Khan had hoped to remain as governor until after the elections, the diplomat said.
 The government moved quickly to put in a new appointee, Sayed Muhammad Khairkhwa, who had served as ambassador to Iran and most recently to Ukraine. The new governor would go to Herat on Sunday, or Monday, said a presidential spokesman, Jawed Ludin.
 Extra troops were sent in from the Afghan National Army and members of the National Police and National Security Directorate on Saturday afternoon. About 1,000 soldiers were guarding positions in the city of Herat, in case anyone tried to take advantage of the transition of power, said a Defense Ministry spokesman, Gen. Muhammad Zaher Azimi.
 In a sign of tension, United States forces opened fire on supporters of Mr. Khan who had gathered in the city to demonstrate and threw stones at an American vehicle, the police chief, Ziamuddin Mahmudi, said. Two demonstrators were injured, he said.
 Mr. Khan's removal is part of larger changes in the region designed to stabilize the area. 
 The governor of the neighboring province of Ghor, and one of Mr. Khan's opponents, also was removed and given an advisory post in the Interior Ministry. Amanullah Khan, who began the recent fighting by attacking the Shindand air base, south of Herat, is under control of the intelligence service, the National Security Directorate in Kabul.
 The governor's removal will help Mr. Karzai in the election by opening up the political scene and removing his political control of the region, the diplomat said.

WHERE THE RIGHT
WENT WRONG
How Neoconservatives Subverted the Reagan Revolution and Hijacked the Bush Presidency.
By Patrick J. Buchanan.
264 pp. Thomas Dunne Books/
St. Martin's Press. $24.95.
 UNDERNEATH the pugnacious hide of Patrick J. Buchanan beats a heart of pure nostalgia. He longs to return to the high-tariff reign of William McKinley, mourns the passing of such budget-slashing icons as Robert Taft and Barry Goldwater and dedicates his new book to Ronald Reagan, who, he says, ''never took precipitate or rash action'' abroad. Buchanan's reverence for late, great conservatives is unbounded by epoch or nationality. He even praises Urban II, the ''extraordinarily eloquent'' French-born pope who inspired the First Crusade.
 The former presidential candidate and longtime journalist has a mission, of course. He wants to marshal this glorious past against ''impersonators'' in and close to the Bush administration who have ''hijacked'' his movement. His enemies list of neoconservatives has unsurprising names: Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Irving and William Kristol, Charles Krauthammer and Jonah Goldberg. He detests them most of all for promoting the invasion of Iraq, for arrogantly believing it would spark a democratic revolution throughout the Middle East. But the self-described populist conservative is still fighting a war against un-Christian cultural elites. And he charges most of the same neoconservatives with abetting the godless enemy on nearly every major issue -- from gay marriage to abortion to immigration. To save the nation, the right must be cleansed. 
 Characteristically, Buchanan blasts away at more targets than he hits. His manifesto includes a stirring, if familiar, call to revive America's heavy industries; those who've allowed the manufacturing base to wither, he declares, are guilty of ''economic treason.'' Elsewhere, however, he writes that China poses little threat of war because its ''prosperity depends on us.'' That confident free trader needs to talk to his agitated protectionist alter ego. When not running for president, Buchanan is a regular participant in the shouting matches the networks call public affairs. In his many illogical moments, it shows.
 Such belligerence weakens the main thrust of his book: a vigorous argument against the war in Iraq. A traditionalist to his core, Buchanan despises policy intellectuals who would ''define morality for all peoples for all times.'' He points out, correctly, that devout Muslims do not hate the United States because they envy our wealth and freedom, as President Bush would have it. They resist the erotic, feel-good popular culture Americans celebrate and sell around the globe and don't like being occupied by a military whose definition of evildoers clashes with theirs. But Buchanan's defense of the original crusaders negates his cautious relativism. The religious warrior makes an unconvincing apostle of peace.
 Alert readers will have spotted another troubling flaw in Buchanan's worldview. His roster of warmongers is made up exclusively of Jews. But it was Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice and the president himself -- good Christians all -- who sent all those armed Americans into Iraq. Aside from Wolfowitz, the Jewish neocons could only cheer them on from their op-ed pages, think tanks and talk shows. 
 Buchanan thinks he can explain this discrepancy between conservatives who decide and those who merely advocate. The neconservatives, he claims, saw that George W. Bush was ignorant about world politics and cleverly persuaded him to think like them. At one point, he compares Richard Perle's ''delight at first meeting the future president'' with Fagin's ''initial encounter with the young Oliver Twist.'' After four decades of close political combat, Buchanan seems unwilling to abandon such abusive rhetoric. It may be as essential to him as God and the flag, even while it confirms his status as a political pariah. Strangely, he doesn't realize that the president, a born-again Christian, needed no special prompting after the attacks of Sept. 11 to declare a new world war between good and evil.
 Pat Buchanan's perpetual irritation with American Jews suggests a larger problem with his style of conservatism. The past to which he would like to return is full of imagined, often contradictory tales. High tariffs under the old G.O.P. were a giant subsidy to industrial companies and the regions they dominated, which is why most foes of big government abhorred them. And to claim that Reagan favored using force only to ''defend the country he loved'' ignores the proxy armies his administration sponsored in Nicaragua and El Salvador, Angola and Afghanistan and the 5,000 American troops who overwhelmed tiny Grenada.
 Since the mid-1950's, when William F. Buckley Jr. created National Review, most prominent conservatives have sought to remake the world in the image of the America they cherish. The fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Market-Leninism in China and Vietnam seemed to vindicate their labors. To demand that they give up this habit now -- when the United States has many enemies but no true rivals -- is naive. Buchanan writes that ''a rebellion is brewing among principled and populist conservatives'' against the quisling hierarchy that rules the Republican Party. But who are these people and why is their revolt so quiet?
 The ideologue is caught in a bind of his own choosing. Antiwar liberals can applaud when he writes: ''In 2003, the United States invaded a country that did not threaten us, did not attack us and did not want war with us, to disarm it of weapons we have since discovered it did not have.'' But we cringe at every aspect of his cultural politics. Christian traditionalists love his stands against abortion and gay marriage, but they burn, like President Bush, to convert the benighted. Buchanan is thus left with a casual audience in the millions but a following that is probably a good deal smaller than the 449,000 votes (including those excuse-me ones from Palm Beach County) that he drew in the 2000 election.
 In his call to emulate an ideal right that never existed, this tough-talking Jeremiah neglects the practice of leaders from Disraeli to Reagan who managed to thrive in a modern age. Conservatives have prospered only when they adapted their principles to the flow of history. As Tancredi, the young aristocrat in Giuseppe di Lampedusa's great novel, ''The Leopard,'' put it, ''If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.''

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Unexpected Stumble from Kerry

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
 Everything seemed to be in place for a powerful run by Senator John Kerry in Ohio in the stretch drive after Labor Day. Al Gore lost the state by 175,000 votes in 2000, despite having pulled all his advertising early in October. Ohio has shed 250,000 jobs since George W. Bush became president. Rocked by scandals and an unpopular tax increase, the statehouse Republicans, from Gov. Bob Taft down the line, have been in unaccustomed disarray for weeks.
 At the end of last month, the Census Bureau reported that Cleveland, with a poverty rate of 31.3 percent, led the country in that most dubious category, and this month American deaths in Iraq topped 1,000. Both developments might have given a leg up in the campaign to Mr. Kerry, a critic of Mr. Bush's economic policy and his conduct of the war. Yet Mr. Kerry seems to be falling back. 
 Ahead by six percentage points in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in mid-July, Mr. Kerry trailed by nine points in a similar survey taken Sept. 3 through Sept. 7, immediately after the Republican convention. Kerry aides said the second poll had been taken too soon after the convention to be meaningful, but its results mirrored the impression of many savvy Ohio political figures.
 ''With all he's got going for him, it's hard to believe Kerry is stumbling so badly here,'' said William P. Blair III, a Canton lawyer and lobbyist, a former Democrat and nominal Republican who now describes himself as an independent of sorts.
 Democratic professionals have begun to criticize Mr. Kerry's efforts -- privately and, in a few cases, publicly. Gerald Austin of Cleveland, a leading Ohio campaign consultant for more than 30 years, said that former President Bill Clinton could run a better campaign than Mr. Kerry's ''even when he was under ether.'' Mr. Austin said that Mr. Kerry had been too slow to respond to Republican attacks on his military record.
 ''I smell the same New England genius that I smelled in the Dukakis campaign in 1988,'' Mr. Austin added. ''Kerry wants to run as a man of the people, and where do they put him for photo opportunities? Snowboarding in Sun Valley, shooting skeet in the Ohio valley, and windsurfing off that great working-class vacation paradise, Nantucket. Democrats -- at least Ohio Democrats -- play softball and touch football.''
 The campaign is far from over, of course. Eric Rademacher of the University of Cincinnati, who conducts the Ohio Poll, said polls taken so soon over Labor Day could be misleading. ''During summer a lot of Ohio people, like people many places, take a vacation not only from their jobs but also from politics, and many are just now refocusing on the contest,'' Mr. Rademacher said.
 Robert T. Bennett, now in his fifth presidential race as the Ohio Republican chairman, predicted that ''trench warfare, down at the grass-roots level'' would continue right through Election Day, with a close finish the most likely outcome.
 Frustrated in 2000 when Mr. Bush's lead shrank in the final 72 hours or so, the Republicans began preparations for 2004 more than a year ago, and 75 people from the state party are now in position around the state, along with 59,000 volunteers, and more than a million pro-Bush telephone calls have been placed to voters. Mr. Bennett called it ''a textbook campaign, with everyone pulling together -- national, state and local -- maybe the best I've been involved in.''
 But he also said the Democrats and their allies were matching the Republicans move for move, if not quite with the same level of unity.
 Ohio is one of roughly a dozen swing states, half of them in the Midwest, that appear likely to prove decisive in the presidential race. With 20 electoral votes, it is a significant prize, but it has a certain iconic significance as well, because no Republican has ever been elected with out carrying it. Both parties have mounted all-out efforts this time, with ample advertising and numerous appearances by their candidates -- no fewer than 66 visits this year by the presidential and vice-presidential nominees. 
 On the very night that Mr. Bush accepted the Republican nomination at Madison Square Garden, Mr. Kerry made a midnight speech in Springfield, Ohio, between Columbus and Dayton. This week, his running mate, Senator John Edwards, was in Chillicothe on Tuesday, Mr. Kerry himself spoke in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Vice President Dick Cheney was there on Thursday, and Mr. Bush campaigned in Portsmouth and Chillicothe on Friday, his fourth Ohio visit in just 16 days.
 Chillicothe -- population a mere 21,796 but with access to several major media markets -- has a respectable claim, if only a fleeting one, to the title of crossroads of American politics. More ranking politicians have come to town this year than it has seen in all the years since its heyday as Ohio's first capital two centuries ago.
 Why this year? Chillicothe is on the edge of -- and Portsmouth is in the heart of -- the state's hilly and chronically economically depressed Appalachian region. Much of the region is represented in Congress by Ted Strickland, a Democrat. Southern Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have fared well there, Mr. Bush barely won there four years ago, and it is widely seen as a pivotal area this year.
 The president clearly hopes to do better this time, but the Kerry forces greeted him with a locally aired commercial focusing on the economy. Its message: ''In 2000, George Bush never bothered to come to Portsmouth. Now, he's here promising to take 'the side of working families.' But in four years, he's taken things in the wrong direction: Health care costs are skyrocketing and family wages are down $1,500.''
 In his Cincinnati speech this week, Mr. Kerry hit hard on the war, but that tactic may not help his candidacy much.
 Prof. John Mueller of Ohio State University, an authority on the relationship of wars, the presidency and public opinion, described Iraq as ''the biggest American foreign-policy debacle since Vietnam,'' and asserted that ''there is probably no way to halt the insurgents at an acceptable cost'' in American casualties.
 ''Historically -- in Korea, in Vietnam -- as American deaths mount, public support gradually withers, more or less regardless of what politicians do,'' Professor Mueller said. ''It's eroding now, but probably not fast enough to affect the outcome of this election, in this state or nationally. Bush wants to make this year into 1944, and Kerry would like to make it more like 1968, I guess.'' 
 Another reason for Mr. Kerry's difficulties is demographic. The state has been closely contested so far, but it is less representative of the nation as a whole than it once was. As labor unions have waned and the suburbs and exurbs around cities like Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo and Akron have flourished, the state has become more Republican. The Republicans now have a 12-to-6 majority in the Congressional delegation, and hold both Senate seats, the governorship, all the other statewide constitutional offices and both houses of the Legislature.
 ''Since 1948, Ohio has slowly become less of a barometer,'' said Michael F. Curtin, president of The Columbus Dispatch, who has tracked Ohio politics for decades, ''On average, it has voted 1.7 points more Republican than the country has. The last Democrat to run stronger here than he did nationally was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.''

HEADLINE: Merchant Class Casts Lot With New Iraq For Now, Despite Physical and Fiscal Risks

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
His home was hit by mortar fire in the American invasion. A car packed with explosives hit his restaurant on New Year's Eve. More than 10 of his friends have paid thousands of dollars to kidnappers. 
 But Nabil Hanna, 41, also a clothing retailer, has no plans to leave Iraq, even though he could. (This month, he will go to Italy to buy a collection for the new season.) 
 The transition to a new Iraq has been hazardous for poor Iraqis, caught up in the chaos and insurgency of the nation. But members of Iraqi's merchant class face risks of their own. They are targets for kidnappers. Robbers roam their cargo routes. Their lives have narrowed to speedy commutes between offices and homes. Many wonder if the danger is too great for them to stay. 
 Yet so far, some entrepreneurs like Mr. Hanna are deciding not to give up. The chaos is their new life, and many are learning to adapt. 
 ''Sometimes I am thinking to leave my country,'' he said on a recent Wednesday in his Baghdad shop. But, he added: ''I am Iraqi. I am respected here. My dream is here, not in another country. So I will wait to see what will happen.''
 Iraq's merchant class declined precipitously under Saddam Hussein, as the state slowly took control of trading, and wars consumed much of the country's resources. By the 1990's, the state had become the single largest employer, with more than 200 state-owned companies.
 The revival of a business class is crucial to the American campaign to help Iraq become stable and prosper. It would help liberalize the state-dominated economy, the Americans say. The establishment of legal rights could give owners the confidence to invest, and create a building block of democracy. 
 But so far lives have been twisted into strange shapes. Abdul Wahed Hashim, an importer based in Baghdad, said he switched cars several times a week and slept in different homes to avoid kidnappers.
 ''It is not a life,'' said Mr. Hashim, 40, who agreed to meet in a cafe because he did not want a foreign reporter to be seen at his office. ''At least the prisoner stays in one place with a guard outside. We are always moving, and only God is watching.''
 In a defense against kidnapping, business owners have begun moving their families to safer nearby countries. Mr. Hashim moved his wife and four children to Syria three months ago, after his 10-year-old nephew was seized. He was released after a ransom was paid. 
 One result is a reverse of what life was like under Mr. Hussein, when Iraqi men sought to leave to earn hard currency for families at home, said Ihsan al-Septi, who owns a jewelry store in central Baghdad, and whose family will soon move to Syria. ''We are strangers in our own country,'' Mr. Septi said Tuesday at his bustling shop. ''Death is like our shadow; it is living with us.''
 That movement can be seen in a figure released by the Migration Ministry of Iraq last month. The government estimated that 40,000 Christians have left Iraq since the American occupation began last year. Christians are a small fraction of Iraq's population of 25 million, but the figure has some significance because a vast majority of Christians own businesses.
 Security concerns cross from personal into professional lives. Mr. Hanna's restaurant remains shuttered, its blank facade a grim reminder of the attack that killed four people on New Year's Eve. Restaurants elsewhere in Harthiya neighborhood in Baghdad were nearly empty at 8 p.m. on a recent night. Before the war they would have been full, said Muhammad Farook, a manager at Coconut, a 200-seat burger restaurant with a handful of diners.
 Part of the problem is frequent power failures, said Omar Mufeed, a fast-food restaurant owner, who bought a second generator. Though his restaurant is as bright as a Christmas tree, the roads to it go dark when the power fails.
 ''Electricity is life in Baghdad,'' Mr. Mufeed said. He said that he had bought a Kalashnikov assault rifle for protection, but that the only time he used it was to fire in celebration when the Iraqi soccer team beat Australia in the Olympics.
 Still, some businesses -- primarily sellers of consumer goods -- are prospering. Vast numbers of public sector employees earn up to 100 times the few dollars they received each month under Mr. Hussein.
 Air-conditioners are selling quickly. Cars and jewelry are also selling well. Mr. Septi said he sold about twice as much as before the war.
 ''Three months ago people started buying,'' he said, while two women negotiated with a salesman for a $948 pendant on a gold chain. The buying, said Mr. Septi, 41, recalled a spree in the 1970's, a more peaceful and prosperous time in Iraq. 
 Another aspect of Iraq's economy that is encouraging business owners is the value of land and property. A spurt of buying when expatriate Iraqis returned fueled a mini-boom after Mr. Hussein fell. The price of a square meter of floor space, almost 11 square feet, jumped fourfold, to $1,000, said Assan al-Shamari, a real estate broker in Baghdad. It has since dropped to $800.
 Mr. Hanna has temporarily closed his clothing factory and sold a women's clothing store, but he is not, he emphasized, selling his land.
 The biggest profits come from government contracts. Those benefiting are mostly larger, well-connected companies, though small ones have profited, too, with the unusual opportunities and perils of the times. 
 Consider Mr. Hashim, who owned a small business importing soap before the war. A lucky moment in the Ministry of Trade after the Hussein government fell landed him a fistful of contracts, some for more than $1 million, importing food, water pumps and other items. His profits, he estimates, are five times what they were for his soap business. 
 But the business uses truck convoys from Jordan and Syria, traveling one of the most dangerous roads in Iraq. Mr. Hashim, a compact man with deep lines in his tanned face, uses his passionate anti-Americanism, family connections in Falluja, the stronghold of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, and force of will to get the trucks through. Security is provided by three groups along the route and has to be negotiated with a new provider each time to reduce the chances of ambush. 
 The convoys have been attacked twice. Once by thieves (a simple transaction in which Mr. Hashim paid $20,000 for the release of eight trucks) and once by Islamists (a more complex negotiation, in which he sought help from a local sheik).
 Ali Abdul Karim, a trucking company owner, said the attackers posted a man who poses as a soda seller at the border. He watches the traffic and uses a satellite phone to report.
 Most business owners interviewed for this article were relieved that Mr. Hussein had been removed. But they also fondly recalled the days when the appetite for bribes among state officials was kept in check by Mr. Hussein's fearsome system of control. Mr. Abdul Karim said that for a recent 100,000-ton shipment of sugar, he paid a ministry official $2 per ton.
 ''Before, they were afraid,'' he said. ''But now they ask officially.''
 Mr. Hanna spends the afternoons in his shop. Business is slow. He likes talking politics over Arabic coffee. Iraqi government officials are all part of a giant chess game, competing for the places closest to power. He, on the other hand, is planning a shopping center. He has the land, but the center is only an idea. 
 ''No new investment until we see what will happen,'' he said. ''I want to see people coming back to Iraq, foreigners coming, businesses opening up.''
 ''I don't want to leave,'' he added. ''Believe me.''

HEADLINE: Discovering An Inner Commando

BYLINE: By KEN TUCKER

 BODY:
THE reason that the large man's arm encircling my throat continues to cut off all air to my windpipe is because, of course, I'm having trouble with my groin strike. 
 Let me explain.
 I am scrawny, 140 pounds. As a boy I could never climb a rope, do a chin-up, or even a decent push-up. Just a year ago I thought that going to a gym was an idiocy tantamount to buying a CD by an ''American Idol'' contestant. Yet I find myself in thrall to Krav Maga, the Israeli self-defense technique developed in the late 1940's, introduced to a small but growing cult in America in the 80's, and nearly discredited after its moment of greatest media exposure, the dud 2002 Jennifer Lopez thriller ''Enough.'' (''Enough,'' in which Ms. Lopez learns the method to protect herself from Billy Campbell, is to Krav what ''Urban Cowboy'' was to mechanical-bull riding: it nearly ruined a perfectly pleasant way to hurt yourself and others.) 
 The national headquarters for Krav Maga (pronounced KRAHV ma-GAH) is in Los Angeles, where Angelina Jolie, Christian Slater and Shannon Elizabeth have taken lessons. Annabeth Gish of ''Mystic Pizza'' and ''The X-Files'' is married to one of Krav's foremost instructors, Wade Allen, a stunt coordinator for the recent Brad Pitt epic ''Troy.'' You know you're on Hollywood's mind when you rate mention in an HBO series -- a recent episode of ''Entourage'' found Jeremy Piven's slimy agent rebuffed by a woman who, repelled by his nerve, said, ''I take Krav Maga classes with your wife!'' And speaking of HBO, James Gandolfini of ''The Sopranos'' took lessons for a few years. 
 But it is in the sedate Philadelphia suburb of Berwyn that my windpipe is being squeezed. I am in a headlock courtesy of my Krav training partner, a wily, burly accountant named Joe; my assignment is to inflict enough pain to break free and put some distance between me and my ''attacker.'' 
 That's the unofficial Krav Maga mantra: Hurt them real bad and get away. To get out of a headlock, you're taught to bend in the direction you're being pushed anyway. Swing an arm down and hit the opponent's groin area with one hand. With the other, reach up and slap your index finger between his nose and upper lip (try it on yourself -- it stings). Push hard with that hand and your attacker's spine bends backward in a question-mark shape; he goes down. Done right, it's a startlingly effective move, whether you're on the giving or receiving end.
 Like so much Krav Maga, economy of movement combines with your hardest parts (fists, elbows, shins) against your opponent's softest (eyes, stomach, private parts). I have bony elbows, which in Krav amount to a special talent; I am especially good at delivering sharp ones to the face, neck or sternum. 
 My problem is, being sedentary and squeamish, I over-think everything, so when I'm choked, my mind doesn't scream, ''Hit him in the nether-region, Krav-king!'' No, my mind says, ''Hey, hey, where's the air? What move was I supposed to make here? Will this hurt my partner? Did I set the TiVo for 'The Amazing Race'? ''
 Krav Maga's remedy for this foolishness is to repeat the physical movements so many times that sense-memory eventually takes over the brains of self-conscious geeks like me. Soon, I'm doing the groin strike with sufficient force and have Joe down on the floor to finish off with ''combatives'': pulled-back-for-safety but still slammingly deployed punches and kicks. Then, of course, Joe does the same thing to me, only harder. 
 How did all this start? One day, my wife rescued from the trash a flier I had tossed out with some junk mail. She said, ''Isn't this the self-defense thing you read about and wanted to try?'' I had seen a newspaper article about a no-frills fighting method that translated from the Hebrew as ''contact combat.'' The card said a Krav Maga site had opened not five minutes from where I live in Berwyn. It was fate; it was combat kismet; it was like getting a sign from God, from Yahweh, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had to try this.
 So I -- a creaky WASP, able to generate income only by sitting on my buttocks and writing mean things about various members of the entertainment industry -- was soon attending Krav Maga classes populated by folks ranging in age from early 20's to mid 50's, college kids, police officers, housewives. I had signed up for sessions led by Scott Gallagher, a Bluto to my Wimpy, a muscled, head-shaven, goateed 31-year-old man who, I would learn, is a Jew raised a Quaker, a former police officer and bodyguard, a mail-order minister of the peace and an off-but-usually-on stand-up comedian.
 Watching two guys taking turns trying to push each other across the room with ''chambered'' kicks to the stomach (hint: pull your knee up to your chest before rocketing it forward), Mr. Gallagher muttered, ''A lawyer and an accountant -- hard to know who to root for, isn't it?'' 
 There are side benefits to Krav Maga; the warm-up session alone is a solid cardio workout. And while bruising is initially inevitable until you learn the fighting stances and defenses properly, the chronic back pain I used to have in my pre-Krav days disappeared after I began a pattern of one-hour classes three times a week. I also meet interesting people, like Jenn McGurk, who comes up to my chest and laughs frequently in a jolly giggle. She can pull a six-foot-plus man down to her level with a hard slap to the back of his neck with her palm and a well-placed knee to the gut. And by ''man'' I mean me.
 As humiliation goes, though, I have that beat easily. I failed spectacularly in my first attempt to attain the novice rank of yellow belt. I was dismissed halfway through the session as ''unprepared,'' and left that class blinking back -- yes -- tears. I experienced the agony of defeat most people leave behind in adolescence. But I also retook the test a month later, bruised from obsessive training and whispering ''Groin strike! Groin strike!'' and earned my title. In the space of seven months, I became the sort of fellow who, if you provoke me, can put an elbow through your jaw with something approaching glee. 
 You know, I bet Jenn McGurk could whip J.Lo. And James Gandolfini, be forewarned: If you don't get new episodes of ''The Sopranos'' on the air sooner than next year, I've got an elbow I'd like you to meet.

SAMMY'S HILL
By Kristin Gore.
387 pp. Miramax Books/Hyperion. $23.95.
 This comic romance novel by Al Gore's daughter Kristin appears to be the product of poll testing and market research -- fitting enough in a town, Washington, where people treat their social lives like a political campaign, sending out drunken calls for company at 2 a.m. via BlackBerry and organizing think-tank happy hours as mock ''departmental summits.'' According to an account in The New York Times, the film producer/force of nature Harvey Weinstein and Jonathan Burnham, the editor in chief of Miramax Books, decided to publish a chick-lit novel set in Washington. Three weeks later, they found their author: Kristin Gore, then 26, whose prior professional writing experience included stints at ''Saturday Night Live'' and the Fox animated show ''Futurama.'' At a reception for the nonprofit where Gore's sister works, the wealthy culture baron and the well-connected offspring of a political dynasty had a conversation that seems more the stuff of fiction than its source: ''What I really, really want to do is write a novel,'' said Ms. Gore. ''What a coincidence,'' replied Mr. Weinstein. What a country.
 The book produced by ''this great serendipitous moment'' (as Gore described it) is a little better than its command-economy lineage might suggest, though such circumstances do set the bar awfully low. The basic story is reliably familiar: girl falls for Mr. Apparently Right, who turns out to be Mr. Completely Wrong; meanwhile, Mr. Apparently Annoying becomes Mr. Right All Along. The cast in this case is Washington-specific: the protagonist, Samantha (Sammy, natch) Joyce, is a senate staffer, Mr. Wrong is an up-and-coming speechwriter (Aaron Driver) and the Spencer Tracy role is filled by Charlie Lawton, a junior reporter at The Washington Post. This plot is chick lit's little black dress -- an empty form made appealing by how it's filled out. 
 But the design of ''Sammy's Hill'' is far too skimpy to accommodate the many incidents stuffed inside it. Subplots spin off like riders on an appropriation bill, including a presidential campaign, a speech-plagiarizing scandal, Congressional adulterers, cheating boyfriends, a minor bit of North Korean espionage and, perhaps most prominent -- and unintentionally hilarious -- the passage of a ''comprehensive prescription drug plan for the millions of Americans struggling to afford their health care.''
 Samantha is equally burdened: she is a bundle of aggressively quirky habits and obsessions, from her celebration of odd anniversaries and holidays (''the 29th anniversary of the epic series finale of 'The Partridge Family,' '' ''the 396th anniversary of the first reported eggnog drinking in America'') to her penchant for acting out bizarre worst-case scenarios: 
 ''As I . . . began scavenging for clean clothes, it occurred to me how difficult these simple tasks would be without my right arm. . . . So I took a moment to do what I always did whenever these neuroses attacked. I reached for a sling from my pile of medical supplies, fashioned it around my right arm and continued my routine with this new handicap.''
 This flighty bumptiousness makes ''Sammy's Hill'' a painfully frustrating read. Wacky behavior makes a poor substitute for comedy and strange tics for character; the many humiliations the author rains upon Sammy don't make her seem adorable, just slightly deranged. Sammy's little experiment in imaginary amputation, for example, results in her boarding the subway wearing nonmatching shoes -- and not just any nonmatching shoes ''but a tan sandal and a bright red sneaker.'' This is probably supposed to be a hilarious exaggeration of a mistake anyone might make, but the specifics here betray the other trait that undermines the whole book: Gore's maddeningly careless writing. I was more puzzled than amused that anyone able to dress herself could confuse tying a shoe and buckling a sandal. 
 But if Gore did not think through the physical actions of her characters, she may have thought a little too hard about their work. ''Sammy's Hill'' is littered with jargon, and it's not ironic satire of Hill patois. Nope, the process of enacting and gaining support for legislation is presented with sober earnestness and in more detail than any of the novel's meager sex scenes. It's ''Bridget Jones's Federal Diary.'' People ''interface with their representative'' and, reflecting on an unexpected reversal of fortune, Sammy notes, ''I considered it a surprising and important lesson about how quickly things could change in the world of politics.'' In one climactic scene, Sammy's passions explode into a lengthy soliloquy before her boss: ''The current laws in the United States prevent anybody except the manufacturer from importing prescription drugs,'' she declares. ''However, law enforcement has long turned a blind eye to Americans returning from Canada with supplies of the prescription drugs that they've procured there for half the price they would pay in the U.S. And in the last few years, several independent operators. . . .'' Say one thing about Kristin Gore: she is her father's daughter.
 The sloppy prose that pervades the book is an unfortunate reminder of its genesis. Its off-the-rack plot, running together B-grade chick-lit with campaign-trail policy talk, is the predictable outcome of a publishing focus group. It's not bad, it's just not any good. God knows, an astringent romantic satire is long overdue in a town where work is foreplay and the vibrating object in a couple's bed could easily be a two-way pager. ''Sammy's Hill,'' however, lacks buzz.

HEADLINE: Not Perfect, but a Recovery All the Same

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF there are any nonpartisan economists left -- besides me, of course -- one of them should write a book on Bush 43 Economics. It's a rich subject, involving many contradictions and mysteries. 
 For example, the administration of the supposedly conservative Bush 43 has executed probably the most extreme and successful use of Keynesian contracyclical economic policy ever, dwarfing that of Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy. 
 Bush 43's immense tax cuts and deficits pretty much stopped a gathering recession dead in its tracks. The mechanism would be interesting to understand, if such understanding is possible. 
 We know far less about economics than the entry-level economics student is allowed to realize, but it is beginning to look as if much-maligned Keynesianism may be in for rehabilitation. 
 We may also try to understand why substantial budget deficits generated by Bush 43's antirecessionary tax cuts did not lead to any meaningful inflation. This goes against some major economic theories and is a bit of a mystery. 
 In the same vein, we may wonder why the substantial budget deficits did not drive up interest rates. This is even more interesting because the budget deficits were accompanied by staggering foreign trade, or current account, deficits. These might have been expected to lead to a huge decline in the value of the dollar, even larger than its 20 percent drop in the last couple of years against the euro, accompanied by higher interest rates and inflation. 
 This should have led to far greater American exports and a closer approach to equilibrium in trade accounts. But none of these things happened. What did happen is a substantial, though not perfect, recovery from the economic weakness that began when Bill Clinton was president. The mystery here is why, given the state of the economy, it is still often described in the news media as shaky or by speakers at the Democratic National Convention as miserable.
 The facts, though, are impressive. Bear in mind that Mr. Clinton ran in 1996 on a platform of pride in economic strength -- and he should have. The economy was strong in '96. But, adjusted for inflation and growth in population, it is considerably stronger now.
 In 1996, the real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product was roughly $30,800 per capita. In the summer of 2004, it was roughly $36,700, up roughly 19 percent, not a small number. 
 The increase from 2000, when Al Gore campaigned rightly on boasts of very high prosperity, is smaller, but it's still roughly 5.5 percent. This is not great, but it's far from a Hoover-style situation.
 In 1996, per capita disposable personal income, adjusted for inflation -- what a person, on average, has left to spend after taxes -- was about $22,500. In the second quarter of this year, it was about $27,150, a gain of 21 percent, a truly large amount. Even from the superbubble levels of the 2000 campaign, real per capita personal disposable income is up 6.9 percent, far from a tragedy.
 Some economists say people's welfare is much better measured by what they buy than by what they earn. The first measure takes into account transfers to the poor and the elderly, which are an addition to the amount they can spend beyond what they earn. These transfers are a very large number in today's world. 
 By that measure, Americans' well-being since 1996 is substantially improved. In 1996, inflation-adjusted per capita consumption was $20,835. In the second quarter of 2004, it was $25,765, a gain of roughly 24 percent. Even since 2000, the gain has been about 8 percent.
 Then there are numbers that are not usually calculated on a per capita basis or adjusted for inflation, but are still revealing. Corporate profits are running at the rate of roughly $925 billion a year as of the first quarter of 2004. This is a slight slowdown from the record rate of $942 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003, but still a healthy number. 
 In 1996, when we thought we were in very high prosperity -- and we were -- they were at $736 billion, so the gain since then is about 26 percent. This is by no means a record-breaking rate of profit growth, but it is at least in line with long-term trends. Profits are up roughly 22 percent from 2000. (These are pretax profits. The percentage gains on after-tax profits are considerably larger. And it's important to remember that most of these profits are owned by retired or eventually-to-be-retired workers and their families.)
 Then there is the unemployment rate, which, at 5.4 percent, is the same as the average in 1996 (although higher than the rate in 2000). It is also lower than the average rate in the 1970's, 80's or 90's. Home ownership is enjoyed by a higher fraction of the population than ever before: close to 70 percent.
 Average hourly earnings, in 1982 dollars, are 8.3 percent higher than they were in 1996, and about 2 percent higher than in 2000. Again, these are not insignificant numbers, although the growth since 2000 in many areas has been disappointing -- but not if you hypothesize that we were about to enter a major correction after the inventory bubble of 1999-2000 and we avoided most of the pain usually associated with such a correction.
 To be sure, there are problems. That gain in real disposable income was bought by cutting taxes and adding to future generations' indebtedness -- although this is standard practice in a great deal of modern politics and economics. (As President Ronald Reagan is supposed to have said so aptly when told that his tax cuts were adding to posterity's burdens, ''What has posterity ever done for me?'') And by one measure, we have certainly lost about a million jobs since 2000, although by another measure we have added jobs. 
 But this administration can run truthfully on a platform of considerably greater prosperity than Mr. Clinton did in 1996 and of somewhat greater prosperity, by most measures, than Mr. Gore did in 2000. This was accomplished despite the terrorist attacks. 
 There is one other note about Mr. Bush's tenure. It is possible that his tax cuts were too large -- although the people who still have jobs because of them would disagree. And it is possible that the very rich, like Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry, got excessively large tax cuts. 
 But there is no well-known mechanism by which anything Mr. Bush did or proposed leads to anything but recovery -- even at the cost of higher federal deficits. That is, even if there is lower employment than we would like, there is no clearly understood mechanism by which Mr. Bush's policies led to unemployment. 
 Some theorists say that by allowing well-to-do people to have large tax cuts, middle-class people who ''should'' have gotten all of the tax cuts did not have enough purchasing power, and that this led to insufficient consumer spending. 
 But consumer spending held up unusually well during the slowdown and into the recovery, and it continues to be strong despite current worries that the economy's growth may be decelerating. In fact, consumer spending has risen in every year since 1996. If the Bush tax policies are somehow connected to the lost jobs, it is by a mechanism generally unknown, unless it is general discouragement caused by the criticism of Mr. Bush in the news media.
 And, this, to be fair, should also be in the book about Bush 43 Economics.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: Kerry's 'Apocalypse Now'

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
LESS than 48 hours after Bill Clinton, speaking from his hospital room, advised the politically ailing John Kerry to start talking less about Vietnam and more about health care, seven American marines were blown up outside Fallujah. So much for the pipedream of changing the subject of this election. Vietnam keeps popping out of America's darkest closet not just because Mr. Kerry conspicuously served there and Mr. Bush conspicuously did not, but because of what's happening half a world away in real time: a televised war in Iraq that resembles its Southeast Asian predecessor in its unpopularity, its fictional provocation and its unknown exit strategy. That war isn't going anywhere by Nov. 2, even as it is sporadically obscured by Florida storm clouds, and its Vietnam undertow isn't going anywhere either. Everyone knows that a Tet offensive, Sunni-style, could yet tilt this election in a direction unknown. 
 But while Vietnam cannot be escaped, that hasn't stopped both men from working overtime in their fruitless efforts to escape it. Their motives could not be more different: George W. Bush doesn't want quagmire analogies to Iraq, and Mr. Kerry doesn't want a referendum on his own Vietnam history. Yet weirdly enough, their strategies have been identical: they've each tried to deflect Vietnam by turning back the clock to World War II. They hope to bask in the reflected glory of a good war that had been transformed into a nostalgia craze in the ''Saving Private Ryan'' era of American pop culture just before 9/11.
 Thus President Bush's acceptance speech, which included yet another of his Reagan-lite efforts to wrap himself in Normandy, was heralded by invocations of F.D.R. from nearly every speaker: Laura Bush, Tommy Franks, Zell Miller and Dick Cheney, who went so far as to inform us that he and Roosevelt share the same birthday. (Rudy Giuliani one-upped them all by equating Mr. Bush with Churchill.) Of course these World War II flashbacks had to come to a screeching halt before identifying the present Hitler, Osama bin Laden. To take the analogy that far would be to remind the audience that we had diverted troops and money from the essential war against al Qaeda and Islamic fanaticism to open an optional second front against Iraq's secular despot.
 For Mr. Kerry, the World War II theatrics were just as tricky. The martial panoply of his convention culminated in his using ''band of brothers'' and ''greatest generation'' twice each in his acceptance speech -- a patent effort to inoculate service in a controversial war with phrases that, courtesy of HBO and Tom Brokaw, have become our culture's indelible brand for World War II's unambiguous heroism. The Democrats' hope was that no one would think about what happened after the Vietnam band of brothers came home and split apart, at which point Mr. Kerry's antiwar role pushed him into closer proximity to My Lai than Iwo Jima.
 The bait-and-switch substitution of World War II for Vietnam quickly proved a bridge too far for both candidates. Just when they thought they had fled Vietnam, it returned, whacking them in the face like a perpetually revolving door. No sooner did Mr. Kerry's convention end than he was impaled by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. No sooner did the Republicans leave New York than word got out that ''60 Minutes'' was poking anew into the president's National Guard stint, a Pandora's box of unanswered questions first unlocked by The Boston Globe four years ago. Now there's a ''Texans for Truth'' ad campaign trailing him in mimicry of the Swifties.
 The next explosive chapter in the unstoppable Vietnam narrative will be unveiled Tuesday night, when the documentary ''Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry'' has its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, in a country that is itself synonymous with anti-Vietnam protest. This is the movie made by George Butler, a Kerry friend for four decades, and inspired in part by Douglas Brinkley's ''Tour of Duty,'' the adulatory biography that boomeranged by launching a thousand negative media bites on the Kerry war record. Though early reports suggested that Mr. Butler would concentrate on Mr. Kerry's present campaign as well as his past, that's not how the finished film turned out. ''Going Upriver,'' made without Mr. Kerry's involvement, is all Vietnam all the time. It opens on some 200 screens across the United States on Oct. 1 -- the morning after the first scheduled presidential debate.
 Mr. Butler reveres John Kerry. His film contains not a negative word about him. But that doesn't mean that the Kerry forces, so busily trying to ''change the subject'' of the campaign from Vietnam, are going to cheer ''Going Upriver.'' To Democratic pols hoping that the election will now be about job creation, this friendly movie may be akin to friendly fire.
 Only the first third of ''Going Upriver'' is consistent with the ''band of brothers,'' Vietnam-era Kerry they do want us to see: it makes palpable just how brave it was for their man to venture into a 2,600-mile river surrounded by dense foliage where assailants hid, ready to strike at any time. You can appreciate why Swift boats in Mr. Kerry's division had casualty rates as high as 90 percent and how grotesque it is that Mr. Kerry's foes savage him now for having served ''only'' four months. (Would they say the same of those who have been wounded or killed in other wars, including Iraq, within four months of deployment?)
 But then Mr. Kerry returns home. Mr. Butler has gathered seemingly every frame of archival film extant on the red-letter events of the Vietnam veterans' antiwar movement of 1971: the ''Winter Soldier'' investigations about American war crimes, the veterans' march on Washington, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that turned Mr. Kerry into a political star. The young vet's charisma so upset Richard Nixon that he schemed with Charles Colson and Bob Haldeman to counter Mr. Kerry with a pro-Vietnam attack dog: John O'Neill, today the leader of the Swifties and the co-author of their best-selling bible, ''Unfit for Command.'' In ''Going Upriver,'' the whole plot is crystal-clear on a contemporaneous White House tape. 
 Mr. Butler, best known for ''Pumping Iron,'' the 1977 documentary that first turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a national commodity, can be a powerful storyteller. And nowhere more so than when he gets to the scene where Mr. Kerry and his buddies protest the war by throwing medals and ribbons over a fence onto the Capitol steps. This incident has been stigmatized as an ugly un-American activity by the Kerry detractors. But the scene plays quite differently when you see it here, not as a grainy snapshot but as an extended cinematic drama, pieced together by Mr. Butler from his own photos and the large and heretofore scattered film record made by the many news organizations present that day.
 What stares you in the face is the anguish and grief of men who put their lives in the line of fire for a government that undertook a pointless war, mismanaged it, kept it going out of hubris and then abandoned it. These veterans do not lightheartedly toss away the symbols of their sacrifice in Vietnam; they struggle with tears and violently conflicted emotions as they do so. They are battered men often wearing the ragtag remnants of their uniforms. Their eyes are haunted. They are willing to engage in self-annihilation, eradicating the record of their own heroism in battle, if that's what it takes to prevent their brothers from continuing to die in a doomed mission. Watch this and try not to weep.
 Set against this real-life backdrop of the time, Mr. Kerry's famous line before J. W. Fulbright, Jacob Javits and the rest of that Senate committee regains its patriotic force: ''How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?'' And as Todd Gitlin documents in his history, ''The Sixties,'' the young Kerry's antiwar stance was hardly anomalous among his fellow Vietnam warriors by then, those still serving included. By that late point in the war -- three years after Tet, L.B.J.'s abdication and Walter Cronkite's public declaration that we were ''mired in stalemate'' -- there were seven desertions and 17 AWOL incidents for every 100 American soldiers. There were more than 250 antiwar newspapers within the armed forces alone. And still another 13,000 Americans were yet to die for the mistake.
 It's hard to imagine paying crowds turning out for ''Going Upriver'' or any hagiographic feature film about any presidential candidate, no matter what its quality or political orientation. If anything, we're reaching the saturation point where we want to run away from both of these guys. But some of the crucial scenes in Mr. Butler's movie will inevitably filter into the 24/7 media ethosphere, much as the ''My Pet Goat'' sequence of ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' reached millions who never saw Michael Moore's film. There, out of context, those vignettes will be battered by the Swifties on Fox News and minimized by the Kerry operatives who want to talk about anything except Vietnam.
 The person who might most benefit from seeing ''Going Upriver'' is Mr. Kerry himself. ''It takes a special courage to speak out against a cause for which you were once prepared to die,'' Jeffrey Smith, a West Point-trained C.I.A. man of the Kerry-Bush generation, wrote in The Washington Post last weekend. That's the courageous hero of George Butler's film, all but invisible in the cautious candidate running for president with a position on Iraq so full of codicils that one of his top foreign-policy aides, Jamie Rubin, recently misstated it. Even Pat Buchanan articulates the ill effects of the Iraq war on the war on terror more precisely than Mr. Kerry. The Democrat's latest salvo on Iraq -- ''the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time'' -- no more undoes his past self-contradictory remarks on the subject than alliterative Bush slogans like ''reformer with results'' and ''compassionate conservatism'' give the president a coherent domestic policy.
 Then again, if Mr. Clinton and the other new Kerry advisers are right and health care really turns out to be the most important issue in the election, it may not matter what their man says about Iraq. And if Mr. Bush can really persuade voters that the war in Iraq is World War II redux, he is no more likely to lose reelection in 2004 than F.D.R. was in 1944. But the same Newsweek poll that gave Mr. Bush an 11-point lead last weekend also found that most of these same Americans do not believe that the war in Iraq has made us safer. That's a Vietnam election-year dynamic, no matter how much the president or Mr. Kerry wants to run away from it. It's why the thousandth American casualty in Iraq may weigh more than the fractional fluctuations of the unemployment rate. It's why Fallujah, not Ohio, may prove the swing state to watch.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 2, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 30 about a videotaped message from Osama bin Laden in which he told the United States that it could avoid a repetition of the 9/11 attacks if it stopped threatening Muslims' security referred incorrectly to material being read in a Florida classroom where President Bush was visiting when he learned of the attacks. (The error also appeared in earlier articles, starting on May 23.) The reading was a story -- not a book -- and it was titled ''The Pet Goat,'' not ''My Pet Goat.'' A reader telephoned last week to point out the error.

CONSERVATIVE pundits routinely accuse the news media of injecting a liberal bias into coverage of issues from abortion to gun control to gay marriage. 
 Now, two months before the presidential election, the economy has been invited to the culture wars. In a new paper, Kevin A. Hassett and John R. Lott Jr., economists at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research organization in Washington, say they have discovered that economic reporters commit the same archetypal sin: slanting the news unequivocally in favor of the Democrats.
 How can a nugget of news like the economy's addition of 308,000 new jobs in March -- the biggest monthly gain in about four years -- yield a report that The Associated Press labeled ''Bond prices tumble on jobs data''? Bias, the researchers suspected. 
 The two economists combed through 389 newspapers and A.P. reports contained in the LexisNexis database from January 1991 through May 2004, during the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. They picked out headlines about gross domestic product growth, unemployment, retail sales and orders of durable goods and classified the headlines' depiction of the economy as either positive, negative, neutral or mixed. Then they crunched some numbers.
 They found that Mr. Clinton received better headlines than the two Republican presidents. Even after adjusting the data to compensate for differences in economic performance under the three presidents, the Republicans received 20 to 30 percent fewer positive headlines, on average, for the same type of news, they concluded.
 For instance, they said, the unemployment rate in the Clinton administration averaged 5.2 percent, only three-tenths of a percentage point less than it has under George W. Bush. But while 44 percent of Mr. Clinton's headlines on unemployment were positive, only 23 percent of President Bush's headlines on the subject have been upbeat.
 The found that as a group, the nation's 10 largest newspapers and The Associated Press were even more skewed. According to the researchers, this group gave Republican administrations 20 to 40 percent fewer positive headlines than those given to Mr. Clinton, on average. Among the top 10 newspapers, they said that all except The Houston Chronicle had a pro-Democratic leaning, though the margin for error in their calculations was too large to be meaningful for most of them individually. 
 ''We have not constructed tests that identify a motive for the bias,'' Mr. Hassett said. ''A desire to aid the political fortunes of Democrats could explain the patterns we see in the data.'' The research has attracted some interest outside of conservative circles. Christopher D. Carroll, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who served on Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said the paper by Mr. Hassett and Mr. Lott was ''the first serious statistical attempt to look at the question that I've seen.''
 The researchers said liberal bias in economic reporting was also uncovered in a 1988 study by Ted J. Smith III of Virginia Commonwealth University. In it, he said that network television coverage during the Reagan administration focused on negative economic stories, criticized the administration for bad news and failed to give it credit for good news.
 Although many news-media watchdogs take business reporters to task for biases, few say the problem stems from a political slant. ''One of the main biases we've found in business reporting is cheerleading,'' said Jim Naureckas, an editor at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, which is on the left side of the political spectrum. He argues that the news media tend to favor the point of view of business because they depend on advertising from business. 
 Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who also served as an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton, said that, if anything, current economic coverage favored Mr. Bush by letting the administration get away with blaming 9/11 for the economy's poor performance. 
 Jack Shafer, the media critic of Slate, the Web journal, was skeptical of the study, saying that it was based solely on headlines, not on an appraisal of actual news articles. ''A headline is not coverage,'' he said. 
 While the researchers of the American Enterprise Institute claim to expose the political bias of the reporting, Mr. Carroll said, it was unlikely that they succeeded in stripping out other factors. He said the reporting of economic statistics depended on broad perceptions of the state of the economy, which are influenced by many variables. The fact that the economy did better under Mr. Clinton than either of the Bushes probably affected the coverage more than the researchers allowed for.
 Moreover, Mr. Carroll pointed out that the results had large statistical margins of error. ''I'm not persuaded that the results have any statistical significance,'' he said. 
 AND what of the researchers' own objectivity? Critics question both their scholarship and their motivations in releasing this research in the middle of a presidential campaign in which the economy is no small issue. Mr. Hassett was an adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, during his bid for the presidency in 2000, and a co-author of ''Dow 36,000,'' a wildly bullish analysis of the stock market's prospects. 
 Mr. Lott's research supporting gun ownership as a crime deterrent has also come under criticism. He acknowledged that he assumed a pseudonym -- Mary Rosh-- to write his own praise and defend his positions in online debate on that subject from 2000 through January 2003. 
 Mr. Lott said that the things he had said in the guise of Ms. Rosh were, indeed, truthful.
 And Mr. Hassett and Mr. Lott said that their research is a serious attempt to quantify political bias, an area that has rarely been studied statistically. This hasn't convinced all critics, of course.
 ''To even base a story on Lott's work at this point in time is to demonstrate a pronounced bias toward right-wing hacks,'' said Brad DeLong, a liberal-leaning economist at the University of California at Berkeley.

HEADLINE: Westchester Republicans at the Convention

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 It is difficult to feel sympathy for Westchester delegates to the Republican convention when they complain of verbal mistreatment from protesters (''The Delegate as Commuter,'' Sept. 5). These people are proud members of a party that lied to take us into a war that has cost the lives of 1,000 Americans and far more Iraqis. 
 They support policies that provided tax cuts for the rich while turning the largest surplus in the country's history into a deficit that will haunt our economy for a generation.
 They belong to a party that has ruthlessly and dishonestly attacked John Kerry's patriotism, courage and character. They have even stooped so low as to mock all decorated veterans by sporting Purple Heart Band-Aids in an attempt to further discredit Mr. Kerry's service in Vietnam.
 Why are they so surprised that they didn't receive the same hugs and flowers on the streets of New York City that they said our troops would receive upon entering Baghdad?

HEADLINE: With Eye on Hurricane, Floridians Seek Safety

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and JOEL BRINKLEY; Felicity Barringer reported from Tampa for this article, and Joel Brinkley from Key West.

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Florida's nerve endings, like an inconstant radio dial, are tuned to two overlapping frequencies right now -- the easy listening music of everyday life and the emergency broadcast system. With a third powerful hurricane bearing down on Florida within a month, thousands of residents spent the weekend uncertain whether, when or where to flee.
 In areas like Tampa and Clearwater, which two days ago seemed to be in the bull's-eye of Hurricane Ivan's track but are now less likely targets, people went to church or to the beach or sipped cappuccino outside a boarded-up Starbucks as if it were a normal Sunday. But motorists' eyes were trained on gas stations to see if plastic bags covered the nozzles at the pumps -- the universally understood signal for ''no gas.'' Wal-Marts in the area had trouble meeting the demand for five-gallon gas cans. 
 In the Mariner's Cove trailer park in Clearwater, Eddie Caballer and his wife, Glenda Vidal, along with her brother Sam Vidal, had decided what they would do if Hurricane Ivan turned back east.
 ''If it's a Category 3, we leave the trailer and stay in Pinellas County'' at Sam Vidal's home, Glenda Vidal said. ''If it's a 4 or a 5, we head out for Orlando.''
 Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on Sunday, but his sober reminder of Hurricane Ivan's strength seemed at odds with the quiet sighs of relief heard along the western coast of the state. Still, many residents -- after witnessing the fury of Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances over the last several weeks -- were not taking chances.
 ''My boyfriend doesn't want to stay,'' said Debbie Cobrusso, a Tampa resident who was at work this weekend at a convenience store in Nokomis, a coastal town 40 miles to the south. Ms. Cobrusso added, ''We've got two brand-new skylights, courtesy of Frances.''
 Asked where she was headed, Ms. Cobrusso replied, ''To the opposite end of the state.''
 A customer at the convenience store, who would give only his first name, Dan, nodded, saying: ''I was here for two. I'm not staying for a third. I'm going wherever it's not.''
 By that definition, he could have headed almost anywhere in the central and southern areas of the state, based on the increasingly westward drift of the path meteorologists expect Hurricane Ivan to take. By Sunday evening, the hurricane was forecast to skirt the western edge of Cuba on Monday afternoon and to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday on the Florida Panhandle near Panama City.
 The changing forecasts brought some doubt, some relief and some frustration to residents of the Florida Keys, 60 percent of whom had evacuated since Thursday.
 Some watching the storm's predicted track edge westward have begun clamoring to return to their homes in the Keys, said W.A. Wagner Jr., the senior director of emergency management for Monroe County. 
 But given the power of the storm and the risk that it could still swing east, Mr. Wagner said, he would keep the causeways shut for another day.
 Standing outside his chapel on Sunday, the Rev. Eugene Frame, the pastor of the Tampa First Church of the Nazarene, said: ''I've had a lot of calls. People are just frantic.''
 The unpredictable course of the third, and possibly the strongest, hurricane pointed toward Florida has exacerbated the stress for people who have either evacuated twice in the last month or lived through the frightening howling of the winds.
 Two of Mr. Frame's parishioners, Brenda Zimmerman and Todd Wendel, stood outside the church after services on Sunday pondering how to reschedule their engagement shower. It was to be held on Tuesday but was canceled. 
 ''When I first heard about Ivan, I freaked out,'' Ms. Zimmerman said. ''And I was disappointed because I knew the shower was gone.'' Now, she said, she is much calmer. ''After the first two have gone over, you're not going to get as upset.''
 On the partially deserted island of Key West, many people were wary of the forecasters' suggestions that Hurricane Ivan was now likely to strike a glancing blow, at worst. Not for Hurricanes Charley or Frances did Key West close up as thoroughly as it did this weekend. Except for a few bars, every business downtown was closed. Duvall Street, usually bustling on a beautiful weekend afternoon, was deserted Saturday and Sunday.
 ''This is the first time in the history of Key West that residents have taken this so seriously,'' Julio Avael, the city manager, said in an interview. ''This time, folks are heeding the warnings.''
 Most residents of Key West saw pictures of the devastation Hurricane Ivan wrought on the island of Grenada, and since then their attention has remained fixed on storm updates.
 All the tourists, the economic lifeblood of Key West, are gone. ''The last one checked out on Thursday,'' said Robert M. Spoto, general manager of La Concha Hotel, in the center of the tourist district. ''We are now the refuge of last resort.''
 The on-again, off-again threats that the storm, now the sixth-largest ever spawned in the Atlantic basin, could hit the Gulf Coast produced a patchwork of evacuations and closings. Dozens of elderly residents at an independent living facility in Charlotte County, north of Fort Myers, whiled away the weekend in a Tampa hotel. Public schools announced they would close in at least five counties around Tampa Bay.
 But government offices would remain open, local officials announced.

HEADLINE: Some Albany Hopefuls Are Challenging Albany's Ways

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
While dissatisfaction with Albany has yet to translate into a widespread, throw-the-rascals-out movement, in a handful of races from Buffalo to the Bronx, insurgent candidates are taking on Albany's ways and its legislative leaders this year.
 Buffalo has suddenly turned into a hotbed of sentiment against Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver -- from his fellow Democrats. 
 Joseph Golombek Jr., a Buffalo city councilman who is challenging Assemblyman Sam Hoyt in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, has called for ousting Mr. Silver. So have two Democrats who are running to fill a vacant Assembly seat in an adjoining district; a third said he would support Mr. Silver only if he got a written pledge that the state budget would be produced on time. 
 Mr. Golombek said that he was struck by how deeply resentment of Albany has seeped into the public consciousness. He said that all over Buffalo voters are upset that the state budget has been late for 20 years in a row, and that they blame Albany's autocratic style of government, sometimes described as ''three men in a room,'' in which all decisions are made by Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. 
 ''I probably run into several people in every election district who know who Shelly Silver is, know that there are problems, are vehemently against the three men in a room,'' Mr. Golombek said in a telephone interview.
 In the Bronx, John Fleming, a retired New York City police detective who is running in the Republican primary to succeed Senator Guy J. Velella, who resigned this year after pleading guilty to a bribery-related charge, is running in part against Mr. Bruno. 
 ''Bruno, to me, is not a Republican leader anymore,'' Mr. Fleming said. He said that Mr. Bruno had embraced increasingly liberal issues and was even supporting a Democratic assemblyman, Stephen B. Kaufman, in the Republican primary.
 ''I hope my race sends a message to Republicans who oppose Bruno,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''We need some of the more experienced, longer-tenured senators to step forward to say, 'We're going the wrong way here.''' 
 Then there is the Fix Albany campaign, a drive started by the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, that is taking aim at a Democrat in the Assembly and a Republican in the Senate to send the message that Albany must be changed.
 Of course, sitting state lawmakers have some of the best job protection in the country. Thanks to carefully drawn districts that tend to favor one party strongly over another, the ease of raising money from lobbyists and special interests, and the power to send constituents taxpayer-financed mail praising their achievements, lawmakers are re-elected more than 98 percent of the time. Although there are 212 seats in the Legislature, political analysts predict there will be only a few competitive races.
 But the anti-Albany sentiment is attracting notice. 
 ''It's a different kind of dynamic now,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''There are people being primaried in the Assembly by challengers who say they won't support Silver. That doesn't happen. The Republicans in the Senate are increasingly relying on Democrats to keep their majority. That's new.''
 Assemblyman Hoyt, the incumbent being challenged by Mr. Golombek in Buffalo, is clearly feeling the heat. He was one of the first lawmakers to sign on to a call to change the state Constitution to give the state a one-house Legislature, abolish public authorities, overhaul the budget process and put an end to gerrymandering. 
 ''I'm in the midst of a very tough primary battle, and the message that is coming loud and clear from my district -- and I think this is consistent throughout upstate New York -- is that people want reform,'' Mr. Hoyt said. 
 ''I'm knocking on doors and people are saying, 'We're fed up with three men in a room,''' he said. ''While I can make an argument about how I am an agent of reform, but working within the system I have to work with, people are fired up and angry.''
 Mr. Hoyt said local Republicans were behind the bid to unseat him. The Erie County executive, Joel A. Giambra, a Republican, started a group called Renew New York that is mailing fliers opposing Mr. Hoyt, including one that shows nine unflattering pictures of Mr. Hoyt with the word ''problem'' running across his forehead. 
 ''I decided that trying to use peaceful persuasion was not getting the job done, was not getting anybody's attention in Albany,'' Mr. Giambra said in an interview, saying that he expected the group to spend more than $50,000 in the race. He said he took on a Democrat -- unlike Mr. Suozzi, who has made targets of lawmakers from both parties -- only because he wanted a race in which the challenger is viable, and he believes he found one in Mr. Golombek.
 But his involvement is attracting criticism from Democrats.
 ''The Erie County Republicans are blatantly attempting to influence this primary to distract attention from the fact that although Governor Pataki has said President Bush's economic policies are working, the people of western New York know that's not true,'' said Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker.
 But the speaker is becoming an issue in the next district as well. 
 Mark J.F. Schroeder, an Erie County legislator running for the Assembly, said he would demand a written pledge from Mr. Silver promising an on-time budget before supporting him. But at least he holds out the possibility of supporting him. 
 Paul Sullivan, a former streets and sanitation commissioner in Buffalo, said, ''I will not support any of the current leadership.'' And the third candidate, Thomas Casey, said he would fight what he called ''the dictatorship we presently have.''
 Mr. Golombek said he knew it would be hard for him in the Legislature if he campaigned by criticizing Mr. Silver, who hands out committee assignments and the stipends that go with them, and controls what laws are passed and what pork is doled out. 
 ''They can throw a perk here and a perk there,'' he said, ''but in the final analysis all of the districts in New York State are harmed because of the current system.''

HEADLINE: Wilderness To War Zones: In Relentless Pursuit of Oil

BYLINE: By NED MARTEL

 BODY:
Oil is often described majestically as the lifeblood of the global economy, the fluid that courses through major arteries and fuels the industrial pulse. But after three hours spent watching ''Extreme Oil,'' the crude energy source seems more an addictive stimulant that leaves a mess after use and drives its dependents to madness just to acquire more.
 This adventurous three-part series, which begins tonight on consecutive Mondays on most PBS stations, diagnoses the thirst for oil as desperate and unquenchable, and given this dependence -- 77 million barrels are consumed daily worldwide -- a taste for other renewable energy sources seems far off or far-fetched. So ''Extreme Oil'' wonders where new underground reservoirs might be tapped, and describes how each site then becomes an ecological or geopolitical danger zone. 
 Oil lurking under rocks is like money growing on trees for the companies that know best how to retrieve it. This series first travels the 1,100-mile route of the half-completed Caspian-to-Mediterranean pipeline. Then the program revisits sins of extraction in Angola and Ecuador. 
 Finally, the northern coastal plains of Alaska are surveyed with a discussion of the environmental harm expected with proposed drilling.
 In its Canadian debut this summer, ''Extreme Oil'' was more heatedly titled ''Oil: The World Over a Barrel.'' Nonetheless, the documentary tries to hear out oil industry leaders and government insiders, whom more strident filmmakers might renounce or even goad. That is all for the good, not just for balance and not just because oil companies have helped PBS through the years, but also because these business and government types do know a few things worth knowing.
 For instance, the United States ambassador to Georgia, Richard Miles, explains the presence of American military trainers in that country: ''The primary purpose is to modernize the Georgian Army, and it does have a backup role, I would say, with regard to pipeline security.'' Or, he says, it's in the American strategic interest not to rely merely on Middle Eastern or, if it came to that, Russian oil and gas, ''so this is another source and therefore it's valuable.'' (One soldier on site had just explained that he was told to say they were somehow aiding the war on terror.)
 Panakh Guseinov, the former prime minister of Azerbaijan, goes on camera to recall how, after the Soviet Union splintered, the Caspian's underground assets were then considered freedom's prize. ''We saw the signing of the oil contracts as a guarantee of our independence,'' says Mr. Guseinov, who has been replaced by a head of state whose administration the narrator calls ''comically corrupt.'' But even in the heady days, there were special favors: priority was given to the British Petroleum Company, Mr. Guseinov said. 
 Something does transpire between companies and politicians that seems at times criminal, at least in Angola, where oil multinationals have spent more than $4 billion that now cannot be tracked, the series reports. Faced with an impoverished populace, the Angolan minister of finance offers this explanation for the losses: ''Our capacity to administer is still very weak. There is no missing money whatsoever. This is accounting problems.''
 The series resorts to some visuals that seek to simplify the complicated disputes, but they veer toward the simplistic. In Ecuador a bat struggles to free its wings from iridescent sludge and looks a lot like 1991's CNN-hyped cormorants in the burning Kuwaiti oil fields. In Alaska a newborn caribou struggles to its hoofs and nuzzles its mother, which feels like a further Bambi-fication of wildlife debates. But these conflicts, especially the Alaskan fight to open a vast refuge, are essentially symbolic: oil companies want to drill in ecosystems preserved by law, and environmentalists do not want land protections undone.
 ''The Amazing Race 5'' has engrossed its summer reality-TV devotees with American can-do contestants who will burn rubber toward any contrived tourist trap. This PBS all-terrain expedition has a similar drive (and soundtrack), but a larger, more edifying purpose.
 In places where oil springs from the ground, there really are noble indigenous tribes who get sick when their streams turn black, in this case the Huaoranis of Ecuador. There really are bands of bandits who occupy a Georgian no man's land and seem beyond the laws of any government. And the painful facts of a faulty, crucial resource are hard to refute when seen up close.

HEADLINE: Suozzi Says Nassau's Fiscal Crisis Is Over

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The fiscal crisis that erupted in the late 1990's and threatened to bankrupt Nassau County -- one of the country's wealthiest suburbs -- is now over, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi said on Sunday.
 ''The phony budgets and one-shot revenues -- that crisis is behind us,'' Mr. Suozzi said as he previewed his budget proposal for 2005, which is to be released Monday. ''We've accomplished the transition from the worst-run county in the country to having the most bond upgrades.'' 
 As evidence of the turnaround, Mr. Suozzi's $2.4 million budget for 2005 would freeze the county property tax for the second year in a row. Having shrunk the county's workforce by one-tenth to its lowest total in three decades, Mr. Suozzi is now calling for limited hiring, mostly of police and correction officers.
 In contrast to last year, when Mr. Suozzi threatened to cut social service programs if unions did not grant givebacks, his latest budget would increase aid to the ailing Nassau Health Care Corporation and the Long Island Bus authority. 
 The county still has problems, especially the steeply rising mandated costs for pensions, health insurance and Medicaid, ''but we're managing them,'' Mr. Suozzi said. ''That's a problem that counties face all across New York State.''
 He also said the county needed to reduce the cost of property tax refunds for erroneous assessments by correcting the mistakes before the amount of retroactive refunds climbs. Mr. Suozzi said he would announce new solutions this week. 
 After the budget got out of control under County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, in 2000, the State Legislature set up a fiscal oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, and granted more than $100 million to bail out the county. Critics ridiculed the notion of helping Nassau, which has 1.3 million residents and a high average household income, especially in an economic boom.
 Promising to fix the problem, Mr. Suozzi was elected in 2001, as the first Democratic county executive in traditionally Republican Nassau in 30 years. In his first budget, he raised the county property tax 19 percent, but he promised no more increases in the remaining three years of his term. 
 ''We've made a remarkable transformation,'' Mr. Suozzi said. Instead of incurring big deficits, the county's budget now yields surpluses, including $80 million last year. To pare costs, the county's staff was reduced to 8,512 from 9,453. Capital borrowing has been cut to $70 million a year, from $160 million. Bond rating agencies responded by upgrading Nassau's credit.
 Mr. Suozzi said the outlook would be even better if it were not for Medicaid costs, which have grown to a projected $296 million next year from $206 million in 2001, the year before he took office. And Nassau's pension bill is increasing to an estimated $144 million next year from $44 million in 2001. Health insurance is rising 12 percent a year, he said.
 The number of police officers, originally budgeted at 2,444 this year, has already grown to 2,590 and would rise to 2,650 under his plan, he said. Police unions have complained of understaffing, but Mr. Suozzi said that the crime rate was at a 30-year low and was still dropping. The additional officers will reduce overtime costs, he said.
 The budget must be approved by the state's oversight board and the County Legislature, which has a Democratic majority. The Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, said that while she has not seen the budget details, ''I'm optimistic that this is a good budget.'' But concerns about budget projections for future years, which have not been released, make it too soon ''to do a victory dance,'' Ms. Jacobs said.
 Edward Ward, a spokesman for the Republican legislators, criticized Mr. Suozzi, saying he is spending more and raising park fees and fines for parking tickets. The Republicans also urged the county to hire even more police officers to further reduce overtime costs. ''The fiscal crisis is not nearly as over as he would like,'' Mr. Ward said.
 Legislators are also debating whether to raise their salaries to $75,000 from $39,500, starting in 2006. It would be the first increase since 1988. Although Ms. Jacobs and the Republican minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt, had agreed to the raise, some legislators said it was excessive.
 Legislators will meet Monday to discuss the proposed raise. ''Obviously I'm not ramming it down anyone's throat,'' Ms. Jacobs said.

HEADLINE: OPEC Finds Few Options To Put a Lid On Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is preparing to meet in Vienna on Wednesday in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable mood: helplessness.
 As recently as last summer, the cartel seemed to have the world oil market well in hand. It deftly responded to a series of supply shocks -- a strike in Venezuela, ethnic clashes in Nigeria, attacks on foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, a war in Iraq -- by meeting regularly and adjusting production frequently, keeping prices fairly stable. 
 Now, the picture is very different. Runaway demand in Asia, sustained violence in Iraq and speculative tumult in the oil markets have combined to push prices far above OPEC's preferred range, and the cartel has been able to do little about it. 
 With crude oil setting a price record almost daily in August, the cartel tried to persuade the markets that it was working overtime to step up supply. But with most of its 11 members already pumping at full capacity, the promise had a hollow ring; traders shrugged, and crude prices climbed to within pennies of $50 a barrel in New York before slipping back into the mid-$40's. 
 Crude oil fell on Friday to $42.81 a barrel in New York, its lowest level since August. 
 Though it has a third of the world's oil production, half of oil exports and three-quarters of known reserves, OPEC is finding that its ability to influence prices has largely been exhausted, at least when it comes to holding them down.
 ''Prices are moving independently from whatever OPEC decides,'' said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a former Algerian oil minister and OPEC president. ''OPEC can't do anything more today.''
 The cartel's members are producing 30 million barrels a day, well beyond its formal ceiling of 26 million barrels and its highest total in 25 years. But it has not been enough to keep its benchmark price within its target range of $22 to $28 a barrel. (The group's benchmark is an average of seven grades of oil that typically runs a few dollars below the most widely followed market price for light sweet crude.) 
 With most members producing all the oil they can, the oil ministers have few options to consider when they meet in Vienna.
 ''If you're looking for actions to bring new oil on the market, it's not going to be there,'' said Robert Ebel, head of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The markets are going to watch the meeting, yawn, and turn back to their computers.'' 
 One proposal is to increase the target price range by $5, to an average of $30 a barrel. According to a Reuters report, Iran and Indonesia support the idea. But oil analysts say that it would send the wrong signal at a time when OPEC is committed to reducing prices and that there is no consensus about its advisability.
 As OPEC's largest producer and the only one with significant flexibility to pump more oil, Saudi Arabia has often acted as a pressure valve for global markets, shutting some wells when prices are low and increasing output when prices are high. 
 In recent months it has cranked up daily production by more than 2 million barrels a day, to 9.3 million barrels a day, the most since 1981, and the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, has said that the country had another 1.3 million barrels a day of spare capacity it can open up if needed.
 The Saudis' actions helped pull prices in the futures markets down from the record high of $49.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during trading on Aug. 20. Even so, prices are up significantly for the year. 
 The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations that ordinarily is critical of OPEC's oil supply management policies, offered an upbeat assessment in its monthly report on Thursday. The agency wrote that because of OPEC's production increases, ''today's market is well supplied with crude.'' 
 Most OPEC countries will reap record revenue this year because of the high prices. But the cartel does not want oil to cost too much, because of the concern that ''prices that are too high could kill the golden goose,'' said Brad Bourland, chief economist at Samba Financial Group in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Sustained high oil prices could prod consumers to conserve more and to step up use of substitutes like natural gas, coal or nuclear power, and they might damp economic growth, economists say. 
 There is another drawback, said Thierry Desmarest, the chief executive of Total, the French oil company. ''Today's price level means there's no feeling of urgency within OPEC countries to invite foreign investors and add new production capacity,'' Mr. Desmarest said in a news conference in Paris on Wednesday. ''But producing countries are worried about high prices. They remember that when it goes up too much, there's usually a drop that's not pleasant to live through.'' 
 The question of new capacity is becoming an issue for oil planners. The energy agency has cited lack of investment by both the OPEC countries and the major oil companies as a factor in the current high prices. 
 Seven OPEC countries -- Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- are producing flat out or close to it. Without large investments in new fields, they will not be able to substantially increase output.
 But surging demand has made one constraint on the countries largely irrelevant: OPEC's system of production quotas. Algeria is courting foreign investors to the Sahara; Nigeria's offshore fields are among the most promising prospects in Western Africa; and with economic sanctions lifted, Libya is eager to open fields for exploration.
 Three more OPEC countries are unable to contribute more oil to world markets for different reasons. Indonesia now consumes more oil than it produces and is a net importer. Venezuela is still trying to recover from a crippling strike last year. Iraq has not been able to sustain its prewar production of about two million barrels a day because of the continuing insurgency. 
 That leaves Saudi Arabia, whose attitude toward foreign investment in its energy sector remains cool. While the kingdom has gradually allowed limited exploration for natural gas by foreign companies, the issue of reopening its oil sector to outsiders has been off the agenda since Aramco was nationalized in 1980.
 Mr. Ait-Laoussine, who now runs a consulting firm in Geneva, said that the present situation offers OPEC a good opportunity to address some longstanding issues, including the cartel's quota system, which produces friction between members; its target price band, which appears obsolete; and the quantity and quality of the statistics OPEC publishes about its production and reserves.
 ''OPEC is benefiting from a period where quotas won't be cut and everyone can produce as much as they can,'' Mr. Ait-Laoussine said. ''This is a comfortable position to be in.''
 It may also be time to consider the longer horizon. Oil prices averaged about $20 a barrel in the 1990's, but many analysts now suggest that the world should plan on $30 oil for the next decade.
 ''Have we moved into a new era, which no one saw coming six months ago, of powerful demand growth that will sustain the need for higher oil-production capacity?'' said Mr. Bourland of Samba, formerly known as Saudi American Bank ''That's the fundamental question for everyone in the oil industry.''
 Most analysts say the record high prices of August were not caused by a physical shortage of oil on the market. As the International Energy Agency noted in its report, ''supply is running ahead of demand and stocks are building.''
 Rather, the rise was driven by traders' fears that the world does not have enough spare capacity to cope with the unexpected, like Russia's largest oil producer, Yukos, facing potentially crippling tax claims from the government. The volatility caused by the fears attracts hedge funds and other investors to speculate heavily. 
 ''OPEC's spare capacity has melted, and that justifies the market's current risk premium,'' said Frederic Lasserre, the head of commodities research at Societe Generale in Paris.
 Still, Mr. Ebel of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, ''If I had a magic wand that could make all the problems in Venezuela, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria disappear, we'd still find oil priced in the low $30's.''
 What no one disputes is the surprising strength of demand, exceeding most forecasts. At the beginning of 2004 , the energy agency predicted average demand for the year at 79.6 million barrels a day; now it expects 82.2 million barrels a day.
 Much of the increase came from China, which for the last four years has accounted for 40 percent of the growth in world oil demand. Last year, China surpassed Japan as the second-largest consumer of oil after the United States, and by 2025, its consumption is expected to double to 12.8 million barrels a day, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.
 Even with such strong demand, though, OPEC worries about high prices, because oil ministers know from bitter experience that sooner or later they will slow world growth and lead to a sudden price collapse.
 In 1979, OPEC countries produced 31 million barrels a day, with Saudi Arabia pumping close to 10 million. By 1985, OPEC's production was down to 15 million barrels a day, and Saudi Arabia 3 million, because of a worldwide recession caused in part by high oil prices. In the late 1990's, financial crises in Asia sharply cut demand for oil and sent prices to around $10 a barrel.
 ''OPEC has accepted the fact that there will be continued disruptions coming from major suppliers, and that its members will have to produce at their full capacity,'' said Valerie Marcel, an energy researcher at London's Chatham House. ''Even if many OPEC members fear an oil-price collapse, many believe that prices will stay high.''

HEADLINE: The Customer Relationship Expert Takes a Dose of Its Own Medicine

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN MATEO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Inside the new Siebel Systems, the chief executive no longer blames the world when his company discloses bad news to Wall Street. 
 And in August, the new chief executive, J. Michael Lawrie, ordered 50 of his top executives to Cambridge, Mass., for three days of self-reflection, if not self-criticism. 
 That event represented a radical departure for Siebel, which was renowned in Silicon Valley for its hard-boiled culture. But, Mr. Lawrie said, he needed to find a way to ''get the employees back intellectually and emotionally.'' 
 Siebel Systems has been a company in transition since May, when the board chose Mr. Lawrie to succeed the founder, Thomas M. Siebel, as chief executive. But it is also a company still in trouble. 
 Since 1993, when Mr. Siebel founded the company, Siebel has dominated the market for customer service software, which helps companies manage their electronic relations with customers while at the same time helping them better understand consumer buying habits. A long list of brand-name companies, including General Motors, Sprint and Procter & Gamble, bought Siebel's product, demonstrating that customer relations software is a multibillion-dollar business.
 But the company has stumbled in recent years. Its stock is down 93 percent from its peak in September 2000, and its revenue is barely half what it was in 2001. For a time Siebel may have rationally blamed the economic slowdown that hurt most every software maker. But where other companies have enjoyed a modest recovery, Siebel still struggles -- in large part because it finds itself on the wrong side of several trends sweeping the technology industry. 
 Increasingly large corporations are seeking to consolidate the number of software vendors with which they do business, and now a trio of larger software makers -- SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle -- offer customer relations software as part of their product suites. 
 The second trend is borne of simplicity and cost-cutting. A new breed of software makers allows businesses to lease software that they then use online, saving them the expense and hassle of installing complex packages like Siebel's that invariably require teams of consultants to make work.
 A third trend possibly working against Siebel came into sharper focus last Thursday when a federal judge in San Francisco gave Oracle the green light to pursue its hostile takeover of PeopleSoft. During the trial, Oracle acknowledged that it was thinking of acquiring Siebel, a ripe target given its depressed stock price.
 Mr. Lawrie said that he was convinced that businesses would continue to choose Siebel -- as long as the company continued to innovate in ways that would keep it a step or two ahead of its rivals. None of that will happen, though, without fundamental changes in a culture that people both inside and outside the company describe as resistant to change. 
 Mr. Lawrie, who worked at I.B.M. for 26 years, acknowledged that his company faced several challenges, from failed forays into the market for small and medium-size businesses to Siebel's miserable relations with many customers. 
 He was one of those customers. Mr. Lawrie was the executive vice president in charge of worldwide sales at I.B.M., where he oversaw the largest customer relationship management deployment in Siebel history -- a decidedly mixed experience, as he described it. 
 ''There's no question in my mind that this company can grow, but first you have to be honest with yourself,'' Mr. Lawrie said in a recent 90-minute interview, his first since taking over as chief executive. ''You have to be honest about where you are. Where we are is not where we want to be.''
 When a recruiter first approached him about taking the Siebel job 18 months ago, Mr. Lawrie confessed to harboring mixed feelings. On the one hand, he said he felt that, while the marketplace was changing dramatically, ''Siebel wasn't adjusting to those changes.'' On the other, the company has more than $2 billion cash in the bank, a product that most technology analysts describe as the best of its breed and a far deeper understanding of customer relationship management than the competition, given its years of experience.
 ''I said, 'Gee, that's not a bad hand. I've been dealt many worse hands in my life,''' Mr. Lawrie said.
 Siebel was able to dominate what he dubbed Chapter 1 of customer relationship management software, or C.R.M., the industry initialism for the type of software Siebel sells. Now it must prove it can dominate Chapter 2. 
 Mr. Lawrie has already won some important converts, including Paul Greenberg, author of ''C.R.M. at the Speed of Light,'' now in its third edition. 
 ''The fundamental issue for Siebel has always been the culture more than its products,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''There was this shark sales culture where you were encouraged to do anything to get the deal and in a sense the hell with the customer. But all my sources inside Siebel tell me that nothing is sacred these days.'' 
 But Mr. Greenberg, the president of the 56 Group, a consulting firm based in Virginia, who describes himself as ''someone who had been a Siebel hater for a long, long time,'' says that ''with Mike Lawrie at the helm, I'm starting to become a believer in Siebel again.''
 The question persists whether new leadership and a cultural change will prove to be enough. SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle, each of which sells a suite of back-office programs that help companies manage their finances, inventory, procurement and the like, have aggressively pursued the C.R.M. market. 
 The main selling point is a persuasive one: while they sell for roughly the same price, customer relation software packages are far more valuable if they seamlessly connect to other software applications. Only then can a phone clerk taking an order let a customer know if an item is in stock; only then can a manufacturer selling customized products automatically request the necessary parts as soon as an agent has taken an order.
 At the same time, smaller, scrappier foes like Salesforce.com and RightNow Technologies, and also Microsoft, are offering cheaper, simpler solutions that appeal to small and medium-size businesses -- and even the occasional large corporation -- in an era of cost cutting. 
 ''Siebel is really feeling the pressure on both ends,'' said Laura Preslan, research director for customer relationship management for AMR Research, a technology consulting firm. 
 According to Mr. Lawrie, the two most formidable foes standing in the way of its goals are SAP and Salesforce.com.
 SAP entered the customer relations field in 1999, but even Darc Dencker-Rasmussen, the vice president overseeing SAP's efforts in the area, described that as a ''very humble beginning.''
 Now, though, he says he is convinced that SAP has the superior product if for no other reason than its integration with the suite of applications his company sells to some of the world's largest corporations.
 ''Our customers had experienced the frustrations of siloed applications, of a fruit salad of applications that really didn't connect with each other,'' Mr. Dencker-Rasmussen said. ''We've never viewed C.R.M. as a separate entity.'' 
 PeopleSoft and Oracle have also broadened their offerings to include customer relations capabilities. PeopleSoft released its first C.R.M. product in 2001, and Oracle is about to reintroduce its offering this fall ''after a major fundamental upgrade,'' said Charles E. Phillips Jr., Oracle's president . 
 J. Bruce Daley, a longtime industry executive who edits three newsletters -- The Siebel Observer, The PeopleSoft Observer and The SAP Observer -- agreed that the better the integration between customer relations software and other applications, the more valuable it is. But at this point, he said, the products that SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle sell are ''far behind'' Siebel's core product.
 Kim Albert, an executive at Exxon Mobil, recently chose Siebel over SAP when selecting a customer relations package for a $10 billion division inside her company. Exxon Mobil is an SAP shop, but after months of investigating, she concluded that SAP's customer software was still too young. 
 ''I think they'll get there,'' Ms. Albert said of SAP, ''but I thought they were a year or two away.'' 
 Given her organization's lack of experience deploying customer relations software, she said, ''we decided to go with the company with the deeper C.R.M. expertise.'' 
 But any shortcomings in the offerings sold by Siebel rivals may be balanced by the advantages offered by companies like Salesforce.com that lease, rather than sell, an online customer relations product. The software leasing model falls under any of several rubrics, including ''software as a service'' and ''on demand computing.''
 Leasing software is the far less expensive option. The on-demand model saves customers the expense of the pricey hardware, consultants and full-time computer experts invariably required when installing an expensive software package like Siebel sells. ''There's a sea change in how corporations consume software, and that's the on-demand phenomenon,'' said Greg R. Gianforte, chief executive of RightNow Technologies. 
 After two false starts, Siebel released its own on-demand product late last year. Despite its late entry, at least a few analysts and observers have concluded that it is already as simple to use as Salesforce.com's offering, the most popular of the on-demand C.R.M. products. 
 ''What you'll see us releasing in the coming months is the kind of functionality that will allow people to do more complex, multidimensional analysis,'' said Keith Raffel, a Siebel vice president in the company's on-demand unit. ''Remember, we're standing on the shoulders of 10 years selling Siebel to the globe's largest corporations.''
 At the same time, Mr. Lawrie has his eye on the 80 percent of the corporate market that he estimates relies on custom-built customer relations products. Over the next 12 to 18 months, said Edward Y. Abbo, Siebel chief technology officer, the company plans on spinning out discrete pieces of its core product that they hope to sell to those who ''roll their own,'' as Mr. Lawrie describes them. 
 ''By aggressively going after this market we see a real opportunity to grow revenues,'' Mr. Abbo said.
 The company is also spending heavily on analytics, a software add-on that lets Siebel users better understand the habits of their customers and evaluate possible marketing campaigns and the like. 
 Ultimately, Siebel's future depends less on new product offerings and more on intangibles, such as its reputation among customers and the mindset of its sales force. 
 ''We need to stop overpromising customers,'' said one longtime midlevel manager who would speak only on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. ''We need to stop spending more time hyping our product than actually building things. 
 ''I see Mike as a positive thing,'' this manager said, ''but I also think he has a Herculean task in front of him.''

HEADLINE: Study Finds U.S. Companies Shifting Profits Overseas

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
From 1999 to 2002, American multinational corporations increased profits taken in countries with no taxes or low rates by 68 percent, while sharply reducing profits taken in countries where they engage in substantial business activity, a study to be published today in the journal Tax Notes shows.
 In 2002, American companies took $149 billion of profits in 18 tax-haven countries, up 68 percent from $88 billion in 1999, according to Tax Notes, which analyzed the most recently available Commerce Department data. This compares with a 23 percent increase in total offshore profits earned by American multinationals during the same period.
 According to Commerce Department data not cited in the study, American companies took 17 cents of each dollar of worldwide profits in tax havens in 2002, up from 10 cents in 1999. 
 Analysis of the data in Tax Notes shows that for each dollar of profit taken in Luxembourg in 1999, American corporations took $4.56 of profit in 2002. The figure for Bermuda was $2.96; for Ireland $2.01; and for Singapore $1.72. These countries are considered tax havens or partial tax havens. For Britain, each dollar of profit taken in 1999 was equal to 67 cents in 2002; for Germany, it was 46 cents.
 The study was conducted by Martin A. Sullivan, who as a Treasury Department economist specialized in international taxation. Tax Notes is a nonprofit journal that reports on tax systems worldwide. 
 Mr. Sullivan wrote in his Tax Notes report that the sharp rise in profits taken in tax havens like Bermuda had no relationship to economic activity there. American companies took $25.2 billion in profits in Bermuda in 2002, yet total revenues there were only $34.3 billion, according to Commerce Department data. Many companies try to lower their taxes by setting up foreign subsidiaries and using internal lending so profits are taken primarily in tax havens and costs are incurred in high-tax countries. 
 Fifty-eight percent of offshore profits are now taken in tax havens, and that is ''a seismic shift in international taxation,'' Mr. Sullivan said, because ''subsidiaries of U.S. corporations now generate profits mainly in tax havens rather than in locations in which they conduct most of their business.''
 Mr. Sullivan noted in an interview that in 1991, when he first seriously examined the issue, only a small part of profit was taken from tax havens. While he has written previously that concern about job creation shifting outside the United States was overblown, he said that the torrent of profits now taken in tax havens may indicate that future job growth by American firms will shift offshore.
 ''There is no question but that the use of tax havens to lower tax rates makes investing offshore more lucrative'' than investing in the United States, he said.
 The figures also show how Congress, by eroding the capacity of the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax laws and through laws and treaties that favor the use of tax havens, is shifting the burden of taxes from multinational companies to individuals and purely domestic companies.
 Some members of Congress, Mr. Sullivan said, will take comfort in his findings because ''they believe in tax sabotage, the idea that we don't care if the I.R.S. can't enforce the laws because it means less taxes.''
 Bruce R. Bartlett, a Republican critic of the tax system whose writings are closely followed in Washington, said the data raise questions about fairness in the treatment of domestic and multinational companies. ''It's an obvious violation of the principle of horizontal equity for two businesses or individuals with similar economic circumstances to pay significantly different tax rates,'' he said.
 However, he said, while techniques that shift profits to tax havens ''involve pushing the law to its limit,'' they are currently legal, and corporate officials are obligated to minimize taxes. 
 Taking profits in tax havens ''is a consequence of the increasing mobility of capital and the existence of sovereign nations with different tax systems,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''There isn't much of anything that can be done about this,'' he said, adding that the country should debate scrapping the corporate income tax and adopting a European-style value-added tax, a kind of sales tax.
 Mr. Sullivan calls Bermuda ''a pure tax haven,'' because it has no income tax and little business activity occurs there. As a result of transactions with units in taxable countries, companies based in Bermuda actually paid taxes of 2 percent on their profits in 2002. 
 He describes Ireland and Singapore as partial tax havens because real business activity takes place there. He said changes in the laws to lure foreign investment were creating ''partial tax havens,'' notably Sweden, Denmark and China.
 While corporations often complain that they are doubly taxed on foreign profits, the law actually permits corporations to earn untaxed profits.
 Congress gives companies a dollar-for-dollar credit on taxes paid in foreign countries, which in practice is a subsidy for offshore investment. 
 Congress also permits perpetual deferral of taxes on profits earned offshore -- but only if they are not returned to the United States, a practice that critics say encourages job creation overseas to the detriment of American workers.

HEADLINE: Let a Thousand Ideas Flower: China Is a New Hotbed of Research

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Harry Shum's office may be one of the best places to witness the next stage of China's rise as an economic powerhouse.
 Set in the heart of the Haidian District in Beijing, with its canyons of universities, labs and high-tech ventures, his office occupies a corner of Microsoft Research Asia, the software giant's ambitious effort to tap scientific brainpower in China. 
 Dr. Shum oversees 170 scientists who huddle around computers in gray cubicles to brainstorm and tinker with ideas that may one day drive Microsoft's technological empire to even greater heights.
 ''Microsoft began to realize we can't find all the talented people in the U.S.,'' he said. Pointing outside, he added: ''Nowhere in this universe has a higher concentration of I.Q. power.'' 
 Microsoft is not the only multinational company to use China as a base for research and development. In recent years hundreds of them have set up laboratories here, and Chinese officials claim the number is growing by 200 a year.
 The labs vary in size and ambition, but as they multiply and expand they may help China grow from mostly a user and copier of advanced technologies developed elsewhere into a powerful incubator of its own, industry executives and experts say. And the shift may eventually reshape applied research, jobs and policies in the United States and other developed countries.
 ''The Chinese are going to become sources of innovation,'' said Denis Fred Simon, a specialist in Chinese science and technology who is provost of the new graduate-level Levin Institute of the State University of New York. ''They will find themselves enmeshed in global R.&D. more and more.''
 But it is far from certain that China will reap the full rewards of this flowering. Planting and nurturing corporate labs is a delicate business, and in China they are buffeted by concerns about protecting patents, retaining and training researchers, and managing the distances -- physical and cultural -- between here and headquarters.
 When Microsoft opened its Beijing lab in late 1998, it was among the first multinationals to establish a large research center in China. It hoped investing in research here would help pry open the door to two dazzling prizes: China's large reservoir of skilled but inexpensive scientists, and its consumers, still relatively poor but growing richer and eager for new technology.
 After considering several sites in Asia, Microsoft settled on the Haidian District, home to some 40 universities, 138 scientific institutes and many of China's 810,000 research scientists and engineers.
 ''China was really the No.1 target from the beginning,'' Richard F. Rashid, the senior vice president of Microsoft Research, said in a telephone interview from corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash. ''We felt there was a tremendously deep pool of talent there.''
 Microsoft, like other companies setting up research facilities here, was able to lure scientists from government-run labs, which do not pay as well and often are not working on cutting-edge developments.
 ''There are a lot of really good scientists and engineers coming from Chinese universities,'' said Maximilian von Zedtwitz, who teaches management at Qinghua University here. ''Their first choice is to go abroad, but their second choice is to work in China for foreign companies.''
 When the Microsoft lab first announced openings for 50 positions, it was deluged with tens of thousands of applications, said Zhang Ya-Qin, the former managing director of the lab who is now a company vice president in charge of Microsoft's mobile technology.
 It is no surprise that Microsoft Research Asia has such popular appeal. It is one of the few labs here spared the pressure of developing products for direct application; its researchers, like those in Microsoft's labs in Redmond, San Francisco and Cambridge in Britain, are given leeway to explore ideas with no immediate commercial payoff.
 But Microsoft researchers here also said they were conscious of their untested ''outsider'' status, which makes them especially eager to find product applications for their theoretical findings. Among other things, researchers are working on computer graphics, speech recognition and text translation.
 ''We're a young lab and an experiment of having a lab in a developing country in Asia, so there was a need to prove ourselves,'' said Zhang Hongjiang, who runs a new division devoted to shepherding research findings into applications. He and many other researchers in the lab said it felt more like an adrenaline-fueled start-up than an academic institute.
 If Microsoft ever overtakes Google in online search, for example, some credit may belong to Ma Wei-Ying. His group, now up to 10 researchers, is working on new ways to drill deep into the Internet and select and organize the information found there.
 ''We've progressed fast because we have a lot of really smart people and we discuss and brainstorm a lot,'' Dr. Ma said. ''In the U.S., the research is much more individual and each researcher is more like a professor. Here it's more a team.''
 The expansion of foreign labs in China is bound to spark further debate, similar to the controversy over outsourcing of technology services, about the implications of the increasing globalization of corporate research. 
 Executives at Microsoft and other companies argue that their Chinese labs are not taking jobs away from the United States or elsewhere. ''There's an internationalization of research going on,'' Dr. Rashid said. ''That's a good thing. The more smart people, the more innovation, and the more benefits for companies like Microsoft.''
 The starting point for this research boom is China's growing importance and sophistication as a market for technology, especially telecommunications and the Internet, industry executives said.
 ''People realize that with the expansion of China's market they need to tailor products to the China market,'' said Martin Hirt, who works for McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, and has advised companies on technology development in China. ''A 50-year-old Finnish or American engineer is not going to understand the needs of an 18-year-old Chinese youth.''
 Recently, Oracle opened a lab in Beijing to tailor its Linux operating software to suit its Asian customers, and companies like Motorola, Siemens, I.B.M. and Intel are going even further, running full-scale labs that work on their companies' most advanced products.
 Last year, General Electric opened a large research center in Shanghai, where it plans to employ 1,200 researchers by next year. And Nokia, the Finnish mobile telephone maker, has moved its software code writing to China. Chinese officials in charge of the sector say no one knows exactly how many international companies have research labs in China, but an official from China's Ministry of Commerce recently stated publicly that the country had as many as 600 and was adding 200 a year.
 Dr. von Zedtwitz was more conservative, estimating that China had as many as 300 foreign research centers, most of them founded over the last three years. But he said that within five years China could overtake Britain, Germany and Japan as a base for corporate research, leaving it second only to the United States. 
 Although experts say that China's growth as an international research base will continue, many also said that growth could be slowed or ultimately endangered by the growing pains and legal uncertainties.
 The most immediate threat is China's laxity in safeguarding intellectual property rights, which makes it too easy for innovations and industrial secrets to leak out, only to reappear in a Chinese competitor's product catalogue. Multinationals' growing resentment of theft of patents and trade secrets is leading some to threaten to quit China for India, Dr. von Zedtwitz said.
 The other serious challenge is retaining and managing researchers who are young and relatively inexperienced, but also eager for rapid promotions and raises. ''You can get all the smart people you want,'' said Dr. Simon of SUNY, who has studied many labs run by multinationals in China, ''but they'll run around like a herd of cats without leadership.'' 
 The recent rise of China as a base for multinationals to conduct research has not yet seriously affected their advanced operations elsewhere. Indeed, it may be helping them. But Mr. Hirt, the McKinsey consultant, cited examples suggesting that at the lower end of applied research, some jobs were indeed shifting from the United States, Japan and other developed countries to China.
 Some Chinese officials have a converse worry -- that the foreign labs may become isolated enclaves, siphoning off China's best talent but creating few beneficial spillovers. But a growing number of Chinese officials and experts seem to believe that the main threat to China's future in innovation does not come from foreign aggression but from the inertia of Chinese industry.
 China has more than doubled what it spends on scientific research to 1.3 percent of national economic output, compared with 0.6 percent in 1992. But little of that money was invested by local businesses. 
 ''The development trend is good, but the problem is our businesses,'' said Zhou Jizhong, a specialist in applied research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ''They're the key, and they're quite weak.''

HEADLINE: A Stodgy Style, But BellSouth Starts to Loosen Its Top Button

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The executives at the BellSouth Corporation, the nation's third-largest regional phone company, are not ones for hyperbole. Blue suits and button-down shirts are de rigueur at the company's unassuming headquarters.
 While rivals often make grandiose claims about their expansion plans, BellSouth's brass likes phrases like ''three yards and a pile of dust,'' a reference to football teams that methodically plow their way down the field.
 That expression about sums up the BellSouth approach to business: stable, disciplined, anything but flashy. Though its decidedly stodgy style was ridiculed during the technology boom of the late 1990's, BellSouth managed to endure while messy mergers and spending sprees consumed competitors like AT&T and Qwest Communications. 
 But BellSouth's cozy, lucrative franchise in its nine-state region in the Southeast is slowly coming undone. It is in a battle with Comcast, Cox, Time Warner Cable and other cable providers that are offering competing phone and broadband Internet services along with their television programming -- all on BellSouth's turf.
 The chairman and chief executive, F. Duane Ackerman, says he knows that BellSouth's long-dominant role in the Southeast is fading, and that simply counting on traditional phone subscribers will not ensure the company's future.
 ''I don't take what's happening lightly,'' said Mr. Ackerman, who has spent his entire 40-year career at the company. ''We've been painted out of the picture many times before. But we understand where the challenges are.''
 With the phone business becoming more competitive and chaotic, BellSouth -- the only Baby Bell that has not acquired or been acquired by another Bell company since the breakup of AT&T in 1984 -- is slowly shedding its conservative approach.
 Mr. Ackerman has been able to keep BellSouth independent, industry analysts say, because the company could rely on the Southeast's strong economy to keep its business growing. That growth, though, has slowed, forcing it to look at buying one or more competitors in the contest against cable, analysts said.
 In February, Cingular, the cellphone company owned by BellSouth and SBC Communications, bought AT&T Wireless for $41 billion, to form the nation's largest cellphone company.
 BellSouth may also take another look at AT&T, which approached BellSouth last year in the hope of merging. Acquiring AT&T, the largest long-distance company, would give BellSouth a big presence in the corporate phone services market, and a national footprint it now lacks.
 Meanwhile, to compete with cable, BellSouth has already invested $40 billion over the last decade to upgrade its networks, allowing it to nearly double its broadband subscribers in the last two years and begin testing an Internet-based phone service. It leans heavily on Cingular to generate revenue growth and provide the wireless services that cable providers do not offer. And it has made a loose alliance with the satellite provider, DirecTV, to sell television programming.
 Despite the competitive and financial challenges -- the company's A+ credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade -- it is hard to dismiss BellSouth. Like its bigger brethren, Verizon Communications and SBC, BellSouth controls the copper wires that go into millions of homes, making it possible to sell local, long-distance, Internet along with wireless services in one package.
 BellSouth's conservative management has helped it generate the highest profit margins and revenue per fixed phone in the industry. While it continues to lose traditional phone subscribers, the rate of decline is slowing. BellSouth also earned a better-than-expected $996 million profit in the second quarter, a 4.7 percent increase from a year earlier, while sales rose 0.1 percent, to $5.08 billion.
 ''They are quiet and steady,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Precursor Group. ''That's not sexy, but they tend to deliver on what they promise.''
 Profit margins may improve next year, mostly because of a crucial regulatory victory: the reversal of government rules that forced the Bell companies to connect local calls for other phone carriers at subsidized rates. BellSouth is likely to raise the connection fees next year by about 15 percent, analysts said.
 The purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular, which will probably be approved by the Justice Department later this year, would increase Cingular's cellphone customers to 46 million, topping Verizon Wireless. The merger would also raise the share of BellSouth's total revenue coming from Cingular to 40 percent from 25 percent now, or by about an additional $6 billion.
 Cingular is increasingly crucial to BellSouth because growth in mobile phone subscribers is helping offset the steady decline its the local phone business. It is also the one major telecommunications product that the cable industry does not yet have in its arsenal.
 ''It's less important that BellSouth differentiate itself from SBC and Verizon,'' said Andrew Cole, a vice president in the Wireless Practice at A.T. Kearny, a consulting firm. ''The cable industry is what keeps these guys awake at night.''
 Cable companies, of course, can deliver television programming to living rooms, a huge franchise. And that remains the biggest challenge to BellSouth and other regional phone carriers. So far, BellSouth has had to settle for a marketing alliance with DirecTV, the country's largest satellite television provider. Ultimately, though, BellSouth and the other Bells want to deliver their own video product. To do this, Verizon, SBC and BellSouth are spending billions of dollars to lay fiber-optic cable to millions of homes. Characteristically, Verizon and SBC have made splashy announcements about their plans. BellSouth, by contrast, has been quiet about how much it plans to spend.
 Without fanfare, BellSouth has built a fiber network that passes 1.1 million homes, 800,000 of which now use the network. Verizon has started building a fiber network that will reach one million homes this year.
 BellSouth expects to expand its network to pass an additional 200,000 homes this year, focusing on new communities in the Southeast where construction costs are lower. And in Atlanta and Florida, 60,000 BellSouth's fiber network subscribers already receive television programming in addition to multiple phone lines and superfast Internet connections. The company plans to sell TV programming in other states as well.
 In older neighborhoods, BellSouth is looking at a cheaper solution: fortifying its copper networks so they can handle video transmission. By bonding two copper lines, it can more than double current connection speeds for as little as $9 a home, a fraction of the $1,000 or so it costs to install fiber lines to homes.
 ''It becomes an economics driven thing,'' said Bill Smith, BellSouth's chief technology officer, who said BellSouth is about 18 months away from selling television programming over those broadband lines. ''We're not going to do anything ridiculous,'' he said, a nod to the multibillion-dollar plans to build fiber networks announced by Verizon and SBC.
 This deliberate approach is a hallmark of Mr. Ackerman's six-year tenure as chief executive. A soft-spoken and unassuming career telephone man, Mr. Ackerman's first job at BellSouth was fielding complaints, and even now reads the loudest criticisms from customers aloud at internal meetings.
 ''He's not one of those imperial C.E.O.'s,'' said Benn Konsynski, a professor at the Goizueta Business Library at Emory University in Atlanta. ''It's never been about Duane.''
 Cingular's purchase of AT&T Wireless was a big step toward expanding BellSouth's reach. But Mr. Ackerman's caution was evident when he broke off talks with AT&T after realizing how fast AT&T's long-distance business was deteriorating.
 BellSouth has been rewarded for its patience; AT&T stock has declined 30 percent since talks ended last October. But that drop in share price, and AT&T's decision to stop marketing its traditional phone services to residential customers, has set off new speculation that BellSouth would consider another merger offer from AT&T.
 If BellSouth acquired AT&T and its client list, it would become the biggest player in the corporate market. BellSouth could also use AT&T's national data network to offer services, like Internet phones, to customers in regions outside the Southeast. 
 Despite the obvious benefits, Mr. Ackerman is likely to wait until AT&T's sagging business bottoms out. When it does, many industry analysts expect BellSouth to make a play for AT&T as part of its strategic battle against the cable industry.
 ''The changes so far have been dramatic, but the change over the next few years will be even faster,'' Mr. Ackerman said. ''The test before us is not just to try and predict the future, but to create it.''

HEADLINE: Testing Clout Of Giuliani In the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
OH, to be Rudy Giuliani. How many politically ambitious Republicans must be thinking that these days? At the party's convention, he showed the country that he can give a stemwinder of a speech. He can invoke Sept. 11 with near impunity, in ways even the president cannot. And as founder of his own consulting company, he, and it, can avoid intense media scrutiny but still get attention as he campaigns for Republican candidates. 
 But there are also reasons to be skeptical of Mr. Giuliani's presidential prospects for 2008. Because, while his positions on national security, the economy and foreign affairs are in line with the mainstream of the Republican Party, his support for abortion rights, gun control and gay rights are out of sync with its influential conservative wing. 
 ''I don't think it is a wing, I think it is the party,'' said Gary Bauer, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and founded the organization American Values. Mr. Bauer said Mr. Giuliani would have to change his stances on social issues. But that might damage his credibility. He could risk incurring the very charge he lobbed at John Kerry in his convention speech -- that he is a flip-flopper.
 Mr. Bauer is one of several conservative Republicans interviewed about Mr. Giuliani after the convention. They all admired his leadership after Sept. 11, and his convention speech (which was not quite vintage Giuliani, but a revelation to a national audience unfamiliar with his loose, aggressive style).
 Those interviewed were also dubious of Mr. Giuliani's presidential chances, because conservatives dominate the Republican primaries and caucuses despite the moderate image the party showed at this year's convention. That's been increasingly true since 1964, when Barry Goldwater was nominated and Nelson A. Rockefeller, New York's governor, was loudly booed at the party convention by the right wing.
 ''Giuliani revives the old fight between the Rockefeller branch and the grass-rooters,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist, emphasizing the Republican platform's opposition to legalized abortion. ''I don't think he could succeed. I don't see how he could modify his position enough.'' 
 The former mayor maintains that his party is changing. ''The party is much broader-based than it was 10 years ago,'' he said the day after he delivered his speech. ''Then there were very few Republican moderates.'' Today there are many more, he said, including Govs. George E. Pataki of New York, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, and Mr. Giuliani's successor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 ''Who knows where the party is going?'' Mr. Giuliani asked.
 Conservatives think they know where, and it is not where Republicans from New York, Massachusetts and California happen to be. ''Pataki isn't going to make it either,'' said Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative pundit. ''The conservative voter dominates.'' Mr. Giuliani would stand a chance of getting the nomination only if the conservative vote split among several candidates, Mr. Buchanan said. ''And then I think you would have a walkout by social conservatives.''
 RICHARD LAND, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, agreed. ''I would have no problem in his being secretary of defense or state, not attorney general or secretary of health and human services,'' Mr. Land said. ''If he succeeded in getting nominated, the nomination wouldn't be worth having. It would split the party apart.'' 
 William Kristol of The Weekly Standard said the former mayor might gain some ground with conservatives if he took an understanding tone, showing that he respected their views without agreeing with them. ''But these are real issues,'' Mr. Kristol said. ''You can't finesse them entirely. It would be a dicey thing for him to pull off.''
 Supporters of Mr. Giuliani point out that as a sought-after Republican fund-raiser, he has something of a platform even though he is not in office, and incurs useful political debts. That technique was perfected by Richard M. Nixon, who joined a law firm after he lost the California governor's race in 1962, and began traveling around the country and campaigning for Republicans. He won the presidency in 1968. 
 Of course, Mr. Nixon had been vice president. Mr. Giuliani is ''America's Mayor,'' a moderate from New York -- which is still New York. Can he make a convincing run for the White House with those credentials? It seems a good bet that America will find out.

HEADLINE: Looking for Energy in the Campaign

 BODY:
Presidential candidates have long dangled the promise of ''energy independence'' in front of the American voter. And all have known that it is an unattainable goal, largely because the United States, which uses one-quarter of the world's oil production, owns less than 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. What America can do, however, is reduce imports -- by producing cars that require less gasoline and by developing other fuels that cars can run on. Over time, such a strategy could enhance our energy security and give us more influence over prices. It would also make a big dent in America's emissions of global warming gases. 
 John Kerry has an opportunity here. Rising gasoline prices and instability in the Persian Gulf have made energy a livelier campaign issue than usual. And while Mr. Kerry has hardly been immune to rhetorical overreach, he offers an energy agenda more adventurous than anything proposed by the Bush administration. 
 Mr. Kerry's approach is expensive, however, and depends on his ability to persuade voters that the government can afford his proposals. He wants to create a $5 billion incentive program to help automakers retool their assembly lines to produce more efficient cars, and he would spend the same amount on consumer tax incentives to get people to buy them. In effect, Mr. Kerry would put a ton of money on the table to help Detroit move from the comfortably profitable world of S.U.V.'s to a riskier universe of gas-electric hybrid cars.
 He would also lavish billions on a large and aggressive ''biofuels'' program that would seek gasoline substitutes not only from corn -- the basis of today's narrowly based ethanol program -- but also from a whole range of agricultural products. Some experts believe that such cellulosic fuels could eventually replace one-quarter of the gasoline used today and could also provide an income stream for farmers when the cushy export subsidies that now distort world agricultural markets come to an end.
 Reducing oil dependency is one big part of the Kerry plan. Learning to live with coal is the other. For all the talk about alternatives fuels like wind and solar power, which both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush endorse, coal remains central to the American economy. It produces 56 percent of the nation's electricity, and its role is likely to grow as prospects for big new natural gas discoveries shrink. (Nuclear power has its enthusiasts, though judging by the few noncommittal paragraphs in his energy plan, Mr. Kerry is not among them). Yet coal is also a big contributor to smog, acid rain, mercury pollution and global warming. So Mr. Kerry would crank up the subsidy machine again to develop and deploy new technologies that strip the coal of pollutants before it is burned and, in the case of carbon dioxide, inject them into the ground. 
 President Bush can fairly claim to have endorsed most of these ideas. But Mr. Kerry is offering more muscular programs and, if words mean anything, a more robust commitment to seeing them through. Mr. Bush's tax incentives are too small to make much difference to the automakers or to consumers. His clean coal program has been slow off the mark. And while he has expanded research into hydrogen-powered cars -- a potentially useful technology that Mr. Kerry also endorses -- Mr. Bush has used hydrogen's long-term promise as an excuse to let Detroit off the hook now. 
 Even the president's more innovative ideas are secondary to his dominant strategy of ramping up production of oil and gas, the centerpiece of which is his proposal to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. This strategy of emphasizing energy production over energy efficiency had its roots in Vice President Dick Cheney's famously secret energy task force in 2001 and reached full flower in two dreadful energy bills. Mr. Kerry opposed the Senate version, and his campaign literature explicitly rejects drilling in environmentally sensitive areas. 
 On two counts, Mr. Kerry's program is irritatingly disingenuous. As a candidate for the nomination, he was openly proud of his Senate vote to require a 50 percent increase in fuel economy standards. As a presidential candidate, however, he has reduced this ambitious but achievable goal to a softer (and, to Michigan voters, much less threatening) pledge to ''update and strengthen'' fuel standards. 
 As a candidate for the nomination, Mr. Kerry also described climate change as the world's ''most serious environmental challenge.'' Global warming, he suggested, was at least as important a reason for reducing fossil fuel use as ending dependency and bringing down prices at the pump. But his recent literature mentions climate change only in passing, and fails to mention at all his vigorous support for legislation that would set strict caps on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas -- legislation that Mr. Bush opposes.
 One can understand Mr. Kerry's wish to avoid the subject of emissions caps in coal-producing states like West Virginia, where caps are controversial. But he knows that without regulatory limits on greenhouse gases, industry is less likely to develop and deploy the technologies that he hopes will lead us all to a leaner and cleaner energy future. The same can also be said of stricter fuel economy standards. History shows that progress on energy issues usually requires sticks as well as carrots, and to pretend otherwise rings false.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Faces His Payoff Year On School Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Not since his days at Medford High School in his Massachusetts hometown has a school year mattered so much for Michael R. Bloomberg.
 After winning control of New York City's public schools two years ago, Mayor Bloomberg introduced the most ambitious overhaul of the schools ever attempted, altering virtually everything, including the way reading and math are taught, the number of superintendents, even cafeteria menus. 
 Today, the city's 1.1 million public school children return to class for an academic year that will serve as a crucial barometer of the mayor's education efforts, which are almost certain to be a central issue in his 2005 re-election campaign. 
 ''It's time to see what happens.'' said Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University. ''This should be a year in which the structures are in place.'' 
 And even now, Mr. Bloomberg, who holds more concentrated power over the schools than any mayor since the 1870's, is pushing ahead with further changes. More than 90 new schools are opening, including 53 small secondary schools that are aimed at breaking a long legacy of failure in the city's largest high schools, and 9 charter schools, the first wave in the mayor's plan to open 50 of the privately run schools. 
 Officials will also soon unveil a sophisticated accountability system to gauge the effectiveness of principals and teachers by measuring individual student progress instead of comparing overall test results from one year to the next. 
 The city is spending $36 million on a new mentoring program for new teachers. And it is allocating $40 million to help children who are failing in early grades, following up on the mayor's third-grade promotion policy, which generated a public furor last year but ultimately did not result in a large increase in the number of children who were held back. 
 There are also direct changes to instruction: there is a new citywide arts curriculum for all grades; the standard math curriculum, which began on a limited basis last year, will be widely used; and the 49 lowest-performing elementary schools will change reading programs yet again to make use of $37 million in federal aid that the city would otherwise lose. 
 And on Thursday, the mayor confidently announced plans to expand his promotion rules to the fifth grade, setting up a potential roadblock to middle school for failing students and reminding voters of his controversial decision last March to fire two of his own appointees to the Panel for Educational Policy because they opposed his third-grade promotion policy and planned to vote against it.
 In a speech that day at Brooklyn Technical High School, Mr. Bloomberg reiterated his personal passion and commitment to fixing the schools. ''Our shared mission is to dramatically improve education in our city, to have a caring and compassionate school system -- with accountability,'' he said. ''I've often said that the dream of achieving educational excellence in our schools is why I sought this job of mayor.''
 By taking such a direct hand -- critics say a heavy hand -- in running the schools, Mr. Bloomberg has made good on his pledge that public education would be his top priority. And for that, he gets nearly universal credit. ''Every mayor should have done this,'' said Dr. Levine of Teachers College. ''This is the first person who has had the courage to embrace the schools and say, 'It's my responsibility.''' 
 The deep unease that clouded over the opening of school last year has dissipated. Instead, the focus has turned to the ways Mr. Bloomberg might be judged, given the dizzying scope of the system and his efforts. Test scores are an obvious yardstick, but also school safety, student attendance, teacher and principal retention, graduation rates and dropout numbers. 
 Then there are still more esoteric criteria that may be difficult to gauge: parent satisfaction, the level of community participation and discourse and, more important, regardless of test results, whether children are actually learning more. 
 Top school officials and some business leaders are convinced that the system is not only improving but on the brink of the major cultural shift that the mayor has sought. They point to a constellation of tangible improvements: a parent coordinator hired for every school; a new training academy for principals; standardized reading and math programs in a city with a constantly mobile student population; new corporate partnerships and tens of millions in private donations; a streamlined administrative structure cleansed of corruption and patronage; and, perhaps most of all, a sharp raising of standards and expectations.
 But among many teachers and principals, there is indignation. Both the teachers' and principals' unions are starting their second school year in a row without labor contracts. ''They have felt abashed and they felt demeaned and they have felt ridiculed,'' Randi Weingarten, the teachers' union president, said. 
 And many parents and community groups have expressed mounting frustration that Mr. Bloomberg has reduced their voice by turning city education policy into his own political monologue.
 From the outset, critics warned that Mr. Bloomberg was changing too much too quickly, and that his huge corporate-style turnaround campaign was ill suited to a hugely complex government social service agency. 
 There were many pitfalls last year, including a major breakdown in the school safety and discipline system and widespread disorganization in special education, both of which forced the administration to make major changes. 
 To avoid the overcrowding that plagued some schools last year, the city plans to limit the number of transfers that it grants to children who request to leave failing schools under the federal No Child Left Behind Act to perhaps 1,000 transfers from more than 7,000 last year. Over the summer, the city also opened 18 enrollment centers in hopes of easing the traditional first-day crush.
 But there are already signs that the administration may be overreaching in some of its major efforts for this year, including the campaign to open new small schools. 
 For example, in July officials were forced to scrap the opening of the Langston Hughes High School for Communication Arts, in Queens, because not enough students were interested in attending. 
 In addition, because there was little time last year to market the new schools to parents, more than 1,500 seats, about a third of the total, in the 53 new small high schools have been filled with students who did not necessarily want them, but were placed after not being admitted to other schools or because they did not submit any application. 
 Another example is the mentoring program for new teachers, which has been cheered by the administration and the teachers' union. Even strong supporters of the program concede that the ratio of 17 or more new teachers to one mentor is too big and will hamper the effort. 
 ''That's purely an economic thing; they can't afford to get the ratio below that,'' said Norm Fruchter, the director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University. ''Given incredibly limited resources and given really ambitious new programs, they are always making Hobbesian choices.'' 
 The administration is pushing forward with its new initiatives even though the city has yet to receive any substantial money as a result of a court order last year that mandated increased state aid for the city's schools. A $5.3 billion wish list that Mr. Bloomberg drew up in anticipation of the extra money has been postponed indefinitely.
 And while the administration is channeling more money to some schools, particularly at the elementary level, other schools have found their budgets heavily cut, largely as a result of complicated changes to the school budgeting process. 
 In addition to new policies, there have also been substantial adjustments to some of last year's changes and some outright backtracking as officials acknowledge that not everything went as planned.
 In particular, there has been some rebuilding of the administrative ranks because the restructuring of the bureaucracy cut back too far, leaving principals unable to reach the staff at new regional centers that handle back-office operations like purchasing and payroll. This year's budget, for example, includes about $6 million more for central administration and an increase of 167 full-time administrative positions. 
 There was also substantial turnover among administrators. Nearly a quarter -- 28 of 113 -- of the local instructional superintendents, a newly created position, did not return this year. About 240 principal vacancies had to be filled; 66 of them will be graduates of the new training academy. And each of the 10 instructional regions will be getting a new science specialist. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, in his speech on Thursday, addressed the difficulties head on. ''Will it be easy?'' he said. ''Not always. We know that. School reform is a high-stakes enterprise. There will always be criticism. There will always be missteps and things we would have done differently given a second chance. That can't shake our confidence or determination to do what we know is right.''
 For his part, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein urged a big-picture view in judging the reforms. 
 ''This is not about one year's worth of results,'' Mr. Klein said in a discussion with reporters about the coming year. ''My goal is to significantly increase the numbers of students who come out of our school system either prepared for college or, if they are not going to college, ready for the workplace.''
 ''Until you do that,'' he continued, ''then you have not materially changed the system.'' 
 He added: ''The question is: Can anyone really transform urban education in the United States and get the kind of results that we all would like to see for these kids? We are on that path and I think we are going to succeed at that. But I have been candid from the beginning: that is a two-term job.''
 But some experts fear that as the mayoral election nears, the school system will become a political Ping-Pong ball. 
 ''The constituency for this year may not be the parents,'' said Martine G. Guerrier, the Brooklyn representative on the Panel for Educational Policy, ''but the voters outside.''

HEADLINE: Through All Their Ordeals, Iraqis Bank on Free Food

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Iraq may be tormented by ethnic and religious divisions, but one thing still unites the entire populace, from holy warriors of the Sunni Triangle to middle-class supporters of the government to disaffected Shiites of the south. What nearly every Iraqi family gets, regardless of income and no matter whose guns rule the local streets, is the central government's monthly gift of free food. 
 Nearly 18 months after American forces demolished Saddam Hussein's government, pledging to create a prosperous, free-market democracy, Iraq remains in some ways the world's ultimate welfare state.
 Mr. Hussein's government started handing out survival rations through neighborhood shops in 1991, when the country faced international trade sanctions. The program continues unchanged, even in cities like Falluja, where Islamic militants are in control and all other government services have been cut off. Across the country, no one doubts that the families of insurgents survive partly on government rations, just like everyone else. 
 The monthly supply of flour, rice, beans and other goods is worth about $15 per person, but for the nation's poor majority, battered by years of sanctions, war and economic collapse, it is a safety net. Even among those who are well-off, food rations have come to be regarded as an entitlement and -- to the chagrin of senior economic officials and their American advisers -- people want the list of free items expanded. 
 ''We can't live without the ration,'' said Hassina Hasoon, a bent, 80-year-old woman, her face beatific in a swaddling of black and white cloths, as she picked up bags of wheat flour in the impoverished Washash neighborhood of central Baghdad. 
 In her three-generation household of eight, only one son can find occasional work, she said. ''We totally depend on the ration for our food. We want them to add meat and chicken to the list.''
 Maher Ali Oraibi, 45, who was visiting the same depot said: ''If they stop the food ration then food prices will go sky high and there will be war in the streets. Don't let them stop this program, for I assure you, people will die.''
 The rationing system has enormous costs, direct and indirect. Importing and distributing the goods eats up $3.8 billion, or close to one-fifth of the annual national budget. It has fostered bureaucratic corruption, created a culture of dependency and, by relying almost entirely on imported goods, suppressed domestic farming and industry. 
 In another example of costly subsidies, gasoline sells for less than 10 cents a gallon. Other fuels are similarly cheap. Altogether the cost to the government amounts to $5 billion in lost revenues, or about $200 per person. The low fuel prices also encourage smuggling and impede needed development of petrochemical industries. 
 Western advisers, the International Monetary Fund and Iraq's own top economists all agree that the nation's huge subsidies will cripple plans to diversify and free up the economy. But they also know the likely consequences in the streets if the subsidies are cut any time soon. For now, basic economic reforms are hostage to the Iraq's political fragility and its mass unemployment. 
 By United Nations estimates, 60 percent of Iraqis depend for an important part of their diets on their rations of flour, rice, beans, cooking oil, milk powder, sugar and tea. Most other families collect the rations, too, with many selling off undesired goods for cash. 
 ''The food distribution system is our most important social safety net,'' said Fakhri Aldin Rashan, a senior economist and under secretary of the Trade Ministry, which administers the rations. 
 Given the security crisis, he said in an interview, ''the more we discuss it, the more we feel we need to maintain the rations for now.'' 
 Fearful of any backlash in a country where large segments of the population are in open revolt, the government has pledged to leave the program in place at least through 2005. Slowly and carefully, Mr. Rashan said, the government hopes to start cutting back rations to the rich, eventually providing free food to perhaps the most vulnerable segment of the population as it fosters private commerce. 
 Western advisers have promoted switching to a cash payment, perhaps $15 to $20 a month per person, that would allow people to buy what they want, thus stimulating private farming, commerce and development. 
 But suspicion and fear run deep, and the government decided against that approach, Mr. Rashan said. 
 Jassim Salah, 74, distributes ration items at his food and cigarette shop in Khadra, a middle-class district in west Baghdad. He had heard discussion on television of the proposed switch to cash payments, he said. His response was typical: ''They are talking about giving us money instead of food. It's all lies. Don't believe them. They'll let us starve.''
 A more practical argument against switching to cash, Mr. Rashan said, is that the funds will tend to be collected by the males who head the households and who may spend the money on themselves or even take a second wife, leaving some women and children defenseless.
 But even as people cling to the security of free food, many complain about poor quality and erratic delivery. People say the flour provided is often half-spoiled and the cooking oil stinks, and corruption in the procurement process is legendary. 
 ''The officials who run this are thieves,'' said Mr. Salah, the shopkeeper. ''They import good quality food, sell it and then give bad quality food to the people.''
 He said his fee for distributing rations was so low it was hardly worth the trouble. But the rations do bring in neighbors who may buy soft drinks or cigarettes as they trade their coupons for ration items. 
 The cycle of dependency also includes many of the distributors, people like Maher Yusef. He bakes bread and distributes flour to 2,800 people in the poorer Washash neighborhood, where streets are strewn with litter and lined with stalls selling rusty used car parts. 
 Mr. Yusef, 45 and a father of four, said his fees as ration agent totaled about $19 a month. But he uses multiple strategies to earn an extra few dollars profit here or there. He is usually given 100 extra bags of flour, which he sells or uses to make bread for sale. He also buys back flour from recipients, to resell in markets. 
 His clients who are more well-to-do sell substandard flour to him so they can buy better flour, he said. His less fortunate clients sell him needed food to get a few dollars for a doctor or to buy clothing. 
 ''It's not enough to live on,'' he said of his own scrounged income. ''The government should put all the distributors on a salary.''

HEADLINE: Before Friendly Audiences on the Trail, a Looser, Livelier Bush Appears

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Bumiller

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
George W. Bush says he enjoys being president. But judging from his performance on the stump over the last few weeks, he enjoys campaigning for president even more.
 From rallies in Ohio to attacks on Senator John Kerry's economic record in Pennsylvania to ''Ask President Bush'' events with rapturous Republican crowds, the president has emerged as a kinetic stage performer with a personality that seems to fits the frantic quality of the campaign. 
 In Washington, Mr. Bush delivers serious speeches, tangles with the press and can appear stolid, defensive and halting. But on the campaign trail, where the invited crowds are kept friendly because opponents are sometimes arrested for wearing anti-Bush T-shirts or dragged from events by their hair, there is a different President Bush. He is looser and livelier, a former Andover cheerleader who has learned how to rouse the crowd in the argot of ordinary America. 
 ''So I'm here asking for the vote, see,'' Mr. Bush said at a recent invitation-only ''Ask President Bush'' event in Nashua, N.H., where he paced happily in his shirtsleeves, microphone in hand, in the middle of a packed high school gymnasium. ''That's what you've got to do. I think you've got to get out amongst the people and say, 'I want your vote.'''
 The line is Mr. Bush's standard opener, a kind of lead paragraph that instantly telegraphs his message, connects him to the crowd, then allows him to transition into a plea that gets applause: ''And I'm also here to ask for your help. See, I don't think you can win elections alone. I think it requires citizens who are willing to register people to vote, to put up the signs, to turn out the vote. And that's what I'm here to ask you to do. I'd like your help as we're coming down the stretch.''
 Of course, voters who dislike Mr. Bush hardly find his act compelling; to them it is just that, an act. 
 ''I wish he was half as good a president as he is a campaigner,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, a former top aide to President Bill Clinton.
 But there is no disputing the president's enthusiasm for this part of his job, particularly now that polls show him leading, and the way the invited crowds lap up his colloquialisms, malapropisms and Texas twang. (It intensifies west of the Mississippi.)
 There is also no disputing that Mr. Bush can falter in front of more skeptical audiences, as he did at a convention of minority journalists in Washington last month. 
 The president got so twisted up in response to a question about tribal sovereignty -- ''tribal sovereignty means that it's sovereign'' -- that the crowd started laughing at him.
 In short, Mr. Bush is at his best in front of the adoring crowds his campaign has arranged for him in the swing states.
 ''O.K., I'm going to appear to be sophisticated, but I'm a wreck,'' a woman said before she asked Mr. Bush a question at the event in New Hampshire. 
 Mr. Bush laughed appreciatively. ''That's what I try to do, too -- I try to be sophisticated,'' he said, to big guffaws from the crowd. ''I have trouble pulling if off, though, you know?''
 Encouraged, the woman plunged ahead. ''I do want to say it's an honor to be here today to meet you, Mr. President,'' she said. ''O.K., and New Hampshire chicks love you. I got to say that.''
 Mr. Bush laughed again. ''So far you haven't acted very sophisticated, I admit, you know?'' he teased. Then he gave the woman a big smile, she beamed back, and the crowd laughed again.
 Even some Democrats begrudgingly give Mr. Bush good marks for his style on the stump. 
 ''He doesn't have the stamina of a Clinton or the charisma of a Reagan, but when he's on his game, and he's not tired, he has a folksy, down-home approach that works for him,'' said Paul Begala, the CNN talk show host who worked in the White House for Bill Clinton and is now informally advising Mr. Kerry's campaign.
 When Mr. Bush is tired, strange things do come out of his mouth. 
 Last Monday at a rally in Poplar Bluff, Mo., the president was into his usual riff against malpractice lawsuits when he said, without missing a beat, that ''too many Ob-gyns aren't able to practice their love with women all across the country'' -- an apparent crossed wire with the president's stump speech to religious groups, in which he invariably says that government cannot put love in a person's heart.
 The day before, in Parkersburg, W.Va., Mr. Bush said that he asked Congress last September for $87 billion to help pay for ''armor and body parts'' in Afghanistan and Washington. 
 And two days before that, the president mangled a favorite line about Mr. Kerry and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Senator John Edwards, who were two of four senators to vote for the use of force in Iraq but against the $87 billion spending package.
 ''Two of those four,'' Mr. Bush cheerily concluded, ''are my running mate and his opponent.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The White House Letter column yesterday, about President Bush's comfortable manner at campaign events, misstated the intended use of the $87 billion he requested from Congress last year. It was for military and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq -- not Afghanistan and Washington.

HEADLINE: As Weather Shifts, Beaches May Pay a Heavy Price

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Coastal geologists, meteorologists and other experts have long warned Floridians not to rely on the relatively placid weather that prevailed in the last few decades, when their state grew explosively. Now the hurricane pattern is shifting, meteorologists say, and the shift has dangerous implications for the beaches -- and the coastal hotels, roads and condominiums -- on which Florida's tourism economy depends. 
 It has been decades since Florida suffered anything like the one-two punch of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, never mind Hurricane Ivan. But if repeated storms become regular events, as they were in the 1940's and 50's, the effects are likely to be devastating, these experts say.
 ''People who grew up around here talk about how when they were kids they were regularly sweeping sand out of people's homes,'' said Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, speaking of the era before the surge of development along Florida's Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Now the weather patterns of those years seem to be returning, Dr. Leatherman said. 
 More frequent hurricanes would be a problem not only for Florida, of course. But they would be particularly worrisome there. Coastal development is heavy and its coastal elevations are low: typically five feet or less, too little to offer much protection against a hurricane storm surge. 
 Also, many of Florida's coastal communities have relied for years on projects to pump sand onto beaches weakened by erosion, which afflicts most of the state's coast, a third of it critically, the state Department of Environmental Protection said. Erosion will accelerate as global warming causes sea levels to rise. More intense hurricane seasons will make beach replenishment, already a problem-filled and expensive proposition, even more difficult. 
 The state's renourished beaches survived the recent hurricanes relatively well, said Richard E. Bonner, deputy district engineer for project management for the Jacksonville District of the Army Corps of Engineers, which covers Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. ''There's erosion, but of course that's what we expect,'' Mr. Bonner said. He and other coastal engineers often describe renourished beaches as ''sacrificial'': designed to protect buildings behind them, even as they erode.
 But in places on Florida's east coast, Mr. Bonner said, Hurricane Frances has left beaches with what geologists call their winter profile, the shape they have after harsh winter weather has eroded them, and before gentle summer weather carries sand back on shore. As a result, these beaches will be more vulnerable to northeasters, winter storms that typically cause even more erosion than hurricanes. 
 Mr. Bonner and other experts said the effects on beaches from the recent storms were more widespread on the east coast of Florida than on the west. Hurricane Charley, which made landfall on the west coast on Aug. 13, was stronger -- a Category 4 hurricane on the 1-to-5 Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity -- but it was quite small and it moved fast. So its damage was concentrated, and much of it occurred on stretches of beach with relatively little development. Hurricane Frances, though only a Category 2 when it struck the east coast on Sept. 4, was a sprawling storm that, as Mr. Bonner put it, ''hung around for a couple of days and beat the heck out of us.'' 
 In places where beaches were already weakened by erosion, Mr. Bonner said, dunes were cut and sand washed over onto roads behind the beach. In places, it even washed onto the main road along the barrier islands that line Florida's east coast.
 Although Mr. Bonner said he was not yet convinced that weather patterns had changed, he said communities that did not replenish their beaches would lose them as rising seas moved in on shoreward structures like seawalls and revetments. 
 But beach renourishment projects can cost tens of millions of dollars and require constant maintenance. 
 ''It's a long-term commitment,'' said Dr. Abby Sallenger, an oceanographer at the United States Geological Survey in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Once you start it, if you get hit by a series of storms in rapid succession you may have to replenish sooner than you thought. It's very expensive.''
 Florida towns are already arguing over shoals and other offshore sand supplies and going as far afield as the Bahamas to obtain sand for beach building. Dr. Leatherman said the city of Hollywood was even considering adding smooth ground glass to replenishment sand. ''They are running out of good supplies of sand; that's no secret,'' he said. Mr. Bonner said the corps of engineers was considering using sand from inland sources to nourish beaches.
 Plenty of people say it would be better if Floridians had not built so many of their homes, hotels and businesses right on the beach. But no one thinks they will remove them any time soon, regardless of weather patterns. In fact, although data on reconstruction after disasters is relatively slim, research suggests that people not only replace buildings destroyed in natural disasters, but they also tend to rebuild them bigger and better, said Dennis S. Mileti, former director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado and author of the 1999 book ''Disasters by Design.'' 
 ''Unless there is total destruction, which there rarely is, buildings that are undamaged are an impetus to rebuild stuff that is already gone,'' Dr. Mileti said. ''One of the biggest constraints to relocation after disasters is that not everything is damaged.''
 There may be calls for stiffer construction standards and other efforts to mitigate future damage, but some experts say that this kind of effort, along with loans and other disaster relief programs, only encourages more building.
 One problem, Dr. Mileti said, is that people and political systems do not cope well with what he calls ''high consequence/low probability'' events. ''It's what has us walk across the street even though we know people get hit by cars,'' he said. ''The average person cannot take on worrying about or making very salient for themselves a high consequence/low probability event.''
 Also, he and other experts say, public attention turns to problems like coastal development just after disasters like hurricanes, but the focus is on individuals and their needs rather than policy changes like relocation incentives and setback requirements that would take people out of harm's way.
 In any event, many experts say, efforts to mitigate the effects of natural hazards can never make a place like the coast of Florida completely safe. ''Mitigation has limited applications,'' Dr. Mileti said, and may have the unintended consequence of making people feel safer than they really are.
 Max H. Bazerman, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, describes the situation in Florida as a ''predictable surprise'' -- a problem anyone can see develop but no one wants to confront. Dr. Bazerman and his co-author, Michael Watkins, discuss the phenomenon in their book ''Predictable Surprises,'' to be published this month. Dr. Bazerman said he doubted that people even considered hurricanes when they moved to the Florida coast. ''I think the more likely story,'' he said, ''is that people sort of want to build on the ocean and they don't even think about those risks. We have limited awareness of factors that we don't want to bring into consideration.''
 The weather in recent weeks ''doesn't mean we should abandon Florida,'' Dr. Mileti said. Instead, he and other experts say, Floridians should build -- or rebuild -- ''in ways that are consistent with the forces of nature,'' basically by keeping high-density development off the beach. But for that to happen, they say, it will be necessary to draw the public's attention to the issue, not when emotions are running high in the aftermath of a storm, but later, when local and state agencies consider development proposals and master plans.
 The problem, Dr. Leatherman said, is that with a few exceptions, like the theme parks around Orlando, the state's economic base is concentrated on the coast. ''The real value is packed along the shoreline, and the magnet is the beaches,'' he said. ''And this is hurricane alley.''

HEADLINE: Hawk vs. Hawk

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The debate on how to proceed in Iraq is not between the hawks and the doves: it's within the hawk community, and it's between the gradualists and the confrontationalists. 
 The gradualists argue that it would be crazy to rush into terrorist-controlled cities and try to clean them out with massive force because the initial attack would be so bloody there'd be a debilitating political backlash.
 The terrorists would fight as long as there were heart-wrenching scenes of dead children on satellite TV, then would melt away to fight another day. And if the U.S. did take control of, say, a newly destroyed Falluja, we would find that we didn't have enough troops to control the city and still hunt down terrorists elsewhere. We'd end up abandoning the city (as we have other places), and the terrorists would just take control again. We'd be back where we started. 
 There is a reason, the gradualists point out, that counterinsurgency wars have tended to take a decade or more. They can be won only with slow, steady pressure. The better course, they continue, is to allow some time to train and build up Iraq's own security forces, and allow some time for the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, to build up a base of anti-insurgent political support. The lesson of Vietnam is that you can't win these wars via military means. You have to build a political structure that organizes public support and mix it with military might.
 The gradualists point to what just happened in Najaf as their model for how the Iraq war should proceed. First, Allawi laid down tough conditions: that Moktada al-Sadr's militia had to go. Then he convinced many of the locals that their lives would be better without lawless thugs in their midst. Then the U.S. attacked and weakened the terrorists. Then Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani brokered an agreement that led to the re-establishment of government control. Now development aid can flow to Najaf again. Aid projects worth roughly $6 million are resuming, and $37 million more is on the way.
 Najaf, the gradualists argue, showed it's possible to marginalize the extremists and rally the decent majority. Now the task is to build on that success in other towns, and slowly rob the terrorists of sanctuaries.
 The confrontationalists can't believe the Bush folks, of all people, are waging a sensitive war on terror. By moving so slowly, the U.S. is allowing terror armies to thrive and grow. With U.S. acquiescence, fascists are allowed to preen, terrorize and entrench themselves.
 Moreover, they continue, there's no reason to think the Najaf model will work in Sunni cities, where we don't understand and can't exploit the local rifts, where there is no Sistani figure to come in at crucial moments. 
 In Sunni cities, the so-called moderates may make deals with Allawi, but they break them just as quickly -- or else are beheaded by the terrorists. Members of the Falluja Brigade, who were supposed to take the city from the terrorists, switched over and joined the other side.
 The gradualist approach, the confrontationalists conclude, has allowed terror to thrive. Now there are about 100 attacks a day. U.S. troops find themselves engaged in a modulated half-war in which they engage the enemy enough to suffer casualties, but not enough to win. The Iraqis are demoralized because it doesn't look as if the country will be pacified in time for full national elections, and because without security there can be no economic development -- only more misery and more terror. U.S. troops are demoralized because if they are going to hit the enemy, they want to hit the enemy hard. 
 The gradualists clearly have the upper hand within the Bush administration. When administration officials talk about Iraq, they emphasize that this is a deliberate process, leading to elections in January but continuing long after. But when pressed, they tend to search for some compromise approach, emphasizing political solutions in places like Sadr City and the military approach in Falluja. 
 It's depressing to realize how strong the case against each option is. But the weight of the argument is on the gradualist side. That's mostly because people like Ayad Allawi deserve a chance to succeed. These people in the interim government are scorned as stooges and U.S. puppets, but they're risking and sometimes giving their lives for their country. Let's take the time to give them a shot.

HEADLINE: A Doctor Puts the Drug Industry Under a Microscope

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In many ways, Dr. Marcia Angell is an unlikely muckraker. A pathologist by training, she is the former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine. She is also a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School.
 But just days short of her 65th birthday and her first Social Security check, Dr. Angell is taking on the American pharmaceutical industry with a new book, ''The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It'' (Random House).''I don't worry about labels,'' Dr. Angell said in an interview at the Hotel Monaco, where she stopped during a book tour.
 In a 1996 book, she noted, she argued ''that there wasn't a shred of evidence that the breast implants were causing all the disease they were said to.'' 
 ''I was said to be a tool of the pharmaceutical and device companies,'' Dr. Angell recalled. ''I call them as I see them.'' 

Q. Why produce an investigative book on the pharmaceutical industry?

A. Because everyone knows that prescription drug prices are sky-high. Americans pay far more for our drugs than people in other countries. The drug companies say, ''We need high prices to cover our staggering research and development costs, and if you do anything to squeeze our prices, it will stifle innovation.'' The book was written to examine that argument.

Q. The pharmaceutical companies say their prices are steep because they spend somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars per drug bringing them to market. Did your research support this assertion?

A. A group of economists -- mainly funded by the drug companies -- came up with the widely quoted figure on this. They said that it cost $802 million to bring a drug out. They, however, were looking at the most expensive drugs to develop: new chemical compounds developed entirely in house. Most new drugs aren't that at all. Most are what people call ''me too'' drugs, which are slight variations of older drugs already being sold.
 According to these economists, the real cost of bringing out those rare original drugs is actually around $403 million. But they doubled it by factoring in how much money the companies might have earned if they'd invested that $403 million. Moreover, the economists did not figure into their total the many generous tax breaks these companies receive for doing research and development. This is a highly inflated figure. 
 The fact is that for the last two decades the drug companies have been hugely profitable. Last year there was a little wiggle downward, but in 2002, the 10 biggest American drug companies had a median profit of 17 percent of sales compared to a median of 3 percent for the other Fortune 500 companies. In the 1990's, profits ran between 19 and 25 percent. Prices are high to keep profits high.

Q. Exactly what are these ''me too'' drugs you argue against?

A. They are minor variations of old drugs already on the market. Sometimes a company creates a ''me too'' drug as a way of extending a patent on an older one. For example, AstraZeneca created Nexium to replace the virtually identical Prilosec when its patent was about to expire. By putting out these me-too's, the companies can get new exclusive marketing rights on what are essentially the same old drugs.
 Other companies come in with their own me-too's because markets are expandable. It's been shown that when you advertise one me-too drug, you increase the sales of all of them. 

Q. Why do you have a problem with this?

A. The prevalence of the me-too's really says an awful lot about the lack of innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. If you look at the new drugs marketed over the last six years, 78 percent weren't even new chemical compounds. They were just new combinations or different formulations of old drugs. And 68 percent were classified by the F.D.A. as unlikely to be improvements over drugs already on pharmacy shelves.
 At the same time, there are shortages of some important drugs that the pharmaceutical companies aren't much interested in making because they are not as profitable as the me-too's. But the companies don't have to turn out needed drugs, if they are not lucrative. And they don't. 

Q. How much of the high cost of drugs is the result of marketing and sales expenditures?

A. The companies spend over 30 percent of their revenues on marketing and administration. Their marketing budgets are so enormous because they have to persuade doctors and patients to prescribe one me-too drug over another. If you had a truly innovative drug -- a cure for cancer, for instance -- you wouldn't have to market it much. The world would beat a path to your door.

Q. Was there anything in your life that pushed you to write this book?

A. As a journal editor, I witnessed a disturbing trend in pharmaceutical research. Twenty years ago, most drug trials were conducted at academic medical centers and the pharmaceutical companies tended to stand back during the testing period. However, in recent years, the companies have succeeded in attaching strings to research contracts, often designing the studies themselves, keeping the data in-house and deciding whether or not to publish the results. They also began to contract with private research companies for testing. Moreover, the medical schools and even individual researchers began to enter into entrepreneurial arrangements with the drug companies.
 While all this was occurring, I began to see bias creep into medical research. And I saw a lot of it. The most obvious example were studies comparing a new drug to a placebo. That may be enough to get a drug F.D.A. approval, but it should not be enough for The New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors don't want to know whether a drug is better than nothing. They want to know if it's better than what they are already using. 

Q. You've written that ''because most medical journals are dependent on drug ads for their survival, it probably also influences what they publish.'' Were you speaking of The New England Journal of Medicine there?

A. No. That's because the Journal was virtually unique. We had a real wall between the advertising people and the editorial offices. But many other medical journals -- and there are thousands of them -- are little more than vehicles for advertisements. Still others, while they are not quite that, will put out occasional sponsored supplements, which I wouldn't have any confidence in whatsoever.

Q. You left the editor's chair at The New England Journal of Medicine in 2000. Have there been any big changes there since your departure?

A. There's only one I know of -- we had a policy that review articles and editorials could not be written by anyone with any financial connection to a company whose product was featured in that article. We said that disclosing the connection was not enough.
 When we printed papers on original research and there were often conflicts of interests, we published those articles with disclosures. It's my understanding that the policy on reviews and editorials is no longer in place. I'm sorry they made that change. But they say it's too hard to find a prominent author who doesn't have a conflict of interest.

Q. The first phase -- the discount card phase -- of the new Medicare drug benefit is about to go into effect. Do you, as a newly minted senior, believe it will make prescription drugs more affordable?

A. It's not going to have a major effect. These discounts are very small, maybe 10 to 15 percent. At the rate of inflation of drug prices, they'll be overtaken in a very short time.
 Now, the main Medicare drug benefit that goes into effect in 2006 is designed to funnel billions of dollars to the pharmaceutical industry. It's an absolute bonanza for it. The pharmaceutical industry's lobbyists made certain that the legislation contained a provision barring Medicare from negotiating drug prices. 
 Interestingly, the federal government negotiates drug prices for the Veterans Affairs system and gets very low prices because it is a bulk purchaser. And Medicare would have been the biggest bulk purchaser of all -- so it could have negotiated very low prices. That provision allows the drug companies to continue raising their prices faster than the inflation rate, and the drug benefit will soon become unaffordable.

HEADLINE: In a Fight Over King Crab, Russians Show Their Claws

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia 

 BODY:
Kamchatka, the rugged, remote peninsula of volcanoes and ice, is famous for its crab, none more than the red king crab that has long been this poor place's hard currency. The problem here today is trying to find one to eat.
 A waitress at Korea House, one of the fancier restaurants in this city, Kamchatka's capital, just shrugged when asked for some. Two other restaurants also had none, underscoring the depths of a gastronomic crisis that has effects in export markets as far away as Japan and the United States. 
 ''Every year we had crab,'' said Yelena Y. Astakhova, a fishmonger in a kiosk at the central market belonging to one of Kamchatka's biggest fishing fleets, Akros. ''This summer, nothing.''
 The reasons are as complicated as any involving Russia's natural resources, including this country's convoluted government bureaucracy, the vagaries of its feral form of capitalism and, not least, its corruption. Ms. Astakhova, though, summarized this summer's plight simply.
 ''No quota, no crab,'' she said.
 When the federal government in faraway Moscow allotted this year's quotas for catching king crab in coastal waters -- rather than auctioning the quotas off as they had in the recent past -- Kamchatka's biggest fishery companies received none. For reasons that are anything but clear, the quotas went instead to companies based around Vladivostok and even some in Moscow, including two that were newly formed.
 The decision, made in consultation with Kamchatka's governor, Mikhail B. Mashkovtsev, produced a storm of protest here as strong as the cyclones that regularly batter the peninsula. The local companies appealed to Moscow, which then suspended the decision, leaving the quotas -- and the season's catch -- in limbo.
 ''There is not a person equal to Christ who can divide 5 fish among 5,000,'' Mr. Mashkovtsev, one of Russia's few Communist governors, said in an interview in his office overlooking the central square.
 ''Practically everyone is unhappy,'' he added. ''The person who got nothing says it is unfair. Those who got large quotas say they did not get enough.''
 The annual fight over quotas has been intensified by the fact they are becoming so small. In 2001, Kamchatka's fishing fleet hauled in 60,000 tons of king crab. But with scientists warning that the population was on the brink of extinction, this year's regional quota was for only 900 tons of crabs within 12 miles of shore and 1,100 tons beyond that, and none of that went to Kamchatka's biggest companies.
 While the Sea of Okhotsk to the west and the Berent Sea to the east are teeming with salmon, halibut, cod and other fish, the king crab is the most lucrative sea creature here, selling for almost $5 a pound on average in the hungry markets of Japan, China and the United States.
 For the local companies, the loss of this year's quotas was the latest jolt in a region that has struggled economically, largely because of the woes of its fishing industry. A recent survey found that Kamchatka was the only one of 79 regions studied that had not experienced economic growth since Russia's financial crisis in 1998.
 The governor acknowledged the plight of Kamchatka's fleet, which operates at only a third of its capacity because of stricter quotas on all types of fish and shellfish. Mr. Mashkovtsev himself faces a criminal investigation for unilaterally lifting quotas on salmon in 2002, though he insisted he did it to protect, not endanger, that year's salmon run from the risk of overpopulation. But when asked why he signed off on crab quotas that shut out the local companies, he declined to comment. ''In any family there are arguments between members of the family,'' he said, ''but in good families they do not discuss it outside their homes.''
 Viktor P. Potapenko, the president of Kamchatrybprom, the company formed from the remnants of the Soviet fishing collective that once operated Kamchatka's fishing industry, said the government's decision mystified him. ''We old fishermen do not understand,'' he said.
 Others see more sinister motives. Across the Far East, fishing quotas have become mired in corruption and criminality. After the governor of Magadan, across the Sea of Okhotsk, was assassinated in Moscow last year, investigators charged his deputy with manipulating crab quotas, which may or may not have been related to his death.
 Yevgeny A. Sivayev, editor of the newspaper Kamchatskoye Vremya, said he believed that the authorities in Moscow put pressure on the governor to select politically favored companies. The quotas, he said, were little more than a lucrative license to steal.
 Since most of the crabs caught at sea are sold directly to wholesalers abroad -- another reason for the dearth locally -- it is impossible to monitor the true size of the catch, he said. ''Peter the Great -- in 1707, if I am not mistaken -- said the fishing business is in principle theft,'' he said. '''The fisherman should not be paid, and one should be hanged annually.'''
 The government, he added, would do more to protect the king crab -- and the local economy -- by cracking down on poaching.
 Poaching, though, is the only way anyone here can find a crab.
 Not far from Ms. Astakhova's licensed shop in the central market, the search for king crab led through a tattered, potholed warren of kiosks and open-air stands. Inside an aluminum-sided building with row upon row of stalls selling salmon and other fresh fish, some vendors openly sold it -- boiled, cracked and absolutely illicit.
 ''We buy it,'' said one woman, who insisted that her name not appear in print, when asked about its provenance, ''but I will never tell you where.''
 At another stall, another fishmonger shrugged off the dispute over quotas. In the market, king crab costs about $15 a pound, which in Kamchatka's economy is all that matters. ''You come here any day,'' she assured a visitor, tearing off a piece for sampling, ''and you will have crab.''

HEADLINE: Preserving an Old-Forest Wilderness at the Ends of the Earth

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LAGO ESCONDIDO, Chile 

 BODY:
Tierra del Fuego is a harsh, desolate and unyielding place, hostile to most human endeavors. But from the ruins of a failed logging venture here at ''the uttermost part of the earth,'' an innovative effort to manage and preserve the world's southernmost old-forest wilderness is about to begin.
 The origins of the project, announced officially in the southern city of Punta Arenas on Sept. 10, mark a departure from the way conservation is usually practiced here. Instead of the usual sponsorship by a government or university, the initiative is the result of a partnership between two American institutions, the New York investment banking and management firm Goldman Sachs and the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo.
 After Goldman Sachs acquired the logging operation in 2003, executives there wondered whether they ''should seek to maximize its economic value, which is what we would have done if this were a shopping mall or an apartment building,'' or do something else, explained Larry Linden, an advisory director who supervised the project. In the end, he continued, ''we decided to do what we thought was the right thing'' and donate the land so as to allow it to return to a more natural state. 
 Successful economic logging would be damaging since trees grow slowly in the harsh environment. The tallest of the beech and evergreen trees that dominate local forests are little more than 60 feet high, which represents about 200 years of growth.
 The reserve, which at more than 1,000 square miles is about the size of Rhode Island, occupies most of the central section of Chile's portion of Tierra del Fuego. Immediately to the east is the Argentine part of the island, while to the south, on the other side of the sound called Seno Almirantazgo but still in Chilean territory, is the spectacular Darwin Range of snow-capped mountains, which includes the imposing Marinelli glacier.
 As is always the case in Patagonia, the project must take into account potential political pitfalls. In both Chile and Argentina, foreign-led efforts to preserve natural habitats are often viewed with suspicion, with some local people even convinced that such programs mean to wrest Patagonia from their control in order to establish an independent state.
 The most controversial figure in that regard is the American multimillionaire Douglas Tompkins, who has bought hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land in southern Chile to set aside as a reserve called Parque Pumalin. A result has been conflicts not only with local elected officials and business groups that want to develop those areas, but also unflattering coverage in the Chilean press and attacks in the Chilean Congress.
 To avoid such problems, the Wildlife Conservation Society, which has been involved in other projects in Patagonia since the 1960's, plans to administer the reserve here, as yet unnamed, in conjunction with an advisory council. Steven E. Sanderson, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said that while the exact composition of that group had not yet been determined, the majority of its members would be Chilean.
 As an island at the southern tip of the world, cut off from the South American mainland by the chilly, churning waters of the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego has long fascinated naturalists. ''A single glance at the landscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything I had ever beheld,'' Charles Darwin wrote when he sailed through here in 1834 in his famous voyage aboard the Beagle.
 Dr. Sanderson said, ''If you look at the structure and evolution of land masses around the world, this is really a unique area with a lot of ecological possibilities.'' He said, ''You have high-latitude forest, peat bogs, rivers and grasslands, as well as a number of animal species and a critical part of the sub-Antarctic Ocean.''
 The new reserve promises, among other things, to be a haven for the guanaco, a New World relative of the camel that indigenous peoples valued for its fur and meat. A herbivore that keeps enemies at bay by spitting at them, the guanaco grows to 300 pounds and typically lives in groups of 8 to 10, with one dominant male accompanied by various females and juveniles, all of them roaming the steppe together in search of food.
 At the time the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the west coast of South America 500 years ago, the continent's guanaco population may have been as much as 30 million, scientists estimate. But as a result of systematic hunting, especially after the arrival of Europeans in Patagonia a century ago, the number has fallen drastically, to less than half a million today.
 Thanks to conservation efforts, the guanaco population, estimated at 40,000 here on the Chilean side, is now growing at 10 to 12 percent a year. But sheep farmers and cattle ranchers on the island continue to view the animal as a pest, competing with their flocks for scarce and valuable grazing land.
 Relatively few other species of mammals are native to Tierra del Fuego. But over the last century, settlers have repeatedly introduced animals from Europe and North America in connection with schemes to stimulate economic growth and attract new settlers, often with disastrous consequences.
 ''The whole idea of introducing species needs to be reconsidered,'' said Guillermo Harris, an Argentine naturalist who is the Southern Cone coordinator for the Wildlife Conservation Society. ''We would like to keep the integrity of this forest as it is, as much as possible.''
 Beavers, for instance, were first brought here nearly a century ago, with the hope of encouraging development of a pelt trade. But an initial population of some 30 pairs has now grown to an estimated 200,000, resulting in extensive damage to forests and the proliferation of dammed streams that interfere with natural water flow patterns.
 Sheep have become both the backbone of the local economy and a source of disease transmitted to guanacos. Rabbits have created similar problems. More recently, deer and even mink have been introduced as part of economic development schemes.
 ''Mink have become a problem in the last 10 years or so, ever since a group escaped from a farm in Ushuaia,'' on the Argentine side of the border, Dr. Harris said. ''They are effective and vicious hunters who are particularly hard on ground-nesting birds such as geese and the flightless ducks.''
 Two species of fish introduced from outside, trout and salmon, are looked upon more favorably because they have attracted fishermen from all over the world and are expected to be the foundation of ecotourism efforts on the reserve, along with the guanaco. But the issue of what to do about other mammals that have become pests has not been resolved yet.
 ''Everyone recognizes that invasive species are one of the main sources of biodiversity loss, so we have got to address this question,'' Dr. Sanderson acknowledged. Part of the solution, he suggested, is to focus on ''harvestable species, with an eye to getting some economic gain.'' 
 What Tierra del Fuego may lack in the way of mammals and reptiles, it more than makes up for in bird and plant life. Most of the 250 species of flowering plants and 400 species of moss known to exist on the 18,000- square-mile island are thought to be present within the boundaries of the reserve. The bird population includes the condor, albatross and Magellanic woodpecker.
 Also common in the forested areas of Tierra del Fuego, though rarely seen elsewhere in the Americas, is a phenomenon known as ''blowdown.'' Because the topsoil here is quite shallow, only a few inches deep in many areas, the root systems of trees are highly competitive and tend to grow horizontally rather than vertically.
 In a region in which gale force winds of 60 miles an hour are common throughout the year, generated by cold temperatures at the peaks of mountains, that means that entire stands of trees are vulnerable to wind gusts and are regularly knocked down. The reserve has many such zones scattered across its length, the largest of which covers about three square miles.
 The reserve's administrators plan to make public the results of environmental and scientific studies conducted when the area was being developed for commercial logging during the 1990's. All told, an estimated 300,000 pages of research were accumulated during that time, some of which could serve as the baseline for future wildlife studies.
 ''The property is not just the land itself, but also all of the scientific information that has been gathered about it,'' said Jesus Maza, a forestry engineer who has worked on the project here since 1999 and supervised part of the research. ''We want to be able to take that information out of cardboard boxes and say to the new owners 'you have acquired this too.'''
 But the new reserve's greatest value, suggest those who will be helping to administer it, may simply be that it exists. Though this may be a remote place studded with romantic associations, it faces many of the same threats that are bearing down on rare or unusual natural habitats all over the world.
 ''Tierra del Fuego has a mystique that has to do with history and all of the names we know so well, from Magellan and Drake to Darwin, with the lure of open spaces and the relative rarity of temperate forests, especially here in the Southern Hemisphere,'' Dr. Harris said. ''It's important to make sure we don't lose that, and there is a real risk that we might if we're not careful.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Tougher Tone in Resolution on Iran's Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
The United States lobbied Monday to toughen an International Atomic Energy Agency draft resolution on Iran's nuclear program, hoping to include a clear ''trigger'' that would send Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions if the country fails to comply with I.A.E.A. demands by November.
 The proposed resolution, prepared by Britain, France and Germany, gives Iran a November deadline to clarify inconsistencies in its nuclear energy program, suspected of masking efforts to build a bomb. But it falls short of setting specific requirements or explicitly threatening to send the case to the Security Council.
 Nonetheless, the draft resolution is the toughest yet in a yearlong effort to persuade Iran to cooperate more fully with the United Nations nuclear agency and shows a shift in Europe's attitude toward Iran. The three European countries have in the past resisted American pressure to deliver a harsher rebuke to Iran. 
 ''The Europeans are taking a very hard line now,'' said a European diplomat involved in the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Iran warned Monday that it might resume efforts to produce highly enriched uranium that could be used to build a nuclear bomb if the United Nations continues pressuring it over its nuclear program. In March, Iran voluntarily agreed to suspend them. 
 ''We can't imagine that the suspension will last very long,'' Hossein Mousavian, head of the Iranian delegation, told reporters at the I.A.E.A. headquarters here. He reiterated Iran's stance that under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty it has the right to produce fuel for nuclear reactors.
 The United States and other countries, however, have long pointed to inconsistencies in Iran's program.
 Despite the suspension Iran promised in March, it has never halted the manufacture of centrifuge parts by private workshops. This month, Iran said it planned to convert about 40 tons of ''yellow cake'' uranium into uranium hexafluoride gas, the raw material for centrifuge enrichment. Nuclear experts warned that the quantity involved was sufficient to produce fuel for several bombs.
 The draft resolution circulated by the three European countries calls on the I.A.E.A. chief, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, to produce a full report on Iran's nuclear activities before the next meeting of the agency's board of governors. It states that on the basis of that report, the board will make ''a definitive determination on whether or not further steps are required.''
 Everyone involved understands that those ''further steps'' include referral to the Security Council, which could lead to sanctions against Iran. The United States, which has lobbied for tougher action against Iran since details of its clandestine nuclear program were disclosed last year, is working to harden the resolution's language further and to include a clear trigger for action in November by giving Iran a list of requirements, like a comprehensive suspension of enrichment activity, that it must fulfill before then.
 In Washington, a senior Bush administration official said the United States would still like the I.A.E.A. to refer the issue to the Security Council this month, rather than wait until November. But European diplomats say that the United States has little choice, because there are not the votes on agency's board of governors for a quicker referral. 
 Once the United States and the three European countries have agreed on the draft, the resolution will be submitted to the board for approval this week. The board can call for a vote, but resolutions are usually approved by consensus to avoid politicizing the agency's decisions.
 Iran, which is not on the 35-member board, is negotiating with Britain, France and Germany to soften the resolution in return for renewed commitments on suspending some of its activities.
 Iran continues to insist that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. But the discovery two years ago that its program was much broader than it had disclosed to the United Nations agency and contained inadequately explained irregularities have convinced the United States that the oil-rich country's goal is not to produce cheap energy but to manufacture nuclear weapons.
 Some Iranian equipment, for example, was found to be contaminated with weapons-grade uranium, and Iran had worked on producing polonium 210, a radioactive isotope that can help set off a nuclear explosion.
 ''There's a whole host of activities that in our opinion don't have anything to do with putting electricity into a light bulb,'' one Western official said.
 Meanwhile, Dr. ElBaradei gave the board additional information on South Korea's secret nuclear experiments, disclosed this month, calling them ''a matter of serious concern.''
 He said that South Korea had produced about 330 pounds of ''natural uranium metal'' at three secret facilities in the 1980's and that some of the metal was used in laser-based enrichment experiments in 2000 to produce a small amount of enriched uranium. 
 The disclosure suggests that South Korea's nuclear experiments had a longer history than previously thought, though South Korea contends that rogue scientists were responsible. Dr. ElBaradei said he would deliver a fuller report on South Korea in November.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 14 about United States efforts to toughen United Nations pressure on Iran over its nuclear program misidentified the radioactive element cited in that country's warning against pressure. Hossein Mousavian, head of the Iranian delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned that his country might resume suspended efforts to produce enriched uranium, the form that can power nuclear reactors. He did not refer to highly enriched uranium, which is used in nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Passengers Are Cleared to Network About the Cabin

BYLINE: By SHARON McDONNELL

 BODY:
On a flight to speak to the New York Power Authority in upstate New York, Gilda Carle was writing an article about how to progress in networking from ''eye-olog'' -- a word she coined to denote eye contact -- to dialogue, then monologue.
 ''The man sitting next to me said, 'What's eye-olog?''' recalled Ms. Carle, a communications consultant in Yonkers and a television therapist known as Dr. Gilda. ''I thought, 'How dare he look over my shoulder like that?' But we started chatting.''
 The man, the president of a diaper manufacturer in Montreal, gave her his business card. One week later, she sent an article about the diaper business to him with a note. She also added his name to her newsletter, and they kept in sporadic touch. 
 Five years later, Ms. Carle received a call from the executive's sales manager, inviting her to be the keynote speaker at the company's international sales conference at a handsome fee.
 As the tray tables go up, and everyday responsibilities recede as far as the cities thousands of feet below, the guard often goes down. Many business travelers report that they have landed clients and forged partnerships thanks to chance encounters on airplanes and in airports, sometimes with serendipitously better results than the meetings or shows they were to attend. 
 Consider Andrew Zolli, the founder of Z+ Partners, a forecasting firm in New York, who met Dr. Sally K. Stansfield, an associate director of global-health strategies for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in the first-class lounge of Swissair last year. Mr. Zolli was checking his e-mail in a cubicle when he began chatting with Dr. Stansfield. He immediately invited her to be a speaker at Pop! Tech, an annual conference on the social impact of technology that he produces in Camden, Me. She spoke last fall.
 Why the sudden decision? ''At work you're bombarded, and I'm constantly approached by people who want to speak,'' he said. ''When traveling, the things that make up your identity disappear and you have these chance interactions with people without your barriers up.''
 While business travelers are more likely to bump into decision makers in the first-class cabin, they can also find opportunity in coach class. Sixteen years ago, Winthrop D. Chamberlin, a founder of Trufresh, a seafood sales and processing firm, was on a flight to Boston to market a fast-fish-freezing patent to seafood suppliers. Squeezed into the last row in coach of a shuttle from New York, he discovered that his seatmate was an investment banker who bought and sold food companies.
 She gave him her card, they later met in New York and she referred him and his partner in Trufresh, Barnet Liberman, to a board member of the R.J. Peacock Canning Company, which runs a salmon farm and a processing company. The partners -- who also own a real estate management firm and invest in restaurants -- then flew to Maine and signed a contract with Peacock, a company that they continue to use.
 ''You talk more to people in first-class, but you're surprised more in coach,'' said Judith King, an owner of Andy Morris Company, a public relations agency in New York. ''People are less jaded.''
 Her own reward came after she was bumped from first class on a flight from San Francisco two years ago and ended up sitting next to Melissa Wagoner, a sales manager for a necktie company and the wife of a chief executive of Ellula Inc., a maker of inflatable speakers for laptop computers and portable digital-music players. Ms. Wagoner, who had also been bumped, soon was deep in conversation with Ms. King. ''We literally talked for five-and-a-half hours,'' Ms. King said. She followed up and arranged a meeting with her new friend's husband, Bill Wagoner. She soon had Ellula as a new client.
 Some travelers have employed an in-your-face networking style with happy results. David Ewing, then a junior analyst at R.B. Webber & Company, was flying to Orlando, Fla., to attend a wireless-telecommunications trade show when he impulsively shouted to his fellow passengers on the uncrowded flight, ''Who here got stuck going to PCS98?'' A man across the aisle said, ''I did,'' and they spent the flight talking. 
 ''It turns out he was an executive with one of the companies I needed to research,'' Mr. Ewing said. ''I got a ton of data, got introduced to his whole staff later, and invited to their parties. The information I brought back made a reputation for me in the firm as a 'whatever it takes' kind of guy.''
 Since that coup, Mr. Ewing, who is now president of San Francisco Consulting Group, a marketing consulting firm, has been known to use bait to reel in promising prospects. On a recent flight to Detroit, the man next to him in coach looked like a chief executive, said Mr. Ewing, who left a copy of a business book he had brought with him on the seat as he got up. 
 The man asked if it was a useful book, and before you can say networking Mr. Ewing offered a laptop demonstration on the plane about pricing and the software tools his firm creates to help companies achieve a good financial return oninvestments. His seatmate, the chief executive of a Silicon Valley hardware firm, was impressed, Mr. Ewing said, and the two men have since scheduled a meeting.
 Other road warriors take a more understated approach. Andrea Nierenberg, the founder of the Nierenberg Group, a corporate training firm in New York, waited until her airplane was descending into Las Vegas before asking her seatmate in first class about her plans in the area, then continued the chat with her as they made their way to the baggage area. She figured it was a smarter ploy than trying to engage the woman in conversation right away and risk annoying her.
 ''There are all kinds of unwritten rules in first class, and people are always working, anyway,'' said Ms. Nierenberg, the author of ''Nonstop Networking: How to Improve Your Life, Luck and Career,'' who has also made business contacts while stuck in an elevator and waiting to get into the restroom. Her patience paid off; her seatmate, a meeting planner, later hired her to give a speech at a conference for a financial firm client and do team-building for another finance client.
 Sometimes serendipity strikes, pure and simple. Ted Levine, the chairman of Development Counsellors International, a economic-development and tourism marketing firm in New York tells the story of how he flew to Barbados in 1961 in hopes of landing a contract but wound up with Trinidad and Tobago. His meetings on Barbados had fallen through, so he went to Trinidad and Tobago for the weekend to see the sights.
 Sitting in Trinidad's Piarco International Airport and waiting for his luggage, he started a conversation with David Weintraub, who was the chairman of the Trinidad and Tobago Industrial Development Corporation. The two kept in touch, and, after the islands gained their independence the next year, the country became his client for more than 10 years. 
 Of course, blabbing to strangers can be risky. Ash R. Huzenlaub, the chief executive of the Emergisoft Corporation in Arlington, Tex., which automates emergency health care records, says he frequently spots loose-lipped competitors on flights to trade shows, often just a row or two a way. ''They talk loudly about their products and pending deals, either on their cellphone as the plane taxis or is at the gate, or to colleagues with them,'' Mr. Huzenlaub said. ''These experiences taught me the value of keeping my mouth shut and keeping my laptop facing the window.''
 Still, Mr. Huzenlaub, who is 28, is not dogmatic about steering clear from high-altitude deal-making. ''A stewardess keeps trying to set me up with her daughter,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An Outsider's Grim Prognosis for Pension Agency

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
It has been a struggle for some, but most big companies are coming up with enough cash to keep their pension funds legally sound, after three years of extraordinary losses. Not so their government backstop. Slowly but surely, the federal agency that insures pensions is running out of money. 
 An independent analysis of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, made available to The New York Times, suggests that the agency will go broke in 2020 if current financial conditions persist. Even if things improve, so that fewer pension funds fail than in recent years, the agency is still expected to run out of money by 2023.
 ''Any private insurance company under those circumstances would be shut down,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, the president of the Center on Federal Financial Institutions and the author of the new study. 
 If the pension agency goes broke, one of two things would happen: the retirees who rely on it would stop getting their checks, or the taxpayers would have to bail the agency out. The agency currently pays benefits to more than a million people whose pension plans have collapsed. It also guarantees benefits promised to 43 million more people.
 The pension insurance program is only one of many such promises by the government. Altogether, Washington insures some $6 trillion in risks ranging from crop failures to nuclear meltdowns.
 The analysis by Mr. Elliott comes at a time of mounting concern about the pension plans of some of the biggest airlines, particularly United, which is in bankruptcy and has warned that it may default on its pension obligations. That could compel other airlines to cut or shed their pension plans, too, leaving the agency on the hook for billions of dollars in benefits. On Sunday, US Airways filed for bankruptcy for the second time in two years, raising fears that it might default on the three pension plans it operates, for flight attendants, mechanics and white-collar employees. The pension agency said that it would suffer a $2.1 billion loss if all three plans failed.
 Mr. Elliott is not the first analyst to suggest that losses on this scale would cripple the agency. But his sophisticated economic model is thought to be the first -- at least in the public domain -- to try to determine where the breaking point would be and what it would look like.
 Such projections are forbiddingly difficult. ''It depends on what market conditions are,'' said Richard A. Ippolito, who was the pension agency's chief economist from 1986 to 1999. ''It depends on which companies are going to get better and which are going to get worse.''
 Mr. Elliott's findings suggest that America's system of guaranteed pensions is in far more precarious shape than its older, bigger and more prominent cousin, the Social Security system.
 The Social Security trust has been subjected to repeated analysis: its current forecast says it is likely to run out of enough money to pay full benefits in 2042, absent remedial measures. Even in Social Security's worst-case outlook, the money probably would not run out until 2031, said Steve Goss, the Social Security Administration's chief actuary.
 In addition, because Social Security takes in substantial payroll tax dollars every year, it would still be able to pay at least 73 percent of promised benefits from that cash flow.
 Some 201 million people participate in Social Security, and forecasts of its possible collapse 38 years from now have long stirred debate. In August, for example, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a conference that he feared ''we have promised more than our economy has the ability to deliver,'' and called for a scaling back.
 There is far less discussion of the pension agency's running out of money, even though the cash squeeze seems to be looming sooner -- and even though it would cause much greater pain to the affected retirees.
 With no one trying to model the pension system's financial future, policy makers have had no clear sense of how grave the system's troubles are. Congress, therefore, has tended to overlook its problems altogether, Mr. Ippolito said.
 As with the Social Security situation, Mr. Elliott said, the earlier any changes are made to the pension agency's finances, the less drastic they will need to be. 
 He ran various possibilities through his model and estimated the cost of doing nothing until the cash ran out and of making various fixes. One of the cheapest ways to revive the agency, he determined, would be to pump in $14 billion right now.
 One of the costliest outcomes would occur if airlines defaulted on their pension plans without any compensatory action. That would leave the agency penniless by 2018, Mr. Elliott's model predicted, and Congress would have to authorize a $109 billion bailout to resurrect it.
 Mr. Ippolito, who left the agency to teach in the law school at George Mason University in northern Virginia, said that Congress should raise the premiums the agency charges corporations to back their pensions. But that idea is not likely to be welcomed by business.
 Mr. Elliott, who also put price tags on various solutions, said that he was not advocating one type of rescue or the other, but merely trying to predict the costs.
 ''What I really want to do is get the debate going,'' he said.
 That has been hard because the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is little known and because those most likely to be stuck with the repair bills -- companies that have pension funds -- tend to argue that the agency can run acceptably well with a deficit and does not need fixing.
 Representative John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, is expected to make a speech today at the United States Chamber of Commerce in which he will outline his ideas for pension reform and try to win over the business community. Mr. Boehner is expected to call for changes in the rules that govern pension contributions, and for making the pension law apply even when a company has declared bankruptcy.
 In addition to charging companies premiums, the agency takes over the assets of pension funds when companies default, invests them, and uses the income to pay retirees. That means that every time a pension fund collapses, the agency gets an immediate infusion of money.
 It also gets an even bigger burden of debt, but the debt is paid over the long term. Until the debts start coming due in large numbers, the tide of new money coming in gives the deceptive appearance that the agency is getting healthier every time another pension fund fails. 
 ''It's the ultimate Ponzi scheme,'' said Mr. Ippolito, the agency's former chief economist. ''That's what a Ponzi scheme is, by the way. It's when you're cash-flow solvent, but you're completely bankrupt as an organization. And what you need to keep going is to keep getting more suckers to come in to the pool every year.''
 The longer a Ponzi scheme keeps going, however, the more unsustainable it becomes.
 ''Sooner or later you run out of luck and the game is over, which is like all Ponzi schemes,'' Mr. Ippolito said. ''You just can't put it off any more. But now, you're in worse shape than ever, because in the meantime, you've taken all these additional claims in.''
 A spokesman for the pension agency declined to comment in detail on Mr. Elliott's projections, saying that the agency uses a different type of statistical modeling and does not try to make forecasts beyond 10 years into the future. He did say, however, that Mr. Elliott's forecasts are generally consistent with the agency's own. 
 Notably, the pension agency recently stopped making official assertions that it had enough money to pay retirees all their benefits ''for the foreseeable future.'' Its most recent annual report says only that it has enough money ''for a number of years.'' 
 In an interview, Mr. Elliott said that his extensive work with insurance companies when he was an investment banker gives him the experience needed to model the pension agency's future cash flows.
 ''I've literally done hundreds of models of insurance companies,'' he said. ''It was my work.''
 Having reached a point in his career when closing deals and making money no longer held much fascination, he said, he began to want to have a voice in public policy. ''I probably talked to about 100 people in Washington,'' he said. ''It started sinking in to me, the huge nature of the government's role as a lender and an insurer.''
 Huge -- and to a great extent undefined. Tucked away within various government agencies are programs to insure a grab bag of risks: crop failures, floods, bank runs, turmoil in developing countries, even nuclear meltdowns. There are also lending programs to help with everything from hurricane cleanups to helping bring home Americans who run out of money overseas.
 Some of these programs are well established and documented. But others stumble along in obscurity, on a wish and a prayer. The nuclear-accident insurance program, for instance, does not charge companies premiums, and offers seemingly limitless coverage to the industry without explaining how claims would actually be paid.
 Another federal insurance program, which guaranteed deposits in savings and loan institutions, failed catastrophically in 1989, after years of policy missteps. Its bailout cost taxpayers an estimated $200 billion in today's dollars.
 More recently, a program to help companies buy under-used radio spectrums suffered billions of dollars of losses when--in an effort to help small companies compete--the Federal Communication Commission effectively made long-term loans just as the technology bubble burst.
 ''You had the F.C.C., which is completely inexperienced in lending, proposing a lending program,'' Mr. Elliott said.
 Disaster might have been avoided, he said, had the officials had an opportunity to learn from the successes and failures of other government lending programs.
 ''Generally, what has happened is, programs have been put in place on an ad hoc basis, as Congress has perceived the need,'' he said.
 Mr. Elliott set about cataloging all the programs he could find. He discovered that the government's lending programs, totaling about $1.4 trillion of debt, were reasonably well documented. 
 But the insurance programs were not. He still is not sure he has identified all of them, but so far he has cataloged about $6 trillion worth of federally insured risks. That appears to make the United States government the largest lender and insurer in the world, he said. 
 Only months after Mr. Elliott founded his research center, United Airlines announced that it was suspending contributions to its four big pension plans. The total shortfall of the plans is about $8 billion, and the contributions are required by law. But regulators have been unable to enforce the law because United receives court protection in bankruptcy. 
 Mr. Elliott's model shows that the pension agency will go broke whether the airlines default in succession or not, but the drama at United has made it easier to get people's attention, he said.
 ''I think United really changed people's thinking,'' he said. ''Whether that will lead to action, and appropriate action, remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Recommits to Recycling With an Ambitious 20-Year Pact

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration plans to announce today that it will sign a 20-year contract with one of the nation's largest recycling companies, a move that assures the city's broad recommitment to recycling. 
 The most ambitious component of the plan is the construction of a $45 million plant on the Brooklyn waterfront to recycle all the city's residential metal, glass and plastic, officials who have been briefed on the contract said yesterday.
 The announcement comes just two years after the city largely abandoned recycling as an economic drain in a time of budget cutbacks. While the Bloomberg administration has gradually reinstituted residential recycling programs, the contract reflects the administration's bottom-line conclusion: as landfill prices increase and technology improves, recycling is the most cost-effective way to get rid of much of its garbage.
 The commitment to recycling solidifies what has been an on-again, off-again program that left New Yorkers guessing from year to year what to do with their garbage. The debate has often been positioned between environmental concerns and rudimentary questions about whether recycling could ever be economically feasible to governments facing tight budgets. With this contract, the Bloomberg administration has settled the debate. 
 Elected officials and industry experts say the city's vote of confidence in the virtues of recycling is expected to have profound repercussions nationwide as local governments decide whether to pursue aggressive recycling programs.
 ''Much like market analysts watch the Federal Reserve in order to assess monetary issues, many people look to New York City when it comes to municipal policies,'' said James Thompson Jr., president of Chartwell Information, a market research firm in San Diego that analyzes the waste management industry. ''I think the repercussions of this will be pretty widespread.''
 Under the contract, one of the largest scrap metal companies in the country, the Hugo Neu Corporation, based in Manhattan, will invest about $25 million in the plant, said officials who have been briefed on the contract. Hugo Neu recycled most of the steel from the World Trade Center.
 Another industry official explained that the city would spend about $20 million to repair a pier so that it could accommodate barges that will carry roughly 90 percent of the material to the plant.
 The plant, scheduled to be finished by 2007, will be on city-owned land at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park.
 When the contract expires, the city will maintain most of the rights over the operation, the officials who have been briefed on the contract said.
 The mayor's office and officials with Hugo Neu refused to comment on the contract. Details are expected to be outlined today at a news conference by the mayor. 
 ''The mayor deserves credit for forging a deal that marries sound environmental policy with good business,'' said Mark A. Izeman, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The environmental community has been advocating this for years, and its great news that recycling is here to stay.''
 A number of factors explain the city's shift away from a policy that shunned recycling just two years ago, when the mayor argued that New York could save $40 million annually by dumping the materials into landfill rather than recycling them. Recent studies, including one by the city comptroller's office, indicate that initial numbers were significantly off the mark.
 Furthermore, landfill prices have also shot up in the last several years. But most of all, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has come to the view that the savings of recycling lie in long-term contracts with recycling companies rather than short-term contracts with less efficient waste-removal companies, as is the current practice.
 Carmen J. Cognetta, counsel to the City Council's Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee, said the city currently pays around $50 per ton to recycle metal, glass and plastic, but that cost will drop to around $40 per ton once the sorting operation is built. 
 It will likely drop even further, perhaps to around $20 per ton, as Hugo Neu picks up a larger share of the more lucrative paper market, which is part of the terms of the contract, he said. 
 The cost of paying haulers to bury the material in landfills is now around $70 per ton, as the cost of sending it to out-of-state landfills has risen 46 percent in the last three years, according to city statistics.
 By offering a long-term commitment, the mayor has enticed Hugo Neu to build the type of highly mechanized operation needed to sort materials cheaply and efficiently.
 In the past, the city has offered five-year contracts, often with 10-day cancellation clauses. Under these contracts, companies have been reluctant to invest in more than the most basic facilities that consist mostly of low-wage workers who sort the materials from conveyor belts.
 In larger and more advanced plants like the one Hugo Neu will build in Brooklyn, manual labor is supplemented by modernized equipment that uses heavy magnets to pull off metals, blowers to sift paper and plastic and optical devices to separate different colors of glass.
 The long-term contract also allows the company to reach better deals with buyers of the materials, further driving down the cost to the city.
 And by placing the sorting operation within the city, the contract will lower the high transportation costs the city now pays to cart the materials farther away. 
 Once the plant is operating, the city's sanitation trucks will still pick up the recyclables, then take it either directly to the Brooklyn complex or to one of two transfer stations owned by Hugo Neu.
 The city is also considering whether to send the materials through the city's marine transfer stations once they are reopened.
 A local lawmaker involved in sanitation issues praised the city's approach.
 ''With this contract, the city does for metal, glass and plastic what it did for paper nearly 10 years ago,'' said Councilman Michael E. McMahon, a Staten Island Democrat and chairman of the Council's waste management committee. 
 In 1997, the city offered a 20-year contract for 50 percent of the city's paper recycling, and Visy Industries, an Australian recycling company, stepped forward to build a $250 million processing plant on Staten Island.
 ''That contract gave paper recycling a permanent home, it attracted the needed investment to build permanent infrastructure and now the city gets amazing returns on it,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''This contract holds the same basic promise.''
 The recycling contract is also a precursor to the mayor's eagerly awaited 20-year waste management plan, which is to be announced by early October. That plan will detail the city's plan to deal with its trash now that its huge Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island has been closed.
 Since taking office, the mayor has struggled to get a solid grasp on the city's trash problems. In August 2002, he announced an ambitious schedule for reopening the city's marine transfer stations, only to backtrack once he realized that his goal was much more expensive and complicated than planned.
 In a report card in July, the mayor gave himself an F in waste management for failing to create a plan for the city's trash problems. 
 With this contract, however, the city will lock firm plans into place for the removal of about 20 percent of the city's total waste flow. 
 ''The mayor might have given himself an F on the trash issue not long ago,'' Mr. Izeman said, ''But in striking this deal, he just turned in an A paper.''

HEADLINE: Storm, Just Grazing Cuba, Crawls Toward Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and FELICITY BARRINGER; Ginger Thompson reported from Havana for this article and Felicity Barringer from Tampa, Fla. Reporting was contributed by Terry Aguayo from Miami; Duwayne Escobedo from Pensacola, Fla.; Thomas Crampton from Robertsdale, Ala.; James C. McKinley Jr. from Mexico City; and Andrew C. Revkin from Tallahassee, Fla.

DATELINE: HAVANA, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Hurricane Ivan spared Cuba the worst of its fury on Monday, skirting the western tip of the island before lurching toward Mexico and then returning to its slow, fearsome path to the United States Gulf Coast.
 Unnerved by the televised images of the destruction from the storm, a Category 5 hurricane, and memories of hurricanes from years ago and weeks ago, residents from the Big Bend of Florida to the Louisiana coast prepared. The storm seemed to combine the size and agonizing slowness of the recent Hurricane Frances with power greater than that of Hurricane Charley.
 Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans, a city largely below sea level and extremely vulnerable to hurricanes, urged anyone who could leave to get out as soon as possible. 
 ''It's my feeling that this storm will pass very close to New Orleans,'' Mr. Nagin told The Associated Press Monday night.
 At a news conference in Tallahassee earlier in the day, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that even with the long-term forecasts showing the eye of the hurricane making landfall farther to the west than earlier ones, no one in the possible strike zone should think that the danger had passed. 
 ''This is not the time to be defiant or let people know you're a macho man,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is a powerful force of nature that you should not be messing with.''
 Part of the Yucatan Peninsula, a popular tourist area, was under hurricane warning on Monday night as the storm passed through the channel between Mexico and Cuba. Officials ordered cruise ships to stay at sea and removed an estimated 15,000 people from the peninsula.
 Hotels from Cozumel to Cancun boarded windows, but had decided not to remove guests. In the Gulf of Mexico, GlobalSantaFe, the second-largest offshore oil driller in the world, shut its entire fleet and removed 495 workers.
 At least 68 people have been killed in Venezuela, Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
 Cayman Airways, the flag carrier of the Cayman Islands, announced that it had canceled all flights through Wednesday. The Owen Roberts International Airport was in restricted use and gave no indication of when it would fully reopen.
 ''Winds ripped apartments like matchsticks,'' one radio report from Grand Cayman said, according to The Associated Press. ''The whole island has taken a battering. Cars and trucks were floating away like toys.''
 But the government of the Islands, which the storm grazed on Sunday, said that the country had suffered ''no reported casualties.'' In a news release it added, ''There has been extensive water damage to a number of buildings, but the vast majority remain structurally sound.'' 
 The western half of Cuba, known for producing some of the best cigars, was battered by heavy rains and winds, and there were concerns about flooding. As the storm passed Cuba, most of the country remained on alert and locked down. Businesses remained closed, and streets were empty. 
 Still, relief was palpable everywhere. In the days that Hurricane Ivan approached the island, the Communist government began an extensive civil defense operation that often felt like a call to arms. More than one million people, mostly women and children, were removed from crumbling or flimsy housing. Men stayed to defend their homes.
 Hundreds of thousands of tons of food and sugar were stored in fortified warehouses. State workers removed street lights and safeguarded gasoline stations.
 The state television dedicated almost all broadcasts to explaining the magnitude and course of the storm.
 President Fidel Castro was on the air much of the time, listening to high-ranking officers report from around the country about conditions and preparedness. In the morning, the aging but ever-charismatic president told reporters that he was grateful for the ''kind attitude'' of the hurricane in bypassing Cuba. He told reporters that his country had stood against threats of nuclear attack, and decades of economic sanctions. 
 ''This storm,'' he said, ''only renews our strength and our solidarity.''
 Watching Mr. Castro, a television anchor commented, ''Always on the front lines of combat.''
 At 11 p.m., the eye was off the western tip of Cuba, moving northwest at 9 miles an hour with maximum sustained winds near 160 miles an hour. 
 The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that hurricane-force winds extended 100 miles from the center and that tropical-storm-force winds stretched 200 miles from the center. 
 The uncertainty about the storm's course, combined with what was apparent certainty that it would hit Gulf Coast communities hard, left Floridians with mixed emotions, and moving in opposite directions. Although curling bands of clouds and rain from the storm spread north over the Keys and the Miami metropolitan region, most of the tens of thousands of residents who had left the Keys began returning.
 In areas like Pensacola, however, residents were making evacuation plans. In the two westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle, Escambia and Santa Rosa, emergency officials said people living in mobile homes and vulnerable sites like coastal and low-lying areas should evacuate. Hurricane Opal hit the two counties hard in 1995.
 The Santa Rosa emergency management director, Dave Ling, was hoarse when he said: ''Whether people remember Hurricane Opal or not, the images of Charley and Frances has everybody energized. They're getting prepared.''
 Paulette Travis, an assistant manager at Fireworks World, a store the size of an airplane hangar in Robertsdale, Ala., that was going to be boarded shut, said: ''When I bought that plywood on Friday, not too many people were shopping. But they've heard now, believe me.''
 Nightmares of Hurricane Frederick's striking Mobile, Ala., in 1979 inspired Mrs. Travis to stock up on supplies early.
 ''God spared me in that longest night of my life because he knew I was a single mother with nowhere to go,'' Mrs. Travis said. ''This time, my mobile home is tied down. But I will be leaving with my personal photos as soon as I can.''
 The emergency management director in Florida, W. Craig Fugate, said the Panhandle and Big Bend, the curve where the western side of the peninsula begins, were especially vulnerable to flooding. The western stretch has many flood prone rivers, and the bend is a dead end for the tidal surge from hurricanes.
 Mr. Bush conceded that residents were worn thin. ''I don't know if it's the five-day forecasts or the slowing down of the last two storms that's created a little bit of a challenge in terms of people's patience levels,'' the governor said. 
 He encouraged residents not to fixate on the day-to-day swings of the storm. Everyone in the danger zone, he said, should prepare and then focus on other thoughts, perhaps the outstanding high-school and college football teams in the state.
 At the hurricane center, meteorologists eyed a new worry, an unnamed tropical depression with sustained winds of up to 30 miles an hour gathered strength and was possibly on course for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

HEADLINE: Sales Forecasts Raise Technology Shares for Third Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Technology stocks rose yesterday for a third day as a sales forecast from the Broadcom Corporation, a maker of semiconductors used in consumer electronics, spurred optimism about the industry's earnings outlook.
 The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 42 percent of its value from computer-related shares, added 16.07 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,910.38. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.90 points to 1,125.82, its highest since July 1.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed, rising 1.69 points to 10,314.76. The Altria Group, the parent of Philip Morris, dropped 38 cents, to $48.84, but regained 20 cents in after-hours trading. 
 About three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.3 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 8.1 percent less than the daily average for the year.
 An S.&P. 500 index of 19 semiconductor and chip-equipment stocks gained 1.7 percent, for its third consecutive advance. The measure has dropped 29 percent this year, making it the worst performer among the benchmark's 24 industry groups, while the S.&P. 500 has risen 1.3 percent.
 ''A lot of these technology stocks were sold because of poor second-quarter results and a cautious outlook by companies for the rest of the year,'' said Ryan Jacob, who manages about $80 million at Jacob Asset Management in New York. ''It seems we're pretty much through this process with prices as low as they have been.''
 Rich Templeton, the chief executive of Texas Instruments, said last week that he was optimistic about demand for the semiconductors that his company supplies for half the world's cellphones. 
 Broadcom jumped $2.60 yesterday, or 9.4 percent, to $30.30, then gained another 19 cents in after-hours trading. The surge was the biggest in the S.&P. 500. The company, whose chips are used in consumer electronics and computer networks, cut its sales forecast by less than some investors expected, said Albert Lin of American Technology Research.
 Broadcom said third-quarter sales would be ''flat to up slightly'' versus $641 million in the second quarter because some customers were delaying deliveries. It had previously forecast $673 million to $680 million. Broadcom said it still saw the possibility that earnings would be higher in the third quarter than they were in the second.
 PMC-Sierra, which makes chips for telecommunications equipment, gained 79 cents, to $10.12. The gain was the second largest in the S.&P. 500. Intel, the biggest semiconductor maker, increased 23 cents, to $20.80. The stock has lost 35 percent this year.
 The Oracle Corporation, which reports its first-quarter earnings today after the market closes, added 16 cents to $10.62.
 Crude oil rose and natural gas soared in New York as the approach of Hurricane Ivan disrupted production and tanker shipments in the Gulf of Mexico, where a quarter of oil and natural gas for the United States is pumped. Crude for October delivery added 2.5 percent to $43.87 a barrel in New York. 
 The ChevronTexaco Corporation, the nation's sixth-largest oil refiner, rose 92 cents, to $50.94. The Valero Energy Corporation, the No.3 United States oil refiner, increased $2.38 to $71.07.
 United States Treasuries advanced as oil futures rose, and after Federal Reserve Governor Susan S. Bies said there was ''no urgency'' to raise the central bank's interest rate target until there were more signs of steady growth.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 12/32 to 100 29/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.14 percent, from 4.19 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Company Shows Argentina How to Shake Its Isolation

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
In the summer of 2001, just as the worst economic crisis in Argentina's history was coming to a boil, Paul H. O'Neill, then the United States Treasury secretary, set off a furor here by suggesting that the country might have avoided collapse had it ever bothered to learn to export.
 The real trouble with Argentina, Mr. O'Neill told The Economist, is that ''they don't have any export industry to speak of at all.'' He added: ''And they like it that way.'' 
 While Argentina is still far from becoming a trade powerhouse, one company that has bucked the trend for decades by successfully selling abroad is Swift Armour S.A. Argentina, the country's leading meat products company. Unlike most of its domestic rivals, Swift generates more than 70 percent of its sales through exports, and inward-looking Argentina desperately needs the dollars earned by exports to stabilize its large debt.
 Run by Carlos Oliva Funes, a soft-spoken executive with more than three decades of experience in the beef business, Swift is generating jobs and setting an example for other Argentine companies that are seeking to increase sales by tapping into foreign markets. The company has added almost 1,000 people to its payroll since 1999, bringing its work force to 2,570; during that time many of its competitors cut workers. And at the government's urging, Swift is now sharing some of its expertise with smaller companies that want to export tea, honey, olive oil and other products.
 ''Swift has always gotten the bulk of its revenue from exports, and that's helped us weather the ups and downs of the economy,'' Mr. Oliva Funes, 61, said in an interview at the company's headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires. ''It's worked well for us, so we're sponsoring some small companies to try and teach them a little bit about how to export so they can do the same.''
 Founded in 1907, Swift has long been a big name in Argentina's beef industry, employing as many as 23,000 people after the government briefly took over the company in the early 1970's. 
 Swift became a private company again in 1977 when a local investment group led by Mr. Oliva Funes bought it and set out to streamline it to make it more profitable. Three years later, a smaller but more efficient Swift changed hands again when the Argentines sold out to the Campbell Soup Company of Camden, N.J., though Mr. Oliva Funes stayed on as a director.
 For most of the next two decades, Swift thrived as one of Campbell's biggest suppliers of frozen and canned beef, used to make soups. In 1997, Campbell's transferred control of Swift to a subsidiary, Vlasic Foods International, which was spun off as an independent company a year later. But Vlasic soon decided to abandon its commodity businesses and focus on its operations in the United States, and it put Swift up for sale in 1999.
 Hoping to seize the chance to buy the company back, Mr. Oliva Funes started hunting for investors. Before long, he brought on board two Wall Street private equity funds, J.P. Morgan Latin America Capital Partners and Greenwich Street Capital Partners, which divided up a 49 percent stake in Swift. With the help of Argentine investors, Mr. Oliva Funes raised $55 million and took a 51 percent stake in the company.
 Swift got off to a rocky start under new ownership. The company was hit hard by a drop in beef prices after outbreaks of mad cow disease in Europe and of bovine hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina. Brazil's decision to devalue its currency in early 1999 also hurt Swift's earnings, making Brazilian beef more competitive on world markets. The Argentine peso was still pegged to the American dollar at that time. By 2003, Swift's sales had dropped to $137 million a year from $160 million in 1999.
 To weather the storm, Swift sealed long-term contracts with big buyers like Campbell's and Kraft Foods, and actively sought out new clients around the globe. Today the company exports beef products to 70 countries and is on track to report more than $200 million in sales this year.
 ''We used to be a reliable supplier for Campbell's Soup,'' Mr. Oliva Funes said. ''Now we're a reliable supplier for a variety of companies all over the world.''
 Swift's aggressiveness also helped it ride out Argentina's economic crisis better than most. When the Argentine economy collapsed in late 2001 and most investors were pulling money out of the country, Swift went on a buying spree. In 2002, Swift spent $4 million to buy Cabana Las Lilas, one of Argentina's best-known brands of premium beef. A few months later, it snapped up a bankrupt meatpacking plant near the Uruguayan border named Vizental for $8 million, which increased its production capacity by about 35 percent.
 ''In the middle of the crisis, instead of pulling back, what we did was raise our bet by going out and buying more assets,'' said Alfredo M. Irigoin, a partner in the Buenos Aires office of JPMorgan Partners, the private equity arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Company. ''But if Swift hadn't been such an exporter, forget it, it wouldn't have paid off.''
 Other Argentine companies are starting to follow Swift's example, taking advantage of a weak peso to export. The government expects export revenues to grow 14 percent this year to a record $33.5 billion, though this is mostly because of a jump in prices for commodities like soybeans and oil. Brazil, by contrast, is on track to bring in more than $90 billion from exports this year.
 But most companies here, especially the smaller ones, still face formidable obstacles to becoming exporters. Credit remains scarce and costly, making it hard for companies to market their products to potential overseas buyers. 
 With a few exceptions, foreign investors have been reluctant to fill that void, preferring to wait and see if Argentina's economic recovery is sustainable. Moreover, the government, strapped for cash, levies taxes of up to 45 percent on exports to help pay the country's huge public-sector debt, currently equivalent to about 127 percent of gross domestic product.
 ''There are several companies doing a good job at exporting, but it has taken years of persistence,'' said Enrique S. Mantilla, the president of the Chamber of Exporters of Argentina. ''There's talent here, but it's not easy to put that talent to use in a country with so much volatility.''

HEADLINE: Junking Science

 BODY:
The Bush administration has from time to time found it convenient to distort science to serve political ends. The result is a purposeful confusion of scientific protocols in which ''sound science'' becomes whatever the administration says it is. 
In the short run, this is a tactic to override basic environmental protections in favor of industry. In the long run, it undermines the authority of science itself.
 The latest example concerns the marbled murrelet, a small seabird listed as a threatened species that lives along the coast from Northern California up to the Aleutian Islands. Its habit of nesting high in the boughs of old-growth forests puts it squarely in the way of logging interests. Last year, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, responding to a suit from the timber industry, authorized an independent review of the status of these birds. The panel determined that marbled murrelets, whose numbers continue to decline, needed ongoing federal protection. The health of the species as a whole, the report found, depends on protecting several genetically and behaviorally distinct populations of the bird. The Northwest regional office of Fish and Wildlife reached essentially the same conclusion, arguing that the birds in that area deserved protection as a distinct population.
 Recently, however, the Bush administration concluded otherwise, that these murrelets were not distinct from their more abundant Canadian cousins. The administration did not lift protections for the bird. But it ordered a study of the bird across its entire range. This, in turn, could lead to a removal of protections for the bird and, ultimately, more logging in the old-growth forests that shelter it.
 This administration seems to make no accommodation for anything besides humans' economic desires. Any creature in the way may find itself legislated, litigated or regulated out of existence.

HEADLINE: Sorting Out The Winners If US Airways Doesn't Survive

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
US Airways' second trip to bankruptcy court holds both promise and peril for the nation's other major airlines.
 US Airways' decision to seek Chapter 11 protection on Sunday could jolt unions at Delta, Continental and Northwest to make wage and benefits concessions, executives at the carriers said yesterday.
 But at the same time, they acknowledged that there was little chance US Airways' probable contraction, and possible demise, would solve the overcapacity that is plaguing the industry.
 In fact, a liquidation of US Airways could have the opposite effect: Low-fare airlines like JetBlue and Southwest could step up their already aggressive plans to expand their fleets and routes to capture its customers before its bigger rivals do. That might be easily accomplished. According to documents filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., yesterday, US Airways' assets include 290 gates in 14 cities, a cargo operation in Philadelphia and hundreds of slots that enable the airline to schedule flights from La Guardia Airport and Reagan National in Washington. 
 JetBlue, which begins service from La Guardia on Friday, might be a ready customer.
 ''If, all of a sudden, there is some real estate available, we would have to take a good hard look at it,'' JetBlue's president, David Barger, said.
 So instead of helping the traditional carriers, US Airways' troubles could make their own even worse, analysts said.
 At least on the labor front, there is some optimism. Delta, Continental and Northwest are trying to reach agreements on pay and benefit cuts with the Air Line Pilots Association, which traditionally takes the lead in labor talks.
 Some analysts think a decision by some union leaders to block pilots from voting on US Airways' contract proposal was the crucial factor in the airline's decision to file for bankruptcy protection. The message companies may attempt to send to unions, they said, is: Do not let that happen to you.
 ''All the airlines will now be playing off each other, and what each one gets will be the minimum for the next one,'' said Gary L. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 Pilots ''have got to be looking at this and thinking, we'd be better off with an out-of-court solution, given that our brethren at US Airways are facing liquidation,'' added William T. Warlick, senior airline analyst with Fitch Ratings.
 John Mazor, a spokesman for the national pilots' union, disagreed, saying, ''We hope that management would get the message that airline workers are tired of handing over concessions that disappear right down the drain because management hasn't fixed the broken business model.'' Mr. Mazor's union is based in Washington.
 Such a sense could be the reason for the standoff at Delta, where its chief executive, Gerald A. Grinstein, has warned for months that the airline is likely to seek its own bankruptcy filing, absent $1 billion in concessions from its pilots, if it is unable to clean up its debt-laden balance sheet.
 Delta's pilots have offered cuts valued at $655 million to $705 million, but they are upset with the company's plan to terminate their retirement program and replace it with a less-generous plan, echoing a threat also made by United Airlines, which is also in bankruptcy court.
 Yesterday, Mr. Grinstein said that the US Airways bankruptcy takes away two psychological impediments he thought could be keeping airline pilots from cutting deals. First, the Chapter 11 filing came amid the strongest air traffic in years, he said, so it cannot be blamed on the business cycles that routinely shake the industry.
 Second, no investors have stepped forward to rescue US Airways, which will be operating on its cash and ticket revenues until it has the chance to craft a restructuring plan. The airline's filing ''peels away those two elements,'' Mr. Grinstein said in an interview yesterday.
 Mr. Mazor, in turn, saw a message sent to management by the filing: ''They need to look at US Airways and decide if they are going to let their own operations slide into that position.'' 
 At Northwest, which has been talking to its pilots about concessions for more than a year, the chief executive, Richard Anderson, said the US Airways situation would heighten the sense of urgency to get a deal quickly. ''This is a commodity market, and you have to have low costs to mark at market prices,'' Mr. Anderson said in an interview.
 Mr. Anderson said Northwest could not ignore what was happening at other carriers. ''We live in a parity world,'' he said.
 Mr. Mazor said he had heard such threats many times during his 25-year career as a union official. ''That's a time-honored game,'' he said.
 But Professor Chaison said US Airways had upset the dynamic of negotiations by following through on its Chapter 11 filing. ''They can walk out of a room any time,'' he said of management, ''and that will be it.''
 Also upsetting the industry balance has been the growth of low-fare carriers, led by Southwest, the industry's sixth-largest airline, which has more employees than US Airways -- about 33,000 to 28,000 -- and JetBlue, which is on track to become a similar size within the next decade, up from about 7,000 employees now.
 Both airlines have ordered dozens of new aircraft -- Boeing 737's for Southwest, and a mix of Airbus jets and Embraer regional jets for JetBlue. 
 Mr. Barger, whose airline does not have unions, expressed sympathy for US Airways, which he said faced ''incredibly difficult circumstances.'' But the battle between the airline and its unions over $800 million in wage and benefit concessions was no surprise, he said, given the labor problems that crippled other airlines in the past.
 Ticking off a list of carriers that did not survive bankruptcy, Mr. Barger said, ''What don't you understand about Pan Am, TWA and Eastern?''

HEADLINE: A Plan to Switch Money to Make Iraq Safer

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Faced with mounting violence in Iraq, the Bush administration plans on Tuesday to propose shifting $3.46 billion from Iraqi water, power and other reconstruction projects to improve security, increase oil output and prepare for elections scheduled for January.
 Congressional sources briefed on the plan on Monday said it cleared the way for President Bush to forgive 95 percent of Iraq's prewar debts to the United States. Those debts total about $4 billion. 
 The proposed changes, which will require Congressional approval, reflect a realization within the administration that without better security, long-term rebuilding is impossible.
 Of the more than $18 billion approved for Iraq's reconstruction, only about $1 billion has been spent so far. 
 Such a shift was recommended last month by John D. Negroponte, the American ambassador to Iraq.
 ''This is adjusting a plan in response to changing circumstances,'' said an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 ''One of the changing circumstances is the need to focus more urgently and more quickly on developing Iraqi security capability,'' he added. ''Another is the need to accelerate employment of Iraqis.''
 Under the plan, the administration will call for shifting $1.804 billion now earmarked for water, sewage and electricity projects to expand Iraqi police and other security forces. Another $180 million would help plan for elections and strengthen local governments.
 In addition to the outlay to bolster Iraqi security and election planning, the administration will shift $450 million to expand Iraq's oil capacity; $380 million to support economic and education reforms; and $286 million to expand job training programs.
 The administration would also set aside $360 million to cover the ''budget cost'' of forgiving 95 percent of Iraqi debt to the United States. The figure represents an amount estimated to secure the loans, largely run up during the 1980's.
 While the administration is required to seek Congressional approval for major changes in Iraq's reconstruction package, Congressional aides said the White House now wants to ease those restrictions. One aide complained that the administration was effectively seeking a blank check to spend the money with minimal oversight.

HEADLINE: PUTIN ISSUES PLAN TO TIGHTEN GRASP, CITING TERRORISM

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin ordered a stunning overhaul of Russia's political system on Monday in what he called an effort to unite the country against terrorism. If enacted, as expected, the proposals would strengthen his already pervasive control over the legislative branch and regional governments.
 Mr. Putin, meeting in special session with cabinet ministers and regional government leaders, outlined what would be the most sweeping political overhaul -- and his most striking single step to consolidate power -- in Russia in more than a decade. Critics immediately said it would violate the Constitution and stifle what political opposition remains.
 Under Mr. Putin's proposals, which he said required only legislative approval and not constitutional amendments, the governors or leaders of the country's 89 regions would no longer be elected by popular vote but rather by local legislatures -- and only after the president's nomination. Seats in the lower house of the federal Parliament, or Duma, would be elected entirely on national party slates, eliminating district races across the country that now decide half of Parliament's composition. In elections last December, those races accounted for all of the independents and liberals now serving in the Duma. 
 After the school siege in Beslan, the downing of two airliners and other terrorist attacks that have shaken the country, Mr. Putin argued once again that Russia was ill-prepared to fight terrorism and said that the country needed a more unified political system. His proposals on Monday, however, made it clear that for him, unity meant a consolidation of power in the executive branch.
 ''Those who inspire, organize and carry out terrorist acts are striving to disintegrate the country,'' Mr. Putin said in televised remarks that the state channels rebroadcast repeatedly, in their entirety, through the day and evening. ''They strive for the break up of the state, for the ruin of Russia. I am sure that the unity of the country is the main prerequisite for victory over terror.''
 The Bush administration was restrained in its comments about Mr. Putin's proposals.
 ''This is a domestic matter for the Russian people,'' said a White House official who asked to remain anonymous. ''It is important for Russia to continue along the pathway of democracy and economic reform.''
 Across the short spectrum of political opposition in today's Russia, reactions ranged from stunned disbelief to helpless anger.
 Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the leader of the main opposition party, the Communists, called the proposals ''ill conceived.'' Sergei S. Mitrokhin, a leader of the liberal Yabloko party, said they represented ''the elimination of the last links in a system of checks and balances.''
 Mikhail M. Zadornov, an independent deputy who was elected from a district in southern Moscow last year, said that rather than unifying Russians against terror, the proposals would simply disenfranchise them from politics and the state.
 ''All these measures,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''mean we are coming back to the U.S.S.R.''
 The electoral changes are subject to the approval of Parliament, but because the party loyal to Mr. Putin, United Russia, controls more than two-thirds of the 450 seats, that is almost a foregone conclusion. Mr. Mitrokhin said that although Mr. Putin's proposals ''contradict the letter and the spirit of the Constitution,'' challenges to them would be futile.
 ''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''in Russia there is no independent Parliament and no independent judiciary.''
 In the wrenching days since the siege at Middle School No.1 in Beslan, where Chechen and other terrorists held and ultimately killed hundreds of hostages, Mr. Putin has appeared publicly a handful of times and with unusual candor admitted the government's failures and weaknesses in fighting terrorism. Until Monday, however, he had offered only the vaguest proposals to fix them, instead exhorting Russians to mobilize against the threats facing the country.
 In the years since Boris N. Yeltsin elevated him to the presidency on Dec. 31, 1999, Mr. Putin has steadily consolidated political power in the executive branch, often by the sheer force of his will. He took away from the regions the power to appoint the upper house of Parliament. He imposed a structure of seven federal districts over the vast and unruly country, each led by his appointees. He also used the Kremlin's vast power over television and government resources, as well as his extensive personal popularity, to reward loyal governors and punish or push aside disloyal ones.
 The proposals on Monday, however, went further than any of other steps under Mr. Putin's watch.
 Since Russia adopted a new Constitution in 1993, residents of the country's 89 regions, from Chukotka in the east to Kaliningrad in the west, have elected their governors or, in some places, presidents. They have also sent their own regional deputies to Moscow. Mr. Putin's proposals would take those choices out of the voters' hands.
 Mr. Putin said the change in parliamentary elections would strengthen the national parties, which he said would ensure ''a real dialogue and interaction between power and society in the fight against terror.''
 In the December elections, only four parties crossed the threshold for winning seats and three of them generally support the Kremlin: United Russia, the Liberal Democrats and Motherland. The Communist Party, marginalized and increasingly disorganized, remains the only pure opposition party. Two other opposition parties, Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, failed to win any seats. A direct proportional election would give the advantage of incumbency to parties in power and eliminate local grass-roots campaigns that have provided the handful of dissenting voices heard on the Duma floor.
 Andrei A. Piontovsky, an analyst at the Center for Strategic Studies in Moscow, said the change in regional elections could have the unintended consequence of alienating voters in the ethnic patchwork of semiautonomous regions and republics, many led by presidents who enjoy at least a degree of independence from the central government.
 ''It is not only stupid,'' he said of the proposal to have Mr. Putin appoint regional leaders to be approved by local Parliaments. ''It is very sensitive for the national republics like Tatarstan and those in the North Caucasus. It will be a humiliation to the people there.''
 After Mr. Putin's meeting, a number of regional leaders loyal to the Kremlin appeared on state television and endorsed his proposals, if not that one specifically. They included Tatarstan's president, Mintimer S. Shaimiev; the governor of the city of St. Petersburg, Valentina I. Matviyenko; and the newly elected president of Chechnya, Alu Alkhanov.
 Mr. Putin has faced unusually pointed criticism from the public and in newspapers after the standoff with militants at a school in Beslan, which ended in the death of at least 339 people, about half of whom were children. Last Friday, appearing to bow to pressure, he agreed to a public inquiry into the attack on the school, though one controlled by the Federal Council, whose members he appoints. On Saturday, he also dismissed the interior minister and security chief of North Ossetia, where Beslan is, though not its president, Aleksandr S. Dzasokhov, who was among those at Mr. Putin's special session on Monday.
 In addition to the changes in the political system, Mr. Putin also demoted his representative in the Southern Federal District, Vladimir A. Yakovlev, who had overseen Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus. In his place, Mr. Putin appointed one of his most trusted aides, Dmitri N. Kozak, who since March has been chief of the government. Before that, Mr. Kozak oversaw Mr. Putin's efforts to rewrite the criminal code and to streamline the government.
 Mr. Putin also proposed the unification of counterterrorism efforts in a single agency, citing the examples of ''a whole number of countries which have been confronted with the terrorist threat.'' That appeared to be a reference to agencies like the Department of Homeland Security in the United States, which some here have said Russia should emulate, but Mr. Putin did not provide any details.
 He also called for banning ''extremist organizations using religious, nationalistic and any other phraseology as cover'' and tougher penalties for crimes committed by terrorists, even minor ones like obtaining a false passport. 
 The electoral changes, however, provoked the fiercest criticism. 
 ''It is not a reaction to a terrorist attack,'' Mr. Zadornov said. ''It is an attempt to change the political system to have more control.''

HEADLINE: A Great Tax Plan (for Accountants)

BYLINE: By Jim Weikart. 
Jim Weikart is a partner in a tax preparation firm and the author of ''Harry's Last Tax Cut,'' a novel.

 BODY:
As a tax guy, I found myself chuckling quietly when President Bush said in his speech at the Republican National Convention that he would ''lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.'' Before long, I was howling with laughter. Sorry, folks, but efforts to ''simplify'' the code always bring clients streaming through my door. And the president quickly went on to show why: he wasn't able to offer simplification without adding two levels of complication within the next two minutes. 
 O.K., the president said, I'm going to lead an effort to simplify. But I'm also going to ''create American opportunity zones'' in which ''we will provide tax relief.'' Thank you, sir, and please add Form AOZ to Forms 1116, 2106, 6251 and all the others we now have. Next came a ''tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts.'' Please add Form TC-HSA. 
 I did get a little nervous, however, when Mr. Bush directed listeners to his Web site for more details. Would it explain how he planned to reconcile these new exceptions and credits with his promise of simplification? I needn't have worried: regarding simplification, it said only that ''President Bush will work to make the tax code simpler for taxpayers, encourage saving and investment, and improve the economy's ability to create jobs and raise wages.'' 
 As a bonus, the site included some proposals not mentioned in the speech. One was for an ''above-the-line tax deduction that individuals could claim for long-term-care insurance premiums'' (add Form LTC). Another was an ''additional tax exemption for home caregivers of family members'' (add Form TEHCFM).
 And, trust me, should the president really ''simplify'' things, an avalanche of other deductions and exemptions would be sure to follow. 
 Form M: Let's get serious. Somebody making $100,000 a year and spending half of it on round-the-clock care for a seriously ill spouse says, ''Hey, how come I pay the same tax under simplification as the guy who makes a $100,000 and doesn't spend anything on medical care?'' Let's make an exception for catastrophic medical problems.
 Form DTUUC: The United States was founded on a revolt against unfair taxation. You can't have a guy in New York City paying about $10,000 in state and local taxes on his $100,000 income and also paying federal taxes on the same income. Shouldn't he at least be able to deduct the taxes he paid to New York to get closer to a level playing field with people in no-tax states like Florida, New Hampshire and Texas? (The DTUUC stands for double taxation unfair under the Constitution.)
 Form M (No, make that Form I, we've already used M for medical): A man's/woman's home is his/her castle. And that castle was built with a mortgage. Don't pull the rug out from under the indebted baby boomers just as they reach retirement age and are worrying that Social Security won't be around (see budget deficits). The mortgage-interest deduction stays. 
 Form C: For charity, so people can give money to the groups running those faith-based initiatives that are filling in for the social-service programs the administration is so intent on cutting. 
 Form E: For the expenses of the self-employed and others who, unlike salaried workers, need to spend a lot of money to make their money.
 Of course, it's not that simple. We would need to put some limits on the exceptions. For example, catastrophic medical deductions could be limited to expenses over 7.5 percent of income; mortgage interest could be limited to two personal properties and to the first $1 million of mortgage debt plus $100,000 home equity debt; gifts to certain charities could be no more than 50 percent of income, while others would have 30 percent or 20 percent limitations. Looking forward to that paperwork?
 Well, the president has one thing right: doing away with the old forms and having a lot of new ones would at least give the appearance of change. So if he wins in November, you can make your appointment with my office at any time. Thanks to his plan to ''simplify,'' you're going to need the help.

 BODY:
Every fall, after raising their young near Teshekpuk Lake and the Colville River, tens of thousands of geese and tundra swans leave the North Slope of Alaska for more southerly shores. Some end their journey at the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in the flatlands of North Carolina.
 Both habitats could be transformed if current Bush administration initiatives come to pass. The birds would have oil rigs as neighbors in Alaska and be greeted by Navy jets simulating carrier takeoffs and landings in North Carolina.
 That such projects could bracket the birds' path is not surprising in light of the priorities of the administration. Over the last three and a half years, federal officials have accelerated resource development on public lands. They have also pushed to eliminate regulatory hurdles for military and industrial projects. 
 From the start, Bush officials challenged the status quo and revised the traditional public-policy calculus on environmental decisions. They put an instant hold on many Clinton administration regulations, and the debates over those issues and others are intensely polarized.
 The administration has sought to increase the harvesting of energy and other resources on public lands, to seek cooperative ways to reduce pollution, to free the military from environmental restrictions and to streamline -- opponents say gut -- regulatory and enforcement processes.
 In a recent interview, Michael O. Leavitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, summed up the Bush administration's philosophy. ''There is no environmental progress without economic prosperity,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''Once our competitiveness erodes, our capacity to make environmental gains is gone. There is nothing that promotes pollution like poverty.''
 The administration's approach has provoked a passionate response. Asked about his expectations in the event of President Bush's re-election, Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is the ranking minority member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, wrote in an e-mail message: ''I expect the Bush administration to continue their assault on regulations designed to protect public health and the environment. I expect the Bush administration to continue underfunding compliance and enforcement activities.''
 Mr. Jeffords concluded, ''I expect the Bush administration will go down in history as the greatest disaster for public health and the environment in the history of the United States.''
 For many environmental groups, Mr. Bush's legacy was assured in his first year, thanks to highly publicized decisions that effectively repudiated Clinton administration positions. Mr. Bush backed off a campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide and abandoned the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. Then the administration pushed, unsuccessfully, for a law allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It scrapped the phaseout of snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park and briefly dropped a Clinton proposal to cut the permissible level of arsenic in drinking water by 80 percent. 
 The cumulative effect was striking. The decisions sought to reverse environmental action for which there was broad support. Polls by The New York Times in mid-2001 and late 2002 consistently showed public opposition to drilling in the Arctic refuge. A CBS poll in the same period showed that, by ratios of better than two to one, those polled said that environmental protection was more important than energy production. 
 The outcry ensured that some Bush administration initiatives favorable to the cause of environmental groups received little notice. They include the E.P.A.'s decision to force General Electric to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to remove PCB's in the Hudson River, a cleanup that has been delayed; legislation speeding the cleanup of urban industrial sites known as brownfields; increases in financing for private land set aside for conservation of animals and their habitats; and the first limits for diesel emissions in trucks and off-road vehicles.
 The diesel regulations, said James F. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, would have as much impact on air quality as the rules that eliminated leaded gasoline. The clamor over the reversals, he said, ''grossly overshadowed the accomplishments, which in scope and scale were of far greater consequence to environmental protection and natural resource conservation than anything people were complaining about.'' 
 The administration contends that free markets often provide the best solution to pollution. That belief underlies regulatory proposals to allow power plants that exceed their goals in reducing pollutants to sell cleanup credits to plants that fall short. 
 The failed ''Clear Skies'' act, incorporating this approach, was in many ways reborn in a pending regulation that Bush officials say would offer significant pollution reductions and that critics dismiss as a retreat from the mandates of the Clean Air Act.
 Mr. Leavitt called the reasoning simple. ''Rather than spend decades and millions litigating'' to ensure power plants' compliance one at a time, ''let's require everyone to do it essentially at the same time,'' he said. ''And create incentives for them to do more as opposed to incentives to try to avoid.'' 
 Mr. Jeffords countered, ''The relaxed Bush approach will produce more illness, disease and premature deaths than simply putting the federal government's full resources into achieving compliance with the Clean Air Act and pushing the development of cleaner, more efficient electricity generation.''
 The recent proposals for Alaska and North Carolina reflect some of the themes of the administration's overhaul of environmental policies.
 In 1998, Bruce Babbitt, President Bill Clinton's interior secretary, opened to oil drilling four million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. That is 87 percent of the landmass of the reserve's northeast quadrant. The 580,000 acres held back, including Teshekpuk Lake, were considered crucial wetlands habitat for molting and nesting fowl -- swans, geese, peregrine falcons and other species -- and for caribou and the hunters who live off them. But geological surveys show that large volumes of oil lie beneath much of that area. In June, the Interior Department proposed opening the lake and most of the remaining acreage to drilling, because, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said recently, ''that's where the resource is.''
 Well before that proposal, a panel of the National Research Council, a private, nonprofit institution, issued a mixed report on the cumulative effects of 40 years of oil development on the North Slope. Bird populations, it found, dwindled as the numbers of predators like foxes and brown bears grew unnaturally large. The predators were drawn to the area by oil-field garbage.
 Edward Porter, research manager for the American Petroleum Institute, said the situation was unlikely to recur around Teshekpuk Lake because the exploration envisioned would have few permanent facilities.
 At the birds' other way station, in North Carolina, the prospective disturbances would be the latest F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet jet fighters, which would touch down and take off from a new airfield 31,650 times each year. 
 A Fish and Wildlife Service advisory in March raised concern; the noise of a jet taking off is two to four times greater than the level that startles such birds into flight. During their winter sojourn, the birds accumulate the fat that fuels their next migration. The more jets startle them into flight, the more they burn fat needed for the journey.
 The Navy's review concluded that the birds ''would not be affected.'' Navy officers also argued that the risk of collisions between birds and planes -- which is estimated to be higher than at any other airfield in the country -- could be mitigated.
 When local North Carolinians and the Audubon Society went to court to block the project, the administration closed ranks, and the Interior Department, the parent agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service, supported the Navy. A United States District Court judge has temporarily blocked the Navy from proceeding. 
 In many ways, the issues in the birds' neighborhoods speak to the aims, tactics and results of the Bush environmental strategy as much as the better-known inventory of decisions, like the scuttling of the Clinton ban on new roads in 58.5 million acres of roadless national forests.
 Environmentalists, for example, accuse the administration of trying to pressure or ignore its scientists, from those of the Pocosin biologists in North Carolina to Environmental Protection Agency scientists working on global warming. In several instances at the agency and at the Fish and Wildlife Service, political appointees aggressively policed agency scientific work that could form the basis of new regulations.
 Administration officials, some of whom were lobbyists for the industries they now regulate, say the crucial factors in their thinking are scientific rigor and economic logic. Such priorities were cited in the proposal to expand drilling in Alaska.
 The effort to offer the set-aside section of the Alaska petroleum reserve for leasing parallels moves across the West. Bureau of Land Management offices and their land-use plans have been re-engineered to streamline leasing and drilling decisions. From the beginning of the fiscal year, the number of drilling permits has increased to 5,222, the bureau reported. If that pace continues, the annual total will be more than 50 percent higher than the average in the previous three years. 
 Ms. Norton says that ''less than one percent of the surface acres of the Bureau of Land Management have any disturbance for oil and gas production.'' With new safeguards for wildlife and technologies allowing several wells to branch underground from one well pad, both energy and environmental needs can be satisfied, she said.
 The means by which energy development accelerated, like the revamping of land-use planning guidelines, is pretty dry stuff. So are procedural questions; for example, when a local office should clear decisions with headquarters. In the Bush years, officials have relied more on less-visible administrative action than on legislation to advance their agenda. For instance, local Army Corps of Engineers offices have been instructed to check with headquarters before taking jurisdiction over wetlands slated for development, a process that critics say discourages wetlands protection.
 The administration had developed a draft proposal to curtail federal wetlands jurisdiction but had to back off after it was disclosed last fall and conservative hunters and fishermen blanched. At a White House meeting, leaders of fishing and hunting groups argued that the plan would degrade large tracts of wetlands and diminish nearby wildlife. Mr. Leavitt quickly repudiated the draft. Last Earth Day, President Bush, standing by salt marshes in Maine, called for a net gain in wetland acreage. 
 Last fall, Mr. Leavitt, the former governor of Utah, took over from Christie Whitman. She had resigned as E.P.A. administrator after two years as what Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called a ''wind dummy'' -- a reference to the buffeting she took for the administration's unpopular initiatives. 
 The portfolio of issues Mr. Leavitt inherited is not in the same stage it was in in January 2001, at the start of the Bush administration. Many of the administration's environmental policies have laid a foundation for more comprehensive actions in a second term. Critics are convinced that efforts to increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands will accelerate, as will efforts to change laws like the Endangered Species Act. 
 Ms. Norton acknowledged that the issue of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, would resurface because ''that it is our largest prospect for onshore oil.'' She added, ''There will be extensive environmental protections.''
 Asked if she would have done anything different in the last few years, she said: ''I would have spent more time talking about our successes. Because we've accomplished a lot more than we've ever gotten credit for.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sept. 14 about the Bush administration's record on environmental issues referred incorrectly to a regulation adopted this year to control emissions from off-road diesel engines. The regulation tightened existing standards; it was not the first federal effort to control emissions from most diesel engines. Highway vehicles have been regulated since 1988 and some off-road engines have been regulated since 1996.

HEADLINE: Record Deficit for a Crucial Trade Figure

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The United States hit a record deficit of $166.2 billion last quarter in trade and capital flows with the rest of the world, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, raising fresh concerns about the nation's overall indebtedness and prompting some analysts to warn of threats to the value of the American dollar.
 With goods continuing to flood into the United States from Asia and Europe, and indications that foreign governments still view the American market as the most attractive place to sell their products and invest their money, there was little indication in the latest report that the overall imbalance is likely to diminish soon. 
 News of the current account deficit, which was significantly larger than expected by most analysts, slightly pushed down the value of the dollar on Tuesday against the euro. The report contributed to a greater decline against the Japanese yen. 
 Most economists attribute the ballooning deficit, which also is reaching high levels as a share of the nation's economic activity, to an overvaluation of the dollar in international currency markets, especially in relation to China and Japan. And some warn that the situation is rapidly spinning out of control.
 ''I really believe we have a disaster scenario in the making,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, which has long been a center for those who worry about the nation's global economic stature. ''As soon as the markets see these unsustainable levels of debt, the dollar could very well crack.''
 But others said the threat was exaggerated by experts whose previous warnings have not been borne out. Claude E. Barfield, resident scholar and trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that he was not one of the analysts ''who think the sky is falling'' because of the increasing deficit.
 He said that the dollar had been weakening against the euro and some other currencies, which should have a positive effect on the trade balance by the end of the year. ''I don't think there is any imminent problem,'' Mr. Barfield added, ''but over time we are going to have to get our macroeconomic house in order.''
 Besides the currency issue, Mr. Barfield said that the long-run answer was for Americans to save more aggressively and for the United States to stop consuming so much beyond its means. 
 The Bush administration interpreted the current account deficit as a sign that other countries were lagging behind the United States and needed to pump up their economies. Robert Nichols, assistant secretary of the treasury for public affairs, said that the deficit actually made the country more attractive to foreign investors.
 The imbalance ''is largely a result of the global growth deficit,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''It's important that the rest of the world grow more, which will expand our ability to export and aid our manufacturing industry.''
 But many outside analysts see a different problem as American consumers continue to buy low-priced imports, especially from Asia, while American manufacturers have failed to increase their share of the global market.
 That has pushed the size of the deficit relative to the overall output of the economy into dangerous territory, some economists contend. It now represents 5.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, a level that many analysts consider unsustainable, up from 2 percent in 1998.
 ''This is a far larger share of the G.D.P. than we've had in the past,'' said Robert E. Scott, of the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. ''This just can't go on.''
 With the presidential election looming, Democrats seized on the latest data as evidence of what they called further proof that President Bush's economic policies were failing the American public.
 ''The current account rising to a new record is exceedingly troubling,'' said Jason Furman, economic policy director for the John Kerry campaign. ''What's even more worrying is that the Bush administration appears entirely unconcerned about the current account deficit or trying to address it.''
 Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, said that he was surprised by the big drop of $9.6 billion in the net income flows earned by American investors overseas.
 To cover the debt, the United States has become more dependent on foreign governments. According to one study, private foreign investors have grown wary of financing the United States deficit over the last year; as a result, Asian governments have stepped in, especially Japan and China, and now provide 87 percent of the inflow of dollars to cover the gap in what Americans earn from selling and investing abroad. 
 Exporters in both countries benefit from efforts made by their governments to keep their currencies at lower levels against the dollar. 
 There is a broad consensus within the administration and at the International Monetary Fund that the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan need to be valued higher against the dollar. 
 But despite increasing pressure, the Chinese have balked at any immediate change, saying they still need time to prepare fundamental structural and financial flaws in their economy before they can allow adjustments in the value of the yuan.
 Meanwhile, China registered a $4.49 billion trade surplus in August, its largest monthly trade surplus this year, according to the Xinhua news agency.
 While encouraging their consumers to spend more, both China and Japan continue to save far more than the United States, which has also lost the domestic savings advantages it gained as federal budget surpluses turned into huge deficits.
 In response, Mr. Kerry, the Democratic candidate, is campaigning in part on a policy calling for more stringent fiscal policy and a return to budget surpluses enjoyed under Mr. Clinton. He has also pushed for more aggressive enforcement of the nation's trade laws.
 President Bush argues that Mr. Kerry, playing to a labor union constituency, has begun flirting with protectionism as an answer to the nation's trade gap; he contrasts that with what he says is a strong White House effort to negotiate more trade agreements with individual nations, regional groups and at the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: What Price Nostalgia? Looking Ahead to Resale

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Yesterday afternoon on eBay, a pair of 1985 Nike Air Jordans climbed to a price of $15,200, a figure that exceeded the opening bid placed two days earlier by $15,190.01. The pair of red, white and black sneakers had been purchased at a yard sale two years ago, the seller acknowledged, and were ''either authentic or a really, really, really good fake.'' 
 Ever since the untamed cultural flowering of nostalgia worship and the growth of an online auction world that has served as potent fertilizer, the economics of fashion have required an understanding broader than that which leftist social observers, with their criticism of planned obsolescence, have traditionally applied. Certain old clothes have second acts, new lives and suddenly impressive market valuations -- none more so than the garments that capture the ethos and passions of a particular moment in our social conscious. 
 Twenty or 30 years from now, what will command the inflated price that an old pair of Nikes or a Pucci shift dress, circa 1970, does today? The spring 2005 collections have offered little in the way of long-term investment opportunities, but if I were to play the runway's Abby Joseph Cohen, I would say that the clothes produced by J. Mendel so powerfully represent one side of the two Americas that someday they will assume the price of small private islands.
 Many of them quite possibly do already. The collection was full of a kind of denied excess: jewel and sequined trims, just a hint of fur around a collar or surrounding a short sleeve. J. Mendel began its life as a furrier, and the show featured at least one fur coat tossed over a pretty chiffon shift. Heavy animal skins for spring and summer seem odd, but apparently dressing in opposition to the weather is the surest way to telegraph that you are a proud member of America's wealthiest 1 percent. 
 In an interview Michael Kors gave to The Daily, the free Fashion Week publication offered in Bryant Park, he said he liked the look of sandals and sleeveless dresses for winter because it means you have a car and driver waiting nearby. Boots in snowstorms are so middle class, he seemed to suggest. If you're wearing a fur coat in August, you must be on your way to your very own cattle ranch in Argentina.
 Michelle Smith's show for Milly provided light tropical dresses, shorts and skirts that one would actually be moved to wear in the summer, when it's hot, however bourgeois an idea that may seem. Ms. Smith turned out pretty, flowing Indian-style skirts, contrasting pastel prints, lovely combinations of greens and browns as well as white eyelet. Nothing in the collection seemed impractical -- the clothes were the sort you would keep for many, many seasons, if not the kind from which you could ultimately make enough money to pay your child's college tuition.
 The Japanese label United Bamboo delivered little that one would even covet right now. Models walked about at the pace of convalescents in a hospital hallway. They wore high-heel wedged shoes, tired gold sandals and dull prints interrupted by a pair of flight pants or a safari suit. Of those last two looks, neither was emphatic or tweaked enough to warrant a renewed appreciation.
 But if one were to deliver a planned obsolescence injunction to anyone this week, it would have to go to Anna Sui, who offered a collection of Western wear so garish and nonsensical it might even be turned away at a rodeo. With cowboy hats, belts, prairie dresses and what seemed like appendages of hanging muskrat, Ms. Sui made nearly every single model who came down the runway look like Nudie, Dale Evans and Daniel Boone in one. Depreciation alert: Here were spring clothes that looked as if they would be slashed to sale price before temperatures hit the mid 60's.

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Museum Names Woman as President

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
For the first time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has chosen a woman as president: Emily Kernan Rafferty, the Met's current senior vice president for external affairs. Ms. Rafferty will succeed David E. McKinney when he retires in January.
 The appointment was set for approval by the museum's board of trustees last night. Ms. Rafferty is to report to Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director and chief executive. 
 ''We could have looked outside the museum, or we could have looked at candidates both inside and out, or we could have looked just from within,'' said James R. Houghton, chairman of the museum's board . ''Since Philippe is 68 and won't be around forever, we thought that having two new people run the museum would be a risk.''
 Ms. Rafferty, 55, who has worked at the Met for 28 years, will be responsible for the museum's administration, including development and membership, technology and information services, human resources, merchandising, communications, government relations, legal affairs and finance, as well as facilities management. She will oversee 2,000 full- and part-time employees. (Curatorial, conservation, library and education employees will continue to report directly to Mr. de Montebello.) 
 Ms. Rafferty will also supervise a $155 million remodeling project, which includes a grand Roman Court and Islamic galleries. 
 ''My job is not to set the vision, but to support the museum's mission and its director at a particularly challenging time,'' she said. ''It's not 9/11 per se, but in one sweeping gesture we were cognizant of the fact that our work had changed.'' 
 ''We were clobbered economically'' after 9/11, she said. ''A year later we were struck by SARS. Suddenly the audiences we relied on weren't there.''
 The Met is the nation's largest museum, with over two million objects and nearly five million visitors a year. Ms. Rafferty said that she viewed her job as providing steady management that could tackle economic and other issues and solve them without disruptions. 
 She has a reputation for being one of the most effective fund-raisers in the art world. In overseeing the Met's vast national and international fund-raising operations for two decades, Ms. Rafferty has helped bring in hundreds of millions of dollars for the museum and over 20 years has worked to build individual, family and corporation memberships from 98,000 to nearly 120,000.
 She also introduced ''holiday Mondays,'' a program that opens the museum on federal holidays for the first time in more than 50 years, and ''member Mondays,'' which allow members to pay $50 to see special exhibitions in a less crowded environment when the museum is closed to the general public.

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes A Softer Threat On Sudan's Oil

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The United States circulated a revision to its draft resolution about Sudan on Tuesday, seeking to overcome opposition on the Security Council by modifying a threat to put sanctions on the country's leaders and its oil industry if the government fails to curb violence in the Darfur region.
 The new version, which amended one debated by the Council's 15 member countries last week, maintained the possibility of sanctions but instead said the Council ''shall consider'' action, rather than ''shall take'' action for noncompliance.
 The new draft retains language calling on Secretary General Kofi Annan to create an international commission to determine whether genocide has occurred in the country, and it strengthens the role of the African Union in trying to end what the United Nations has called the world's gravest relief crisis. 
 The resolution is the second proposed Security Council action this summer aimed at stopping the violence, which has left an estimated 50,000 black Africans dead at the hands of Arab militias and has forced 1.2 million people to flee their homes. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that the United States had concluded that the violence constituted genocide.
 The first resolution on Sudan, also drafted by the Americans, passed the Security Council on July 30 by a vote of 13 to 0, with China and Pakistan abstaining. The newer proposal, with its focus on Sudan's oil, deepened opposition from China and Pakistan, both of which get oil supplies from Sudan. Sudan took in $1 billion in oil revenue in 2002, on production of 250,000 barrels a day.
 Wang Guangya, the ambassador of China, who had said his country would veto the resolution unless the language was altered, had no immediate reaction to the revisions. But he suggested that any mention of sanctions on oil would still pose problems.
 John C. Danforth, the American ambassador, said he hoped for a vote by Friday. He said the most important new emphases in the draft were ''to maximize the African Union presence and to make sure the commitments are there for the humanitarian support.''
 The United Nations says it has received barely half of the $531 million appeal for the Darfur relief effort.

HEADLINE: Amid Job Cuts, Housing Chief Of Newark Unit Added Luxuries

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
When the Newark Housing Authority announced that it would lay off 99 employees this month, Harold Lucas, the agency's executive director, blamed the federal government for cutting the agency's subsidy by 10 percent over the past three years. 
 ''We were able to hold off on the layoffs for two years and we boiled it down to the bare minimum, but we're down to nothing,'' Mr. Lucas said in an interview with The Star-Ledger, published on Sept. 3. ''Now it's people.''
 Yet in the past 18 months, the agency -- which handles housing for 32,000 residents -- has spent more than $400,000 for new cubicles, carpets and other renovations to offices and conference rooms at the authority's six-story headquarters on Broad Street, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with employees and vendors. 
 The purchases included a $2,850, 42-inch plasma television that was installed in Mr. Lucas's office in early July, a new $215 vanity for Mr. Lucas's private bathroom and more than $14,000 worth of other audio-visual equipment -- from projectors to wireless microphones and televisions -- for the headquarters building, according to agency invoices and interviews with employees and vendors. 
 The authority also spent more than $42,000 on two new sedan cars, bought in July and August and driven by top officials. One of the cars, a black Mercury Marquis, has leather seats. The cars are at a parking lot next to the headquarters building.
 The agency also paid $25,000 on June 25 to a nonprofit youth services organization run by Mr. Lucas's daughter, Kelley Lucas Barnhardt. The organization assists with the agency's annual beauty pageant for young female residents, an event held each summer.
 Mr. Lucas is listed in documents as the registered agent for the firm, Kelstar Rising Inc., meaning that he is the group's lawyer. Hiring the firm of a relative could be a violation of federal regulations, according to lawyers familiar with the rules, and appears to violate Newark's procurement policy.
 At the same time, the Housing Authority failed to apply for federal funds that would supplement its budget for Section 8 housing, the federal rent subsidy program, according to federal housing officials. Several other housing authorities in New Jersey, with fewer Section 8 apartments, received as much as $515,000 in federal aid to increase rent subsidies, and New York City received $52 million in extra aid. 
 Mr. Lucas, who served as executive director from 1992 to 1998 and returned to the post in 2002 after a stint as an assistant secretary in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, did not return calls for comment. Mr. Lucas's aides said he was on vacation.
 However, during an interview yesterday, Mayor Sharpe James reached him by telephone from a conference room in City Hall and placed him on speaker phone in the presence of this reporter. During the call, Mr. Lucas remained silent when asked to respond to questions about agency spending. Later, he did not return two messages left at the Newark Housing Authority and three follow-up phone calls made to his home. 
 Mr. Lucas reports to the Newark Housing Authority Commission, a board whose members are appointed by Mayor James. His salary is $190,355, which is nearly $30,000 more than what Mr. James earns as mayor, and about $20,000 more than that of the executive director of the New York City Housing Authority, which provides housing services for more than 10 times the number of tenants as Newark. 
 Calls to two of the housing commissioners, Zinnerford Smith, the chairman, and Fran Adubato were not returned. Harry Robinson, the authority's spokesman, referred all calls to Mr. Lucas.
 Mayor James, who has worked closely with Mr. Lucas since the 1980's, when they both started their careers in city government, said that blame for the staffing cuts lay with the White House. 
 ''I would hope that the focus would be on the Bush administration, as opposed to local people fighting over the crumbs that the federal government is offering us,'' he said. 
 But Mr. James also said that Mr. Lucas has created a ''special challenge'' for himself by launching renovations during austere times, and by accepting a $190,000 salary.
 ''We've reached a crisis era,'' Mr. James said, referring to several complaints that he has heard recently from residents about the quality of Newark's public housing. ''Mr. Lucas must prove that he's worthy of his salary.''
 The layoffs this month brought to the surface complaints that many tenants and employees have had with the agency, which manages 8,230 public housing units, along with 5,348 units of housing that are subsidized by Section 8 vouchers. Many of the buildings are new low-rise complexes built to replace high-rises that were demolished in the 1990's. 
 The agency's total budget is about $70 million. Federal housing officials have been providing an operating subsidy of $42.6 million, with a proposed reduction next year to $40.8 million -- a cut that is less than the 10 percent that Mr. Lucas said justified the layoffs, according to the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, a 30-member group that works closely with federal officials on housing budgets. 
 The agency in Newark had about 1,000 employees. Those who were laid off came from all departments, including maintenance, security and headquarters.
 About 25 current and former employees, along with residents and their family members, marched outside the housing authority's headquarters last Thursday to protest the layoffs. 
 Tomasa Sereno, 83, one of several senior citizens from Hyatt Court, a three-story public complex that is more than 40 years old, said at the rally that her main concern is security. The area surrounding the buildings in the East Ward -- near two other public-housing projects -- is a notorious hot spot for drug dealers and prostitutes. 
 ''Now,'' she said in Spanish, referring to the layoff of security personnel, ''I'm afraid that the doors will be open to anyone who wants to come in. We won't be safe.'' 
 Crime remains a concern of many tenants. Despite the suburban town-house appearance of the newest housing stock, many of Newark's public complexes are still pocked with trouble. One of the four police officers shot here this year while on duty was injured at a public-housing complex. On Sept. 7, a 26-year-old man, Kenneth Dandridge, was found dead in the parking lot of Pennington Court, a Newark Housing Authority development in the East Ward. 
 City Councilor Luis Quintana, a former opponent of Mr. James in one of the mayor's five re-election bids, said that his office receives complaints daily about conditions in Newark public housing, including clogged pipes and filthy hallways. 
 ''We want them to stop the luxury spending,'' Mr. Quintana said in an interview at the rally. ''We want to see accountability.''
 Mr. Quintana was joined on Thursday by Jermaine James, a senior adviser to Cory Booker, who ran against Mr. James in the last election. Politics was clearly in the air; Mayor James faces re-election in 2006. 
 But the picketing employees said they were concerned about the way the agency was being run, and were angry that Mr. Lucas resorted to layoffs.
 Nelson Nieves, 47, who was laid off from the public information office, said the agency's spending did not bother him at first. He said it seemed to suggest that the authority was flush with cash. But when the layoff letter arrived on Aug. 11, he could hardly breathe because of the shock, he said.
 ''I was like whoa, what the hell is this,'' he said in an interview. ''You're laying off people, but you're buying all this equipment? Harold Lucas just said that he wanted it all new because it was his office, his suite.''
 Mr. Nieves and other employees were also unhappy with how the laid-off people were chosen. They pointed out that several of Mr. Lucas's direct family members work for the authority. Documents confirmed this. 
 Mr. Lucas's wife, Emma Lucas, was hired on April 3, 2000, as a building services manager; she earns an annual salary of $61,800. His son, Martin Lucas, was hired in 2002 and earns $34,985, according to internal documents. Mr. Lucas's daughter-in-law and Martin Lucas's wife, Sonji Lucas, was hired in 1992 and earns $49,083. 
 None of Mr. Lucas's relatives were laid off -- even though they all arrived, for example, after Levern Scott, a repairman who said that he spent 13 years ''busting his hump,'' only to see a pink slip.
 The letter sent to Mr. Nieves said that they were being let go ''for reasons of economy and efficiency.'' The authority's contract with the Service Employees International Union, which represents about half the laid-off employees, requires that seniority be the determining factor in layoffs. But employees throughout the company report that seniority was disregarded.
 ''Someone in my department has 15 years of experience and I have six, but I'm still here,'' said Amy Lebron, 28, a clerk in the inventory department. ''How's that for seniority?''
 Mr. Nieves said he was probably laid off because, when he was on the school board several years ago, he voted in favor of a candidate for superintendent who was opposed by Mayor James. 
 The S.E.I.U. Local 617 has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board over the way the layoffs were carried out, and requested an injunction in state court to get the employees reinstated. But in a statement, Rahaman Muhammad, president of the union, blamed President Bush for the agency's budget woes and labeled the rally an example of ''political maneuvering.''
 Employees and public-housing residents also blamed the White House for the cuts. But many said they believed Mr. Lucas should be challenged about the agency's spending.
 ''He claims it's based on economics and efficiency,'' Mr. Nieves said. ''If that's the case, how can you justify the renovations and the cars?''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 15 about a costly renovation project at the headquarters of the Newark Housing Authority, undertaken just before the agency eliminated nearly 100 jobs, misstated the makeup of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, a liaison group between the nation's housing agencies and the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. It represents 60 agencies, not 30.

HEADLINE: New York City's Poverty Rate Holds Steady While Nation's Rises

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
The Census Bureau's annual survey measuring income and poverty rates show that the national poverty rate rose for the third year in a row in 2003 to include one in eight Americans, an increase largely attributed to the recession and slow recovery that have battered the national economy since 2001.
 But New York's poverty rate held steady, at one in five New Yorkers, despite the fact that New York's recession was deeper and longer than that in the rest of the nation, with the city economy losing 6.4 percent of its jobs, compared with a national drop of 1.8 percent from the 2000 peak. 
 In a report released yesterday analyzing the new census data, which was announced last month, Mark Levitan, senior policy analyst at the Community Service Society, a group that serves and studies the poor, said that the crucial difference between the national and local poverty figures was whose jobs were lost. 
 In New York, Mr. Levitan found, the job losses were heaviest for young men between the ages of 16 and 24, who are typically not breadwinners for families, while single mothers, perhaps the population group most at risk of dragging a family into poverty, saw their employment rate increase. 
 ''In national data we see a decline in employment for single mothers and a rise in poverty for female-headed families,'' Mr. Levitan said. ''There, we have lost the kind of gains that were made in the late 1990's that were associated with a hot job market and welfare reform. In New York that hasn't happened. Single moms have been able to hang in there.''A family of two adults and two children with an income of less than $18,660 was considered poor.
 In the past, job losses have meant that the city's poverty rate escalated quickly. From 1988 to 1992, when the city was mired in its last recession and the work force shrank by 8.1 percent, the poverty rate rose 3.3 percent to include almost one in four New Yorkers. Last year it rose 1 percent.
 While men saw their employment rate drop by 5.4 percentage points and women in general saw their employment rate drop by 2.2 percentage points, single mothers increased their employment rate by 3.1 percentage points. This was in part because the sector that gained the most jobs in the past three years was educational and health services. Women make up 72 percent of that sector's work force, Mr. Levitan said.

HEADLINE: G.M. Helps to Drive a Detroit Revival 

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The largest private landlord in downtown Detroit, the General Motors Corporation, is nearing the end of a major renovation of its riverfront headquarters complex that has significantly transformed one of the city's most iconic structures.
 In addition, G.M. has announced preliminary plans for a 25-acre mixed-use development on land it owns adjacent to the complex and is playing a major role in the city's effort to redevelop the mainly blighted riverfront into a mixed-use community that combines retail and residential space with public improvements like parks and marinas. 
 The activity grows out of the company's decision in the mid-1990's to acquire the 5.5-million-square-foot Renaissance Center as its new world headquarters. The center consists of four 39-story office towers and a 74-story hotel atop a large five-story retail atrium.
 G.M. bought the complex for about $75 million, a fraction of what it cost to build in the early 1970's. Since then, it has spent upward of $500 million on a top-to-bottom renovation and has also acquired several additional properties in the area. 
 ''They're quite the big fish,'' said David L. Littmann, senior vice president and chief economist at Detroit-based Comerica Bank. ''They got the real estate at a very good price and are leveraging it in their favor.''
 Matthew P. Cullen, G.M.'s general manager for economic development and enterprise services, said, ''We made a very cognizant choice to invest in the city.''
 But he emphasized: ''This was not a philanthropic gesture. It was a business decision that was intended to be consistent with our philosophy that in order for G.M. to be successful, the communities in which we are located have to be successful.''
 The renovation -- by the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill -- corrects problems that have plagued the center almost from the day it opened. 
 The center was erected by a consortium of local business interests led by Henry Ford II, G.M.'s rival, as a response to the race riots and general decline that crippled Detroit in the late 1960's. The architect was John Portman, then famous for a series of mixed-use projects that incorporated vast interior atriums.
 ''It was the first of the silver bullets that were going to solve all the city's problems,'' said Robin Boyle, associate dean of the College of Urban, Labor and Metropolitan Affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit. ''The idea was that it would provide the city with a springboard to the 21st century.''
 From the beginning, however, there were complaints about the complex's fortresslike appearance and what was deemed a confusing interior circulation plan. 
 Criticism centered on a 30-foot concrete berm in front of the complex on Jefferson Avenue that seemed to wall it off from the rest of downtown. 
 ''It was very foreboding,'' said Peter Zeiler, business development coordinator for the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, a nonprofit group that acts as a liaison between the city and private developers. 
 Mr. Boyle said: ''The building has never been user-friendly. It was seen as a symbol of exclusion.''
 G.M. has removed the berm -- at a cost of $30 million -- and relocated its mechanical systems to the basement of the center. ''If you're going to play a catalyst role in the city,'' Mr. Cullen said, ''You can't have this physical barrier that agitates the heck out of everybody who sees it.'' 
 Inside the complex, the company has relocated the lobby of the 1,298-room Detroit Marriott Hotel at G.M.'s Renaissance Center to the third floor and smoothed out the circulation problems by installing a suspended glass walkway around the perimeter of the atrium. 
 ''The challenge,'' said Richard Tomlinson, managing partner of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, ''was making the public areas of the building more about G.M. and less about the hotel.''
 Probably the biggest change, however, is the creation of a 14,000-square-foot glass winter garden, which looks out on the river. 
 The winter garden also serves as the complex's new retail hub. The center has about 230,000 square feet of retail space. G.M. also controls another 78,000 square feet of retail space in several adjacent buildings. Together, it amounts to about half of the total retail space in downtown Detroit. The results at the center, however, have always been mixed. 
 The retail vacancy rate is about 30 percent and -- aside from Brooks Brothers, Jos. A. Bank, Waldenbooks and a few others -- there is a significant lack of major national stores. 
 Now, however, the company has brought in a new leasing agent -- the Houston-based Hines Interests -- and is introducing a new entertainment-driven strategy.
 Two white tablecloth restaurants recently opened and a third is on the way. One of the newly opened restaurants, Coach Insignia, occupies one of the well-known -- but long-empty -- restaurant spaces in Detroit: the two-level 21,000-square-foot space on top of the cylindrical hotel tower. The original restaurant revolved. Coach Insignia, named for a California vineyard owned by a member of the Fisher family of Fisher Body fame, is content with jaw-dropping but stationary views in all directions. 
 The restaurant is operated by the Unique Restaurant Corporation, a large independent restaurant and catering company based in suburban Detroit. ''We worked out a deal based on percentages,'' said Matthew Prentice, president of Unique Restaurant. ''If the costs get out of whack, the difference is borne by the landlord. But if it's a success, it's win-win on both sides.'' 
 In addition, a long shuttered four-screen movie theater complex will reopen early next year.
 ''Entertainment will bring people downtown,'' said Conrad Schwartz, G.M.'s worldwide director of asset management. ''Our goal is to make the city of Detroit believe that you can come down to the Renaissance Center for a delightful evening.'' 
 Local real estate executives agree. ''G.M. is putting more retail space on the market than there's been for a while,'' said James Bieri, president of the Bieri Company, a commercial real estate firm here. ''But they're doing it wisely. They're choosing who they go after and working with them carefully.''
 The office portion of the complex is also prospering. ''When we bought it,'' Mr. Cullen said, ''the building was probably 30 to 40 percent vacant. Today, it's essentially full.''
 G.M. occupies about 60 percent of the office space in the original complex. The rest is leased to a variety of tenants.
 All of this is raising hopes that downtown Detroit -- long on the sick list of American cities -- is set for a turnaround. ''The central business district has improved over the last three to five years,'' Mr. Littmann said. ''The biggest visible difference has been stability.''
 Mr. Bieri said: ''We're starting to talk to some national retail companies. Five years ago, they wouldn't take your call. Three years ago, they would take the call and then diss you. Now there's enough going on where they want to talk.'' 
 All of this is a precursor to more ambitious plans. Since the late 1990's, G.M. has acquired about 25 additional acres along the Detroit River just east of the center. Most of the land is vacant. Now, however, the company says it plans to redevelop the area into a mixed-use neighborhood that will include retail, residential and possibly additional office space. 
 ''We have a list of about 10 developers to whom we're talking,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''Hopefully, this year or early next year we will pick a partner. ''
 The project dovetails with the city's plan to build a three-and-a-half-mile walkway along the city's riverfront. The plan is being coordinated by the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, a nonprofit group; Mr. Cullen and Derrick A. Miller, the city's chief administrative officer, are co-chairmen of its board. 
 The estimated cost of the walkway is about $80 million, and most has already been raised through a series of grants and private initiatives. 
 ''A city is not successful,'' Mr. Cullen said, ''by having 10,000 G.M. folks drive in at 8 in the morning and out again at 5 in the afternoon.'' 
 ''We want to be a catalyst for economic development and to provide leadership for the renaissance of the city,'' he said. ''We want to bring in retailers and residential people. That's what we're trying to do at the Renaissance Center and in a much broader way along the riverfront.''

HEADLINE: Carmakers In for a Long Haul In Paying Retiree Health Care

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Ernest Pusey is older than General Motors. 
 At 109, he once helped build the Stovebolt Six, a heavy cast iron engine that propelled Chevrolets across America, but it has been nearly half a century since he retired from G.M. and moved to Florida. Today, he is one of 240 G.M. retirees or spouses over 100 years old. All of them are older than G.M. itself, which is four years from its centennial.
 So what's his secret? 
 ''As far as eating, I eat what I want,'' he said last week while preparing to tour a G.M. plant in Grand Blanc, Mich., near Flint, where his grandson Craig Pusey works. ''Never smoked, never drank very much.'' 
 For G.M., the nation's largest private purchaser of health services and of drugs from Viagra to Lipitor, the projected cost of providing health care benefits to current and future retirees like Mr. Pusey is a staggering $63 billion. 
 While soaring medical costs are an issue for all employers in the United States, for older domestic manufacturers the nation's health care system is a competitive double whammy. That is particularly true for G.M., the world's largest -- but far from the most profitable -- automaker. 
 G.M. covers the health care costs of 1.1 million Americans, or close to half a percent of the total population, though fewer than 200,000 are active workers while the rest are retirees, children or spouses. Not only are such costs escalating rapidly, but G.M.'s rivals, based in Japan and Germany, have virtually no retirees from their newer operations in the United States and, at home, the expenses are largely assumed by taxpayers through nationalized health care systems. 
 Toyota, the industry's most profitable automaker, employs 31,000 Americans and also faces rising health care costs, but not to any great extent for its retirees. So while G.M. faces a $63 billion bill for retiree health care in coming decades, Toyota said in its latest annual report that its retiree health care obligation was not even large enough to affect its profits significantly.
 ''To saddle the cash flow of American businesses with an obligation that other competitors do not have creates serious long-run disadvantages,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University economist specializing in health issues.
 ''They are basically social insurance systems,'' he said of the Big Three domestic automakers: G.M., Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler. ''Detroit is like a bunch of countries with older populations.'' 
 The United Automobile Workers union negotiated enviable pension and health benefits with the American automakers in an era in which the Big Three essentially made up the world's auto industry. Today, with global competition and the United States health care system putting the burden largely on employers, retiree medical costs are one reason Toyota's $10.2 billion profit in its most recent fiscal year was more than double the combined profit of the Big Three. 
 ''We're spending more on health care and less on the auto business, and frankly that does not work,'' said John Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer. ''A system that has it solely on the back of U.S. business I don't think is going to be sustainable.''
 G.M. offers hourly workers and retirees choices of H.M.O.'s, P.P.O.'s or the option of choosing their own doctor and it covers the majority of the costs, with Medicare picking up some of the bill for the retirees. In labor talks last year, the union agreed to increase co-payments for brand name prescription drugs to $10 from $5 for hourly workers and future retirees, though it did not raise co-payments for current retirees. Under the new Medicare legislation Congress passed last year, the government will pay 28 percent of the cost of prescription drugs.
 Mr. Pusey was born in 1895, the same year as Babe Ruth. He started at G.M. in 1926 after serving aboard the battleship Wyoming during World War I. When Mr. Pusey retired in 1958, G.M. dominated the American automobile landscape, selling more than half of the cars and trucks sold in the United States. 
 The biggest challenge for G.M. is not so much that people are living longer today, but that medical costs are going up so fast in an era of mega-marketed pharmaceuticals and big-ticket diagnostic tests. When Mr. Pusey retired, medical spending was about 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, compared with about 15 percent today. Average spending per person on hospital care alone is up to about $1,600 from the 1965 equivalent of $318 in today's currency. 
 For G.M., which earned $1.2 billion last year, annual health spending has risen to $4.8 billion from $3 billion since 1996, even as deaths and job cuts have trimmed its employee and retiree ranks and it has taken numerous steps to trim costs. The company also contributed another $3.3 billion last year to a retiree health care trust fund. Out of the total 1.1 million people it covers, G.M. currently pays health care expenses for 450,000 retirees and their spouses. 
 For Ford, which calculates its data further back, expenses have risen to $12,443 for every current or former worker, from about $500 in 1970, or $2,300 when adjusted for inflation. 
 Longevity costs money, because people living longer generally use medical care more intensively and the biggest expenses, which tend to be concentrated in the last few years of life, keep escalating. G.M.'s 240 members of the century club in themselves are not enough to balloon the overall costs of health care for G.M. Indeed, Mr. Devine said, ''If you live to be 100 years old, you tend to be in good shape.''
 But the nearly 13,000 retirees or spouses 90 or older and the nearly 87,000 in their 80's add up to huge health care expenses that will not go away anytime soon.
 Mr. Pusey is in remarkable shape. 
 ''He never took a pill until he was 100,'' said Dora Pusey, his daughter-in-law. ''Right now he's on something for his stomach, but he doesn't take many. Maybe four or five a day.'' 
 By comparison, at a retiree rally last year during labor negotiations, many 70-something former workers said they had a dozen prescriptions or more. 
 Mr. Pusey has outlived a son and two wives. He has 4 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. He likes to watch ''Jeopardy'' and ''Wheel of Fortune,'' he recently told a union newsletter. 
 His visit to Michigan last week was prompted by the hurricanes back home. On Thursday morning, he stepped out of his daughter-in-law's Buick and walked into G.M.'s Grand Blanc Metal Center, a 39-acre plant that produces hoods, fenders and doors. He is frail but needs no cane and hears well enough to field some questions from plant managers. 
 Ernest, when did you retire?
 ''Nineteen fifty-eight,'' he said. 
 The eyes of Willie Huddleston, a superintendent in the plant's maintenance department, widened. ''That was the year I was born,'' he said.
 Daniel Welton, the plant manager, unfolded a picture of Mr. Pusey and another G.M. retiree from a local newspaper.
 ''Who's the young gentleman with you?'' Mr. Welton asked; the other retiree was merely 100. 
 Mr. Devine, the G.M. executive, said people his age, in their late 50's and early 60's, were actually the most expensive group because they were not yet Medicare eligible and were often stepping up their use of health care. Unfortunately for G.M.'s bottom line, those age groups are the largest part of its population; it has more than 130,000 people ages 60 to 64. 
 In an op-ed article in The Detroit News last month, Senator John Kerry laid out proposals for three top industry concerns: He would have the federal government assume some of the soaring costs of covering catastrophic care; work to lower prescription drug costs by, among other things, allowing imports from Canada; and take steps to rein in medical malpractice. 
 ''Motor City has been especially hard hit,'' he wrote. ''Automakers are spending more on health care than they are on steel.'' 
 President Bush, on a campaign stop on Monday in Michigan, a battleground state in the election, called Mr. Kerry's broad health agenda ''a massive, complicated blueprint to have our government take over the decision-making in health care.''
 Mr. Bush instead has emphasized helping small businesses, proposing to let them pool resources to buy discounted insurance. He also wants to expand tax credits to encourage businesses and individuals to use personal health savings accounts. 
 Mr. Devine of G.M. declined to endorse either side but he is glad the issues are on the table. Union leaders strongly favor Mr. Kerry and his plan, though they would ultimately like the kind of nationalized health care system that appears to be a political nonstarter. 
 By no means is health care the American auto industry's only reason for its vulnerability. Detroit has lost a huge part of the market to its Asian competitors. Toyota has a reputation for consistent quality that has eluded the Big Three over the years; its manufacturing system is considered the industry's model of efficiency. Toyota and Honda have both aggressively pursued more fuel-efficient technologies as regulations tighten around the world. 
 But the health care spending gap does have ramifications for the nation's economy and energy policies, not to mention Midwestern job growth, because it takes billions of dollars out of the domestic industry's pocket each year that could be spent developing more efficient cars or paying for other efforts. 
 ''The fact that General Motors is using so much of its surplus cash flow to fund its retiree medical liabilities just underscores the significance of the problem,'' said Scott Sprinzen, a bond analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Mr. Pusey still buys G.M. cars, of course, his latest being a '98 Oldsmobile 88, a brand the company discontinued this year. 
 ''I have a lady that takes care of me and she drives the car,'' he explained. ''I've driven Oldsmobiles before and I like them. Of course they don't make them anymore. I drove a Chevrolet; I drove a Buick, Oldsmobile, different cars.''
 Last Thursday, while Mr. Pusey and his grandson Craig were meeting and greeting with plant managers before their tour, G.M. was almost ready to put its most senior man back to work. 
 ''Craig, we're hiring temps,'' said Randy Tuttle, an assistant plant manager. ''Is he interested?''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices and Worry Over Hurricane Keep Shares Flat

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended barely higher yesterday as oil prices rose and investors tried to anticipate the economic repercussions from Hurricane Ivan.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.40 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,318.16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 2.51 points, or 0.22 percent, at 1,128.33. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.02 points, or 0.26 percent, at 1,915.40. 
 Oil companies plucked thousands of workers from offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, home of about a quarter of United States oil and gas output, and shut down some production.
 ''The big talk today has obviously been Ivan, and what industries are going to be affected -- insurance, commerce, oil, whatever,'' said Brian Williamson, vice president for equity trading at the Boston Company Asset Management. ''Is it going to be distribution centers in Houston, or oil rigs in the gulf or direct hits in Louisiana, where there's a lot of commerce?''
 United States light crude oil rose 52 cents, to $44.39 a barrel. Crude futures were just $5 from a record high of $49.40 reached on Aug. 20. 
 Internet stocks rose on indications that third-quarter results might reach the high end of targets and because of a surprise increase in August online retail sales. Ask Jeeves rose $3.46, or 12.8 percent, to $30.46; Yahoo climbed $1.33, or 4.2 percent, to $33.20; Amazon.com gained $2.66, or 6.6 percent, to $42.67; eBay was up $2.31, or 2.5 percent, at $94.41; and Google rose $3.99, or 3.7 percent, to $111.49.
 Shares in McDonald's were up 43 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $27.60 after the company raised its annual dividend 38 percent.
 Allied Waste Industries fell 94 cents, or 9.2 percent, to $9.30 after it cut its 2004 earnings forecast for the second time in three months.
 Shares in Office Depot fell $1.10, or 6.8 percent, to $15.10, after it said that its third-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of Wall Street estimates because of disruptions from two earlier hurricanes.
 Shares of Kmart Holdings rose after UBS raised its price target on the company to $101 a share from $85. The stock gained $3.66, or 4.3 percent, to $89.
 Shares of Kroger, the No.1 American grocer, fell 72 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $15.98, after it posted a lower quarterly profit than in the year-earlier period.
 In economic news, retail sales fell 0.3 percent in August -- more than the 0.1 percent drop that Wall Street analysts had projected -- but sales excluding autos rose 0.2 percent, matching expectations.
 ''Over all, the data lend support to our forecast that consumption has rebounded in the third quarter,'' UBS wrote in a research note.
 Oracle, the software company, fell 7 cents, to $10.55, in regular trading. After the market's close, it reported higher quarterly profit, and its shares rose in after-hours trading.
 The price of Treasury securities rose. The benchmark 10-year note was at 101, up 3/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.13 percent, from 4.14 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Jamaican Economy Grows, Despite Storm

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
As Hurricane Ivan approached Jamaica last week, government and business leaders worried that the country's fragile economic recovery would be knocked into a tailspin.
 But while at least 15 people died in the storm over the weekend, damage was generally lighter than expected. The vital tourism business and the country's second-largest industry, bauxite mining, seem to have been barely touched.
 ''We're going to come out of this really nicely,'' said Garfield Sinclair, the president and chief operating officer of the investment bank Dehring, Bunting & Golding Ltd. in Kingston.
 Economists said that aid from the United States and other countries, which had already started to flow, and payments from insurance companies to cover some of the hurricane damage would give Jamaica a lift. They said they also expected Jamaicans living abroad to increase the money they send home -- already the country's biggest source of income at $1.13 billion a year. 
 The last big storm to hit Jamaica, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, united the island's citizens, economists said, and the result was greater productivity. ''People tend to pull together and work twice as hard after a hurricane,'' Mr. Sinclair said.
 Economists said they were encouraged by developments in Jamaica but cautioned that nothing could be taken for granted in a country that for most of the 1990's had little or no growth, saddled itself with enormous debt and three years ago suffered a serious setback as vacationers curtailed air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It will take careful management and a bit of luck, they said, for the recovery that resumed last year to stay on course. 
 Hurricane Ivan, one of the most powerful storms to rise out of the Atlantic this year, charged toward Jamaica last Friday with wind speeds of up to 155 miles an hour. But the hurricane veered westerly and took a much less destructive path south of Jamaica, battering Kingston, the capital, and towns and villages along the southern coast, ripping off roofs, knocking down power lines and flooding homes and streets.
 Heavy damage was reported in a few pockets of the country. But the heart of Jamaica's tourist business along the north coast was spared the worst of the storm. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said in an interview on Monday that he was waiting for assessments from around the country before issuing an estimate on total losses from the hurricane. 
 Tourism in particular seems to be coming back quickly. As the tailwinds of the hurricane were still lashing the western part of the island on Sunday, the airport in Montego Bay, Jamaica's main tourist gateway on the north coast, reopened. The air-conditioning at the airport was a little spotty, government officials said, but on Monday the airport welcomed several hundred vacationers from Europe and the United States, and planes once again began flying from the international airport here in the capital. 
 ''Within two weeks all the hotels on the north coast will be fully functional,'' said Godfrey G. Dyer, the president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourism Association and the owner of a small hotel in Montego Bay. ''We thought the hurricane was going to be devastating. But it turns out to be not bad at all.'' 
 In the months before Hurricane Ivan, earnings from tourism were about 10 percent above those in 2003. That year was the country's best ever, with earnings estimated at $1.07 billion. Mr. Dyer said that short-term growth would probably slow as a result of the hurricane but that earnings for the year would still probably set another record.
 Business investment may also be stepping up. Spanish hotel companies agreed this year to build four hotels on the north coast, adding 5,000 rooms to the 20,000 that Jamaica now offers.
 Moreover, American and Canadian investors pledged to spend $1 billion in Jamaica's bauxite industry. For the last few years, China has had a voracious appetite for bauxite, the raw material for aluminum. Prices have jumped and Jamaica has been stepping up production. 
 In an interview at Jamaica House, the headquarters for the government, Omar Davies, the finance minister, said that even with the effects of Hurricane Ivan, the chances were good that the country's roughly $8 billion economy would grow at the anticipated 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year, up from 2.1 percent in 2003. 
 For all its tropical allure and the reputation of its 2.7 million people for industriousness, Jamaica has often been bypassed by foreign investors. One reason has been violent crime, several government officials and independent economists said. Most of the violence has been among gangs of Jamaicans aligned with the major political parties or involved in shipping cocaine from Latin America and home-grown marijuana to the United States and Europe.
 But sometimes tourists have been robbed or killed and businesses have been forced to pay protection money. ''The cost of doing business here includes private security,'' Mr. Sinclair said. 
 In the early 1990's, Jamaica suffered runaway inflation, with prices rising at one time by 80 percent a year. To curb the inflation, the central bank raised interest rates, making it costly for individuals and businesses to borrow. The inflation rate dropped sharply, though it is still more than 10 percent.
 But Jamaica's banks began to experience trouble. To attract deposits that they could lend at a profit, many agreed to pay high interest rates on certificates of deposit of several years. As inflation and interest rates fell, the banks still had to pay the higher rates. But earnings on new loans were lower, creating an income gap that eventually bankrupted some lenders. Government officials said corruption and poor management led to more bank failures. 
 The government cushioned the losses to depositors with borrowed money that added to an already large debt that for years had been hobbling growth. Jamaica now owes $11.6 billion, and spends a staggering 65 percent of its annual revenue of about $400 million to pay interest.
 Jamaica's economy began to pick up in 2001 with modest growth of 1.5 percent. But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks led many Americans to avoid flying, and tourism in Jamaica fell 10 percent, reducing growth in 2002 to 1.1 percent. 
 The economy started coming back last year, and growth in the first quarter of 2004 was 2.4 percent. The government has been limiting spending to try to curtail borrowing. But with expenses caused by the hurricane, the government is facing the prospect of cutting back on two big projects -- building a four-lane highway from Kingston to the north coast and improving the north coast highway. Both are regarded as fundamentals for future economic growth.
 ''The overall picture for the economy is that we're going to have a temporary setback,'' said Mr. Dyer. ''But I think everything is going to move forward and the country's plans will not vary too much.''
 Peter Moses, who is in charge of Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, in Jamaica, said the economy was likely to rebound faster after Hurricane Ivan than after Hurricane Gilbert 16 years ago. 
 ''I'm optimistic,'' he said. ''But if tourism takes too long to get back on track and if some of the infrastructure projects get delayed, we could lose our momentum. Our key economic ingredients have to come back up to speed quickly for the hurricane not to have a medium- or longer-term negative impact.''

HEADLINE: Seeing Threat to Iraq Elections, U.S. Seeks to Shift Rebuilding Funds to Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Tuesday that it would shift nearly 20 percent of its aid budget for Iraq out of reconstruction projects and into security and short-term job-creation programs, acknowledging that continued violence threatened its plans for elections early next year.
 The State Department said it would ask Congress to take $3.46 billion out of the $18.4 billion aid package that President Bush signed into law last November and authorize its use to speed the training of Iraqi security and police personnel, create temporary public works programs and take other steps to help stabilize the country. Officials said the money would come mainly from allocations to build water and sewer systems and repair and modernize the electricity system.
 ''The security situation presents the most serious obstacle to reconstruction and economic and political development in Iraq,'' said Marc Grossman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, who said the decision was made after consultations with American military commanders and the Iraqi government. 
 ''They decided that without a significant reallocation of resources to the security and law enforcement sectors, the short-term stability of Iraq would be compromised and the longer-term prospects for a free and democratic Iraq undermined,'' Mr. Grossman said at a news conference.
 The announcement came on a day when attacks by insurgents left dozens of Iraqis dead, many of them police recruits or officers, underscoring the difficulties and dangers of trying to shift all responsibility for security to the Iraqis. Saboteurs also temporarily knocked out much of the nation's electricity supply through an attack on an oil pipeline. 
 Democrats said the change was evidence that the administration was grasping for solutions to a situation that was not getting any better.
 The announcement ''is an acknowledgment that the current situation in Iraq represents a failure of the administration's plan to bring stability and democracy to Iraq,'' Rep. Nita M. Lowey of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, said in a statement.
 Noting that the United States has spent only about $1 billion of the $18.4 billion aid package so far while the costs of the war are running billions of dollars a month, she added: ''This has not gotten results. Right now, violence is rampant, many Iraqis live without basic services, and we have failed to turn Iraqi public opinion in our favor.''
 But the administration's package appeared likely to win the backing of the Republican-controlled Congress. Rep. Jim Kolbe, the Republican from Arizona who is chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee, backed the proposal. He said that it was unclear whether the money could make a difference quickly enough to ensure that elections go ahead as planned, but that the United States had to recognize that it was facing a different situation from what it had assumed when it drew up reconstruction plans last year.
 ''The most important thing is that it clearly represents a shift that reflects the reality of what we're dealing with today,'' Mr. Kolbe said in an interview.
 The plan was drawn up by John D. Negroponte, the United States ambassador to Iraq. It would decrease the budget for water and sewer projects by $1.935 billion, electricity projects by $1.074 billion and purchases of refined oil by $450 million.
 Those reductions would go to offset a $1.8 billion increase in spending on law enforcement and security. Among other programs that would get more money are several intended to create jobs. Iraq's official unemployment rate is 28 percent. 
 The administration is also requesting that Congress allocate $360 million to wipe from the books Iraq's debts to the United States, which total $4.4 billion but have been largely written off. It also asked for $450 million to invest in Iraq's oil production capacity, with a target of increasing production by 650,000 barrels per day within 10 months.
 Mr. Grossman said the money would ultimately help train 45,000 new Iraqi police officers and 16,000 new border control officers, plus a substantial number of additional Iraqi national guardsmen. Robin Raphel, the department's coordinator for Iraq assistance, said that in the short run the money would help increase capacity at police training academies to 5,300 per month from 2,300. She said the Iraqi police force now numbers 82,000.
 The officials said that there was still plenty of money available for rebuilding projects in the long run, but that the immediate focus had to be on creating conditions that would allow elections to proceed as planned.

HEADLINE: Taxes for an Ownership Society

 BODY:
When President Bush talks about an ''ownership society,'' hold on to your wallet. The slogan, like ''compassionate conservative'' before it, is sufficiently vague to mean many things to many people, and the few details that Mr. Bush has provided -- encouraging more home ownership and offering new tax-sheltered savings plans -- seem innocuous enough. But in tax terms, ''ownership society'' means only one thing: the further reduction, if not the elimination, of taxes on savings and investments, including taxes on dividends and on capital gains on stocks, bonds and real estate. That, in turn, means, by definition, a shift in the tax burden onto wages and salaries -- or, put more simply, a wage tax.
 The regressive results would be appalling. The richest 1 percent of Americans earn just about one-tenth of total wages and salaries, but almost half of all income from savings and investments -- income that would be largely, perhaps entirely, untaxed in an ''ownership society.'' In contrast, taxable wages and salaries make up almost all of the income of most Americans. 
 The Bush camp has been floating the idea that what the president is getting at is a consumption tax. But the administration is not talking about a true consumption tax, which would apply to spending regardless of where the money comes from -- from your paycheck, cashing in your stocks and bonds, selling your house, or borrowing. It is, in effect, talking about a tax on wages. 
 Properly understood, a consumption tax is intended to increase national savings by making it relatively more attractive to save than to spend. The main argument against it is that it hits hardest at low-income and middle-income families, who tend to spend most of what they earn. But as Peter Orszag, an economist at the Brookings Institution, pointed out in a recent speech at Georgetown University, Mr. Bush's de facto wage tax would be the worst of all worlds: it would have all the regressive aspects of a consumption tax and none of its potential for increasing national savings. 
 When Mr. Bush talks about new tax-favored savings accounts, he never mentions that most people don't even take full advantage of existing plans. They won't be turned into ''owners'' by new tax breaks for interest, dividends and capital gains. To increase Americans' financial stake requires a strong economy in which people who work for a living share in the benefits of growth. 
 A good place to start would be to tackle the obstacles to sustained growth that currently exist, like spiraling health care costs, dependence on foreign oil and the administration's mania for unaffordable tax cuts -- in short, to reverse, not intensify, the trends in the current economy. 
 In the past nearly three years of economic recovery, the distribution of economic growth has become more skewed than at any other time in modern memory. Currently, 47 percent of growth is flowing to corporate profits, by far the largest share than that in any of the other eight post-World War II recoveries. Fifteen percent goes to wages and salaries, the smallest share of economic growth in more than 50 years. To make matters worse, the share of compensation that is devoted to health and pension benefits is far larger during this recovery than in any other, representing a further squeeze on the wages and salaries of ordinary Americans. In 2004, take-home pay as a share of the economy dropped to its lowest level since 1929, when the government started keeping records. 
 All of this would make the drive for a wage tax laughable, if only it were a joke. And yet, when he says ''ownership society,'' a wage tax is exactly what Mr. Bush is driving at.

HEADLINE: Known for Comebacks in Capital, Barry Does It Again

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The television cameras were rolling, giddy voters were rejoicing and a city bus stopped in its tracks on Wednesday as a jostling crowd in the poorest corner of the nation's capital scrambled for a glimpse of the unlikely star of the moment. And there, in the middle of it all, was Marion S. Barry Jr., shaking hands, slapping backs and savoring yet another improbable political comeback.
 Mr. Barry, the former Washington mayor whose political career was tarnished by his arrest and conviction on a drug possession charge in 1990, was celebrating his startling victory in a fiercely contested primary race for City Council. His underdog campaign had so little money and so little support from the political establishment that even his own pastor endorsed Mr. Barry's major opponent. Weakened by diabetes and high blood pressure, he often looked gaunt and frail as he sought votes to revive his dormant career. 
 But on Wednesday, Mr. Barry, 68, was gleeful and defiant as he celebrated his return to political life. He broke into song on a busy street corner, crooning, ''Victory is mine!'' and declared that the concerns of this city's poor and neglected would now take center stage, promising to oppose city plans for a publicly financed baseball stadium and investment that focuses solely on revitalizing downtown Washington.
 ''Get ready,'' Mr. Barry told his joyous supporters. ''I'm back!''
 Mr. Barry's victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary -- which is typically tantamount to victory in this overwhelmingly Democratic city's general elections -- marks the return of one of the city's most colorful and controversial politicians. But it also reflects the widening dissatisfaction among poor and working people here who feel untouched -- and often adversely affected -- by the economic renaissance in the nation's capital in recent years.
 Mr. Barry was one of three insurgent candidates who ousted incumbents in the Democratic primary races for City Council. The victors differed in style, but all three rode similar waves of discontent and delivered similar warnings to the political establishment: The city's poorer residents -- who are predominantly black -- will no longer be overlooked in the drive for economic development in Washington.
 Contenders in the City Council races generally acknowledged that important progress had been made in recent years under the current mayor, Anthony Williams, a politician known more for competence than charisma. Murder rates are declining, property values are soaring, fiscal accountability is improving and big retailers and people are moving back to a city once viewed as a pariah. But disparities in incomes have widened in recent years, census data show, and many poor people feel increasingly left behind.
 In the 1990's, the average income for the top fifth of households here grew 36 percent during this period, adjusting for inflation, while the average income of the bottom fifth of households rose just 3 percent, according to a census analysis by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute.
 ''They don't see the progress, and I don't see it either,'' Mr. Barry said of his supporters as he stood outside his worn campaign headquarters in an impoverished neighborhood across the muddy Anacostia River from the capital's thriving downtown.
 ''I want baseball, but not downtown and not with one cent of taxpayer dollars,'' he said. ''Unemployment is going up. Jobs are being cut and you want to spend taxpayers' dollars for a stadium? Give me a break.''
 Political analysts say the victories may slow the pace of large-scale economic projects that are viewed as having little impact on those voters. Public financing for a new baseball stadium, for instance, is likely to get much greater scrutiny as the new members of the 13-member City Council insist that public money would be better spent on programs intended to produce more affordable housing, jobs and better health care. 
 ''Poor and working people see an economic development renaissance happening in every part of the city, but east of the river,'' said Jonetta Rose Barras, a local political commentator and the author of the ''The Last of the Black Emperors: The Hollow Comeback of Marion Barry in a New Age of Black Leaders.'' ''They see downtown retail shops, new hotels, new jobs. They're not getting that. People are concerned about the Manhattanization of this city and being pushed out.''
 Kwame Brown, the 33-year-old candidate who ousted another incumbent, echoed those concerns. ''It clearly seems as though people in the neighborhoods didn't have a voice and someone representing their interests,'' Mr. Brown said. ''They really respected where the city was going, but they felt they weren't a part of it.''
 On the impoverished streets of Anacostia, Patricia Reed, a 52-year-old cook, said she had voted for the incumbent in the race, Sandy Allen, in the last election. But she said Ms. Allen had forgotten about the needs of poor people in her ward.
 ''On this side of town, he gets the job done,'' Ms. Reed said of Mr. Barry. ''If you have a problem, he will fix it. If you need the streetlights fixed, he gets that done. He's always been there. He's always stood up for us.'' 
 Some local politicians have worried publicly that Mr. Barry's election might harm the city's improving image. And in the eyes of some voters here, black and white, he still epitomizes the worst of local politics.
 Mr. Barry, one of the city's most influential politicians, shaped much of the nation's capital during its economic rise and fall in his first three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1990. But he served six months in prison for drug possession and his fourth term as mayor, which lasted from 1994 to 1998, was marked by huge deficits and dysfunctional agencies.
 In 1995, the Republican-controlled Congress created a board that assumed all meaningful authority over the city and left Mr. Barry as little more than a bit player. He retired from public service as mayor in 1998. In 2002, his bid for a seat on the City Council ended after the United States Park Police reported finding small amounts of crack cocaine and marijuana in his illegally parked car.
 No charges were filed and Mr. Barry, who has been working as an investment banker, said he was framed by the police. 
 In an interview in his campaign office on Wednesday, he was clearly delighted to have defied the expectations of critics who doubted he could ever return to political life.
 ''All those pundits and armchair politicians don't know this ward,'' Mr. Barry said. ''People want some action, they don't want this status quo, this go-along, get-along and don't push for things we need out here.''

PERSON: Aaron Director

HEADLINE: Aaron Director, Economist, Dies at 102

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Aaron Director, an economist whose rigorous free-market analysis profoundly influenced approaches to antitrust law, died on Saturday at his home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. He was 102.
 His death was announced by the University of Chicago, where he taught for two decades and imbued a generation of some of the nation's most influential economic and legal scholars with startling new ways to view public issues, particularly antitrust policy, through an economic lens. Milton Friedman, Dr. Director's brother-in-law and his longtime colleague, said in an interview yesterday that his achievement was ''to apply economic analysis to the kind of issues that had been treated on the basis of supposed common sense before.'' 
 In particular, Dr. Friedman cited a study published by John S. McGee in 1958 that was specifically intended to prove Dr. Director's thesis that would-be monopolists always prefer merger to predatory pricing. The paper is widely believed to prove that the government's 1911 breakup of the Standard Oil trust as a monopolistic combination hurt rather than benefited consumers because prices of oil products were actually lower under the efficiencies the trust created. 
 Antitrust laws restrict business practices considered unfair or monopolistic, like conspiring to fix prices, and courts have considerable latitude in determining both violations of the laws and appropriate remedies. Dr. Director's contribution was to apply statistics and price theory to judicial thinking.
 Robert H. Bork, who was a student of Dr. Director and later a judge and antitrust expert, said Dr. Director was ''the first one anywhere to question the economics of antitrust as the courts developed it.''
 On a personal level, Dr. Bork said in an interview, ''Aaron gradually destroyed my dreams of socialism with price theory.''
 Dr. Director's conservatism was such that he called Dr. Friedman, long a revered guru to conservative intellectuals, ''my radical brother-in-law.''
 In an interview, Kenneth E. Scott, a professor emeritus at Stanford Law School, said that Dr. Director's contribution was to refocus antitrust law to make it serve the interests of consumers, not the interests of competing companies. Dr. Bork said that, practically, this meant that big is not necessarily bad. 
 In 1958, Dr. Director magnified his influence by founding The Journal of Law and Economics, which spread his ideas to courthouses and law schools; both institutions now routinely employ economists.
 A central idea of law and economics is to promote efficiency, not equitable distribution, making results, not actions, the criteria for legal judgments. From the field of antitrust, what its adherents call a ''movement'' has expanded to most legal arenas and beyond.
 ''Feminists, in recent years, have picked up the law-and-economics ball and run with it,'' said Richard A. Posner, the judge and legal scholar who developed some of his novel ideas in talks with Dr. Director. For example, in Reason magazine in 2001, he explained that giving a monetary value to domestic work can support feminist arguments for greater equity.
 Dr. Director was born in what is now Ukraine in 1901, according to the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law. When he was 12 or 13, his family moved to Oregon, where his father was a peddler and later opened a store.
 A representative from Yale came to Portland to recruit students, and he and a friend, the painter Mark Rothko, applied. At Yale, the two published a cheeky leftist newspaper called Yale Saturday Evening Pest.
 After graduating, Mr. Director took jobs he thought appropriate for a young socialist, from working in a coal mine to picking fruit. He took a cattle boat to England and taught labor history at a union school in Oregon. In 1927, he went to the University of Chicago to study labor economics with Paul Douglas, later a Democratic senator from Illinois.
 In 1930, he began a four-year stint as an instructor at the university. The department was then ruled by Frank H. Knight and Jacob Viner, who together elevated the University of Chicago to economics' highest tier, along with Harvard and the London School of Economics.
 Henry C. Simons, sometimes called the true progenitor of the Chicago School, that beehive of brilliant and conservative economists that included Dr. Friedman and George Stigler, was a close friend. Dr. Simons did pioneering work in applying economics to tax law.
 Dr. Director invited his sister Rose, who had studied economics for two years at Reed College in Portland, to move to Chicago. In 1932, she took Dr. Viner's course. So did Mr. Friedman. Dr. Viner seated students in alphabetical order, and they sat next to each other. Things proceeded, and they eventually married.
 Dr. Director worked in Washington for the American Youth Commission during World War II. After the war, he persuaded the University of Chicago Press to publish ''The Road to Serfdom,'' by Friedrich von Hayek, a seminal work on the dangers of state control.
 In 1946, Dr. Director was appointed a professor at the University of Chicago's Law School. Edward H. Levi, a professor who would later be attorney general of the United States, asked him to help him teach his antitrust course. Dr. Levi lectured four days, with Dr. Director handling the fifth. 
 ''Aaron Director would tell us that everything Levi told us the preceding four days was nonsense,'' E. Kitch wrote in The Journal of Law and Economics in 1983. ''He used economic analysis to show us the legal analysis simply would not stand up.''
 Around 1960, Dr. Director was host at a dinner at his home for Ronald H. Coase to discuss a new theory on the inefficiency of governmental intervention. The discussion began with 20 of 21 people opposing what quickly came to be called the Coase Theorem, the basis for Dr. Coase's Nobel Prize. At the dinner's end, all 21 endorsed the paper.
 Dr. Director moved to California in 1965 and joined the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Dr. Director's only immediate survivor is his sister, Rose Director Friedman, who lives in San Francisco.
 Dr. Director wrote two books, both published in 1931: ''The Problem of Unemployment,'' written with Mr. Douglas, and ''Unemployment.'' Dr. Friedman suggested a reason his brother-in-law did not write more: ''He had a sense of perfection.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 20, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Thursday about Aaron Director, an economist who applied free-market analysis to antitrust law, misstated the timing of Friedrich von Hayek's ''Road to Serfdom,'' which Dr. Director persuaded the University of Chicago Press to publish. It came out in 1944, not after World War II.

HEADLINE: Industrial Growth Missed Forecast in August

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Growth in industrial output nearly stalled last month as production cuts at mines and utilities almost outweighed a strong performance at factories, a report from the Federal Reserve showed on Wednesday.
 Production at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent last month, the Fed's report showed, compared with Wall Street forecasts for a 0.5 percent gain.
 Economists said big declines in electricity output as a result of an unusually cool summer masked underlying industrial strength. They said a rebound was likely when a more normal seasonal pattern returned. 
 ''The overall number was a little bit disappointing, but the manufacturing side of things looked pretty good,'' said L. Douglas Lee, president of Economics From Washington.
 August's weak output growth kept the nation's industry operating at 77.3 percent of capacity, the same as July and well shy of levels that would raise concerns about inflation. Economists had expected the use rate to rise to 77.4 percent.
 Helping take the sting out of the disappointing August output figures were an upward revision for July -- to a gain of 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent -- and a solid, if slower, rise in factory production. Manufacturing accounts for more than four-fifths of industrial output.
 Manufacturing production grew 0.5 percent in August after an upwardly revised increase of 0.9 percent in July. The revisions showed that the industrial sector, which bottomed out in December 2001, had completed by July a slow crawl back to its previous peak.
 With production up in August, factories operated at 76.8 percent of capacity, the highest rate since March 2001.
 An increase in automobile production, which pushed the vehicle assembly rate to an annualized 12.03 million units from July's 11.51 million, accounted for much of the August factory strength. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial output would have dropped 0.1 percent.
 The other two industrial areas, mining and utilities, both contracted in August. Mining production fell 1.1 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in July, while utility output fell 2.4 percent, the third consecutive monthly decline. 
 A separate report on Wednesday showed that United States business inventories climbed 0.9 percent in July, a gain that was slightly greater than expected and one that built on an upwardly revised 1.1 percent June increase.
 The two-month performance was the biggest increase in stockpiles in nearly five years, the Commerce Department said.
 The inventories-to-sales ratio, which measures the number of months it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales rate, advanced to 1.32 months in July from 1.31 months in June.

HEADLINE: Markets Help Endowment Pass $22 Billion at Harvard

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Harvard's giant endowment, by far the largest of any university's, grew further in the last fiscal year, reaching $22.6 billion by June 30 with the help of a 21.1 percent return on its investments, the Harvard Management Company says.
 In June 2003, by comparison, the endowment was at $19.3 billion.
 Although many universities have not reported their final investment returns for the fiscal year ended in June, Harvard's are expected to be among the highest.
 In a letter Tuesday to the Harvard community, Jack R. Meyer, president and chief executive of the management company, which is wholly owned by the university and invests its assets, said preliminary numbers for the 25 universities with the largest endowments showed that half had earned returns of at least 17.1 percent in the latest year. These universities typically enjoy somewhat higher investment returns than other colleges and universities. 
 It is too early to say whether the strong results at Harvard will quiet any of the criticism that it pays its money managers too much. Last year Harvard reported that two of them had earned about $35 million each in the previous fiscal year and that Mr. Meyer had earned $6.9 million. Some Harvard alumni have said they will withhold contributions to the university if the compensation plan is not changed, and Harvard officials have said they will study the issue.
 At other top universities, money managers rarely earn as much as $1 million. But some of those money managers noted yesterday that Harvard was unusual in the extent to which it directly invests its own assets, rather than simply overseeing investment portfolios that it farms out to independent managers. They said Harvard's high compensation reflected Wall Street patterns and the university's sophisticated money management. 
 ''I admit that it creates a good deal of tension for the university,'' Mr. Meyer said of the issue in a telephone interview last night. ''But I'm confident that it is a good deal for Harvard.
 ''The problem could easily be solved by spinning out all of our internal fund managers. But if that happened, our fees would go up, our investment results would go down.''
 He said that if the compensation that each similar university paid to all its outside managers was added up, it would make the payments to Harvard's managers ''diminish to nothing'' by comparison.
 Among universities that have released their preliminary investment performance for the 12 months ended in June, the University of Pennsylvania says that it earned 16.8 percent and that its endowment reached $4 billion. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology says it earned 18.1 percent, which helped push its endowment to $6 billion. Stanford earned 18 percent, and its endowment reached $10 billion. Cornell's return was 16.1 percent, and its endowment grew to $3.8 billion.
 At Williams, which has one of the largest endowments among liberal arts colleges, the return was 17.8 percent, and the endowment climbed to $1.3 billion. Swarthmore earned a return of 18.6 percent and saw its endowment grow to $1.1 billion.
 ''We had a very good year,'' said Suzanne P. Welsh, treasurer and vice president for finance at Swarthmore.
 ''But the past fiscal year,'' she said, ''is really just making up for returns we hadn't been getting since 2000,'' when the financial markets peaked.
 Year-to-year endowment growth results from several factors: how much an institution spends from its endowment (typically about 5 percent of the total), how much it receives in gifts to the endowment, and the investment return.
 Ronald G. Ehrenberg, a Cornell economist who studies higher education, said that while he expected many colleges and universities to report strong investment gains because of the uptick in the markets during the last year, ''many institutions, including my own, still have not seen their endowments grow back to where they were at the peak of the market four years ago.''
 Dr. Ehrenberg said he expected the good investment returns at the universities with the largest endowments to widen further the gap between them and other institutions.
 Mr. Meyer's letter to the Harvard community noted that the university's highest investment returns last year were in stocks: domestic equities (22.8 percent), as well as foreign equities and emerging markets (each more than 36 percent).
 But, his letter warned, ''the cloud in this silver lining is that we don't expect the good times to persist.''
 ''We do not want to cut short the celebration of fiscal 2004 results,'' he added, ''but we should not get accustomed to these outsized returns.''

HEADLINE: The commercial resilience of New York is clear three years after the 9/11 attacks.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@Princeton.edu.

 BODY:
THREE years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, economists have pieced together a reasonably good picture of their effect on New York City's economy. That picture is one of remarkable resilience. 
 In the most comprehensive analysis so far, a team of researchers organized by the Russell Sage Foundation has found that although the attacks were undoubtedly an economic setback and, needless to say, a tragedy for thousands of families, they did not fundamentally knock the city's economy off track. 
 Shortly after the attacks, many analysts predicted that New York would suffer a long economic decline because the fear of future attacks would cause businesses and residents to flee, or because the destruction of office space inhabited by prized companies in Lower Manhattan would cause those and other companies to move to cheaper locales outside the city. 
 Instead, the way the economy coped is a tribute to human ingenuity in the face of adversity. The relocation decisions of businesses also tell much about why cities exist in the first place. 
 The task for researchers is to compare trends in employment, property values and other economic indicators with a credible estimate of what those trends would have been in the absence of the attacks -- that is, to compare the actual to the ''counterfactual'' outcome. 
 Establishing a convincing counterfactual scenario is particularly difficult in this case because the attacks occurred just after a recession had begun (in March 2001, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research) and the stock market had turned down. These developments would have caused New York's economy to deteriorate after Sept. 11 even if the attacks had been thwarted. 
 To estimate the effects of the attacks, economists have compared New York's performance before and after Sept. 11 with its performance in past recessions, with the performance of the rest of the nation before and after Sept. 11, and with the experience of other large cities. A similar picture emerges from all these comparisons, raising one's confidence in the conclusions. 
 First consider commercial real estate, which the attacks affected directly. The destruction of the World Trade Center and damage to surrounding buildings rendered 10 percent of New York City's prime commercial space -- and 60 percent of the downtown area's prime space -- at least temporarily uninhabitable. 
 Other things being equal, this supply shift would be expected to drive prices up. But if companies were discouraged from locating in the city because of the attacks, demand for commercial real estate would simultaneously have fallen, putting downward pressure on prices and rents. 
 Andy Haughwout, an economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, found that, after initially dipping, the price of office buildings in Lower Manhattan relative to the nation as a whole has increased slightly in the three years since Sept. 11. Prices in Midtown, by contrast, increased sharply in the months after Sept. 11. He said there was no sign of a significant drop in demand for a New York address. 
 Relatively little residential real estate was destroyed. Thus, the supply of residential real estate was unaffected in the short run, and prices would be expected to drop if New York became viewed as a less desirable place to live. Again, there is no sign that the appeal of New York suffered. In the three years before Sept. 11, prices in the New York area rose faster than in the nation as a whole, and they have continued to rise at about the same pace in the three years afterward. 
 Some 80 percent of the businesses that were based in the World Trade Center relocated elsewhere in Manhattan or returned to restored buildings after the attacks; most of the rest went to New Jersey. The migration to Midtown and the New Jersey waterfront hastened a trend that had already been in motion: even before the attacks, the downtown business area was in the process of becoming more of a residential center. 
 Franz Fuerst of the City University of New York discovered another fascinating pattern: businesses tended to relocate in areas where other businesses in their line of work were already clustered. 
 For example, most of the architectural firms that were displaced from the World Trade Center relocated in the same area between 14th and Canal Streets, already home to the highest concentration of architects in Manhattan. 
 Economists have long wondered why companies in the same industry locate near one another. Geographic agglomeration, the defining characteristic of cities, is hard to explain in a world with low transportation and communication costs. The tragic events of Sept. 11 suggest that information spillovers -- in production methods and knowledge about the suitability and availability of office space -- as well as similarity in business requirements are responsible for agglomeration effects, even over a very short period. 
 Mr. Fuerst also found that businesses often used space that they had available but that was not listed as vacant, like basements that could be put to better purposes. Substitution of resources is an underappreciated response to economic shocks -- including hurricanes and terrorist attacks -- that helps to limit the damage. 
 There is little evidence that New Yorkers overreacted to the tragedy. Indeed, only a slight sign of apprehension can be detected from the pattern of vacancy rates. Before Sept. 11, the vacancy rate for buildings with 50 or more stories moved in tandem with that for other buildings. Since the middle of 2002, however, the vacancy rate in tall buildings increased by a few percentage points more than the rate for all buildings in Manhattan. 
 Employment mirrored business location. The number of jobs fell in the recession, but studies have found that after an initial sharp drop, the loss of employment in New York after Sept. 11 was not noticeably different from what it was in other major cities. Cordelia Reimers of Hunter College concluded, ''The ongoing recession had a much more negative impact than 9/11 on New York City's workers.'' 
 Although President Bush and his administration frequently point to the terrorist attacks as a reason for the economic downturn, the evidence suggests that the recession hurt the economy in New York and the rest of the country much more. This conclusion should be viewed as an important victory in the war against terrorism, as the terrorists sought to disrupt the American economy and largely failed.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline, Pulled Down by Reduced Profit Forecasts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares dropped yesterday after the Coca-Cola Company and Xilinx Inc., the world's biggest producer of programmable semiconductors, said that results would miss estimates, continuing a trend of reduced forecasts for the third quarter. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest decline in a month, shedding 86.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,231.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.96 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,120.37. The decline, the largest this month, ended four days of advances. The Nasdaq composite index fell 18.88 points, or 1 percent, to 1,896.52. 
 The Russell 2000 index, which tracks companies with a median market value of about $472 million, lost 2.44, or 0.4 percent, to 568.52.
 ''Built into the market is a very optimistic profit scenario,'' said Doug Cliggott, a strategist for Brummer & Partners, which manages $3.5 billion in New York. ''Our guess is we will come in well below that.'' 
 Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.3 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 11 percent less than the daily average this year. 
 United States companies' quarterly profit forecasts are trailing estimates at the highest rate in three years. Of the 173 United States companies that have given previews of third-quarter results, 105, or 61 percent, said earnings would be less than expected. 
 Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink maker, fell $1.71, to $41.16. Second-half earnings will be 77 cents to 82 cents a share, the company said. Coca-Cola was expected to earn 99 cents, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Shares of Xilinx fell $1.54, to $27.50. The company said sales for the second quarter would miss forecasts because customers have too much inventory. A gauge of chip and chip-equipment makers fell 2.5 percent, the most among 24 industry groups in the S.&P. 500. Celestica Inc., the world's fourth-biggest maker of electronics for other companies, lost $1.97, to $12.60. The company said profit and sales for the third quarter would miss earlier forecasts. 
 An index of computer and communication-equipment makers lost 2 percent. A Goldman Sachs survey found a ''significant downtick'' in corporate technology spending plans for the rest of this year and next. A Goldman analyst, Laura Conigliaro, reduced her rating on computer stocks to ''neutral'' from ''attractive.''
 ''We anticipate slower growth for tech in 2005,'' she wrote in a report.
 Going against the trend, the Oracle Corporation, the software maker, added 78 cents, to $11.33. Its 7.4 percent gain was the biggest in the S.&P. 500. The company said profit in its first quarter rose to 10 cents a share, topping analysts' estimates of 9 cents.
 The Best Buy Company climbed $2.32, or 4.6 percent, to $52.61, for the second-largest gain in the S.&P. 500. Profit for the second quarter, excluding some costs, was 53 cents a share, beating an average estimate of 52 cents from Thomson. Increased sales of digital televisions and additional customer-support services lifted earnings.
 Taser International Inc. rallied $7.74, or 22 percent, to $43.09. The company, the nation's biggest maker of stun guns, said the weapons had been approved for use by the police in England and Wales. Taser shares have more than tripled this year.
 United States Treasury notes fell for the first day in four after gains in indexes of manufacturing and production eased concern that the economy is struggling. United States industrial production rose 0.1 percent in August after increasing 0.6 percent in July, according to the Federal Reserve. Although the gain was less than expected, the manufacturing component in yesterday's report rose to 119.3 in August, higher than a prerecession peak in June 2000. Manufacturing accounts for about 13 percent of the economy.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note dropped 10/32, to 100 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.16 percent, from 4.13 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Four Major Orchestras Facing Contract Issues

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
At the Philadelphia Orchestra, management says its contract with the musicians is a ''roadmap to extinction.'' The players of the Cleveland Orchestra, which has racked up a $7.4 million accumulated deficit, are demanding pay parity with their colleagues in Boston. In Chicago, a former federal judge was called in to mediate. 
 It is contract negotiation time at some of the nation's most important orchestras, when the world's most exquisitely trained musicians go into hard-hat mode and artistic administrations act like cost-cutting bosses.
 But this year is unlike any other. 
 In an extraordinary alignment of the stars, four of the so-called Big Five orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, coincidentally have multiyear contracts expiring now, precisely at a moment of serious economic hardship. It is also a time when, more broadly, many wonder what future classical music has in the larger culture. And this round features one of the most publicly acrimonious negotiations in recent memory, at the Philadelphia Orchestra, which struck for 64 days in 1996.
 The Philadelphia and New York contracts expire at 12:01 a.m. Monday, the day before the opening night for each; Cleveland's expired on Aug. 29 and the Chicago Symphony's on Sunday, but both were extended until the end of October. The New York Philharmonic, too, is expected to ''play and talk.''
 Contracts are up for other orchestras, including the major ensembles of Washington, Cincinnati and Minnesota. But attention naturally focuses on the traditional flagship institutions in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago.
 Combined, these aircraft carriers of the classical music world have endowments of $800 million. Yearly budgets range from $36.5 million in Cleveland to $70 million in Boston. All but Boston are running deficits.
 Management and musicians are locked in negotiations at various levels of tension.
 Matters are worst in Philadelphia, where each side has hired an outside public relations consultant and waged the fight on rival Web sites. The parties in Chicago and Cleveland have remained tight-lipped, though there are signs of fraying nerves. Relations seem smoothest at the New York Philharmonic, although with the musicians just back from vacation, it is a little early to tell.
 Across the board, the decline in the stock market has eaten into endowments, which orchestras beefed up substantially in the fat years of the 90's and so now depend on even more for income. Sept. 11, too, put a dent in giving. Attendance is down or flat at many orchestras, and revenue from recordings is drying up as major recording companies cut back sharply on new classical projects. At the same time, health care and pension costs are soaring just as much for flutists as for flight attendants.
 ''It's getting closer to the bone,'' said Jack McAuliffe, the vice president of the American Symphony Orchestra League. ''I think it just makes it a more intense negotiation, because everything matters.''
 Many orchestra executives argue that there is no recourse but to cut employee costs. Minimum salaries in the Big Five all exceed $100,000 a year, but that is deceptive. First-chair players can sometimes triple that, and most players in the trenches earn more than the minimum in overtime and seniority payments. Vacations are usually eight or nine weeks a year.
 Meanwhile, pension plans are generally on the fixed-benefit model, meaning that the orchestras finance them fully and guarantee a set amount at retirement age, instead of a pay-as-you-go plan like a 401K. 
 Typically, the Philadelphia Orchestra said, half of its costs go to musician salaries and benefits. Another quarter goes to administration, marketing and fund-raising. 
 The musicians say that the salary numbers can be deceptive in other ways. Pay may seem generous for seven or eight concerts and rehearsals a week, but that does not take into account a lifetime of study, hours of daily practice and the high cost of instruments. Meanwhile, they note, executive directors are paid in the mid-to-high six figures and music directors in the millions.
 Underneath lies a deep sense of preserving hard-won gains. It was only in the mid-1960's, when the New York Philharmonic became the first orchestra to institute a 52-week season, that orchestra playing was even considered a year-round job. 
 David Zauder, a retired trumpeter of the Cleveland Orchestra, recalls playing on tour with the Boston Pops early in his career. 
 ''I wound up sleeping in a park bench one night because I didn't have money for the hotel,'' he said. ''What's happening today is musicians are afforded five-star hotels, and we fought for that.''
 As Donald Miller, chairman of the Cleveland Orchestra's musicians' committee and a percussionist, put it: ''We start our professions at age 3, and we work at them for 25 years before we have an opportunity to do them for a living. We have an entire generation of time before we can even begin to reach the level necessary to be here. We didn't get into this business for money, but having said that, we're not going to do it for nothing.''
 The musicians' other argument for keeping up minimum salaries is the need to attract the best colleagues. The quality of the ensemble, after all, is the ultimate issue in an orchestra's working conditions, they say. (But contracts also specify minutiae of working conditions, like the length of intermissions and temperature limits for outdoor concerts.)
 Quality is just what the players in Philadelphia, where a strike in 1996 took a particularly ugly tone, say is at stake.
 Management says that it has reduced its projected $4 million deficit to $1.8 million through administrative job reductions and pay cuts for its music director, Christoph Eschenbach, and managers, and it is now time for the musicians to give something back. The orchestra is asking the musicians to make up the savings through any combination of pay cuts, changes in work rules and a reduction in number of full-time musicians, to, possibly, 100 from 106.
 ''Our current trade agreement is a roadmap to extinction,'' Richard Smoot, the orchestra's chairman, wrote in a letter to the public on the orchestra's Web site.
 The musicians have countered with proposals including extra performances and a benefit concert by Riccardo Muti, their former music director. A spokesman for the orchestra, Steve Albertini, said the suggestions would bring a one-time-only benefit, and permanent savings need to be built in.
 In a highly unusual situation, both sides have taken their arguments public, wrangling over various proposals and accusing each other of distorting their respective positions. 
 Management promises that its proposals would never harm the orchestra's artistic level.
 ''We want to preserve the jewel of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Orchestra,'' said Mr. Albertini, a public relations executive hired to present the orchestra's case. The players have their own outside public-relations man.
 But John Koen, a cellist and the chairman of the players' committee, says that reducing full-time positions -- even though the same number of musicians would always be onstage through the use of substitutes -- could undermine the orchestra's fabled artistic tradition. 
 For example, he said, one position singled out is the full-time second harpist. The ''Philadelphia sound'' is partly based on decades of playing large French symphonic works, which often require two harps. Eliminating that job would run counter to the tradition, he said.
 The Chicago Symphony and its musicians are living up to a news blackout. On Sept. 3, the orchestra announced the appointment of Abner Mikva, a former judge on the United States Court of Appeals, to mediate. For years, Chicago paid its musicians well, raising the bar for other orchestras, partly the result of flush times but also of an avoidance of confrontation by management.
 The financially secure Boston Symphony holds the lead now, having begun a four-year contract in 2002 that provides for a minimum of $108,000, a prize eyed by others.
 The Cleveland Orchestra says money must be saved.
 ''Because of our financial situation and because of the economy of northeast Ohio, the association needs costs to go down,'' said Gary Hanson, the executive director. It has already cut or frozen administrative salaries and reduced the pay of its conductor, Franz Welser-Most.
 Both sides make efforts to sound amicable, but a strike in Cleveland -- where the orchestra is a beloved institution on a landscape without as many cultural giants as New York or Boston -- would be particularly damaging to the city's prestige.
 ''It's a factor in a community's self-esteem,'' said Thomas W. Morris, Mr. Hanson's recent predecessor. ''And there's enormous value in the beauty or the challenge of serious music, the same way there is in serious art or serious literature. In a funny way, we probably need those things more than ever.''

HEADLINE: A Fading Game Lacks Answers For Its Questions

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THIS could be the big one. This could be the Hurricane Ivan of sports, the perfect storm that levels the landscape of a formerly major league.
 The National Hockey League is shutting down. We may never see it the way it used to be -- 30 teams stretching across two nations, attracting the best players in the world. 
 The meteorology of this shaky sport includes high-pressure areas of salaries and ticket prices colliding with low-pressure areas of public apathy and television ratings. 
 This lockout could be a man-made disaster for all who depend on the sport -- from players to fans to working stiffs like the nice attendant who greets regulars in the parking lot outside Nassau Coliseum in February's icy drizzle. 
 Canadians are going to miss hockey because it is a deep part of their culture, their life. This could be a long one.
 With auto racing, golf, football, basketball and baseball scooping up available television money in the United States, Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, said yesterday that the 30 teams had lost a cumulative $497 million in the past two seasons. 
 Normally, I do not believe team owners who whine about losing money, because I see too many new candidates lining up to pay the going rate. 
 Bettman, however, said he was weary from patching up the Pittsburghs and the Buffalos of this overextended empire. The Islanders, out where I live, have had a ludicrous assortment of owners in the past two decades. 
 ''We lose less money by not playing,'' Bettman said yesterday, calling his sport ''an industry that isn't competitive.'' He also said players could solve the problem by agreeing to a salary cap, similar to the one that saved pro basketball two decades ago, but the players association does not seem interested.
 Unless salaries come way down, there may not be enough income to make it worth opening all those gates again, whenever. It has seemed inevitable that sports salaries would peak sometime, but the truly big bang may be concentrated in one shaky sport. 
 Hockey is a victim of shifting economics and new loyalties. It is also a victim of rich and ignorant ownerships that spent foolishly on players and executives who had seen better days.
 But enough about the Dolans and the Rangers. 
 Hockey was already in trouble, what with American television networks backing away. The fan base was loyal in some spots and disastrous in others, like New Jersey, where they couldn't fill the Meadowlands for a Stanley Cup champion. 
 The league stretched all over the place. Finals were held in Dallas, Tampa, and Raleigh, N.C., while the rest of the country yawned. Canadian teams shrank to 6 out of 30. 
 The vanishing of the N.H.L., whether temporary or permanent, will get no journalistic drive-by shooting from me.
 I will miss trips to Montreal and Toronto, where the 6 o'clock sportscasters talk knowledgeably about junior leagues.
 I will miss the sport in Detroit, the Twin Cities and Boston, where people actually play it for recreation, outdoors on ponds and rinks. My daughter Corinna and her husband, Peter, used to lace up their skates and play communal games when they lived in St. Paul.
 Ultimately, participation is the backbone of a sport. My son David, a journalist who knows hockey as well as anybody, plays in rec leagues in suburban Atlanta. I've seen men and women show up for games that end near midnight. I bet those players will miss the N.H.L. right away.
 Never mind fretting about violence, players in trouble with the law, trap defenses, tie games, foreign players, all the usual scapegoats. Hockey's troubles are deeper than all of that. In broad demographics, hockey has been marginalized. The players association may have even less of a glimmer of that reality than the league leadership does. 
 The World Cup that ended Tuesday night was fine, but it came at a glutted sports time in the United States. Plus, the specter of a lockout had already cast a pall over the games. 
 The league could still be out in mid-April, Stanley Cup playoff time, when refs tighten up their calls and players stop gooning it up, when games mean something, when series-ending handshake lines are a gracious sign of springtime, like azaleas.
 The worst thing about this lockout is that it threatens the high level of Olympic hockey. With Czechs and Russians competing against Americans and Canadians, the Winter Games in 1998 and 2002 challenged the Stanley Cup finals as the heart and soul of hockey.
 Bettman said yesterday that if the league missed a big chunk of the coming season, he would not envision shutting down in February 2006 so the national teams could compete in Turin, Italy. I think this is backward reasoning. Bettman should be privately begging the Olympics to keep space open as long as possible. But it may be a moot point. We could be saying goodbye to hockey as we knew it.

HEADLINE: Alzheimer's in the Living Room: How One Family Rallies to Cope

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
After his retirement as a New York City carpenter four years ago, and before he faded into the incoherent fog of Alzheimer's disease, Christopher Dillon and his two grown sons renovated a bathroom in the basement of the family's Queens home. 
 It would be the last multigeneration home-improvement project for the Dillons. But the tiny room with its stall shower would soon become center stage in a family's determined effort to care for a failing loved one at home. 
 Giving Mr. Dillon, 66, a shower is unbearable for his wife, Kitty, 63, despite her long experience working in a nursing home. She has only to lay out towels, washcloth and soap and Mr. Dillon becomes agitated, sometimes shoving her or pulling her hair, she said. 
 So the task falls to her strapping boys, Chris, 36, a sanitation worker, and David, 34, a police officer. The National Guard, Mrs. Dillon calls them, riding to her rescue each evening with stores of patience and good cheer that she, as the primary caregiver, feels seeping away.
 ''It's overwhelming, worse every day,'' Mrs. Dillon said recently, wincing from stomach pain and steadily losing weight. ''I don't have any life. Whatever happened to the golden years? Both of us have been robbed of everything we worked for.'' 
 The Dillons' ordeal is familiar to families of the 4.5 million American men and women with Alzheimer's disease, which progressively destroys the cerebral cortex and thus the ability to think, communicate and comprehend. The number of afflicted will more than triple to 14 million by midcentury, according to health care experts and demographers. For their caregivers, life is a round-the-clock vigil, an act of stoic devotion that most families embrace as the antithesis of a nursing home.
 ''It's a myth that Americans dump their relative in long-term care,'' said Dr. Peter V. Rabins, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and co-author of ''The 36-Hour Day,'' a groundbreaking guidebook first published in 1981, when Alzheimer's was not yet a household word. ''When you look at the numbers, that is simply not the case.'' 
 Experts like Dr. Rabins agree that a substantial majority of Alzheimer's patients are cared for at home by family members; estimates range from two-thirds to 95 percent. This growing army of caregivers props up the nation's health care system with free labor, worth, economists and researchers say, more than $100 billion a year, or more than twice the cost of nursing home and paid home care combined. 
 But these largely invisible caregivers, who buttress the nation's health care system, pay a terrible price. The architecture of the family is turned upside down, turning children into parents and parents into children. Emotional bonds and financial resources are strained, even in the most resilient households. Caregivers get sick from the stress.

A Test of Human Spirit
 Alzheimer's disease is ''a cataclysm'' that ''tests the human spirit'' of caregivers like no other, wrote Sherwin B. Nuland, a physician and author of the best-selling 1994 book ''How We Die,'' which describes without euphemism the most common causes of death. 
 With the baby-boom generation aging and life expectancy continuing to increase, Alzheimer's disease has become a ticking time bomb. The fastest-growing segment of the population is 85 and older. In Mr. Dillon's age group, 65 to 74, 3 percent have Alzheimer's; in the 85-and-over group, it is a staggering 47 percent, according to the National Institutes of Health.
 But policy makers have ignored the inevitable, Dr. Rabins said. ''As a society we're paying no attention,'' he said. ''What you see is the coming together of a medical and social crisis that family caregivers alone cannot solve.'' 
 Each family has a different capacity for caring for an Alzheimer's patient, experts say, depending on its size, financial resources, location, competing obligations, social and religious support and approach to conflict resolution. According to criteria established by hospital groups for caregivers, the Dillons would score A-plus on all counts. Still, there are moments when the house seems to vibrate with silent tension.
 Take shower time, typically among the worst for Alzheimer's families, because the patient's sense that his privacy is being invaded, and his inability to perform simple tasks, can provoke extreme reactions. Mrs. Dillon, on the rare occasion she tries to bathe her husband, pleads with him to cooperate. He can no longer follow instructions, she said, but is aware enough to be embarrassed and frustrated. 
 The result can be explosive. And having seen her once-gentle husband raise a fist or a stick in her direction, Mrs. Dillon was shaken last week when, the police say, another Queens man with Alzheimer's killed his elderly wife, who had been his caregiver. 
 Her sons have figured out not to reason or instruct. ''Unless you really ruffle his feathers, he's easygoing 98 percent of the time,'' Chris Dillon said. But if necessary, the younger Mr. Dillon knows how to get the job done. ''Not rough,'' he explained, ''just slightly aggressive because it moves things along.'' 
 Mrs. Dillon is, by her own account, a perfectionist clinging to the last vestiges of control, so she often monitors the progress of the shower from the top of the stairs. She worries aloud that her sons might not wash Mr. Dillon thoroughly or might forget fresh underwear. They respond, ''Ma, I know what I'm doing,'' or roll their eyes. 
 ''I don't think they always understand the whole scenario,'' Mrs. Dillon said, referring to the difference between visiting and living with her husband. She catches herself sounding critical. ''There's a lot of pressure on my children and they never complain,'' she said. ''Neither of them has a lazy bone in his body.'' 
 Chris and David Dillon, like their mother, can be annoyed one minute and admiring the next. They chide her for being stubborn or saying something that provokes their father. But they realize that they get to go home at night. ''What we do is the easy part,'' Chris Dillon said. ''She's there all the time.''

Hiding the House Keys
 Mr. and Mrs. Dillon both retired with good union pensions and health benefits. She spent 28 years working the 3-to-11 p.m. shift at the Dry Harbor Nursing Home, near the family's three-story attached Tudor-style home in Middle Village, Queens. Thus, she said, she ''saw the writing on the wall'' a decade ago when her sweet-tempered husband suddenly became ''snappish over the smallest thing.'' 
 Her sons noticed only garden-variety forgetfulness. Mrs. Dillon did not tell them that the keys they thought had been lost had actually been hidden by their father behind the sugar in the cupboard, common hoarding behavior. She came home from work to charred food in the oven and the smell of gas throughout the house. Finally, Mr. Dillon had a seizure, an uncommon but not unheard-of symptom, in the middle of the night. It frightened her into forgetting her sons' phone numbers. At St. John's Queens Hospital, she said, it took eight nurses and four security guards to restrain him. 
 Last year, Mrs. Dillon took early retirement, with a smaller pension, to stay home with her husband. Caretakers often do this when it becomes impossible to hold two 40-hour-a-week jobs, one in the office and the other at a sickbed, according to a study in April by the Caregiver Alliance and AARP.
 A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's was not made until a few months ago.
 ''But I'd seen it in the home, so I knew I wasn't dreaming,'' Mrs. Dillon said. 
 The neurologists said her husband was in the middle stage of a disease that can last 20 years. 
 In conversation, Mr. Dillon drifts to his boyhood home in Ireland, the village of Ardee in County Louth. There, a pretty, bold girl named Kitty picked him to dance at a ladies'-choice 40 years ago. ''Some days we're there pretty much all the time,'' Mrs. Dillon said, her voice girlish with the memory. 
 Soon came the wandering so common to Alzheimer's disease. Mrs. Dillon put an internal lock on the front door but once forgot to remove the key. Off her husband went, found by teenagers in the middle of the night in a snowdrift miles from home. He now wears an identification bracelet, with Mrs. Dillon's phone number and her sons'.
 The door from the basement to the back garden remains easy to open so Mr. Dillon can spend time in his vegetable garden. He plucks green tomatoes because he can no longer distinguish them from the ripe ones. The garden opens to an alley. At dusk, children greet him as they ride by on bicycles and he kneels to pet the neighborhood dogs.
 One recent day, when no one was looking, Mr. Dillon wandered from the garden. The creak of the door sent his sons racing after him. He had crossed the street to visit with a 97-year-old neighbor. The household breathed a collective sigh of relief. But was it time to lock the basement door? 
 The progression of this disease is inevitable. But each day brings change. Caregivers must be nimble, reconsidering what is possible, what is safe.
 Mr. Dillon has lately gotten ''lost'' on the way to the toilet and used a wastebasket instead. How-to literature for Alzheimer's caregivers suggests positioning the bed within sight of the open bathroom door, painting the wall behind the toilet a contrasting color, running a strip of Day-Glo tape from bedroom to bathroom. Instead, Mrs. Dillon, a light sleeper, shares her husband's bed, waking when he stirs and showing him the way.
 Both of Mr. Dillon's sons live close by and adore their father, who used to take all the neighborhood children on camping trips in the Poconos. They visit daily, inviting Mr. Dillon for a round of pitch-and-putt or a slice of pizza. When David Dillon, the police officer, had to work straight through the Republican National Convention, his brother picked up the slack. The reverse will happen next winter when Chris Dillon is summoned for snowstorm overtime at the Sanitation Department. Both are insistent that caring for their father is a privilege, not an imposition. ''It's not a burden at all,'' David Dillon said. ''I never look at it that way. I've always loved spending time with him and I still do.''
 His wife, Colette, is equally devoted. ''There are fathers and then there are storybook fathers like Christy,'' said Ms. Dillon, an executive with a commercial real estate firm. At the house one recent day, her eyes brimmed with tears and she tenderly held her father-in-law's hand. ''To be asked to do something for him ...,'' she said, her voice trailing off. ''He would have done it for any of us a thousand times over.'' 
 Colette Dillon is also efficient. Without children, she has time to help. She is the one who found a support group for her mother-in-law, at Sunnyside Community Services. It was canceled last month when the center lost a federal grant. She is looking for a lawyer to help Mrs. Dillon put the remaining family affairs in order.
 The cancellation of the support group was a terrible blow to Mrs. Dillon. ''Hearing everybody else pouring out their souls, I didn't feel so alone,'' she said. 
 The last meeting featured a financial and legal expert. Some topics were familiar. The house had already been put in trust for the sons, and Mrs. Dillon had her husband's financial and medical powers of attorney. 
 But there is no plan in place if Mrs. Dillon were to get sick. Neither has the family taken the steps, entirely legal, to qualify Mr. Dillon for paid home care at Medicaid expense. ''I never thought that was for people like us,'' Colette Dillon said.
 Colette Dillon's mother, Beth Prior, takes care of Mr. Dillon three afternoons a week, calming him with her familiar brogue and jolly demeanor. She fixes him a sandwich and urges him to eat: ''One more bite. Keep going. Good man!'' Then she gives him his midday medication -- drugs to slow cognitive decline, reduce anxiety and prevent seizures -- and teases that she might sneak him some Viagra. He gets the joke, and that makes Mrs. Prior's day. 
 Sometimes they page through The Irish Voice, although Mrs. Prior is not sure if Mr. Dillon can read it. Sometimes they dance to Irish music or he helps her hang the wash. Their favorite activity is walking, generally to the park, where Mr. Dillon recognizes the smell of cut grass or the sound of distant thunder, coos at babies and pets dogs and looks forward to the ice cream truck.
 Mrs. Prior holds his hand now, which did not used to be necessary, and stands sentry outside the public restroom if he is inside. But when they pass friends from the old country, fellow retirees from the carpenters' union, he remembers them by name. ''We saw the Neville boys, Kitty,'' Mr. Dillon tells his wife when Mrs. Prior takes him home. ''You remember the Neville boys.''

Remembering to Laugh
 David and Colette Dillon marvel that humor lingers when so much is gone. Mr. Dillon accompanied them to the mall recently, where David was buying a suit. When his son was not paying attention, Mr. Dillon donned a Kelly green jacket, the kind that Bob Hope might wear. ''Shuuush!'' he told his daughter-in-law, apparently eager to keep his costume a surprise. ''He knew it was funny,'' she said. ''This is a good time in the disease because we can still connect with him.'' 
 But Mrs. Dillon's good humor is fading. One day he will not know her. ''Look after yourself; you can't take care of him if you don't take care of yourself.'' She hears this daily from well-meaning relatives and friends. But like so many other spouses in her situation, she often refuses relief. 
 Her eldest son took a two-week vacation after Labor Day to free his mother to go to Ireland for a family wedding. She balked. ''You just have to get on the plane, Ma,'' Chris Dillon said. ''You're not flying it.'' 
 Mrs. Dillon was awaiting the results of a sonogram for her stomach pain, she said. Also, she said, ''I don't have the energy -- mental, physical or emotional -- for getting organized and packed.'' 
 Chris Dillon suggested a weekend in Amish Country instead. Mrs. Dillon agrees, if her husband can join them. ''You need dynamite to move her,'' Chris said. ''I might as well be talking to a wall.'' 
 Mrs. Dillon acknowledges that she is neglecting herself. ''At the rate I'm going, I'll be gone before him, dead and buried,'' she said. 
 A while back, she tried adult day care for Mr. Dillon. Restless and screaming, he lasted only a day before she and her sons were called to take him home. She would like to try again, since the progression of the disease has made him less aware of his surroundings.
 Mrs. Dillon is also researching respite care, small settings where someone with Alzheimer's can stay for a limited time while a caregiver rests and regroups. She suspects that one son will object, interpreting it as a slippery slope to a nursing home.
 That prospect is the conversational third rail for the Dillon family. Mrs. Prior said her sister-in-law, who also had Alzheimer's, was put in a nursing home when she still knew what was going on and quickly died. In a whisper, she added, ''That time will come for Christy,'' but only after he is oblivious.
 Colette Dillon said she reacted to vague inquiries about the future as if the family were being hurried in that direction. ''Is it 10 years away? Is it 20?'' she asked. ''You don't know. How long does this stage last? It's hard to look past today when we know we're making him happy. As long as Christy can be here at home. ...''
 Her husband interrupted in midsentence. ''This,'' David Dillon said, ''is the best environment he can be in.'' 
 Mrs. Dillon sat very still in a straight-back living room chair, exhaustion etched in her face. It was time to head for Mass at Our Lady of Hope. 
 Would someone take Mr. Dillon upstairs and help him change from shorts to long pants? It would surely be a struggle, perhaps not worth the bother, she said. But he shivered so in the air-conditioned church.

HEADLINE: Floridians Wince at Home Insurance Deductibles

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Twelve years ago when Hurricane Andrew pummeled South Florida, 11 small insurance companies went out of business and the giants in home insurance, State Farm and Allstate, were staggered.
 But industry analysts say that is not going to happen this year, even though not one, but two, hurricanes have torn up thousands of houses and businesses across the state and a third, Hurricane Ivan, was expected to affect the Florida Panhandle late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 The insurance companies are expected to do fine, industry experts said, because the insurers, with the approval of Florida officials, have cut back on hurricane coverage, shifting much of the initial cost of repairs and reconstruction to the people who suffered the damage. 
 The insurers argued that they could not stay in business without such measures. But now Gov. Jeb Bush and Tom Gallagher, the head of the state's Department of Financial Services, are suggesting that the companies have gone too far. 
 The governor and Mr. Gallagher are focusing on sharply increased deductibles that force homeowners to pay thousands of dollars for repairs before their insurance kicks in. 
 Mr. Bush, with the support of Mr. Gallagher, is considering calling a special session of the Legislature to review the higher deductibles and other issues arising from the barrage of hurricanes. 
 Economists say the deductibles will probably deepen an anticipated slump resulting from the hurricanes. But the slowdown is expected to be brief as federal assistance and billions in insurance payments flow into Florida. 
 To offset the impact of the deductibles, J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Governor Bush's council of economic advisers, said Wednesday that he has recommended that the Legislature consider dipping into surplus state funds. One approach, he said, would be to give everyone with unpaid insurance losses a payment of $500 or so. Mr. Villamil said he was also recommending that state construction projects be accelerated.
 ''With Ivan now making landfall, there is going to be a tremendous short-term impact on Florida,'' Mr. Villamil said. ''This makes a special session of the Legislature very likely. And it would cover all these issues.'' 
 When hurricane warnings go up, instead of the standard $500 deductible in use across the country, a much higher mandatory deductible becomes effective for most homes in Florida and most other parts of the Atlantic Seaboard and the coast along the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in deductibles in Florida will probably lead to similar shifts for insurers and tens of millions of customers throughout the region, insurance experts said.
 In Florida, the mandatory deductible for homes valued at more than $100,000 is 2 percent; it is 5 percent for homes insured for more than $250,000. The standard $500 deductible remains unchanged for homes valued at less than $100,000. 
 With a 2 percent deductible on a $200,000 home, the owner pays for the first $4,000 in damages. 
 That is expensive enough when just one hurricane has hit. But now, with the arrival of Hurricane Ivan, some homeowners may face three sets of deductibles. 
 As state law stands now, the higher deductibles can be applied to a single home for each of the storms so that the owner of a $200,000 home could wind up having to pay as much as $12,000 for repairs for three hurricanes before collecting a dime from an insurance company. 
 ''We want to get rid of that multiple deductible,'' Mr. Gallagher said in an interview on Wednesday. ''Many consumers don't have the money to handle that. There should be one deductible per season.''
 Mr. Gallagher also wants to replace the high mandatory deductible with a more flexible system. As a minimum, he would impose a $1,000 deductible for most homes. But he would also permit people to choose a range of higher deductibles intended to lower premiums. 
 One way or another, though, the insurance industry says that customers are going to have to pay up for coverage. ''You can't reduce the deductible without increasing the rate,'' said Roger Morris, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. ''That's how we've kept rates down, by raising the deductible.''
 Rates have more than doubled in Florida since Hurricane Andrew, but the industry says that without the deductibles they would have had to rise much higher.
 A spokesman for Mr. Gallagher, Justin Glover, said that more than 130 homeowners had complained about the high deductibles recently as overwhelmed insurance company adjusters have been making their way through the damage of the first two storms and personally delivering the bad news to customers. 
 In the town of Frostproof, in the heart of Florida's citrus region, the home of Steve Stallons, an electrical engineer at an orange juice processing plant, and his wife, Pattie, a sales representative for a skin care company, suffered roof damage from both Hurricane Charley on Aug. 13 and Hurricane Frances on Sept. 5. 
 An adjuster for the Florida Farm Bureau Insurance Company told the Stallons, they said, that the damage from Hurricane Charley would cost about $20,000 to repair. Then, when Hurricane Frances came along, moving slowly and delivering huge amounts of rain, water poured through the damaged roof, collapsing the ceilings in four rooms and adding another $16,500 or so in costs. 
 The Stallons had insured their house for $132,400 and had a $500 deductible for everything except hurricanes. For hurricanes their deductible was 2 percent of the insured amount, or $2,648. Under current Florida law they will have double that amount, or $5,296, deducted from their insurance claim. 
 Mrs. Stallons said that did not seem reasonable to her. ''This was one giant event,'' she said. ''Charley did the initial damage. If it wasn't for that damage, the other storm would not have made a difference. It would have been just like a bad rainstorm.'' 
 In gaining the support of state officials to place more of the costs of hurricanes on the shoulders of customers, the insurance companies have argued that unless they were able to make drastic changes after their heavy losses from Hurricane Andrew, they would either have to stop doing business in Florida or raise prices to crippling levels. 
 One solution was the higher deductibles. The idea started in Florida and spread to other states, including Alabama and Louisiana, which now appear to be squarely in the sights of Hurricane Ivan.
 ''The deductibles were a way of helping spread the risk around, sharing it somewhat,'' Mr. Morris said, referring to both insurance companies and their customers. ''It's a vital part of the whole equation. How do you provide insurance in these high- risk areas?''
 As Mr. Gallagher sees it, one hurricane deductible is enough, no matter how many storms hit the state in a season. ''I believe it is fundamentally unfair for consumers to pay multiple hurricane deductions,'' he said. 
 Because of higher deductibles and other measures, the losses to the insurance companies from the three storms are expected to be significantly less than in Hurricane Andrew. In today's dollars, Hurricane Andrew inflicted about $35 billion in total damage. 
 Some estimates of damage from just the first two hurricanes run as high as $40 billion.
 For Hurricane Andrew, insurers paid about $20 billion in today's dollars. The highest estimates for the costs to insurers from the first two hurricanes peak at about $17 billion and some analysts said they thought that the insurers would ultimately pay less.

HEADLINE: U.S. Intelligence Shows Pessimism On Iraq's Future

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
A classified National Intelligence Estimate prepared for President Bush in late July spells out a dark assessment of prospects for Iraq, government officials said Wednesday.
 The estimate outlines three possibilities for Iraq through the end of 2005, with the worst case being developments that could lead to civil war, the officials said. The most favorable outcome described is an Iraq whose stability would remain tenuous in political, economic and security terms. 
 ''There's a significant amount of pessimism,'' said one government official who has read the document, which runs about 50 pages. The officials declined to discuss the key judgments -- concise, carefully written statements of intelligence analysts' conclusions -- included in the document. 
 The intelligence estimate, the first on Iraq since October 2002, was prepared by the National Intelligence Council and was approved by the National Foreign Intelligence Board under John E. McLaughlin, the acting director of central intelligence. Such estimates can be requested by the White House or Congress, but this one was initiated by the intelligence council under George J. Tenet, who stepped down as director of central intelligence on July 9, the government officials said.
 As described by the officials, the pessimistic tone of the new estimate stands in contrast to recent statements by Bush administration officials, including comments on Wednesday by Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, who asserted that progress was being made.
 ''You know, every step of the way in Iraq there have been pessimists and hand-wringers who said it can't be done,'' Mr. McClellan said at a news briefing. ''And every step of the way, the Iraqi leadership and the Iraqi people have proven them wrong because they are determined to have a free and peaceful future.''
 President Bush, who was briefed on the new intelligence estimate, has not significantly changed the tenor of his public remarks on the war's course over the summer, consistently emphasizing progress while acknowledging the difficulties. 
 Mr. Bush's opponent, Senator John Kerry, criticized the administration's optimistic public position on Iraq on Wednesday and questioned whether it would be possible to hold elections there in January.
 ''I think it is very difficult to see today how you're going to distribute ballots in places like Falluja, and Ramadi and Najaf and other parts of the country, without having established the security,'' Mr. Kerry said in a call-in phone call to Don Imus, the radio talk show host. ''I know that the people who are supposed to run that election believe that they need a longer period of time and greater security before they can even begin to do it, and they just can't do it at this point in time. So I'm not sure the president is being honest with the American people about that situation either at this point.''
 The situation in Iraq prompted harsh comments from Republicans and Democrats at a hearing into the shift of spending from reconstruction to security. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, called it ''exasperating for anybody look at this from any vantage point,'' and Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said of the overall lack of spending: ''It's beyond pitiful, it's beyond embarrassing. It is now in the zone of dangerous.'' 
 A spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment on any new intelligence estimate.
 All the officials who described the assessment said they had read the document or had been briefed on its findings. The officials included both critics and supporters of the administration's policies in Iraq. But they insisted they not be identified by name, agency or branch of government because the document remained highly classified. 
 The new estimate revisits issues raised by the intelligence council in less formal assessments in January 2003, the officials said. Those documents remain classified, but one of them warned that the building of democracy in Iraq would be a long, difficult and turbulent prospect that could include internal conflict, a government official said.
 The new estimate by the National Intelligence Council was approved at a meeting in July by Mr. McLaughlin and the heads of the other intelligence agencies, the officials said.
 Its pessimistic conclusions were reached even before the recent worsening of the security situation in Iraq, which has included a sharp increase in attacks on American troops and in deaths of Iraqi civilians as well as resistance fighters. Like the new National Intelligence Estimate, the assessments completed in January 2003 were prepared by the National Intelligence Council, which is led by Robert Hutchings and reports to the director of central intelligence. The council is charged with reflecting the consensus of the intelligence agencies. The January 2003 assessments were not formal National Intelligence Estimates, however, which means they were probably not formally approved by the intelligence chiefs.
 The new estimate is the first on Iraq since the one completed in October 2002 on Iraq's illicit weapons program. A review by the Senate Intelligence Committee that was completed in July has found that document to have been deeply flawed.
 The criticism over the document has left the C.I.A. and other agencies wary of being wrong again in judgments about Iraq. 
 Declassified versions of the October 2002 document included dissents from some intelligence agencies on some crucial questions, including the issue of whether Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program. The government officials who described the new estimate on the prospects for Iraq would not say if it had included significant dissents.
 On Wednesday night, Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the existence of the intelligence estimate, but he declined to discuss its contents in detail because they were classified. But he said the document ''makes clear why it is so important to stand with the Iraqi people as they face these challenges.''
 Mr. McCormack said that in describing ''different possible scenarios for Iraq's political and economic future over the course of 18 months,'' the document had made clear that ''Iraq's future will be determined by a number of different factors, include the nation's economic progress, the effectiveness of Iraq's political structure, and security and stability.''
 He added: ''In the past, including before the war to liberate Iraq, there were many different scenarios that were possible, including the outbreak of civil war. It hasn't happened. The Iraqi people continue to defy the predictions of pundits and others.'' 
 Separate from the new estimate, Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued other warnings on Wednesday about the American campaign in Iraq, saying the administration's request to divert more than $3 billion to security from the $18.4 billion aid package of last November was a sign of trouble.
 ''Although we recognize these funds must not be spent unwisely,'' the committee chairman, Mr. Lugar said, ''the slow pace of reconstruction spending means that we are failing to fully take advantage of one of our most potent tools to influence the direction of Iraq.'' 
 Less than $1 billion has been spent so far.
 The committee's ranking Democrat, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, one of the harshest critics of the Iraq policies, was far more outspoken. ''The president has frequently described Iraq as, quote, 'the central front of the war on terror,''' Mr. Biden went on. ''Well by that definition, success in Iraq is a key standard by which to measure the war on terror. And by that measure, I think the war on terror is in trouble.''

HIGHLIGHTS

DOWNTOWN DRAMA -- A sibling for the TriBeCa Film Festival was announced yesterday. The new downtown event, planned to be held annually, is the TriBeCa Theater Festival, scheduled to make its debut on Oct. 19 and run through Oct. 31. It represents a collaboration between Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff, the co-founders of the film festival, and the TriBeCa-based Off Broadway theater company Drama Dept. With an emphasis on new voices and new work, and a continuing mission to enhance the economic and cultural revitalization of Lower Manhattan, the festival will be highlighted by a series of short plays, a film series focused on theater, and panel discussions and play readings. Yesterday's announcement said that among the contributors to the world-premiere short-plays series would be Douglas Carter Beane, David Henry Hwang, Neil LaBute, Warren Leight, Paul Rudnick and Wendy Wasserstein, above. Information is available at www.tribecatheaterfestival.com or www.dramadept.org.

PICASSO PREMIERE -- Resurrected by experts from beneath layers of paint on another canvas, a ''virtual copy'' (a backlit transparency) of the 104-year-old painting that is believed to be Picasso's first Paris scene has gone on view at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, The Guardian of London reported yesterday. Reconstructed using X-ray techniques, the virtual copy depicts a turn-of-the-century nightclub and laughing onlookers, some of them top-hatted, watching cancan dancers. Picasso, then 19, painted over the scene for a study of a man, a woman and a child walking in Montmartre. Will Shank, the former chief curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said at the unveiling, ''It was not at all unusual for Picasso to reuse his canvases,'' adding, ''but this was an extraordinary example of a virtually complete composition.''

COUNTRY'S COOKIN' -- For the first time in nearly a decade, one country album has replaced another at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. The new favorite, according to Nielsen SoundScan, is ''What I Do'' by Alan Jackson, below, with sales of 178,000 copies in its first week of release. The record's success ended the two-week No. 1 reign of Tim McGraw's ''Live Like You Were Dying,'' which sagged to second place with 153,000 copies sold. The rhythm-and-blues star Anita Baker made news when her first studio album in a decade sold 131,000 copies in its first week, capturing fourth place on the Billboard 200 chart and first place on its chart of best-selling rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop albums. Ray Charles's ''Genius Loves Company,'' with sales of 135,000 copies, slipped to third place from second the previous week.

FOOTNOTES

All of Shakespeare's works -- plays, sonnets, poems and even the apocrypha -- are to be performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company beginning in April 2006. The yearlong Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival, also involving international companies and other British professional and amateur groups, ''is the first time that Shakespeare's entire canon has ever been performed together at the same event,'' the company's announcement said. The Mike Leigh film ''Vera Drake,'' winner of the Venice festival's Golden Lion last week, will open the London Film Festival, on Oct. 20.

HEADLINE: Ex-Guardsman Is Said to Be a CBS Source

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Baird, Tex., for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Bill Burkett once said his job was to make Gov. George W. Bush a hero. 
 As a lieutenant colonel working on the readiness of the Texas National Guard, Mr. Burkett, a lay preacher's son from Portales, N.M., was brought in with a high commission in 1996 to work on mobilization plans that would make the Guard shine. 
 ''I was very supportive of Bush,'' he said in an interview this year. 
 But it was not long before Mr. Burkett, whom colleagues call a stickler for rules, fell out with senior commanders and ended up in a suit against the Guard and its leaders. He also became disillusioned with Mr. Bush, who he said was not supporting needed reforms in the Guard.
 The bitterness, he later said, moved him to go public with what he said he and a fellow officer, George O. Conn, witnessed one night in Austin in 1997. That was when, he said, commanders, in touch with Mr. Bush's political advisers, left documents in the trash while sanitizing the governor's service records. . 
 Now, Mr. Burkett, whose account last February was derided by the White House, has been drawn into another fray, this one on documents supplied to ''60 Minutes II'' on CBS. On Tuesday, a person at the network named Mr. Burkett as a source of records critical of Mr. Bush's Vietnam era service that CBS said last week came from the personal files of Lieutenant Bush's squadron commander, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, who died in 1984. 
 Citing discrepancies in the typeface and wording of the documents, a growing number of experts, as well as Mr. Killian's wife and son and his former secretary, have called them fakes. The secretary, Marian Carr Knox, said they appeared to reflect Colonel Killian's sentiments that someone might have sought to recreate from lost originals.
 Mr. Burkett (pronounced BURR-kit), 55, did not respond to numerous messages in recent days and turned away a reporter for The New York Times on Wednesday who called several times from outside the locked gate of his ranch in Baird, Tex., east of Abilene. 
 His lawyer, David Van Os of San Antonio, repeatedly declined to answer when asked whether Mr. Burkett had a role in obtaining or providing the documents. 
 ''Bill Burkett is tired of being speculated about when the real story is and should be where was George Bush?'' Mr. Van Os said. ''The possibility that Bill Burkett would falsify documents or falsify any story is zero.'' 
 Robert Strong, a former Guard officer interviewed on ''60 Minutes,'' said documents that CBS showed to him for authentication bore a facsimile stamp of a Kinko's store in Abilene. Mr. Van Os, asked whether that pointed to Mr. Burkett, said he had no information about that.
 Mr. Conn, who vouched for Mr. Burkett in his suit in 2002, has a United States government job in Germany and did not respond to an e-mail message and a telephone message left at his home in Dallas. In an e-mail message in February, Mr. Conn said: ''I know LTC Bill Burkett and served with him several years ago in the Texas Army National Guard. I believe him to be honest and forthright. He 'calls things like he sees them.''' 
 Mr. Conn declined to say whether he had seen any cleansing of Mr. Bush's files with Mr. Burkett.
 Harvey Gough, a restaurateur in Dallas who was in the Guard with Mr. Burkett and Mr. Conn, said this week that he had recently spoken with Mr. Conn in Europe and came away convinced that Mr. Conn had no knowledge of the Killian documents. 
 Mr. Gough said he also had no idea of their origins and had never discussed the matter with Mr. Burkett.
 Yet another officer who served with Mr. Burkett, Dennis Adams, a retired lieutenant colonel now working as a security officer at the State Capitol in Austin, said this week, ''I don't know of anybody I'd put in a higher category than Bill.''
 Mr. Adams said that Mr. Burkett had told him afterward of having witnessed the sanitizing of Mr. Bush's Guard file ''and that some of the things in the trash were pulled out.'' 
 ''He never did say by whom,'' Mr. Adams added. ''I don't have the foggiest idea what documents of any kind he ever had,'' Mr. Adams said. 
 In addition to describing what he said was the destruction of documents, Mr. Burkett said in the February interview that also overheard a conversation in mid-1997 between Gen. Daniel James, head of the Texas National Guard, and Joseph M. Allbaugh, a top aide to Governor Bush, that discussed the Guard records. 
 Contacted in February, Mr. Allbaugh acknowledged the conversation, saying he had talked with General James in an effort to ensure that the records would be helpful to journalists who inquired about Mr. Bush's military experience. He called Mr. Burkett's account about the destruction of documents ''pure hogwash.''
 Mr. Burkett was at home on Wednesday working on his ranch about six miles south of the tiny town of Baird, far from the swirl of attention around CBS News. His gate, on a dusty and little-traveled dirt road, was padlocked. He briefly answered the phone in his house on the far side of his tidy pasture to decline to comment.
 This week, The Abilene Reporter-News identified Mr. Burkett as a suspected source of the CBS documents. At the Callahan County Farmers' Co-op in Baird, a gathering place where Mr. Burkett has been a frequent presence, his role as a public accuser of the president stirred strong emotions. Pete Mendez, a former firefighter who says he is one of the few open Democrats in the county as well as one of Mr. Burkett's few defenders, said the reports had made Mr. Burkett a pariah. Mr. Burkett has recently complained that when he sat down at the co-op table, all his neighbors rose and left, Mr. Mendez said.
 ''If you buck the system around here you are kind of an outcast or radical,'' he added. ''A lot of people around here seem to think he was just upset because he was turned down for something or other.'' 
 Mr. Mendez said he had known Mr. Burkett for a few years and recently lent him a valuable tool.
 ''In my opinion -- which is no more than I have known him -- I feel that he is truthful and whatnot,'' the neighbor said. ''He has always treated me fair.'' 
 In a book published this year, ''Bush's War for Re-election'' by James Moore, Mr. Burkett is quoted as reporting having received numerous death threats, including telephone messages and a bullet with his name on it that he says he found in his mailbox. More recently, he told people that his son's car had been burned. 
 In interviews with The Times in February as he was publicizing his tampering charges, Mr. Burkett said he grew up in New Mexico and majored in agribusiness and economics. He said he joined the New Mexico National Guard in 1970 to avoid service in Vietnam. 
 ''I did not believe in what we were doing there,'' he said.
 He became deputy commandant of the New Mexico Military Academy and, Mr. Moore's book said, headed training and planning for troops sent from Fort Hood, Tex., for the gulf war in 1991. Mr. Burkett said he worked on Defense Department projects for Boeing and, because the Texas Guard could not pay his civilian rate of $154 an hour, was commissioned a lieutenant colonel to revamp the Guard in 1996.
 He clashed with General James, who, he later said, was the official whom he overheard and saw directing the censoring of the files at the behest of the governor's top advisers. The Guard gave him an assignment in Panama, where he contracted a tropical disease.
 In letters to state legislators and a later suit, he said he collapsed at the Abilene airport in 1998 and was ''willfully and maliciously'' denied military medical care by Guard officials, worsening his condition. Before finally obtaining medical benefits in July 1998, he had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for depression, he told The Times. 
 An appeals court dismissed his suit in August 2002 because commanders enjoy broad legal immunity from their troops.


CORRECTION-DATE: September 18, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about disputed memos obtained by CBS News that cast doubt on aspects of President Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard truncated a quotation from David Van Os, a lawyer for Bill Burkett, a retired National Guard officer. Asked what role Mr. Burkett had in raising questions about Mr. Bush's military service, Mr. Van Os posed a hypothetical chain of events in which someone -- not Mr. Burkett, he said -- reconstructed documents that the preparer believed existed in 1972 or 1973. Mr. Van Os then asked ''what difference would even that make'' to the ''factual reality of where was George W. Bush at the times in question and what was he doing?''
 A correction in this space yesterday misstated Newsweek's description of Mr. Burkett. The magazine's Sept. 20 issue called him a ''principal source for CBS's story,'' not a source of the memos. 
 A profile of Mr. Burkett on Thursday referred imprecisely to an account in a Texas newspaper, The Abilene Reporter-News, linking him to the CBS report. The Reporter-News said Newsweek had identified Mr. Burkett as a source for CBS; the newspaper did not independently identify him as a suspected source.

HEADLINE: Kerry Mounts Fierce Attack on Bush's Economic Policies

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; David E. Rosenbaum contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry lashed out at President Bush's economic record on Wednesday, saying that Mr. Bush had created more excuses than jobs and that in the closing months of his term he could no longer refuse to take responsibility for the failures on his watch.
 ''His is the excuse presidency: never wrong, never responsible, never to blame,'' Mr. Kerry said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that amounted to his strongest attack yet on the Bush administration's economic policies. ''President Bush's desk isn't where the buck stops, it's where the blame begins. He's blamed just about everybody but himself and his administration for America's economic problems.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's speech, billed by his campaign as a major economic address, offered no policies beyond what he had already put forth: tax incentives for American corporations to help keep jobs in the United States, a rollback of tax cuts for people who make more than $200,000 a year and a $1,000 child care tax credit for the middle class, among other proposals.
 But at a time when Mr. Kerry has pledged to hit harder at Mr. Bush and focus more on domestic policy, he framed his economic argument against the president with hot new rhetoric. Mr. Kerry said that the job losses and economic troubles under Mr. Bush were a result not of bad luck -- the recession, the Sept. 11 attacks and the corporate scandals that the president cites in his speeches -- but of bad choices.
 Mr. Bush's choices, Mr. Kerry said, have consistently been in favor of the rich and the powerful. ''He chose and he chose and he chose,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''And every single time his choices made middle-class America pay the price.''
 In Mr. Bush's America, Mr. Kerry added, ''a fireman who works overtime to save money and pay for his kid to go to school actually pays a higher tax rate than a billionaire who just inherited a fortune.''
 Mr. Kerry was apparently referring to Mr. Bush's 2003 tax bill, in which the top tax rate on dividends and capital gains, a source of most billionaires' income, was lowered to 15 percent. That is a lower rate than would be paid on the overtime of a firefighter who earns $70,000 a year.
 The Bush campaign replied that Mr. Kerry was offering up more gloom about America. ''He rehashed old, tired ideas of higher taxes, of more regulation and of more government control of people's lives that his own advisers say will not work,'' said Ken Mehlman, the president's campaign manager, in a conference call.
 Mr. Mehlman added that Mr. Kerry had voted 98 times for tax increases totaling $2.3 trillion and had voted 8 times for higher taxes on Social Security benefits.
 Mr. Mehlman was apparently referring to a record that is more complex than suggested in the daily charge and countercharge of the two campaigns. In reality, Mr. Kerry voted for one large tax increase, the Clinton tax bill of 1993. Most of the additional income taxes in this bill were imposed on the wealthy, but it did include an increase in the taxes on Social Security benefits for middle-income retirees.
 Mr. Kerry also voted against two large tax cuts, the Bush tax bills in 2001 and 2003. Although most of the tax cuts went to the wealthy, the bills included lower taxes for middle-income couples and families. Mr. Kerry favored the middle-class cuts but voted against them in the course of voting against the entire legislation. 
 Mr. Kerry did cast 98 tax votes, but nearly half of them were not on bills but rather on budget resolutions, measures that set overall tax and spending targets. The total also includes the many times he cast multiple votes on the same bill. 
 Mr. Kerry delivered the speech, at Cobo Hall in downtown Detroit, accompanied by Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. In the introduction to his remarks, Mr. Kerry lavished praise on Mr. Rubin and made it clear that if he was elected he would want Mr. Rubin at his side. 
 Mr. Rubin, he said, is ''one of those rare public citizens who has this great ability to move between the public sector and the private sector and keeps his credibility through both.'' He added that ''there are those of us obviously who would love to see him make that transition and move again.''
 Over all, Mr. Kerry's remarks were greeted with tepid applause, which one of his advisers, Gene Sperling, attributed to what he said were the largely conservative leanings of the economic club. Mr. Sperling, an economic adviser in the Clinton White House, was in Detroit to brief reporters after Mr. Kerry's speech.
 Mr. Kerry began his day by calling in to Don Imus's radio show and talking at length about the war in Iraq. When Mr. Imus asked Mr. Kerry if there were ''any circumstances'' that warranted going to war with Saddam Hussein, Mr. Kerry replied, ''No, there are none that I see.''
 The exchange prompted the Bush campaign to again call Mr. Kerry a flip-flopper; in August, Mr. Kerry said that knowing what he knows today, he would still have voted to authorize the president to use force against Iraq.
 And Mr. Kerry told Mr. Imus that a new book, ''Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry,'' by John E. O'Neill and Jerome R. Corsi, was a ''pack of lies,'' and that he had no interest in reading it. He also briefly addressed Mr. Bush's record in the Texas Air National Guard. Mr. Bush, who missed duty in the Guard in 1972 and 1973, spoke Tuesday to a Guard convention in Las Vegas.
 ''Wouldn't it have been funny,'' Mr. Imus asked the senator, ''if he'd have showed up for that speech yesterday, that National Guard speech -- the president went up there and gave that dopey salute like you did and said, 'Reporting for duty, finally'?'' 
 Mr. Kerry laughed and replied, ''Yes, actually it would have been funny.''

HEADLINE: Inflation in Check, Bond Prices Rise Briskly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bond prices rose sharply yesterday, sending the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note to its lowest level since the beginning of April. 
 The rally followed a government report that showed that inflation was well restrained in August. In addition, a revision in a Merrill Lynch forecast said that Federal Reserve policy makers would move more slowly in raising interest rates than previously forecast. A regional economic index for Philadelphia also dropped much more than expected. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 4.08 percent, down from 4.16 percent Wednesday, its lowest since it reached 3.88 percent on April 1. The yield on the 10-year note has fallen almost steadily since June 14, when it reached its 2004 high of 4.87 percent. In the stock market, the three main gauges rose slightly. 
 That peak in June for the yield on the 10-year note came not long after the price of crude oil passed $40 a barrel. While the initial response to rising oil prices was fear of higher inflation, more recently bond investors have apparently concluded that the surge in the price of oil is more likely to slow economic growth than to push other prices higher.
 A lack of inflationary fears and expectations of slower growth have combined to pull longer-term interest rates sharply lower. 
 The power of that combination was reinforced yesterday. First, the government said that the Consumer Price Index rose only 0.1 percent in August. The core index, which excludes food and energy, also climbed 0.1 percent and is up 1.7 percent over the last 12 months. 
 At the same time, the economic index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia dropped a surprising 15.1 points to 13.4 for September. A reading over zero means the economy is expanding.
 That was a much bigger decline than expected and was added ammunition for those who question whether the economic soft patch is over, as Fed officials have contended.
 Also yesterday, Merrill Lynch economists, in a monthly report, revised their forecast for the 10-year Treasury yield and their prediction on how fast and far Federal Reserve officials will raise their benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. 
 Merrill predicts that the target for the federal funds rate, now at 1.5 percent, will rise to 2 percent by November and will hold there until the end of 2005. The yield on the 10-year note is now forecast to drop as low as 3.60 percent by the middle of next year, instead of to 4.15 percent by the end of next year. 
 Kathleen Bostjancic, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said the revision of the forecast was based on several factors. One is that higher oil prices are slowing growth. But just as important is that another surge in mortgage refinancing, which has been a boost to consumer spending, is not likely unless the 10-year yield falls to around 3.80 percent, she said. That means a refinancing boom, if it occurs, is not likely until the middle of next year and may not last long if rates rise again.
 In addition, she said, the stimulus from last year's tax cuts has faded and the stall in the stock market is probably discouraging some consumer spending.
 Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said, ''There is a growing perception among people in the market that the Fed has finished tightening or has almost finished tightening.''
 But he does not agree with that outlook. He argues that the economy is growing strongly enough for the Fed to carry through with its objective of raising the goal for the federal funds rate to what economists call neutral -- a level that neither stimulates nor slows economic activity. And neutral, Mr. McCarthy said, is somewhere between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 Mr. McCarthy also said that while the pace of monthly inflation had slowed, a further rise in oil prices could change that. Ms. Bostjancic agreed.
 Despite this rally and the belief among some observers that the Fed will slow the pace of future rate increases, it is still expected that policy makers will raise their benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75 percent when they meet next Tuesday. The meeting after that is scheduled for Nov. 10. 
 In the bond market, the price of the 10-year note rose 24/32 to 101 14/32. The yield on the Treasury's 2-year note fell to 2.41 percent, from 2.47 Wednesday. Unlike the 10-year note, the 2-year yield is not anywhere near its end-of-March level of about 1.6 percent. That is because the 2-year yield tends to stay close to the expected federal funds rate.
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,244.39 while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,123.50. the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.56 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,904.08.

HEADLINE: Collapse of 60 Charter Schools Leaves Californians Scrambling

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Ken Larson was pacing the floor of his office in a tiny elementary school in Oro Grande, Calif., surrounded by the chaos of fax lines beeping, three beleaguered secretaries peppering him with questions and phone lines ringing for the umpteenth time.
 It had been a month since one of the nation's largest charter school operators collapsed, leaving 6,000 students with no school to attend this fall. The businessman who used $100 million in state financing to build an empire of 60 mostly storefront schools had simply abandoned his headquarters as bankruptcy loomed, refusing to take phone calls. That left Mr. Larson, a school superintendent whose district licensed dozens of the schools, to clean up the mess.
 ''Hysterical parents are calling us, swearing and shouting,'' Mr. Larson said in an interview in Oro Grande last week. ''People are walking off with assets all over the state. We're absolutely sinking.'' 
 The disintegration of the California Charter Academy, the largest chain of publicly financed but privately run charter schools to slide into insolvency, offers a sobering picture of what can follow. Thousands of parents were forced into a last-minute search for alternate schools, and some are still looking; many teachers remain jobless; and students' academic records are at risk in abandoned school sites across California.
 Investigators are sifting through records seeking causes of the disaster, which has raised new questions about how charter schools are regulated.
 ''Until the Charter Academy went into its tailspin, few people predicted that these crashes could be so bloody, but this has been a catastrophe for many people,'' said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The critics of market-oriented reforms warned of risks with the philosophy of let-the-buyer-beware, but in this case, buyers were just totally hung out to dry.''
 Jack O'Connell, the California superintendent of schools, said in an interview that a majority of the state's 537 charter schools were making a solid contribution to public education. But Mr. O'Connell has concluded from the disaster that the state must apply ''tough love'' in regulating them, ''to keep this kind of near-bankruptcy and chaos from happening again,'' he said.
 ''If there's mismanagement and malfeasance, we'll come in and put you out of business,'' he said.
 Back in 1999, the national movement to provide alternatives to parents through charter schools, which face less burdensome regulation than other public schools, was gaining steam. Many charter schools have since flourished, and experts say that some of them offer an excellent education. But in Southern California, there were signs of trouble soon after C. Steven Cox, a former insurance executive whose only educational credential was his brief service on a local school board, founded the Charter Academy.
 State auditors are now scrutinizing Mr. Cox's financial records to determine whether he exaggerated enrollments and to sort out claims from a line of creditors, said Scott Hannan, director of school fiscal services at the California Department of Education.
 ''But our highest priority is securing the student records,'' Mr. Hannan said. That is a sore point with Mr. Larson, who said that thousands of students' immunization and academic records had been virtually abandoned all across California.
 Mr. Larson, superintendent of a tiny school district in Oro Grande, a Mojave Desert village 88 miles northeast of Los Angeles that looks like a set for ''Bad Day at Black Rock,'' has converted a storeroom at his school into a warehouse for the records. He has arranged for dozens of file cabinets holding student records to be trucked to Oro Grande from schools that have closed across the Mojave Desert, he said, but he has no way to collect records and equipment left behind elsewhere.
 Mr. Larson said Mr. Cox approached him in 2001, preaching the charter school gospel that money spent on filing reports to government regulators would be better spent in classrooms, and asking the Oro Grande district to license him to found charter schools. The Oro Grande school board approved the idea, and two other California districts forged similar relationships with Mr. Cox between 1999 and 2001. 
 Mr. Cox eventually founded 60 satellite schools in low- and middle-income communities stretching from Chula Vista near the Mexican border to Gridley, 140 miles northeast of San Francisco, and under California's financing formulas the state paid him about $5,000 annually for each student he enrolled. As his business grew, he hired his wife, son, daughter-in-law and other relatives to work at his corporate headquarters in Victorville, near Oro Grande.
 But by early 2003, Mr. Cox had become mired in several costly confrontations with the California Department of Education; one centered on whether 10 of his schools were in violation of a 2002 law barring charter operators from opening schools in counties they had not registered in. The state withheld more than $6 million that Mr. Cox had expected to receive.
 Mr. Cox sued, seeking to force payment, but lost that battle after running up huge legal fees, and the state withheld money as a result of other disputes, too. By the summer, Mr. Cox's financial difficulties had grown severe, and on July 28, the trustees of one of the four charters responded to the mounting crisis by voting to close the schools they had licensed. Mr. Cox stalked out of that meeting and stopped responding to most phone calls.
 Within a week and a half, trustees voted to close the rest of Mr. Cox's schools, and his second in command announced to scores of employees gathered at the Victorville headquarters that they were out of a job. Kim Ehrlich, a billing supervisor, said she spent the first half of August with workers dismantling the offices around her, phoning local utility companies across California to turn off the power at Charter Academy schools, then lost her job.
 The sudden collapse blindsided even the charter school principals. Melody Parker, whose Village elementary school in Inglewood was one of the most popular schools in Mr. Cox's organization, said that although her budget had been slashed and Mr. Cox had grown aloof, she never imagined that his organization could fall apart.
 ''It hit us like a tornado,'' Ms. Parker said. On Aug. 12, she informed teachers that their jobs were gone, and the next day she told hundreds of parents gathered at the school that it would not open for the fall term. Many had still not found schools by the second week of September, she said.
 ''The collapse was so disheartening,' said Dwayne Muhammad, who works in a funeral home and whose daughter Aisha was to attend the Village's fourth grade this fall. ''Everybody began rushing to find alternate schools.'' 
 Mr. Muhammad has visited eight schools in the weeks since, all of which have been full, he said Monday. ''We've been left by the wayside.''
 The nonprofit California Charter School Association said in a report this week that 80 percent of the students displaced from Mr. Cox's schools had since enrolled in other charter schools. Some teachers, like Maria Boatwright, who taught first grade at the Village, have found new jobs at other charters.
 But teachers all across the state have reported difficulties in finding new teaching positions because most schools had hired their staffs by the time the academy collapsed, Mr. Larson said.
 At the interview in Oro Grande, he produced a stack of letters from distraught, jobless teachers. Travis D. Taylor, who taught art and science to students at a Charter Academy school in Gridley, wrote to say that he had not been repaid the hundreds of dollars he spent on books and science equipment for his students.
 Mr. Taylor's mother, Shelly, said that since the collapse, Mr. Taylor had been unable to find another teaching job. With his debts mounting, he has been harvesting rice ''to keep his head above water,'' she said.
 Mr. Cox did not respond to requests for an interview left on his voicemail, sent by e-mail and relayed through former employees. Mr. Larson has not been able to reach him either, he said.
 One of Mr. Larson's secretaries interrupted the interview to announce that the landlord of a school forced to close in Los Angeles was threatening to dump desks and student records in the street to make way for a new tenant. Mr. Larson wrestled with the notion of driving a truck to Los Angeles himself to fetch the assets.
 ''There's 100 desks down there,'' he muttered. ''What would we do with 100 desks?''

HEADLINE: Taxing Global Profits

 BODY:
A new study showing that American multinational companies booked a record $149 billion of profits in tax-haven countries in 2002 is further evidence, if any were needed, that the corporate tax structure is much in need of repair. 
 The research, done by a former Treasury Department economist and published in a journal that is the tax industry's bible, Tax Notes, looks at American subsidiaries that are located in countries with low or no corporate taxes, like Ireland, Bermuda, Luxembourg and Singapore. Some offshore entities are merely tax-reducing way stations. In other places, American companies have legitimate business operations, which are often coupled with aggressive tax-avoidance strategies. 
 Take a simplified example: Say a company has a subsidiary in Ireland that manufactures a computer part for $10 to be sold to customers in the United States for $50. The Irish subsidiary sells the part to the American parent company for $35 -- a markup that is so huge as to be abusive because the high-value patents and know-how for the part exist in the United States. When the part is sold in this country for $50, the company will owe tax on $15 of the profit, even though it will make $40 on the deal -- $25 of that will be booked as profit for its Irish subsidiary. 
 The study concludes that the more that American companies can use foreign subsidiaries to lower taxes, the greater their incentive to invest and employ staff abroad. That means a steady, significant erosion of this nation's corporate tax base, amounting, the study says, to ''many billions of dollars.''
 Some tax analysts have latched onto findings like these as a reason to do away with the corporate income tax altogether. In a world where capital flows freely, they say, nothing can stop the sheltering of profits. 
 Yet the tax avoidance that is abusive stems as much from gaping loopholes in the system as from the system itself. In 1998 and 1999, for example, business interests successfully lobbied Congress to block Internal Revenue Service regulations that would have curtailed the abuses. In addition, past and present Congresses and administrations have been lukewarm, at best, in supporting efforts by the Treasury Department and the I.R.S. to enforce existing law. 
 Global capital presents a big challenge for tax collectors, and there are no easy answers. After careful study and debate, it might make a lot of sense to enact some other type of tax, like a European-style value-added tax, that could more efficiently capture the profits that currently escape the United States tax system. 
 What is unacceptable is for antitax forces and their allies in Congress to allow the current system to fail so they have an excuse to ''reform'' it, often in ways that are as much ideological as they are economic -- by, for instance, eliminating taxes on profits, thus shifting the burden to wage earners. Genuine reform would start with ending abusive tax shelters abroad.

HEADLINE: Uncorking A River

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

DATELINE: SUMMERSVILLE, W.Va. 

 BODY:
AT a little before 7 a.m. last Friday, a caravan of purple-and-green school buses pierced through the morning fog and pulled into a steadily filling parking lot at the base of the Summersville Dam. Like a column of picnic ants, hundreds of people in orange life vests, neoprene wet suits and white helmets formed a line down to the lip of the Gauley River. Then, precisely at 7, the Army Corps of Engineers uncorked the dam, sending 2,300 cubic feet of water per second into the Gauley, churning the usually ho-hum creek into a 25-mile thrill ride that ranks among the fiercest rapids in the nation, if not the world. 
 It was the start of Gauley Season (recently dubbed ''Gauley-Palooza'' by National Geographic Adventurer magazine), a 22-day annual orgy of whitewater, when over six weekends after Labor Day, the Army Corps opens the sluices on the Summersville Dam, draining the artificial lake behind it and creating more than 100 rapids, ranked from a moderate Class III to a heart-stopping V-plus, on the river. During that time, more than 70,000 rafters will pass through Summersville, pumping an estimated $20 million into the local economy. 
 For many Summersville residents, Gauley Season spells fresh faces and dollar signs. Hotels are fully booked, restaurants are filled, and bars are packed with rafters and kayakers. Along Route 19, the town's vehicular lifeline, Subaru Outbacks topped with banana-yellow kayaks cram the parking lot outside the Up the Creek Smokehouse, a tavern that only resembles a hunting lodge. Nearby, a string of two- and three-story hotel chain outposts have gone up in recent years, catering not only to truckers and passing drivers, but to rafters seeking something less rustic than a tent in the woods. ''Coal mining was king, but tourism is going to be the future king,'' said Joe Cardullo, executive director of the Summersville Convention and Visitors Bureau, which was formed in March. 
 But if that change is as inevitable as Mr. Cardullo believes, not everyone in Summersville is equally enthusiastic. Despite its renown among the Teva and CamelBak crowd, Summersville, population 3,300, remains very much a rural and industrial town. A plate of eggs and toast costs $1.95 at Fran's Diner, the greasy spoon on Main Street, where a crooked screen door serves as a drive-through window for rusty pickup trucks. Men in authentic trucker hats and deer camouflage plop down $7.50 at Townsend's Barbershop for a haircut. Around town, signs depicting a man urinating on the word ''rafters'' have sprouted on lawns. Locals have accused outfitters of everything from discarding cigarette butts on the riverbanks to driving them off the narrow roads with the clunky buses carrying rafters.
 While the whitewater fans and Summersville locals may share the same geography, psychically they are worlds apart. On the same weekend that Gauley Season kicked off, Summersville held its annual Potato Day Festival and parade, led this year by Sheena Miller, a high school senior who wore a sparkling tiara and a sash that read, ''Nicholas County Potato Festival Queen.'' The entire county, it seemed, turned out to watch the procession of pageant winners, marching bands and backyard potato farmers. Most of the spectators seemed oblivious to the rafters downstream. The local weekly, The Nicholas Chronicle, led its community coverage with a photograph of Ms. Miller posing with a bushel of spuds, while the whitewater event failed to warrant a single mention.
 Those who come to the Gauley to raft ''just have different morals,'' said Matt Bark, 21, a National Guardsman from Summersville who recently returned from Iraq. ''We want to listen to country music, ride our trucks and drink beer. The river rats want to listen to their heavy metal, smoke their pot, and not shave.''
 BEFORE the Gauley was known for whitewater, it was known as the River of Ink. In 1894, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway laid tracks along its banks as mining operations dug deeper into the region's black veins. Sludge runoffs from coal mines and lumber mills darkened the river and turned it foul. By the 1940's, there were some 1,100 mines in West Virginia, employing 130,000 workers. Towns like Summersville flourished on the backs of coal miners. 
 But by the end of the 20th century, the industry had dwindled. Although production levels remain high, West Virginia -- the Mountain State -- today has only 103 mines employing roughly 20,000 workers. So the state turned to its other abundant natural resources -- mountains for biking and hiking, rivers for rafting and kayaking, rock faces for climbing. ''Tourism may help salvage the state's economy,'' said Fred A. Barkey, professor emeritus at the Marshall University Graduate College in Huntington, W.Va., and an expert in the state's coal history. According to state records, tourism contributed $4.86 billion to its economy in 2001.
 Among West Virginia's attractions is the Gauley, which had been dammed by the Army Corps in 1966 to control flooding. River runners soon discovered that whenever the floodgates were opened, the river became a rapids-filled playground, and they gave the most difficult stretches of water names like Iron Ring and Lost Paddle. But the release schedule was erratic, and outfitters never knew when to book advance trips. Meanwhile, Summersville Lake became a popular fishing spot and picnic area for local families. For them, opening up the dam meant turning the lake into a mud hole unfit for recreation.
 It took an act of Congress (which added rafting to the river's official list of permitted uses in 1988) and years of sniping between rafters and lake users before the Army Corps reached a compromise -- to drain the lake for six weekends every autumn. Not everyone was appeased. ''I'm not against rafters, but they are hoggish and want the whole thing for themselves,'' said Joseph Pugh, 75, a former marina owner who still fishes on the lake. ''They've gotten too big.'' 
 The conflict between the adventure crowd and locals is, in fact, being played out all over West Virginia, as the state tries to market itself as an unspoiled reserve and overcome its hillbillies-and-moonshine reputation. In Fayetteville, nestled along the New River Gorge, some locals trying to maintain their small-town flavor fought tooth and nail but failed to block new fancier restaurants from getting liquor licenses. At the Snowshoe Mountain ski resort, near the Virginia border, neighbors feared that an influx of tourists would threaten their relaxed way of life when the ski giant Intrawest bought the mountain in 1995. In Swiss, where many Gauley rafters take out, congregants at a Methodist church were mortified by the sight of rafters peeling off their wet suits and standing more or less naked across the road.
 But inexorably, it seems, Tevas are slowly overtaking hunting boots in this part of West Virginia. Eighteen licensed outfitters now dot the region between Summersville and Fayetteville, ranging in sophistication from do-it-yourself kayak rentals to full-scale resorts like Class VI River Runners, in Lansing, which is the host of corporate retreats and claimed the state's first Starbucks. In Summersville, among the featureless brick buildings and bail bond storefronts that line Church Street, is the Caledonia Cafe, offering organic lattes, tequila shrimp pasta and a Wi-Fi connection. ''It's not your typical West Virginia restaurant,'' said Sharon McNeill, 45, who moved to Summersville from Maine after marrying a local rafting outfitter and opened the cafe on Memorial Day. ''Around here, it's definitely your meat and potatoes crowd.''
 Among the newcomers attracted by the whitewater is Ryan Yarnell, a strapping 26-year-old from Texas who wears his reddish hair in dreadlocks. He is among the globe-trotting guides who travel the whitewater circuit -- Australia, Mexico, Chile, California, New Zealand and now West Virginia -- for a living. ''I can probably live on $5 a day here,'' Mr. Yarnell said. ''My only extravagance is beer.'' 
 Most tourists spend more. ''We almost fell out at Lost Paddle,'' said Sheila Mehta, 36, a product manager from Australia who flew in for the first weekend of the season, and paid about $250 for two trips down the Gauley. ''It's good to be scared occasionally. Every time we went through a rapid without tipping, I thought the guide was a god.''
 ''It's a major shot in the arm to our economy,'' said Stanley Adkins, Summersville's mayor, whose three sons have all worked for rafting outfitters. ''It's one of the only things that give us national exposure.''
 As the first day of Gauley Season drew to a close, rafters gathered at Chetty's Pub, a beer and wings establishment at the Class VI lodge, to recount their spills and conquests. Video footage from that day played on a large projection TV, already edited and burned on DVD's that can be taken home for $62.50. On the wooden deck overlooking the verdant Appalachian hills, Sam Camper, 48, was drinking beer and talking shop. A former coal miner, he's now a rafting guide, one of the many locals who made the transition from hoisting coal to ferrying office workers. He no longer makes as much as he did as a coal miner, but he has replaced the dangers of mines and carbon dust with natural hazards like the 12-foot drop at Sweet's Falls.
 As far as he's concerned, there's no choice between Summersville's past and its future. ''I got a letter from a coal mine the other day asking me to come back,'' Mr. Camper said. ''I ripped it up.''

HEADLINE: 36 Hours Red Bank, N.J.

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE EGAN

 BODY:
THOUGH the Atlantic Ocean is just eight miles away, Red Bank, on the south shore of the Navesink River, with many of its 11,500 residents living in modest Victorian homes, takes pride in its roots as a river town. English sailors first noticed its banks of red clay in 1609; it was settled in the late 17th century and developed into a bustling port rom which seafood and crops were sent to New York City. In the 1980's, its commercial district suffered an economic downturn that earned it the unfortunate moniker ''Dead Bank.'' Today, with help from a downtown business alliance, the town has changed again. Red Bank supports a growing array of trendy shops and restaurants, and has fashioned itself into a mini-center for the arts, with famous neighbors including Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi in nearby towns. And while summer brings outdoor festivals, concerts and movies to the town's streets and public riverfront areas -- Riverside Gardens Park and Marine Park -- the crowds disperse during autumn, making the view of boats cruising the Navesink much easier to enjoy.

Friday
 Red Bank is 48 miles south of New York City and 85 miles northeast of Philadelphia, at Exit 109 off the Garden State Parkway. Local trains on the New Jersey Transit North Jersey Coast Line (800-772-2222; njtransit.com) stop at Red Bank. From the station, Red Bank can easily be explored on foot.
 The Molly Pitcher Inn (88 Riverside Avenue, 732-747-2500) was built on the Navesink in 1928 and has a bar and a restaurant with river views. There are boat slips for guests who float in. The inn's 106 rooms start at $159. The Oyster Point Hotel (146 Bodman Place, 732-530-8200) has the same owners as the Molly Pitcher, a few hundred yards away. Its 58 rooms start at $159, and it has a restaurant and bar, also on the water.
 Seven miles northeast of town, the Blue Bay Inn (51 First Avenue, Atlantic Highlands; 732-708-9600) is a just-opened boutique hotel with a restaurant and lounge. Its 27 rooms, some with balconies, start at $159 and include a continental breakfast.


5 p.m.
1. Shrine to Comic Books
The filmmaker Kevin Smith, whose credits include ''Dogma'' and ''Jersey Girl,'' helped put the town on the pop culture map by filming much of his ''Chasing Amy'' and the cult favorite ''Clerks'' in the area. He also owns a downtown comic book shop called Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash (35 Broad Street, 732-758-0508). Join the steady stream of comic book aficionados as they browse through coveted copies of Swamp Thing or Identity Crisis.

8 p.m.
2. Taco Night
Red Bank boasts a large Mexican and Salvadoran population, and would-be patrons often wait in line for a table at the popular Juanito's Mexican restaurant (159 Monmouth Street, 732-747-9118; lunch and dinner). Try the queso fundido -- a spicy cheese dip with Mexican sausage and flour tortillas ($7.95), or the shrimp enchiladas poblanas in a dark mole sauce ($16.95). And while you'll have to do without margaritas (there is no liquor license), customers can bring their own beer and wine.

Saturday

9 a.m.
3. Stretch Yourself
Ease into the day with a class ($18) in Dancing Foot Yoga's 1,500-square-foot, wood-floor space at Synapse Studios (10 Broad Street, third floor; 732-219-6662). If that doesn't kick you into gear, head down the street to No Ordinary Joe Cafe (51 Broad Street, 732-530-4040) for a banana muffin ($1.85) and a medium-size cappuccino ($3.15).

11 a.m.
4. Out and About
Stroll the five-block downtown and browse at Funk and Standard Variety Store (40 Broad Street, 732-219-5885) for hip clothes and jewelry, retro lunch boxes ($14 and up), Cleopatra action figures ($10) and a copy of Cassell's Dictionary of Slang ($16.99). Then pop into the Bees Knees boutique (24 Broad Street, 732-758-1900) for girly Lilly Pulitzer clothing and Eliza B. accessories. In the rear of this space, don't miss the Jersey Shore Apparel Company (24 Broad Street, 732-530-1048), which stocks T-shirts, sweatshirts, baseball caps, coffee mugs and bumper stickers that all pay tribute to the Garden State and to Red Bank in particular.

1 p.m.
5. Food for the Soul
Down to Earth (7 Broad Street, 732-747-4542) serves organic vegetarian cuisine in its cheery basement-level dining room. Try the ''notorious nachos'' ($6.95), corn chips beneath homemade three-bean chili, lettuce, salsa and tofu sour cream -- yeast cheese is a dollar extra. Or recharge with a concoction of iced apple and lemon juices with a dash of ginger ($4.75). After lunch, keep walking and peruse a few galleries -- Art Forms (16 Monmouth Street, 732-530-4330); the Art Alliance of Monmouth County (33 Monmouth Street, 732-842-9403); and the Laurel Tracey Gallery (10 White Street, 732-224-0760) -- for contemporary paintings, photography, jewelry and sculpture. Occasionally, Red Bank plans self-guided art-themed walks, and the Visitors' Center (in the train station at Monmouth Street and Bridge Avenue, 732-741-9211; www.visit.redbank.com) offers maps highlighting galleries and antiques shops.

3 p.m.
6. To the Lighthouse
A 20-minute drive northeast to the Sandy Hook Lighthouse at Fort Hancock puts you where you can watch birds and hike on about five miles of trails. Built in 1764 and the oldest operating beacon in the United States, the lighthouse offers impressive views of lower Manhattan (Gateway National Recreation Area, 732-872-5970). It is open noon to 4:30 p.m. weekends through November, and admission is free. The nearby Twin Lights of Navesink is where America's first Fresnel lens was used. The Twin Lights' medieval-style turrets were decommissioned in 1949; today they are a museum and historic site (Lighthouse Road off Route 36, Highlands; 732-872-1814). It is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday; a donation is requested.

6 p.m.
7. Go Italian
For the last decade, 2 Senza (2 Bridge Avenue, 732-758-0999) has served Italian and Mediterranean food to loyal regulars from its open kitchen in the Galleria building. Start with a salad of mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled portobello mushrooms and gorgonzola ($10). Then dine on sushi-quality yellowfin tuna with sauteed spinach and a balsamic vinegar reduction ($30). It has a small shop specializing in Italian boutique wines.

8 p.m.
8. It's Showtime
This year, the Count Basie Theater (99 Monmouth Street, 732-842-9000; www.count basietheatre.org) celebrates the centennial of Count Basie's birth. In August 1904, William James Basie, the renowned composer of ''One O'Clock Jump,'' was born on Mechanic Street in Red Bank. The theater opened 22 years later as a vaudeville and movie house; it was given its current name in 1984. Today its year-round programs include opera, music, dance, rock bands, world music, comedy and film. The space, with an impressive proscenium arch, has nearly 1,600 seats and recently reopened after a major refurbishment, which includes historically accurate theater seats and an updated screen and sound system. On Oct. 8 and 9, the theater will play host to the fourth annual Red Bank International Film Festival in conjunction with the Freedom Film Society.

10:30 p.m.
9. An Irish Nightcap
After the entertainment, head down the block for a pint of Smithwick's ($5) at the Dublin House (30 Monmouth Street, 732-747-6699), a charmingly scrappy Irish bar set in an attractive former home with a mansard roof, whose owners, Sean Dunne and Eugene Devlin, hail from the Emerald Isle.

Sunday

10 a.m.
10. Rise and Shine
The bright and spacious River's Edge Cafe (35 Broad Street, 732-741-7198; breakfast, lunch, and dinner) is an unassuming downtown spot with around 40 tables; locals feast on eggs Benedict ($8.50) and seasonal specialties like pumpkin pancakes with honey butter ($7.50).

11 a.m.
11. Fresh and Wild
Every Sunday from May through October, you can load up on flowers, plants, fruits, vegetables and baked items -- all from New Jersey -- at the Red Bank Farmer's Market in the Galleria parking lot (corner of Bridge Avenue and West Front Street, 732-530-7300; 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.). Before leaving town, grab a pressed roasted chicken or prosciutto sandwich ($8) and a latte ($2.50) from the coffee bar at Savanna (10 Bridge Avenue, 732-741-6333). This newly renovated cafe and tapas bar fills a section of the restored 80,000-square-foot brick Galleria, a former warehouse and factory where World War I uniforms and parachutes were made.

HEADLINE: Price Index Up Just 0.1% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Consumer prices barely budged in August, suggesting that inflation is not currently a problem for the economy and that Federal Reserve policy makers can stick with a gradual approach to raising interest rates.
 The government's closely watched inflation barometer, the Consumer Price Index, rose by just 0.1 percent in August from the previous month, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Falling prices for clothes, cars and air fares helped to temper rising prices for medical care, education and some food items. The tiny rise came after consumer prices dipped 0.1 percent in July. 
 Excluding energy and food prices, which can swing widely from month to month, core prices also inched up by 0.1 percent in August for the third month in a row. That suggested that most other prices were remaining tame, analysts said.
 From an economic point of view, the inflation picture was slightly better than some analysts were expecting. They were forecasting a 0.2 percent rise in the overall price index and for core prices.
 A slowing in economic growth in the second quarter, analysts said, made it harder for some companies to raise prices and induced others to cut them, thus improving the inflation climate.
 Analysts said the report boded well for the Fed's maintaining a measured approach to raising short-term interest rates.
 Next week, the Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate to 1.75 percent, from 1.50 percent, in what would be its third rate increase this year. Some analysts say rates are still low by historical standards and need to rise to help prevent inflation from becoming a future problem.
 In a separate report,, new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 16,000, to 333,000, the Labor Department said. The pace of layoffs, however, has slowed over the last year. A year ago, new filings were at 401,000.

HEADLINE: Designer Boutiques Rush In to Meet Demands of the Wealthy in Moscow

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON; Rachel M. Thorner in Moscow contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Brawny bodyguards, curled wires stretching from ears to shirt collars, stood waiting and smoking cigarettes on the cobblestone street in an enclave of luxury boutiques here. 
 Suddenly, cigarettes were tossed away, and the men rushed to escort their clients: the impressively dressed, impressively made-up women the residents call the New Russians, shoppers with money, who are not bashful about showing it off. 
 Until recently, well-to-do Muscovites traveled to New York, Paris, Milan and Swiss ski resorts to satisfy their appetite for Gucci handbags, Hermes scarves and Chanel ballerina flats.
 But in the last few years, shops have rushed to open here: Burberry, Hermes, Christian Dior, Salvatore Ferragamo, Gucci, Tod's, Bulgari, Ferrari and dozens more. Since May, Rolls-Royces have been sold at the quintessential Russian address: One Red Square. 
 Despite the economic and political turmoil in Russia, Moscow has become one of the fastest growing luxury markets in the world, said James Oglivy, publisher of Luxury Briefing, a monthly newsletter on the global market. Shoppers here spend an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion a year on luxury goods, including cars and jewelry -- a surprisingly hefty amount, even when compared with the $2 billion spent on high-end clothes and accessories in New York City. 
 The Robb Report, a glossy magazine of over-the-top goods, published in Greenwich, Conn., just decided to print its first foreign-language edition -- in Russian.
 It is no longer just the jet-setters and spouses of the oligarchs who are buying Hermes. With housing and basic services still relatively cheap, Muscovites, on average, spend $4,300 a year on nonfood shopping -- compared with $930 in the rest of Russia, according to a report published by Renaissance Capital, a large investment firm in Moscow. Shoppers, bankers and merchants here, in interviews, say that a significant portion of the money is being devoted to a taste of the good life so long denied.
 And the international luxury-goods companies have responded.
 Five years ago, ''there was nothing, nothing,'' said Anton V. Averin, 28, an executive from Nizhny Novgorod, about a six hours' drive from here. ''Everything has started appearing in Moscow; now we have the very best,'' he said, walking out of the Dolce & Gabbana shop, a few doors from Armani on the Tretyakovsky Passage, an luxury enclave near Red Square.
 Now, Mr. Averin says, he has started buying expensive clothes.
 ''I love Armani, Prada, Zegna, Brioni,'' he said. ''I just bought my wife a pair of pants, jeans and a skirt -- a short one, of course -- from D&G.'' 
 Despite the expansion by foreign retailers, there are significant obstacles to doing business in Moscow. Mr. Oglivy listed ''cumbersome bureaucracy and high import tariffs'' as among them. Steep tariffs on many imported items and most luxury goods make prices even higher in Moscow than in most European cities, said Marvin S. Traub, a retail consultant who is advising the Mercury Group, a large luxury distributor in Moscow.
 In Moscow, there is a virtual monopoly on luxury goods distribution: three companies control almost all the prime space -- a situation that is starting to change, but only glacially. 
 Under licensing arrangements here, a local distributor pays for everything on the ground: the shop, the fixtures, the advertising, the sales clerks. The distributor then pays a percentage of the gross sales, usually 4 percent to 10 percent, to the owner of the brand. Most big names are still part of that arrangement, but in the last year, Louis Vuitton broke the mold, and established its own self-managed store on another upscale shopping street here.
 The average Muscovite follows the rumors about the big brands, and tries to keep track of who might defect from one distributor to the other. Of the three --Mercury, Jamilco and Bosco di Ciliegi -- Mercury is the only one to release sales figures. Last year it sold $350 million of luxury goods in its various boutiques around the city -- and one Russian investment banker said the actual figure was probably double that amount.
 ''We Russians are very reluctant to say too much to the tax people,'' the banker said, refusing to let his name be used because, he said, ''it is not too healthy to be out front too much.''
 To Leonid Friedland, the president and chief executive of Mercury, a heavy-set man who wears Brioni pinstriped suits and presides over his restaurant in Tretyakovsky Passage, there is no real competition.
 Reminded that Chaumet, a luxury watch brand, had just defected to Jamilco, a rival to Mercury in the luxury retailing distribution game, Mr. Friedland pulled a face, shrugging dismissively. ''Chaumet? Chaumet?'' he repeated, as if unfamiliar with the name. ''Why would I care?''
 But to Khaled Jamil, chairman of Jamilco, the battle is just beginning. 
 ''We are competing for the same client base,'' he said.
 Although he will not divulge his company's total sales, his list of brands includes, besides Chaumet, well-known names like Dior, Ferragamo, Hermes, Escada and Burberry. While he acknowledged that Mercury has a firm lead for the jewelry and watch market, he disputes its claim to be No.1 in clothes. 
 As the distributors argue about market share, shoppers milling around the boutiques here grumble about the high prices. ''Everything is so overpriced here, much more expensive than in Europe,'' said Anton Hodus, marketing director for Jacob & Company in New York, who was born in Moscow and was here this summer on business.
 Oxana S. Olenova, a biologist in her late 30's, still buys her clothes in Geneva and Vienna. ''It's cheaper,'' she said. ''Clothes seem to be cheaper in every city other than Moscow. And for some reason, they have more selection.''
 But Ms. Olenova, who mentioned some of her favorites -- boots from Max Mara, bags from Gucci and, for her husband, Armani -- said she was still willing to shop in Moscow. ''I'm off to buy some open-toed shoes in Prada.'' 
 She is the kind of sophisticated customer who appeals to Yves Carcelle, the chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton.
 ''We started to invest in Moscow five years ago,'' Mr. Carcelle said. ''From the beginning, we targeted our customers who bought from us in Paris, in Dubai -- they were already Vuitton customers, so we had a base.'' 
 Versace came first, in 1994. ''For years, Versace was the only one,'' Mr. Jamil said. ''They made a killing. Finally, seeing the lasting success of Versace, other big brands signed up -- first a trickle, now a flood.'' (A spokesman for Versace says the Russian market makes up almost 10 percent of the company's worldwide sales.)
 But for years after the first Versace store opened, ''it was difficult to get the brands,'' to come to Moscow, said Alla Verber, a vice president and the chief buyer for Mercury. To outsiders, Russia's woman were still stereotyped with ''the image of a grandmother wearing a scarf, looking terrible.''
 Now that has changed, but a different stereotype has taken over. ''The image,'' she said, ''is of Russian mafia-types, with all the men wearing red jackets, and the women wearing Versace prints.'' 
 The reluctance on the part of luxury purveyors was not due solely to money, retail executives say; they did not want to spoil the impression of their brands. ''They were content to let the other companies come first,'' Ms. Verber said.
 Now, there are signs that luxury shopping is moving out to the suburbs. Bosco di Ciliegi, one of the big luxury distributors, opened the Crocus Mall, about a 30-minute drive south of Red Square. Next year, Mercury is planning a large mall along another major highway out of town. Alexander Reebok, Mercury's general manager, estimated that as many as 150,000 affluent Russians drive by that site every weekend. 
 ''All the wealthy pass by this one location,'' he said, gesturing toward an elaborate scale model of the proposed shopping center. ''It is our Hamptons.''
 Yet some Russians seem cynical about the suburban palaces. ''They had a man playing a white piano at the Crocus mall,'' one shopper said. ''But nobody else was there. Why would I go driving all the way out there when the same brands have bigger stores here?''
 To Helen Yarmak, who has been running a fur shop near Red Square ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- and who opened a branch in the Crown Building in Manhattan three years ago -- there are two types of customers who buy her sables. 
 ''First there is the independent businesswoman who has a difficult life,'' she said. ''They come into the showroom. They are so exhausted and then they start trying on the furs and they start to sing songs, they have the better mood.''
 Second, there are ''the wives of rich businessmen and, to manage these husbands, that is not easy either.'' 
 ''They desperately need to look great, to travel with husbands,'' she said.
 A full-length Russian sable coat in her store costs anywhere from $25,000 to $150,000.
 ''Not expensive,'' she said. ''This is 'our crowd,' this is our customer. This is the New Russian.'' She paused. ''And this is their therapy.''

HEADLINE: Where Time, Not Terrorism, Is the Enemy

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
ELEVEN steps down from Eldridge Street, in a room worn with age, two dozen worshipers greeted the Jewish New Year yesterday armed with nothing but prayers.
 No security guard stood watch at the door. No unsightly concrete barriers ringed the sidewalk, as they do outside many Jewish institutions these days -- a sad necessity in an age when Islamic terrorists have made targets of Jews living anywhere and everywhere.
 Instead on this Rosh Hashana, which signaled the start of the Jewish calendar year 5765, worshipers at the struggling Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side had only prayers. Why would anyone have thought they might need more than that? 
 The only reason was a weird coda to a terror alert last month from the Department of Homeland Security. That was the warning of possible threats to financial bastions like Citigroup, the World Bank and the New York Stock Exchange.
 Oh, and by the way, a newsweekly reported at the time, the counterterrorism types are also worried about the Eldridge Street Synagogue.
 Hello? Citigroup, the stock exchange, the World Bank and the Eldridge Street Synagogue, long past its glory years and drawing maybe 15 worshipers -- 20, tops -- to a typical Sabbath service. Does the phrase ''what's wrong with this picture?'' come to mind?
 Apparently, it was all a misunderstanding. Neither the police nor the synagogue had heard of any specific threat. Other Jewish institutions clearly knew better, too. The mistaken report ''didn't even generate one phone call to ask, 'Are you O.K.?''' said Paul P.E. Bookson, a retired state judge and former state senator who is president of the congregation that forms the synagogue, K'hal Adath Jeshurun with Anshe Lubz.
 ''I don't know if I'm reassured by that, or whether it shows their lack of interest,'' Mr. Bookson said with a laugh during an interview before the start of Rosh Hashana.
 With good reason, supposed terrorism threats concern Eldridge Street less than the challenge of making it through yet another day, another week, another month.
 The neo-Moorish building, a faded beauty declared a national historic landmark in 1996, had its heyday long ago. That was in the early decades after it was completed in 1887, the first great synagogue built on these shores by waves of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
 No New York neighborhood ever stays the same. Jews moved uptown, or decamped to the suburbs. One by one, synagogues on the Lower East Side closed. Decorative plaques from their Holy Arks, the often-ornate cabinets where Torah scrolls are stored, adorn a wall at Eldridge Street -- silent tribute to what once was.
 Eldridge Street itself hung on, but barely, an anomaly on a block that became part of the expanding Chinatown. The synagogue fell into serious disrepair, a waterlogged mess. As far back as the 1950's, the shrinking congregation retreated from the sumptuous main sanctuary to a study hall downstairs, the same modest room where worshipers gathered yesterday.
 FOR the last 18 years, bringing the building back from near death has been the mission of a nonsectarian group called the Eldridge Street Project. The worst is over, said Amy E. Waterman, the project's executive director.
 Thanks to private donations and government money, the structural damage has been undone, although years of work remain to restore the sanctuary to anywhere near its former glory. Cultural and educational programs lure 20,000 visitors a year: schoolchildren on class trips, Europeans interested in architecture, suburban Jews looking to connect briefly with their families' past.
 ''People talk about nostalgia as a cheap emotion,'' Ms. Waterman said, ''but pleasant memories of childhood and one's grandparents are good things.'' And who knows? The bizarre terrorism report last month might even prove a blessing of sorts. When the inevitable pitches for money are made, she said, it is possible that ''people may pay more attention.''
 That's for the physical part of the synagogue. Its soul, the congregation, is another matter.
 The numbers, as the Rosh Hashana service showed, are hardly brilliant. But they seem to have stabilized, said Mr. Bookson, whose grandfather was a member in 1887. Neighborhood newcomers, including some young Jews, offer a measure of hope, reflected in a banner at the synagogue that says, ''Your arrival is our survival.''
 Besides, it was the New Year, a season of hope, not threats or fears. ''As you see,'' Mr. Bookson said, ''we're still alive.''

HEADLINE: Clear Channel Is Expanding In Spanish Radio

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

 BODY:
Clear Channel Communications, the nation's biggest radio conglomerate, said yesterday that it planned to convert up to 25 of its stations to Spanish-language formats as it pursues a larger share of the advertising dollars aimed at Hispanic listeners.
 The shift, expected to take place in the next 12 to 18 months, will more than double the number of Spanish-language stations in Clear Channel's empire, and will position the company to compete directly against the Hispanic marketplace's dominant radio players, including Univision Communications Inc. and the Spanish Broadcasting System. Clear Channel now has 18 stations broadcasting in Spanish, fewer than 2 percent of its 1,200 stations.
 The move is a return to the marketplace for Clear Channel, which sold its stake in Univision earlier this year. 
 The company began the transition by switching WMAX, a relatively weak Atlanta talk station, to a Spanish-language rock station this week. Clear Channel's new senior vice president for Spanish-language stations, Alfredo Alonso, said he was studying other markets, of various sizes, as potential candidates for the next changeover. 
 While the company is expected to face stiff competition, particularly in cities with established Spanish-language stations like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, it may be able to draw on its influence with English-language advertisers to attract more marketing dollars. 
 Mr. Alonso said it would be up to the company to develop compelling programming to drum up business. 
 ''It's not like Clear Channel can walk in and say, 'We're Clear Channel so you better start buying us,''' he said. 
 The shift to Spanish-language stations is one outgrowth of the intersection of media consolidation and demographics. Since federal lawmakers deregulated the radio industry with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, broadcasters have been increasing their holdings while advertisers have been pouring more money into campaigns aimed at fast-growing minority populations.
 Univision moved last year to take advantage of both trends, buying the rival Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, in which Clear Channel owned a 26 percent stake, for about $3 billion. Clear Channel sold its shares in the expanded Univision and is reaching back into the market using its own radio portfolio, which was formed by a series of multibillion-dollar mergers in the wake of the deregulation. 
 The company now faces the prospect of competing against radio stations in which it was a part owner just a year ago. But Mr. Alonso said ''that happens every day in the new era of media ownership.''
 Since selling its shares in Hispanic Broadcasting last year, Clear Channel has been hungry for a piece of the Spanish-language radio market, which Mr. Alonso estimated reached $700 million in revenue last year, out of $20 billion for the industry over all. Analysts project Spanish-language radio revenue will rise about 10 percent this year, far more than its English-language counterpart.
 Hispanic buying power has been growing rapidly. According to a recent report by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia that estimated disposable income, Hispanic buying power will total $923 billion by 2008. 
 But radio executives estimate that advertising on Spanish-language stations sells at as much as a 40 percent discount to ads on English-language stations, and there is intense competition for what business there is in the Hispanic market. 
 Clear Channel could start with some disadvantages. Rivals point out that the company may be unwilling to devote its most powerful radio signals in major markets to the format, which could make it tough for new programming to gain traction. 
 Some also said the company would have trouble developing new talent because Spanish-language radio, which has a presence in fewer markets, lacks the expansive farm system that exists for English-language broadcasters. 
 ''I think it's a long way between what they'd like to do and how they're going to get there,'' said Bill Tanner, executive vice president for programming at the Spanish Broadcasting System.
 Mr. Alonso, however, said there were ample opportunities for the company, especially in small and midsize cities that lack Spanish-language programming. He also suggested that the company could draw more listeners by finding new niches instead of sticking with the conventional genres, like regional Mexican music, that compose the bulk of Spanish-language music sales in the United States. 
 ''The only way you can make money in broadcasting,'' he said, ''is to deliver an audience.''

HEADLINE: Browsing in Bethlehem: Tidy Brick on a Foundation of Steel

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
IN Bethlehem, Pa., the abandoned steel works stand like an Alexander Calder nightmare -- skeletal, spooky and weirdly mesmerizing. Dark, angular buildings, where 30,000 people once worked at coke ovens, blast furnaces and sheet mills, loom vacant for block after block, more than three miles in all. Above the locked gates, a clock is permanently stopped at 11:30, halted with the plant, which produced its last steel in 2001.
 On the other side of the city, across the swift-flowing Lehigh River, shoppers and cafegoers mingle in a historic district of tidy brick buildings, and drivers hunt for parking spots on picturesque hilly streets. Moravian College, founded in the 1740's, has a green and serene downtown campus. Nearby, young families have restored regal century-old houses built by executives of Bethlehem Steel. 
 And on a hill far above the old plant, the main campus of Lehigh University, looking down from Gothic stone towers, offers up a steady stream of lively students to keep the old town young.
 ''A lot of people hear Bethlehem and think, ooh, ick, it's a depressed area,'' said Dana DeVito, the general manager of the Moravian Book Shop on Main Street. The store she runs is a prime example of what changes their minds. In business since the 1740's, it has gone beyond its venerable roots to include not just the traditional well-stocked bookstore, but a collection of entertaining boutiques good for hours of browsing. Ms. DeVito, who moved here a decade ago from New Jersey, said that she herself was surprised at first by the town's contrasts.
 But they make an intriguing combination for a day-tripping sightseer. Bethlehem, conscious of its yin-and-yang appeal, is trying to complement its pretty historic district by developing a National Museum of Industrial History at the old steel plant. The Smithsonian Institution is committed to an affiliation, but the city has to raise the money.
 In the meantime, a drive along Third Street, from Stelko Boulevard to Broadway (Route 378), conveys the hulking plant's sheer brooding immensity, communicating what the loss of the old manufacturing behemoths meant to the economic life of Rust Belt towns. Anyone who ventures down a service drive around back of the fenced-off buildings in search of an open gate, however, will quickly be confronted by a security guard racing up in a white sport utility vehicle.
 THE most comprehensive view is from the Minsi Trail Bridge over the Lehigh, which runs right through the complex and allows a look deep down inside the plant, at acres of desolation.
 The lighthearted district at the other end of the bridge is the perfect counterpoint. The Moravian Book Shop's boutiques sprawl for nearly a full block, offering wares from the latest kitchen gadgets to hip greeting cards to Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. Stacked in the bookstore itself -- where authors frequently stop by -- are wooden blocks with sketches of city buildings. The one that sells fastest, Ms. DeVito said, depicts Bethlehem Steel.
 Just up Main Street, Johnny's Bagels and Deli has handmade bagels and a big variety of sandwiches. Also on Main, Granny McCarthy's Tea Room features a meaty Celtic breakfast on Saturdays, along with a lunch menu and a full selection of teas, but is best known for its white-chocolate-laced scones.
 On street signs and the facades of old buildings are variations on the Moravian star, a round center with 26 spikes -- remembrances of the German Protestants who founded the town. More stars, with twinkling lights, come out at Christmastime, when Bethlehem capitalizes on its name with a festival of seasonal activities, concerts, church services and holiday foods.
 The town's early history is retold at the Moravian Museum on West Church Street, a collection of old buildings including the Gemeinhaus, a large structure that was built in 1741 and is a National Historic Landmark, as well as a cemetery and an herb garden.
 Back on the north side of the river, climbing up a long slope above the old mill, modest houses built for steelworkers hug tight to each other, differing mostly at the the rooflines, where some have cupolas and gingerbread. Still farther up is the park-like 1,600-acre Lehigh campus, with vistas from sidewalks and terraces. Lee Iacocca, the automotive executive who was born in nearby Allentown, went to Lehigh and in 1988 returned to give the university the Iacocca Institute, dedicated to global competitiveness in manufacturing.
 Down below on Third Street, west of the steel complex, a fledgling arts district is anchored by Monsoon, a gallery on East Third Street with an eclectic mix of colorful modern art and sculpture from local, national and international artists.
 Rounding out the day with dinner in Bethlehem means choosing not just a place, but an era. One downtown choice, the Sun Inn, was built in 1758 as a way station for visitors and still serves traditional American food. Another, the Apollo Grill, represents the modern side with a streamlined interior and a full menu including more than two dozen appetizers. Many diners make two or three of them a whole meal.

 FROM Manhattan, take the Lincoln Tunnel or the George Washington Bridge to the Garden State Parkway south. Head west on Interstate 78 to Route 22 west, then south on Route 378 to Exit 3 (Center City) in Bethlehem. At the stop sign at the top of the exit, make a left onto Third Avenue. At the next stoplight, turn left onto Broad Street to enter downtown Bethlehem, north of the Lehigh River.
 The Apollo Grill (85 West Broad Street, 610-865-9600) has a full menu including entrees and desserts, along with a wide range of appetizers.
 The Sun Inn, (564 Main Street, 610-866-1758) has a Colonial theme and serves traditional American entrees and desserts.

HEADLINE: Weekender Shandaken, N.Y.

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR

 BODY:
IN Shandaken, you can spend the morning at a Buddhist retreat, the afternoon fly-fishing and the evening in a fine restaurant. Rugged hiking trails and world-class trout streams coexist with art galleries and luxury spas. Housekeeping cabins from the 1950's are just down the road from $500-a-night hotels.
 The common denominator for everyone who loves this area is the beauty of the mountains, mostly wild and unmarred by development in this part of the Catskills, and the feeling of being far from civilization.
 ''You get in touch with all those little voices inside your head that are automatically tuned out in the city,'' said Nancy Golladay, a playwright and theater instructor from Brooklyn. ''It's just you and the trees and the stars.'' Last October, Ms. Golladay and her husband, David Congdon, bought a contemporary house near a stream in the hamlet of Woodland Valley as a weekend retreat. Mr. Congdon said they had spent about $100,000 less than they would have for a comparable property in nearby Dutchess County or Connecticut. 
 The word Shandaken (shan-DAY-kin) means rapid water and it is what the Esopus Indians of the Algonquin Nation called this mountainous area. The township, about 15 miles west of Woodstock, has wilderness, countryside and 12 small hamlets: Shandaken, Woodland Valley, Mount Tremper, Mount Pleasant, Phoenicia, Chichester, Allaben, Bushnellsville, Big Indian, Oliverea, Pine Hill and Highmount. It lies within the Catskill Park, and more than 70 percent of the land in town is state-owned and protected from development.
 The rare native rainbow trout and the more common brown trout swim in Esopus Creek, one of Shandaken's most beloved assets, and the occasional human in an inner tube or kayak floats on it, too. The Esopus, renowned for fly-fishing, feeds into the Ashokan Reservoir, one of New York City's main sources of water.
 The mountains (Slide Mountain, the tallest, is 4,204 feet) are full of hiking trails, and the state-owned Belleayre Mountain Ski Resort offers 37 downhill skiing trails and holds concerts during the summer. In the fall, hunters pursue deer, bear and turkey.
 When Serge and Lynne Volpe were considering buying a weekend home last year, it was the peace and quiet that clinched the deal. ''You can press 'clear' on your brain, and you leave here refreshed,'' said Mr. Volpe, a senior programmer and analyst for the Bank of America who lives in White Plains and works in Manhattan. In August 2003 the couple bought a three-bedroom log-faced ranch house for $162,000.

The Scene
 The Shandaken area has long been a place of spiritual retreat. Big Indian was the site of an ashram in the 70's; Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix used to frequent an Indian sweat lodge in Woodland Valley. Today, the Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, a Buddhist training center, holds retreats that are open to the public. The Menla Mountain Retreat and Conference Center in Phoenicia is run by the Tibet House in Manhattan and rents facilities for staff retreats. 
 Between 35 percent and 40 percent of all residents are vacation-home owners who live in town only part time, according to the town supervisor, Bob Cross Jr.
 Artists and musicians are drawn to Shandaken in part because of recording studios and galleries in nearby Woodstock. ''There is gay, straight, young, old,'' said Laura Levine, a painter and filmmaker from New York who owns an antiques store in Phoenicia and lives part time in Mount Tremper. ''It's a nice, balanced community.''
 Starting in the 1950's, the town became a weekend getaway popular with French chefs in New York, including Jacques Pepin and Pierre Franey. Some of them moved to Shandaken and opened restaurants. Other people of French descent soon followed. ''A lot of people from the Pyrenees came here because it reminded them of the countryside in France,'' said Martine Gaudet, an owner of La Duchesse Anne, a restaurant in Mount Tremper. Though the French influence has lessened, she said, French conversation can still be overheard occasionally. 
 In the first half of the 20th century, Babe Ruth vacationed in Shandaken. Another frequent visitor was Dutch Schultz, the Prohibition-era gangster, who was rumored to have buried money and other treasures near Esopus Creek. People still show up with shovels and metal detectors to hunt for it. In 2001, Ms. Levine made a documentary about them called ''Digging for Dutch.''
 For the last few years, the hot topic in town has been the proposed development of a 500-acre resort adjacent to Belleayre Mountain Ski Center. Plans include two golf courses, two hotels with a total of 400 rooms, 350 town houses, tennis courts, restaurants and a wilderness activity center.
 A coalition of 11 environmental groups opposes the project, as do many local residents. Roadside signs proclaim ''Green Not Greed'' and ''Trees Not Tees.'' Tom Alworth, executive director of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development in Arkville, N.Y., said that the biggest fears were that the Esopus would be polluted and that the appearance of the mountain would be marred. Last month, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the city's water system, said that it would withhold permits for the resort unless the developer could show that the project would not pollute streams and rivers that feed the reservoir.
 Dean L. Gitter, managing partner for the project developer, Crossroads Ventures, argued that the project's proposed ''modern pesticide program'' would avoid polluted runoff. He said that there would be ''virtually no impact'' on views of the mountain from public land. Mr. Gitter moved from Boston 33 years ago to join the ashram in Big Indian that has since disbanded. Now a silver-haired, conservatively dressed businessman, Mr. Gitter said that the resort would revive a sagging local economy. ''I relished being in the wilderness,'' he said, ''but after 30 years here I began to understand that this is a tough place to earn a living.'' He said that the project -- costing as much as $300 million -- could create more than 500 full-time jobs with a median salary of $30,000.

Pros
 Phoenicia has a picturesque one-block-long main street with several restaurants, five antiques shops, two real estate offices, a pharmacy, two home furnishings stores and several art galleries. A line forms outside Sweet Sue's, which serves breakfast and lunch, on most weekend mornings.
 Shandaken has held onto its innocent, small-town charm despite a big jump in real estate prices and an influx of city people. There are well-attended Memorial Day and Halloween parades and an annual ''rubber ducky'' race. On the second floor of Phoenicia's library are an anglers' museum and a supply of fishing rods that residents can sign out for two weeks at a time. 
 The town is serious about relaxation. ''You're overdressed if you're wearing anything spiffier than a T-shirt and shorts,'' said June Eisland, a weekender for 30 years who runs a consulting firm in Manhattan. ''If your yard is a little wild, no one raises an eyebrow. It just blends into the woods.''

Cons
 If fireflies and raccoons are your idea of night life, Shandaken has plenty. But bars that stay open until the wee hours don't exist. ''A lot of people come up here and say, 'It's so quiet -- what do you do?' '' said Lea Haas Fridrich, who moved to Shandaken six years ago. ''It's about doing nothing at all.''
 The Town Tinker in Phoenicia does a brisk business renting inner tubes for rides on the Esopus ($10 a day, $12 for one with a seat), but many find the water too cold for anything more than wading. In August, water temperatures can still be in the 50's -- perfect for trout, chilly for humans.

The Real Estate Market
 Housing prices rose 10 percent to 15 percent a year from the late 90's until 2001, according to Marilyn Nasstrum, an associate broker for Ruth Gale Real Estate in Phoenicia. But, she said, ''after 9/11, things got absolutely wild,'' with prices almost doubling by this year and some properties attracting multiple bidders.
 Still, property remains relatively inexpensive. Houses in Woodstock, 15 miles to the east, cost 30 percent to 50 percent more, Ms. Nasstrum said.
 On the market this week were a 1920's rustic summer cabin on a stream with two bedrooms, one bathroom and a river-stone fireplace for $169,000; a Victorian farmhouse with six bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms and a barn for $249,900, reduced from $325,000; and a five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath house with a heated in-ground pool and a separate efficiency apartment for $850,000 on 8.2 acres, or $1.15 million on 40 acres.

HEADLINE: An Unlikely Love Takes Root In the Barren Ground of War

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''Zelary,'' which takes place in a small village in Czechoslovakia during the Nazi occupation, was the official submission of the Czech Republic to last year's Academy Awards. The movie, directed by Ondrej Trojan and based on a novella by Kveta Legatova, might be said to belong to the official genre of European nominees for the best foreign-language film Oscar, since it is yet another small-scale drama of life during World War II. It has a familiar, lived-in feel, and if its observations of rural life at a time of political turmoil don't feel terribly original, they are nonetheless absorbing and sometimes powerful.
 Eliska (Ana Geislerova) is a medical student in Prague involved in the Resistance. After her lover, a doctor who is also one of her comrades, is arrested, she flees the city in the company of Joza (Gyorgy Cserhalmi), a woodcutter whose life she had saved by providing her blood for his transfusion. He returns the favor by taking her to Zelary, a remote mountain hamlet populated by colorful characters as well as some dangerous ones. To escape the attention of the Gestapo, Eliska reluctantly marries Joza and then, to her surprise if not to ours, falls in love with him. 
 Mr. Cserhalmi, burly and soft-spoken, and Ms. Geislerova, who bears a passing resemblance to Isabelle Huppert, are both subtle, serious actors, and they handle the relationship between their characters with patience and precision. Mr. Trojan is similarly patient, allowing the story to ripen and evolve according to the seasonal rhythms of the countryside rather than marching it from one incident to the next. His camera wanders around the rugged, beautiful landscape, across the mountainsides and through the forests, as Zelary's human tableau comes quietly to life.
 Overseen by a kindly priest and a temperamental school headmaster, the village has its share of internal problems as well as the persistent outside threat of the Nazis, who summarily execute anyone found sheltering partisans. Life there includes drunkenness, spousal abuse and sometimes violent discord between parents and children, in addition to the cycles of birth, death and domestic economy. Eliska -- who now calls herself Hana -- negotiates the customs and habits of this strange, isolated place with the nervous tact of someone learning a foreign language.
 As she responds to Joza's simple kindness and to the solicitude of the local women, she becomes more fluent, and trades some of her urban refinement for peasant toughness. Her medical skills and her native courage also prove useful to the villagers in times of crisis, which are plentiful.
 Watching ''Zelary,'' which opens today in New York, I found myself reminded, curiously enough, of ''Cold Mountain,'' another story of feminine resiliency in wartime, also shot in the mountains of Eastern Europe. Perhaps because this film also takes place in those mountains, it has a more authentic, less artificial feel. A lot of what happens, especially in the subplots percolating outside of Joza and Hana's cozy cottage, is not hard to anticipate, but you nonetheless welcome each turn of the story, as if you were reading a well-liked, half-forgotten novel for the second time. 
 ''Zelary'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence, and some nudity.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: City Jobless Rate Falls

BYLINE: By Lydia Polgreen (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level since September 2001 last month, as the city added 48,600 jobs in the past year, according to statistics released yesterday by the State Labor Department. 
The city unemployment rate was 6.7 percent, down from 7.5 in July and 8.4 percent a year ago. The state unemployment rate edged lower still, to 5.6 percent, close to the national rate of 5.4 percent. Several sectors drove the job growth, which was led by strong gains in employment services, publishing, broadcasting, retail and leisure and hospitality, while the city's signature industry, finance, remained basically flat.

HEADLINE: 2 Canadian Agencies Make Acquisitions

BYLINE: By Nat Ives

 BODY:
Two Canadian agency companies have made acquisitions, both for undisclosed terms.
 MDC Partners in Toronto continued a buying streak that began last year when it acquired a 49.9 percent interest in Zig, a Toronto agency with 38 employees who work for clients like Ikea Canada, Greenpeace and Unilever Canada. 
Zig was opened in 1999 by Elspeth Lynn, Andy Macaulay and Lorraine Tao, who continue as the agency's principals.
 MDC has bought majority or minority interests in advertising and design agencies including Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami, the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York, Bruce Mau Design in Toronto and VitroRobertson in San Diego. 
 The Cossette Communication Group in Quebec City acquired a public relations agency in London, the Band & Brown Group. Band & Brown has 85 employees and billings estimated at $9 million from clients like Cisco Systems and Sony Ericsson. The deal is the second for Cossette in Britain since December, when it bought Identica.

HEADLINE: Fed Study Regards Its Strategy a Success

BYLINE: Dow Jones

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
An unusual strategy adopted by the Federal Reserve in the summer of 2003 for stoking the nation's economy without cutting interest rates was a success, researchers at the central bank have concluded in a new study. 
 The study, led by a Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, says the central bank exerted powerful effects on longer-term interest rates by promising to keep the key short-term federal funds rate low for a ''considerable period.'' 
 The study's conclusions support the confidence that many Fed policy makers showed late in 2002 and early 2003 as Wall Street fretted that the central bank was running out of ammunition to stimulate the economy.
 By July of 2003, the Fed had dropped the federal funds to a 45-year low of 1 percent without generating what it could consider a sustainable economic recovery. 
 The policy makers decided at that point to stop cutting interest rates. They switched instead to a strategy that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues call ''policymaking by thesaurus.''
 For the first time in its history, the Fed began to make public statements about how it might change interest rates over a horizon beyond six to eight weeks. 
 ''Shaping investor expectations through communication does appear to be a viable strategy,'' Mr. Bernanke and his co-authors, Vincent R. Reinhart and Brian P. Sack, concluded.
 ''By persuading the public that the policy rate will remain low for a longer period than expected,'' they wrote, ''central bankers can reduce long-term rates and provide some impetus to the economy, even if the short-term rate is close to zero.''

HEADLINE: Mexico and Japan Expect To Sign Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan will sign a free trade agreement Friday that Mexico hopes will attract more investment from Japanese manufacturers and spur exports across the Pacific. 
 Mexico has long been seeking to reduce its dependence on the United States for trade and investment and has engaged in a flurry of deal-making over the last decade. It has 11 free trade agreements covering 32 countries. 
 The accord, which is subject to approval by legislatures in both countries, is Japan's second, after an agreement with Singapore. 
 Japan's exports to Mexico -- about $7.6 billion last year -- dwarf Mexico's sales of about $1.2 billion to Japan.
 For Japan, the deal offers a chance to compete on equal footing with American and European companies that manufacture in Mexico. 
 ''It's a huge domestic market as well as a gateway to Latin America and into the European Union,'' said Ryu Yamazaki, Japan's chief negotiator for the agreement, in an interview. Most imports from the United States, Canada and Europe enter Mexico duty-free, while Japanese goods face an average tariff of 16 percent. 
 The automakers Nissan, Honda and Toyota all supported the pact because it would lower the cost of importing parts from Japan for the models they produce in Mexico, both for the domestic market and for export.
 Electronics giants like Sony and Matsushita, which have been manufacturing in Mexico for the American market since the 1980's, will also benefit from more predictable rules for importing components from Japan. Almost two-thirds of Japan's exports to Mexico are components used in export industries. 
 The agreement includes a chapter on the business environment and will create a committee to address Japanese companies' concerns about doing business in Mexico, touching on subjects from capricious regulations to the high crime rate. 
 ''You need security, predictability and transparency to get the investor here,'' Mr. Yamazaki said. 
 The government of Mexico hopes that by lowering tariffs and reducing uncertainty for investors, the pact will lead to more Japanese investment in the country. The government aims to increase investment from Japan to about $12.7 billion over the next 10 years. Mexico received just 1.3 percent of the $26 billion that Japanese companies have invested overseas since 1994, according to Mexico's economy ministry. 
 ''This economic partnership agreement hopefully will bring Mexico back onto the Japanese radar screen,'' Mr. Yamazaki said.
 The economy ministry is also promoting the free trade agreement as a boon for the country's agricultural exporters, arguing that it opens access to the nation that is the world's largest food importer. Japan imports about 60 percent of its food needs -- about $50 billion -- but Mexico accounted for just $395 million of that last year, the Mexican economy ministry said. Haggling over agriculture delayed the pact's completion for months as Japanese pig farmers and orange juice producers fought to defend their market from Mexican imports. Mexico eventually won quotas for pork, oranges and orange juice. 
 The government expects that increased trade and investment will create about 82,000 jobs a year in Mexico during the next 10 years.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* ''THE BOURNE SUPREMACY,'' starring Matt Damon. Directed by Paul Greengrass (PG-13; 120 minutes). It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11 this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies and counterspies from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Mr. Damon as Jason Bourne, the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The thriller reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a film that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride (Stephen Holden).

''THE BROWN BUNNY,'' starring Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. Written and directed by Mr. Gallo (not rated, 92 minutes). Neither an atrocity nor a revelation, ''The Brown Bunny'' is a very watchable, often beautiful-looking attempt by Mr. Gallo to reproduce the kind of loosely structured mood pieces that found American and select foreign-language cinemas of the 1960's and 70's often at their most adventurous, with Monte Hellman's 1971 ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' the most obvious touchstone. Mr. Gallo plays Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer (and the title's symbolic bunny) on his way back home to Los Angeles from a New Hampshire meet. As Bud racks up miles, he stares moodily at the road, visits a childhood haunt, eats a lonely meal, sleeps a lonely motel sleep, takes his motorcycle for a spin and exchanges small talk with a few women, all of whom have the soft, bruised look of chronic disappointment. Eventually Bud hits Los Angeles, where he checks into a hotel, and where yet another flower of femininity, Ms. Sevigny's Daisy, gives the film its back story and furnishes what the porn industry calls, in rather more direct language, its economic raison d'etre (Manohla Dargis).

* ''CELLULAR,'' starring Kim Basinger, Chris Evans and William H. Macy (PG-13, 89 minutes). In this improbable, improbably entertaining action thriller, a Los Angeles science teacher (Ms. Basinger) is kidnapped by a squad of baddies who lock her in an attic with a telephone that works just well enough for her to connect, at random, with the cellphone of a surfer (Mr. Evans), who spends the rest of the movie trying to rescue her. In an age of self-important, bloated blockbusters, this movie, directed with breeziness and rigor by Mr. Ellis, is a refreshing rarity: an honest, unpretentious B picture, with enough decent jokes, crackerjack car chases and plot convolutions to make the price of the ticket seem like a reasonable bargain. Mr. Macy adds a wry, touching note as the weary L.A.P.D. veteran who helps the surfer in his effort to save the science teacher (A. O. Scott).

* ''COLLATERAL,'' starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 115 minutes). In ''Collateral,'' the edgy new thriller from Mr. Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Mr. Foxx), and the assassin Vincent (Mr. Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously made commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith (Dargis).

''CRIMINAL,'' starring John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Directed by Gregory Jacobs (R, 87 minutes). Mr. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal in ''Criminal'' of a gimlet-eyed con man allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in ''Chicago'' to leak into his performance. But the Mametesque film has strong supporting performances by Mr. Luna, as Mr. Reilly's not-so-naive protege in swindling, and Ms. Gyllenhaal, as Mr. Reilly's angry sister. The film, a fairly faithful adaptation of the Argentine director Fabian Bielinski's ''Nine Queens,'' is a clever and diverting caper, relocated from South America to Los Angeles. Instead of rare stamps being pursued by assorted grifters and counterfeiters, the priceless fetish being sought is the counterfeit of an 1878 Monroe silver certificate. Mr. Mamet covered roughly the same territory with far more zest and cunning in ''House of Games,'' a movie that unlike ''Criminal'' leaves you with the uneasy sense of living in a world run by diabolically clever thieves gloating over the naivete of suckers like you and me (Holden).

''EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING,'' starring Stellan Skarsgard and James D'Arcy. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 114 minutes). Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's Army boots are nowhere to be found in ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to ''The Exorcist,'' William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Mr. Skarsgard as the character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks. But when push comes to demonic shove, hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup, just as surely as some producers have no shame. Despite Mr. Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, however, the film singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly, it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh (Dargis).

''HERO,'' starring Jet Li. Directed by Zhang Yimou (PG-13, 99 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). In Mr. Zhang's ''Hero,'' an ambitious period epic about the birth of the first Chinese empire, warriors fly through the air like birds of prey, their swords cutting through enemies and lovers alike. Set during the third century B.C., the story of an assassination plot unfolds with such dazzling bursts of color and blurs of furious action that it might be easy to miss the nationalistic message tucked amid the visual enchantments. The martial-arts film star Jet Li is the title's nameless warrior, who claims to have vanquished the king's most feared enemies, Sky (Donnie Yen), Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and the powerful Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). In time, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang signals with shifts of color that flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen. Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool (Dargis).

* ''MARIA FULL OF GRACE,'' starring Catalina Sandino Moreno and Yenny Paola Vega. Written and directed by Joshua Marston (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Ms. Sandino) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms. Sandino's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromise but never undermine her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed (Holden).

''OPEN WATER,'' starring Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Written and directed by Chris Kentis (R, 79 minutes). In this minimalist, digital video thriller, a tourist couple spend their vacation trying not to be eaten by sharks. ''I wanted to go skiing,'' complains Susan (Ms. Ryan), and you can hardly blame her. She and Daniel (Mr. Travis), her boyfriend, out for a morning of scuba diving, have been left behind by the charter boat, and they bob up and down, fighting panic, exhaustion and each other in a desperate struggle to survive. The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too underdramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort. Susan and Daniel are so bland that they could be anybody, which is the problem, and your sympathy for them is fleeting, as if you had encountered them in a short, grisly item on the local evening news (Scott).

''THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2: ROYAL ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Anne Hathaway, Chris Pine and Heather Matarazzo. Directed by Garry Marshall (G, 120 minutes). In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for this new feature-length fairy tale, the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Ms. Hathaway), a onetime San Francisco teenager turned Old World pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Mr. Marshall, who has been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in ''Pretty Woman,'' and written by Shonda Rhimes, ''The Princess Diaries 2'' combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake, too (Dargis).

* ''RED LIGHTS,'' starring Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet. Directed by Cedric Kahn (not rated, 106 minutes; in French with English subtitles). This brilliant, sinister French thriller is a twisty road movie in which every sign points toward catastrophe. As night falls during the journey of an unhappily married couple from Paris to Bordeaux, the clogged highway takes them into descending levels of psychosexual hell. Mr. Darroussin's Antoine is a mousy, balding insurance salesman who hates his job and resents his more successful wife, a sleek corporate lawyer. The movie is a study of male passive aggression that comes up with a malicious Hemingwayesque solution to Antoine's masculinity crisis. When his wife, fed up with his drinking on the road, deserts him to take the train, he picks up a hitchhiker he knows may be a dangerous escaped convict and courts the redemptive (and grisly) male rite of passage he's been seeking. Following Jean-Luc Godard's ''Weekend'' and Claire Denis's ''Friday Night,'' ''Red Lights'' uses the traffic jam as a potent screen metaphor for something bigger (Holden).

''VANITY FAIR,'' starring Reese Witherspoon and James Purefoy. Directed by Mira Nair (PG-13, 141 minutes). Her eyes snapping like tiny firecrackers, Ms. Witherspoon makes an appealingly crafty Becky Sharp in Ms. Nair's bland but color-drenched screen adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel. The star, as usual, conveys a bristly, determined spunk. But if her performance emits enough sparks to hold the screen, it never ignites a dramatic brush fire. You long for more Scarlett O'Hara and less Elle Woods. Her Becky comes across as a lightweight schemer about as formidable as an aspiring trophy wife on a daytime soap. In compressing a novel that spans three decades of the early 19th century, the movie becomes increasingly hurried and eventually loses track of time, and in trying to mix satire and romance it proves once again that the two are about as compatible as lemon juice and heavy cream. It flashes to comic life in those scenes that convey Thackeray's disdain for the preening foolishness and snobbery of early 19th-century English society and the crass symbiotic relationship between money and aristocracy (Holden).

HEADLINE: EDWARDS ENDS RURAL TOUR

BYLINE: By Randal C. Archibold (NYT)

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards concluded a two-day bus tour of rural Ohio and West Virginia on Thursday with spirited attacks on the Bush administration's record in Iraq and on the economy and health care. Taking note that Mr. Bush was speaking on health care in Minnesota, Mr. Edwards told a crowd of a few thousand in Portsmouth, Ohio, ''I hear it was a short speech,'' before accusing the administration of allowing the number of people without health insurance to increase by 5 million, to 45 million, during Mr. Bush's term. Mr. Edwards visited several small towns in southeastern Ohio and northwest West Virginia. The Bush campaign responded in a statement with a bevy of statistics that it said suggested the economy was being revived. Randal C. Archibold (NYT)

HEADLINE: Those Soaring Medicare Premiums

 BODY:
The Medicare premium increase announced last week -- the largest in the program's history -- has ratcheted up campaign accusations on both sides. John Kerry's campaign is accusing President Bush of failing to restrain the escalation in health costs that is propelling the increase, but this is not an issue that lends itself readily to a blame game. The inescapable truth is that costs throughout the health care system, not just in Medicare, continue to escalate. Someone -- generally the patients or the taxpayers -- must pay the bills. The question raised by the Medicare premium debate is whether too much of the burden is now falling on beneficiaries. 
 There is no doubt that the higher premiums will be onerous for elderly Americans whose income is just a bit too high to qualify for various subsidies. The Medicare Part B premium, which covers doctors' services and outpatient costs, will jump by 17.4 percent next year, to $78.20 from $66.60 a month. That increase of $11.60 a month will take a big bite out of the annual cost-of-living increase added to Social Security checks, thus eroding beneficiaries' ability to meet rising costs in other areas. 
 In the current year, for example, retirees with a monthly benefit of $1,000, about the average for retired men, saw nearly 40 percent of their cost-of-living increase eaten up by a Medicare premium increase, while more than a million Americans had their entire Social Security increase wiped out by the higher premiums. 
 The Bush White House points out, correctly, that most of the increase is based on laws that Mr. Kerry supported in the Senate. By law, beneficiaries are required to pay 25 percent of the costs of the Medicare Part B program, while general tax revenues pay for the other 75 percent. The biggest factor driving up the costs of the medical care outside hospitals is an increase in payments to doctors. Like most things about Medicare, the doctors' fees are based on a formula, which actually dictated that fees be cut 4.5 percent. But Congress yielded to the pleas of medical lobbyists and granted a 1.5 percent increase instead. Critics may see this as caving in to special interests, but the rise will not allow the doctors to keep up with inflation. 
 The next biggest factor in the premium increase is the need, seemingly indisputable, for money to beef up a reserve fund so it is actuarially sound. About $1.75 of the monthly increase will subsidize managed care plans that participate in Medicare. That, too, was a bow to lobbyists from the H.M.O.'s, though Senator Kerry supported a small portion of it as a way to protect prescription drug benefits during the transition to the new Medicare drug program. 
 Medicare costs are obviously an important issue -- but the proper focus of criticism isn't a premium increase that in the main looks justifiable, given the current ground rules. The real question is whether the Medicare burden is being shared equitably.
 The current framework was set in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which saved the government money by limiting Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors and health plans and by pushing more of the burden onto beneficiaries. That act was widely praised at the time as a model of fiscal discipline. But in subsequent years, the providers of health services -- like hospitals, doctors and health plans -- have all convinced Congress that they were dealt too severe an economic blow and have won relief from the pain. No such relief was provided to the beneficiaries of Medicare. 
 Medicare's problems will not be solved until the underlying problem of the rapid rise in health care costs is solved. Mr. Kerry urges a war on waste and fraud, which sounds appealing but is unlikely to produce huge savings. Mr. Bush says private-sector competition is the answer, but that idea seems delusional. Neither is going to produce any short-term relief for older people who can't afford the new premium increase.

HEADLINE: IRAQ STUDY FINDS DESIRE FOR ARMS, BUT NOT CAPACITY

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
A new report on Iraq's illicit weapons program is expected to conclude that Saddam Hussein's government had a clear intent to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons if United Nations sanctions were lifted, government officials said Thursday. But, like earlier reports, it finds no evidence that Iraq had begun any large-scale program for weapons production by the time of the American invasion last year, the officials said. 
 The most specific evidence of an illicit weapons program, the officials said, has been uncovered in clandestine labs operated by the Iraqi Intelligence Service, which could have produced small quantities of lethal chemical and biological agents, though probably for use in assassinations, not to inflict mass casualties. 
 A draft report of nearly 1,500 pages that is circulating within the government essentially reaffirms the findings of an interim review completed 11 months ago, the officials said. But they said it added considerable detail, particularly on the question of Iraq's intention to produce weapons if United Nations penalties were weakened or lifted, a judgment they said was based on documents signed by senior leaders and the debriefings of former Iraqi scientists and top officials, as well as other records. 
 The officials said the report would portray a more complicated and detailed picture, based on a far more extensive examination of suspected Iraqi weapons sites and records, as well as the debriefings. They said new information in the draft report based on on-site inspections of clandestine labs described the possibility that they were intended to provide small quantities of poisons.
 A final version of the report, by Charles A. Duelfer, the top American weapons inspector in Iraq, is expected to be made public within the next several weeks.
 In its current form, the report reaffirms previous interim findings that there is no evidence that Iraq possessed stockpiles of illicit weapons at the time of the American invasion in March 2003, the officials said. Prewar intelligence estimates that said Iraq actually possessed chemical and biological arsenals and was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program were cited by the Bush administration as the major rationale for war.
 With the presidential election campaign in its final weeks, Republicans and Democrats are likely to seize on separate aspects of the report in an effort to score political points. 
 President Bush, who has said Iraq posed a threat to the world whether or not it possessed illicit weapons, will probably draw attention to the conclusion that Mr. Hussein sought to acquire illicit weapons. His political opponent, Senator John Kerry, who has accused Mr. Bush of misleading the country into war, will probably highlight the conclusion that Iraq had not begun a large-scale production program. 
 The separate disclosure on Wednesday that a classified National Intelligence Estimate completed in July portrayed a gloomier prognosis for Iraq than Mr. Bush has acknowledged was already fueling fresh debate about Iraq on the campaign trail. 
 The report on Iraq's weapons is the result of some 15 months of work by the Iraq Survey Group, a military and intelligence team of more than 1,200 people that has inspected scores of sites, interviewed hundreds of former Iraqi scientists and officials and reviewed thousands of documents to try to reach a final judgment. 
 As described by the government officials, the findings of Mr. Duelfer's report, in its current draft, are broadly consistent with the interim judgments, including the report issued in October 2003 by David A. Kay, the first top American inspector. When he stepped down in January, Mr. Kay said that ''we were all wrong, probably'' about whether Iraq had stockpiles of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. But he also said there was evidence that Iraq was developing ''test amounts'' of chemical weapons and researching how to produce ricin for use in weapons, and that it had made little progress toward restarting its nuclear program.
 In trying to untangle the mystery of why no illicit weapons have been found in Iraq, Mr. Duelfer's report is expected to look more closely at the issue of Iraq's intentions. The document will stop short of offering a final judgment about Iraq's weapons program, the officials said, and will not completely close the door on some possibilities, including the still unsubstantiated theory that illicit weapons may have been moved to other countries. 
 It will say that a vast cache of additional documents, including a recent find of 10,000 boxes, still needs to be translated and studied before any definitive conclusions can be reached about Iraq's capabilities and intentions. The Iraq Survey Group will continue its work, the officials said, and may issue additional reports. 
 Meetings are scheduled next week to discuss what portions of the new report should be made public. A meeting led by Mr. Duelfer early this month in London presented versions of the draft to about two dozen British, Australian and American experts, the officials said. The final draft of the report remains to be completed, they added. 
 Some contents of the documents were described by government officials from several agencies who have seen all or part of the draft or been briefed on it. The officials spoke on condition that they not be identified by name, agency or, in some cases, by nationality, because the document remains classified and because its contents remain in draft form. The officials included some who said Iraq posed a threat that justified the American invasion, and some who said it did not. 
 On nuclear weapons, earlier American reports have described no evidence that Iraq had begun an active effort to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program that it was forced to abandon after the Persian Gulf war of 1991. The officials who described the draft report declined to provide details about its findings on nuclear issues. 
 Mr. Duelfer is still in Baghdad, and through a spokesman, he declined a request to be interviewed. In an interview late last month with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Duelfer declined to discuss any findings in detail, but said his report would document the evidence collected to date and attempt to explain ''the evolution and decision process'' regarding Iraq's illicit weapons program through 2003. Mr. Duelfer said in that interview that questions involving Iraq's pursuit of so-called weapons of mass destruction ''deserve something more than just a simple-minded archaeological exam of the W.M.D. program.'' 
 On Thursday, an intelligence official said the internal review under way was intended ''to make as much of the document available to the public as possible, consistent with intelligence sources and methods.'' The official added, ''That does take time.''
 Mr. Kay's report last October cited ''a clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses within the Iraqi Intelligence Service'' that contained material suitable for research into chemical and biological weapons. Mr. Duelfer's report, based on inspections of clandestine labs, will say the Iraqis were capable of using the labs to produce small quantities of lethal agents or to conduct very primitive research as a very early step toward broader weapons production.
 Mr. Duelfer, who took over as the chief weapons inspector in January, said in testimony to Congress in March that Iraq did have dual-use facilities that could have produced biological or chemical weapons on short notice. He also noted that Iraq was working until March 2003 to build new facilities for the production of chemicals.
 But officials who have seen Mr. Duelfer's report say it describes no conclusive evidence that any effort was under way to use these facilities for weapons production. 
 Mr. Bush, who warned before the war that Iraq's illicit weapons posed an urgent threat to the United States, now generally describes Iraq as having been a ''gathering threat,'' a phrase he has used at least 11 times since Aug. 12. In a Sept. 9 campaign speech, Mr. Bush told voters in Ohio: ''Remember, Saddam Hussein had the capability of making weapons; he could have passed that capability on to the enemy.''
 Mr. Kerry, by contrast, has focused on the fact that the illicit weapons have not been found in Iraq as evidence that Mr. Bush's assertions lack credibility. ''Everybody knows that just saying that there are weapons of mass destruction didn't make them so,'' Mr. Kerry said in an Aug. 2 television interview.

HEADLINE: Afghan Leader's Helicopter Is Attacked, Aborting a Campaign Rally

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
President Hamid Karzai had to abort a rare campaign rally on Thursday in Gardez, southeast of the capital, when a rocket was fired over his helicopter as it came in to land. 
 The helicopter, an American Chinook, swerved violently and soared away back to Kabul, swirling dust over hundreds of schoolchildren, tribal elders and government dignitaries lined up to greet the president. 
 The rocket, or rocket-propelled grenade, whistled over their heads and landed with a loud bang 300 yards away. The assembled Afghans barely blinked, so accustomed are they to explosives, and many believed the governor when he announced over the public address system that the explosion was celebratory. 
 But American coalition and Afghan troops on the ground were taking no risks. Gunfire had been directed at an American vehicle simultaneously, and the president's visit was abandoned. ''Such a shame, just one guy can ruin the day for everyone,'' said one American security official.
 The incident was the closest attack on Mr. Karzai since he escaped an assassination attempt in Kandahar on Sept. 5, 2002. Another visit he made to Kandahar in April 2004 was marred by rocket and grenade attacks before his arrival. 
 Three people were reported to have been arrested by the Afghan police in Gardez in connection with the attack, Kabul Television reported later. A woman in Gardez told the police that she had seen three men with motorbikes and rocket-propelled grenades hiding in a neighbor's house. 
 Back at the presidential palace in Kabul and clearly frustrated, Mr. Karzai made light of the rocket attack and chided his American and Afghan security officials for being overly cautious. ''I think really our guys are taking a lot of precautions for no reason,'' he said. 
 He said he had asked to land after the rocket was fired, but the security men on board had refused. Once back in Kabul, he called the governor of Paktia, who was still on the ground waiting for him to arrive. 
 ''I said, ''What was going on?' and he said, 'Nothing, there was just one rocket that came and landed two kilometers away, and the people are still here,''' Mr. Karzai recounted to journalists later in the afternoon. He immediately asked to return to Gardez, but security officials ruled it out. 
 ''So I am thinking of that now, that on a trip like that I should take my own measures,'' he said. Or, he joked, he would start making secret visits to provinces, without the knowledge of his security detail. 
 Campaigning in private, as it were, would present a quandary for the president, who is still a target of diehard elements of the Taliban and Al Qaeda intent on attacking the American-backed government and trying to disrupt Afghanistan's first democratic elections for a head of state on Oct. 9. 
 Mr. Karzai rarely moves out of the Arg, the former royal palace compound where he has both his office and residence, and apart from one speech in Kabul to open his election campaign last week, he has yet to do any campaigning. And the incident in Gardez revealed how little the president is in charge. He clearly had no control over his return to Kabul. 
 As the incumbent, he remains supremely confident. He said he did not think his failure to land at Gardez would cost him votes and said he was sure he could still obtain the necessary 51 percent to win in the first round of the election.
 ''I don't think it will go to a second round, that's my judgment,'' he said. ''But even if it goes to a second round, it doesn't matter. We are entering a new era of voting and democracy.'' 
 However remote from his people and controlled by American bodyguards -- a criticism leveled by some of his political rivals -- Mr. Karzai knows he can rely on the votes of the Pashtun, his own ethnic group and the largest ethnic group in the country, estimated at 40 percent of the population. Paktia is predominantly Pashtun. 
 Despite continuing support for the Taliban in some districts, and complaints from others against Mr. Karzai for his close relationship with Washington and his concessions to the ethnic Tajiks in the government, when it comes to voting for a national leader, the Pashtuns will vote for one of their own, foreign and Afghan officials here said. 
 Even family members of a rival in Paktia Province have rallied around him, and so diluted the opposition.
 In opening his campaign, Mr. Karzai promised to continue his policies of democracy and stability for Afghanistan, but he acknowledged some shortcomings and said he would concentrate more closely on security, the economy and social services. 
 He pleased international aid donors by saying he would pursue disarmament, combat narcotics and corruption, and find jobs for demobilized fighters and alternatives for farmers who give up growing opium. He also promised to raise the average monthly wage to $500, from $200, within five years.

HEADLINE: After Being Bounced Around Florida Is Bouncing Back

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: STUART, Fla., Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Bob Ellis was picking up plywood and two-by-fours on his second trip of the day for supplies to deal with the wreckage from Hurricane Frances, the second of three hurricanes that have hit Florida and the southeastern United States in the last five weeks.
 Mr. Ellis, a carpenter, was planning to build sides on two flat-bed trailers so he could make money hauling trees and shrubs ruined in the hurricane nearly two weeks ago.
 ''We understand FEMA is paying quite well for cleaning up debris,'' he said on Thursday as workers loaded the lumber into his pickup at a Home Depot store here.
 FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has already promised at least $2 billion in aid to the state and has dispensed over $200 million in cash to hundreds of thousands of victims, along with another $100 million in housing aid. It has become almost as familiar a presence for beleaguered Floridians these days as are presidential campaign commercials. 
 As one hurricane after another has pounded Florida since Aug. 13 -- when Hurricane Charley cut a swath from Fort Myers in the southwest through Orlando in the center of the state -- many businesses have been shut for days and sometimes weeks. That led to a broad economic slowdown in a state that previously had been doing considerably better than much of the rest of the country.
 But even before a full assessment of the billions of dollars in damage this week from Ivan, which wreaked havoc in the Florida Panhandle and caused major damage along the neighboring coasts of Alabama and Mississippi, the economic situation is already changing here on the ground. Most businesses in the state are up and running again. Indeed, the glimmerings of a miniboom are apparent.
 Early estimates suggest that total losses from the three storms could reach as high as $45 billion to $50 billion, with as much as $26 billion of that covered by insurance claims. That's not the only monetary impact, of course. Florida's $500 billion economy is the fifth largest in the nation and retailers and manufacturers around the country have felt the ripple effects from the disruption. Wal-Mart, Federated Department Stores and other retailers said earlier this month that sales were running a little behind expectations, in part because of the loss of consumer traffic in Florida. 
 With power off across broad stretches of the state, the storms also cut into the nation's industrial production, causing utility output to fall over 2 percent. And with the first two hurricanes knocking out an estimated 20,000 jobs, the devastation added to the number of people nationwide filing for unemployment claims.
 While it will take a long time for many of the people who suffered damage to their homes and businesses to recover their losses, an economic bounce-back from the first storms is already under way. Economists expect the Panhandle and the Gulf Coast states to go through a similar experience: a few days or weeks of stagnation, then a surge of new activity that lasts considerably longer. Experts began to study this cyclical effect from modern hurricanes seriously after Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida hard 12 years ago, stunning the state with a loss of over $35 billion, in today's dollars.
 Based on that pattern, J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Gov. Jeb Bush's council of economic advisers, says the recovery in Florida and neighboring states is expected to build sharply over the next few months and may extend for a year or two, propelled by heavy infusions of money from the federal government, insurers and relief agencies.
 And in part because of the closeness to the presidential election and Florida's role as a critical swing state, experts expect the money from Washington to flow even faster than in a typical disaster. [On Friday, the White House said that President Bush would be flying to the Florida Panhandle on Sunday, his third visit to the state in a month.]
 ''After most natural disasters it takes some time for the federal government money to start flowing,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com, a research consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. ''But I think this disaster came right to the top of the policy agenda.'' 
 Not everyone, of course, is benefiting from the improving business situation. Restaurants and movie theaters, for example, are still suffering. So are some of the retailers as people have cut back on traditional back-to-school spending on things like clothing and accessories.
 Many people affected by the hurricanes are conserving their money so they can focus on their immediate needs; others are holding back because they are simply too tired to go out after long days of mopping up and struggling with plugging leaks and replacing siding.
 ''We're not eating out the way we used to and we're conserving gas,'' said Peter Crafts, who owns a picture framing and art conservation business here in Stuart.
 Mr. Crafts's shop has been closed for nearly two weeks, but he said he expected to make up for that lost period in the months ahead as people come in with water-damaged paintings to be repaired. 
 The recovery is strongest so far on the southwest coast around Fort Myers and Punta Gorda, where the first hurricane blasted ashore on Aug. 13. It is just gathering momentum at the heart of the destruction that Frances inflicted along the Atlantic Coast over Labor Day weekend. And, of course, it has yet to start in the Panhandle region and along the Gulf. 
 Here in Stuart, where hundreds of roofs were ripped off and forests of trees and shrubs were shredded, building supply stores and construction companies are at the leading edge of an upturn that is also starting to draw in resources from around the country. Out-of-state manufacturers of plywood and electricity generators, for example, have said they are having trouble keeping up with the demand from Florida. 
 Building contractors here are hiring as fast as they can and rushing to sign up customers for repairs before, they fear, battalions of out-of-state carpenters and roofers pour in.
 ''Right now, the money is in roofing repairs, drywall repairs, fixing interiors and cleaning up debris,'' Mr. Ellis said. 
 After Hurricane Frances, Mr. Ellis quit his job as a supervisor on a project building 20 new homes to work fewer hours but at higher pay for a contractor who decided to specialize in hurricane repair. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Ellis said, he went out to give an estimate on replacing the roof on a three-bedroom home. He noticed most of the roofs on the street were damaged and returned a little later with a handbill offering repair services. By the end of the day he had 12 new customers. 
 ''Everywhere you look, you can go down any street and I guarantee you 80 percent of the houses are damaged,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''If you get two or three people on every block or so, that's good money. We're not charging any more than usual. It's just the sheer volume. There are definitely not enough workers to cover the damage that's been done.''
 But already the laws of supply and demand are altering the labor market in ways that will help speed the recovery. Shortly after Hurricane Charley destroyed hundreds of acres of orange groves in south central Florida, for instance, citrus workers lined up in the town of Wauchula to apply for jobs as roofers.
 ''You're going to see a lot of this,'' Mr. Villamil said.
 As power is restored, stores reopen and people go back to work, the initial panic buying of generators and cleaning supplies has been replaced by a steady flow of shoppers seeking materials for repairs, insect repellent and a host of other supplies.
 ''It's starting,'' said Dan Grund, the manager of the Home Depot in Stuart, about 100 miles north of Miami. ''It'll probably be a little heavier in the next week or so.''
 As he spoke, Tyrone Sawyer, a maintenance worker from Indian Town, about 20 miles inland, was paying for four carts full of shingles, tar paper and lumber with a $500 voucher he had received from the Red Cross. 
 Another shopper, Pat Clausing, a real estate agent, said neighbors had told her that she probably would not be able to find any tarpaulins to cover her roof. But she found three, and, she said, there were still a few left on the shelf. 
 As she was leaving the store, her cellphone rang. It was her husband, Tom, at his office in West Palm Beach. ''I got the tarps,'' she said. ''They're not as large as Susan's. But I got 'em.''
 For people in the real estate business like Mrs. Clausing, however, it will be a while before the economic resurgence hits home. She had been out of work for nearly two weeks; when she finally made some phone calls on Wednesday she found that four families who had wanted to sell their homes were now wondering if they should wait.
 ''A lot of people sell here to go to larger or smaller houses or condos,'' she said. ''They scale up or scale down. They want to stay in the area. But the whole area has been hit hard. So they're kind of, 'Let's see what's available before we put ours on the market.'''
 Denise Rabinowitz lost a week's pay as a clerk for FedEx in Port St. Lucie. Her insurance company was going to be among those contributing to the recovery, paying for a new roof and an air-conditioner crushed by a falling tree. 
 But she was not waiting for the check. She spent $94.98 on Thursday for three shrubbery clippers, half a dozen spray cans of insect repellent and a few other things. Her biggest concern was the bugs.
 ''Everywhere you go red ants are out,'' she said. ''Lots of wasps, lots of bees. It's just been crazy.''

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Soars to 4-Week High On Storm-Related Shutdowns

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Crude oil surged to a four-week high, bringing the gain this week to almost $3 a barrel, on concern that shutdowns caused by Hurricane Ivan would further reduce inventories. Gasoline futures also rose to a four-week high, capping the largest weekly gain in a year. 
 Ivan, which came ashore Thursday in Alabama, idled at least one-sixth of the refining capacity along the Gulf of Mexico and reduced offshore oil production 83 percent. The storm, which followed Hurricane Frances, closed ports and delayed tankers carrying oil and gasoline.
 Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.71, or 3.9 percent, to $45.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Aug. 23.
 Gasoline for October delivery rose 4.4 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $1.2703 a gallon on the exchange, the highest closing price for a near-month contract since $1.3236 on Aug. 19. 
 Ivan weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall near Gulf Shores, Ala. ConocoPhillips and at least five other companies shut refineries in Mississippi and Louisiana.
 Many of the refineries are still closed or running at reduced rates, analysts said.
 The refinery shutdowns idled at least 1.42 million barrels a day of United States crude processing capacity. The closed plants have about 18 percent of the gulf region's total capacity of 7.88 million barrels, according to Energy Department data. The storm has cut oil production by at least 3.9 million barrels since Monday as companies evacuated workers from offshore platforms.
 ''The storms are feeding supply concerns,'' said Tom Bentz, an oil broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Ford's Optimistic Forecast on Earnings

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher yesterday after Ford Motor raised its earnings forecasts but gains on the Nasdaq were checked after the wireless technology provider Qualcomm said an accounting review might reduce pretax income.
 Oil stocks rose as crude oil futures surged almost $2 a barrel to their highest close in more than three weeks amid concerns over how Hurricane Ivan and new storms might affect oil production. Some analysts worried that higher oil prices would hurt economic growth and cut into corporate profits outside the energy sector. 
 Exxon Mobil rose 1.7 percent, to $48.37, and ChevronTexaco climbed 1.9 percent, to $51.94. October crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up $1.71, or 3.9 percent, at $45.59 a barrel.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 39.97 points, or 0.39 percent, at 10,284.46. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.05 points, or 0.45 percent, at 1,128.55. The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.01 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,910.09. It was the S.&P. 500's highest weekly close since June 27.
 Trading in stocks was active on what was a ''quadruple witching'' day, when four different sets of options and futures contracts expire.
 About 1.4 billion shares were traded on the New York Exchange, equal to the 1.4 billion daily average last year. About 1.6 billion shares were traded on the Nasdaq, just under the 1.69 billion daily average last year.
 On the Big Board, the number of stocks on the rise outnumbered those declining by about seven to five. 
 General Electric rose 2 percent, to $34.22, after the Prudential Equity Group recommended investors buy the shares, citing an expected rebound in its energy business.
 Altria fell almost 1 percent, to $48.48, making it one of the biggest drags on the Dow. The Los Angeles Times reported that California's top court had for the first time upheld a damages award in a smoking and health case. The newspaper said the court dismissed an appeal by the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria seeking to overturn a $10.5 million judgment won by a lung cancer patient who had been a longtime smoker of Marlboro cigarettes.
 The Internet conglomerate InterActiveCorp rose almost 7 percent, to $23.50, on rumors that the chief executive, Barry Diller, was taking the company private, analysts said. A spokeswoman for InterActiveCorp declined to comment.
 Alpharma rose 10 percent, to $18.95, after a federal appeals court cleared the way for it to make a generic form of Pfizer's Neurontin epilepsy drug.
 Ford was up 27 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $14.22 on the New York Exchange.
 Shares of Qualcomm fell $1.57, or 3.9 percent, to $38.83.
 Cisco Systems also dragged on technology stocks after the company, which makes equipment that routes Internet traffic, was downgraded by Lehman Brothers. Its stock fell more than 2 percent, to $19.16.
 Circuit City Stores, the electronics chain, was up 61 cents, or 4.3 percent, at $14.72 after it reported a smaller quarterly loss. The orthopedic device maker Biomet rose 3.7 percent, to $47.47, after reporting higher quarterly earnings, excluding items, as sales of hip and knee replacements increased.
 Treasury securities dropped after a measure of consumer sentiment fell for a second month. The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 101 3/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.11 percent, from 4.08 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Tax Break Bringing Businesses, And Fraud, to the Virgin Islands

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM and LYNNLEY BROWNING

DATELINE: ST. THOMAS, V.I. 

 BODY:
Inside and outside the freshly stuccoed mansions that hug the hillsides here, the gardeners and cleaning women come and go.
 No one else seems to, though. No one, that is, except the federal agents who have taken to questioning the workers and the neighbors about when the owners last took a dip in their glistening pools and when they might be expected back.
 The questions are intended to ascertain whether the owners of the candy-colored homes are bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands or instead are pretending to live in these homes to dodge an estimated $400 million in federal income taxes.
 Drawn by an economic development program that is blessed by Congress and confers a special tax rate that amounts effectively to just 3.5 percent of income, well-heeled Americans have migrated in droves to this United States territory in the last few years, kindling its first real economic boom. 
 At least until recently. Last year, Internal Revenue Service agents raided the offices of one of the program's beneficiaries, and the Justice Department has subpoenaed others in what one government official described as three criminal investigations.
 The ensuing confusion about the islands' economic development program and fears of attracting the scrutiny of tax authorities have already scared away some of the new arrivals, both individuals and companies. And local officials are beginning to fret that people violating the spirit and perhaps the letter of the tax law could derail the program, which is vital to a territory where 30 percent of the residents were living below the poverty level in 1999.
 One program beneficiary, the Consolidated National Corporation, closed its office in St. Thomas in July, saying that the tax laws governing the program are ambiguous, and executives at two other beneficiary companies said they were on the verge of pulling up stakes for the same reason.
 ''If something were to go wrong with this program, it would have the impact of a major hurricane,'' Lt. Gov. Vargrave A. Richards said in an interview. ''This program is the best thing that ever happened to these islands.''
 In June, the I.R.S. fired a warning shot at participants, saying that lawyers and estate planners promoting the program were making false claims about what income qualified for the program's tax benefits and about its residency requirements.
 Its notice, which hinted at a widespread problem, came a year after its agents stormed the office of Kapok Management, a financial services company that is a beneficiary of the program. Though Kapok and its principals and advisers have not been charged with wrongdoing, one of its partners, Gary J. Payne, pleaded guilty to tax fraud after federal investigators demonstrated that he lived in the islands less than one month a year and nonetheless claimed the program's tax benefits for income he generated selling insurance in Massachusetts.
 Federal officials suspect there are dozens of other taxpayers taking advantage of the program, a group that includes a car dealer in southern Illinois, a board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., and asset managers and insurance agents.
 The few people who agreed to talk about their moves said they followed the program's rules and were careful to pay proper taxes, but most of the beneficiaries declined to comment when contacted or did not respond to calls and e-mail messages.
 Many here blame the federal government for failing to carefully define what constitutes residency and what income qualifies under the program. ''Congress foresaw that these two areas would be a problem and ordered Treasury to come up with definitions in 1986,'' Mr. Richards said. ''We have asked repeatedly for these definitions but have never gotten any.''
 Though the Treasury Department's work plan has called for creating more explicit definitions on four occasions since then, it has not followed through, nor did it respond to proposed definitions submitted by concerned parties after the Kapok raid.
 Treasury officials insist that the rules are clear and that their goal is not to kill the program, as some here suspect. ''Some people have purposefully chosen not to follow the existing rules,'' said Tara Bradshaw, a Treasury spokeswoman. ''Those who promote this intentional disregard of the rules are typically the source of complaints about ambiguity.''
 In all, about 100 companies with an unknown number of partners and participants are eligible for tax breaks under the program, and about 70 more have approval to begin claiming the benefits.
 Participating companies are saving about $1 billion a year, said David Marshall Nissman, who just retired as United States attorney for the Virgin Islands district. 
 But one federal official estimated that 40 percent of those savings are being claimed fraudulently.
 The program's beneficiaries, known as E.D.C. beneficiaries after the Economic Development Commission that confers the tax benefit, must meet various requirements. Individuals and companies must commit $100,000 of capital, employ 10 local residents, buy goods and services from local suppliers and promise to make charitable donations. They must also establish residency, although they do not have to spend a specific number of days in the islands. Instead, they are advised to buy or lease a house and car, obtain a local driver's license and join local clubs, among other things.
 In exchange, participants receive what promotional materials describe as ''incredible tax benefits,'' paying an effective tax rate of just 3.5 percent on eligible income compared with a top rate of more than 35 percent on the mainland.
 A dispute between one of the beneficiaries and the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the islands' tax authority, reveals just how substantial the tax breaks can be.
 According to papers filed in Federal District Court in St. Croix, James Auffenberg Jr., owner of the St. Clair Auto Mall in O'Fallon, Ill., had $6.4 million in income in 2000. The bureau calculated that his total federal tax liability for that income was $2.3 million.
 But Mr. Auffenberg is a partner in an economic development company. He claimed that $5.4 million of that income was eligible for the accompanying tax benefits, and paid the Virgin Islands some $97,000 in taxes. 
 The bureau contends that he owes it $102,000 more, something he disputes. Through his lawyer, Mr. Auffenberg declined to comment or provide the name of the company in which he is a partner.
 The program's benefits have been available for decades. In the 1960's, Congress gave United States territories like the Virgin Islands the ability to offer tax breaks to encourage economic development and build self-sufficiency. The islands used that tool mostly to attract manufacturers, hotel operators and tourism businesses.
 About a decade ago, the local government expanded the program to attract service companies, hoping to draw highly educated, affluent workers to the islands. These businesses have kicked the program into high gear in the last few years, pumping up government revenues and leading to a boom in restaurants, boat building, dentistry and other professional services. 
 Among the newer arrivals who are beneficiaries of the program are Richard Driehaus, the Chicago money manager whose new house in St. Thomas is the talk of the town; Jeffrey Epstein, the elusive money manager who reportedly handles only clients with $1 billion or more in assets, and Steven Gluckstern, the former head of Zurich Re who now has his own asset management business.
 Economic development companies paid nearly $75 million to the local government in the 2003 fiscal year, or almost 15 percent of the territory's total tax receipts, up from 12 percent just two years earlier.
 The economic impact of the program goes far beyond tax receipts. Housing sales and construction have risen sharply, as reflected in the 150 percent jump in taxes collected when deeds are recorded from 2001 to 2003. The ''sea goose,'' the pontoon plane that shuttles between St. Croix and St. Thomas, has hired more pilots to keep up with demand, and marinas that had stood empty since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 now have waiting lists for berths.
 Charitable contributions have also improved the quality of life. Thefts of computers from a school on St. Croix stopped after Lewis Lester, the head of Global Capital Advisors L.L.C., an economic development company, paid to install security cameras, and the St. Croix police have bulletproof vests thanks to another beneficiary.
 More than 2,000 employees have migrated off the bloated public payroll and into the private sector. But what locals prize most is the program's ability to reverse the brain drain and bring back to the islands people like Cesar A. Guerra.
 Mr. Guerra, a native of St. Croix, did not even consider looking for a job here when he graduated from the University of Chicago with an economics degree. ''My only choice would have probably been to come back as an algebra teacher,'' he said.
 He was working at Blum Capital in San Francisco when he heard that several investment management companies were moving to his hometown, drawn by the economic development program. He quickly joined one, the Valance Company. ''There was kind of stigma attached to coming back, frankly, like you couldn't make it anywhere else,'' Mr. Guerra said. ''Now it's like you got one of the really good jobs here, there's a cachet to it.''
 Vetting and oversight of the program's beneficiaries seems weak, as several of them have run afoul of federal regulators in the past. For instance, Warren B. Mosler, the owner of Valance, is a principal in two mainland firms that the I.R.S. has cited for underpaying taxes in the past. Mr. Mosler did not respond to messages left by phone and e-mail.
 Frank Schulterbrandt, the chief executive of the Economic Development Authority, the umbrella agency for the Economic Development Commission and other government agencies, did not know that one beneficiary had 99 partners -- he said his records showed only three -- and that two other economic development companies had apparently merged or were at least sharing an office across the street from his office in St. Thomas.
 He said applicants are vetted by his staff, which occasionally seeks additional help from outside services, such as the Gaming Enforcement authorities. He is requesting $2.9 million more to beef up oversight, but he made it clear that determining participants' tax status is not his job. ''Tax issues are the responsibility of the tax authorities,'' he said.
 A reporter dropped by the offices of 17 economic development companies in St. Thomas, an exercise recently duplicated by I.R.S. agents. Most of the offices seemed empty but for support staff and receptionists, who said that their employers had just left, were off island or would otherwise be unavailable to comment. 
 So far, the I.R.S. and the Justice Department have focused on about a dozen companies apparently consisting of social and business acquaintances from the mainland who have banded together to share the program's tax benefits. 
 Kapok, for instance, appears to have had more than 60 partners whose businesses ranged from selling insurance to trading cattle futures. The partners established Virgin Islands residency and forwarded the income from their businesses through Kapok, thus capturing the tax benefits, according to investigators and a lawsuit filed against Kapok by two of the partners.
 ''We're concerned about whether these are real partnerships or whether they are essentially selling tax credits to disparate groups of businesses that have no real connection to each other,'' said Mr. Nissman before he completed his service as United States attorney in August. (He now works at Bridge Capital, a financial services company in St. Croix that is a new E.D.C. beneficiary.)
 At least two other firms have lost partners since the raid. Gary J. Hirst, a Florida money manager, declined to explain why he dropped out of Margate Management in March but said he had not taken advantage of Margate's tax benefits. ''I thought it sounded good when I joined, but then I decided it was inappropriate,'' he said.
 Christopher Russell, a Maryland real estate developer who founded a charity that is now under the scrutiny of the Senate Finance Committee, said he had ended his partnership in International Asset Management Inc., in St. Croix. ''My tax counsel advised me after the raid on Kapok that I should get out,'' he said.
 But federal officials say the biggest threat to mainland tax coffers may be the emigration of highly compensated hedge fund managers who have begun claiming the program's tax benefits, executives like S. Donald Sussman, the founder of Paloma Partners of Greenwich, Conn., which manages nearly $3 billion in capital.
 An avid yachtsman, Mr. Sussman has a home in St. John, where he spends most of his time, and he cruises between it and houses in Greenwich and Deer Isle, Me.
 In 2000, he established Trust Asset Management under the E.D.C. program, and serves as chairman and chief executive of Paloma through it. Paloma pays Trust Asset to cover his compensation and the services of 10 other Trust Asset employees in St. Thomas.
 As owner of Trust Asset, Mr. Sussman pays the Virgin Islands government the low tax rate on the share of income that Trust Asset gets from his funds and the full federal tax rate on the rest. ''I live in St. John,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I follow the rules. I do what I'm supposed to do.''
 Mr. Sussman is confident that he is within the law and upset that others may be playing fast and loose. ''If what has been alleged is true, those nonresidents who masquerade as residents are engaged in outrageous behavior and potentially endangering the E.D.C. program,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Trade Partners Maintain Unhealthy Long-Term Relationship

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
No organization has been more alarmed about America's constantly rising deficit in global transactions than the Institute for International Economics, a center of expertise in this field. A disaster in the making, declares the institute's director, C. Fred Bergsten -- and one coming soon. 
 But month after month, indeed year after year, the disaster has failed to occur and now one of the institute's own trade experts, Catherine L. Mann, has stopped, as she puts it, crying wolf.
 ''Because nothing happened, I did a lot more analysis,'' Ms. Mann said, ''and I have come to the conclusion that a co-dependent relationship exists between the United States and its trading partners.'' That situation ''may not be healthy for either side,'' she added, but it ''can last for quite some time.'' 
 For Americans, the positive side of this equation -- known as the balance on current account -- is that they get to consume much more in goods and services than they produce. As for America's trading partners, particularly China, Japan and the Asian tigers, they gain from an overseas marketplace that allows them to expand production and job creation beyond what their own population can consume. 
 The downside for the United States is that most of its imports are purchased on credit extended by its trading partners. The overall indebtedness is now about $4.4 trillion, nearly twice what it was in 2000 -- an increasingly costly arrangement for Americans and a potentially risky one for the nation's foreign creditors. 
 While Mr. Bergsten, one of the better-known commentators on the global economy, remains alarmed that the arrangement could unravel abruptly, with the dollar plummeting in value and inflation rising, Ms. Mann represents an alternative view held by a growing number of economists. This group argues that rather than crisis, the United States is caught in a gradual, almost imperceptible deterioration brought on by the yawning deficit in trade and other international transactions, and the deterioration could continue for a long time. 
 ''If there has been no crisis, there has to be a counterweight that keeps the crisis from happening,'' Ms. Mann said. ''The counterweight is that the United States and its main trading partners have a vested interest in the status quo.''
 No one knows how this situation will unwind. The willingness of the United States to accumulate more and more debt could indeed end painfully or it could play out gradually and mildly as the nation's trading partners pull back on their lending and Americans slow their consumption of imported goods and services.
 ''I think in the long term what is happening is unsustainable but it is very hard to predict a turning point in an unsustainable situation,'' said Robert Blecker, an economist at American University who, like Ms. Mann, describes himself as a former Chicken Little. ''You can see why something cannot keep going,'' he said, ''but you can also see why it keeps going.'' 
 The scorecard in this process is the current account, which encompasses the imbalance in the trading of goods and services as well as the shortfall in all other cross-border payments, from interest income and rents to dividends and profits on direct investments. The current account deficit was equal to 5.7 percent of all domestic economic activity in the second quarter, the Commerce Department announced this week. 
 That was a record and an unusually rapid rise from 4.5 percent of G.D.P. in last year's fourth quarter and 5.1 percent in the first quarter. The trade deficit, the biggest single component, has risen to $447 billion over the last year, a 10 percent increase. 
 What could turn things around? Interest payments on the debt could finally get too burdensome for American borrowers, for example, or the Chinese, the centerpiece among the nation's trading partners, could discover that they finally have enough customers at home and do not need to sell so much to the United States on credit.
 The dollar, in response, would fall sharply in value, forcing prices to rise in the United States for a vast array of imported goods and services, leaving Americans, in response, much more dependent on their own inadequate production.
 ''At some point the music stops, or slows down, as the two sides become too unhinged,'' said Lee Price, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute.
 The focus on whether or not the rapidly growing current account deficit will produce an abrupt crisis draws attention away from the continuing deterioration in America's global economic status.
 Interest income that once went to lenders within the United States now seeps overseas to foreign lenders. Foreigners own more than 40 percent of all Treasury securities, up from less than 15 percent a decade ago. They purchase these securities with the dollars American consumers pay for imports, in effect lending the dollars back to Americans for more purchases. The money collected through the Treasury sales finds its way back to the public through the Bush administration's deficit spending, and the cycle of purchasing on credit continues.
 ''The budget deficit is essentially consumption supported by foreign lending,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank. 
 China and Japan held $1.3 trillion in Treasuries through June, according to the International Monetary Fund. That continuing willingness to invest surplus dollars in Treasuries helps to explain why the dollar has fallen in value by only about 10 percent over the last year against a market basket of currencies representing the nation's trading partners. So far the dollar's preeminence as a reserve currency and America's importance as a consumer market outweigh the dangers of one or two lenders holding so much American debt.
 ''My hope prior to the Iraq war was that the ministers of the major nations would sit down and address the United States problem,'' said Christian Weller, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a research institute. ''But the war overshadowed the discussions and the trade deficit became a sideshow.'' 
 The last time something similar happened, in the mid-1980's, America's trade problems focused more on Germany, France, Britain, and Japan. Recognizing the crisis, these countries reached an agreement with the Reagan administration to manage the fall of the dollar against their currencies. As imports became more expensive, American production revived, particularly in manufacturing. 
 This time, China, Japan and other Asian countries are the focus of trade, and lacking enough demand at home for all their production, they are eager to keep their goods and services as inexpensive as possible for American consumers. So they resist letting the dollar fall in value, defying market forces and ignoring mild prods from the Bush administration.
 While Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, has said he will ''take America in the right direction on trade,'' Tim Adams, policy director for the Bush campaign, has said, ''We will continue to work with the Chinese toward a flexible exchange rate.''
 For the United States, however, the gradual deterioration is bringing the country to a turning point. Until now, despite the growing imbalance, income earned by Americans on all of their investments abroad as well as their exports has exceeded the earnings of foreigners on their holdings in the United States and their exports to this country.
 Only occasionally have the roles reversed, and then only briefly. But now a heavy swing in the net income flow appears to be developing, Mr. Roach says, as interest payments rise on the hoard of Treasuries held by foreigners.
 The net income flow favored the United States by $64 billion in last year's fourth quarter, but that net dwindled to less than $10 billion in the second quarter ''and it will keep falling sharply,'' Mr. Roach said. 
 Production and job creation also suffer as imports substitute for goods and services made in America. These imports now account for nearly 15 percent of total consumption in the United States, up from 12 percent in the mid-1990's and 9 percent in the mid-1980's, according to government data. Manufacturing within the United States has simultaneously fallen to less than 13 percent of the gross domestic product from 15.4 percent in 1998.
 With less and less production at home, stimulating the economy in periods of sluggish growth is becoming gradually more difficult, some economists argue. The Federal Reserve, for example, was forced to cut interest rates to rock-bottom levels before the economy started to recover, in part because a growing portion of the goods and services Americans buy are imported, diluting the stimulative effect on domestic production.
 How long can this imbalance between the United States and the rest of the world continue? Indefinitely, says Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist who argues that no other country has a currency as reliable and attractive as the dollar.
 The downside is that a strong dollar forces the least competitive American companies to give up or shift operations abroad.
 ''If this went on forever, ultimately we would import everything,'' Mr. Wojnilower said. ''But that is not going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Qualcomm to Review Accounting Practices

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Qualcomm, the world's second-largest maker of microprocessors for cellphones, received a lesson in stock market jitters on Friday.
 The company, based in San Diego, announced on Friday morning that it planned to study whether to change its accounting practices to reflect the growing size and volatility of the mobile communications market.
 It is a potential change applauded by Wall Street analysts. But investors, nevertheless, punished Qualcomm -- albeit briefly. The company's stock fell by as much as 7 percent before rebounding moderately to close at $38.83, down $1.57. ''When people hear there's a change to a company's accounting, 90 percent of the time it's because there's a problem,'' said Albert Lin, a telecommunications analyst with American Technology Research, a research firm for institutional investors. In this case, Mr. Lin said, ''this is definitely good for investors.'' 
 Whether Qualcomm will actually make any changes will not be known until as late as November, said Bill Keitel, the company's chief financial officer. But, he said, the company wanted to let investors know it is planning to study how best to record the royalties it earns from makers of handsets when they use Qualcomm's technology, known as code division multiple access, or CDMA, in their mobile phones.
 Qualcomm makes about 40 percent of its revenue from selling microprocessors used by handset companies, like Samsung and Motorola, that make cellphones for use on CDMA networks. Qualcomm has been a pioneer of CDMA technology, which is one of the two standards for how voice and data are transmitted over wireless networks. It is used in about 25 percent of mobile phones worldwide. Another 30 percent to 40 percent of Qualcomm's revenue comes from royalties paid by the handset makers that build phones to be CDMA-compatible. Generally, the royalties that handset makers pay are equal to about 5 percent of the retail price of the phone. 
 The proposed change in accounting would affect how Qualcomm records revenue from those royalties. Currently, when the company announces its quarterly results, it bases the amount of royalty revenue on an estimate of the number of phones that include CDMA technology sold during the quarter.
 Mr. Keitel said the company typically did not get actual sales figures from the handset makers until several months later. At that point, Qualcomm has historically revised its earnings to reflect the actual phone sales.
 The estimate can be off by tens of millions of dollars -- and as much as 10 percent of the company's royalty revenue, said Mr. Lin, the telecommunications analyst. He said that several years ago he suggested that Qualcomm change the way it recorded royalties.
 Other analysts said they had not seen a serious problem with using estimates. ''They're calibrating relatively accurately,'' said Jim Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.
 Mr. Keitel said the company had concluded that its current accounting practice best complies with government rules, which require companies to make an estimate of revenue if it can reliably do so. But he said Qualcomm was going to study whether it would better satisfy regulatory standards if it reported actual handset royalty revenues when they become available. 
 He also said the company would consider some hybrid solution, like recognizing some of the royalty revenue by estimate, but not all of it. If the company makes a change, he said, it would not affect the underlying economics of the business. 
 Louis P. Gerhardy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the initial drop in share price on Friday might reflect confusion about the nature of the proposed accounting changes. He said investors might also have been reacting to a revision in Qualcomm's fourth-quarter earnings forecast.
 Qualcomm said it expected fourth-quarter revenue to rise 60 percent to 62 percent from the same period a year earlier. And the company said it expected earnings per share to be $1.09 to $1.10. Previously, the company said it expected earnings of $1.08 to $1.09, and revenue to increase 57 percent to 65 percent. 
 Both guidance figures were improvements, analysts said. But ''some investors were probably expecting a more significant positive surprise,'' Mr. Gerhardy said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell for a second month in September, tempered by slack job growth and near-record gasoline prices.
 The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index declined to 95.8 from 95.9 in August and 96.7 in July. 
 ''This is a mild disappointment and may speak to the concerns consumers have -- gasoline prices really haven't receded that much and jobs are hard to get,'' said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. 
 The stall in confidence may signal a leveling off in spending. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last week that the economy was emerging from a ''soft patch'' in the second quarter.
 Companies added an average of 104,000 jobs a month from June through August, about a third of the average of 295,000 in the previous three months, according to Labor Department figures. 
 Unemployed workers took an average of 19 weeks before finding new jobs as of August, a month longer than the average over the last three decades, the figures also showed.
 The confidence measure has held above 95 for the last four months, the longest such string since the end of 2000. It reached a low for the year of 90.2 in May, after setting a three-year high of 103.8 in January.
 The current-conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situations and whether it is a good time to buy big-ticket items, fell to 105.8 from 107.9 in August. 
 The average pump price for gasoline is at a record for the year at $1.81 a gallon, according to the Energy Department. That is up from $1.56 a gallon last year and $1.34 in 2002.
 Consumers bought cars at a slower pace in August, helping push retail sales down 0.3 percent, in the third drop in five months, according to figures from the Commerce Department.
 Consumer spending will probably expand at a 3 percent pace this quarter, according to a forecast by economists at J.P. Morgan.

HEADLINE: Chief Is Ousted in Shake-Up at Argentina's Central Bank

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Argentina's president, Nestor Kirchner, ousted the head of the central bank on Friday, removing one of the government's most respected figures on Wall Street just as the country seeks to work out the final details of a $100 billion debt restructuring.
 In a surprise move that rattled Argentine financial markets, the government said that the bank's chief, Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former head of emerging market research at J.P. Morgan Chase, would be succeeded by the deputy foreign minister, Martin Redrado, when Mr. Prat-Gay's term expires on Wednesday. 
 Miguel Pesce, the government's chief internal auditor, was named the central bank's new vice president, and three of the bank's eight directors were replaced, a central bank spokeswoman said.
 Government officials declined to say why Mr. Kirchner made the changes. Some analysts speculated that the shake-up was intended to give the president more room to intervene in monetary policy. Fears of such increased political power helped push Argentine bonds lower in New York on Friday and sent the peso tumbling more than 1 percent at its nadir in Buenos Aires before it recovered and settled flat.
 Mr. Prat-Gay, 38, was seen by many as the most market-friendly face in a government that has otherwise unnerved investors by taking a tough stance in talks with private bondholders and lenders like the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Prat-Gay was one of a small group of officials who met last month in Buenos Aires with the I.M.F.'s new managing director, Rodrigo de Rato, pressing the fund to delay $1.1 billion in loan payments while Argentina works out its debt restructuring.
 The I.M.F. granted the delay on Friday, saying in a statement that it would give Argentina another year to make the payments. Argentina, however, still has to repay the I.M.F. an additional $1.46 billion in obligations coming due in the next four months, the fund said.
 Like Mr. Prat-Gay, who is credited with curbing inflation after Argentina's economy collapsed in late 2001, Mr. Redrado is a well-known economist who made a name for himself at a young age. Now 43, Mr. Redrado, who studied public administration at Harvard, became the chairman of Argentina's securities commission at the age of 30 and served for four years. At the foreign ministry, he had been Argentina's chief trade negotiator in the last two years, heading up talks with the European Union to form a free trade area with Mercosur, the South American bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

HEADLINE: Kerry's Cast of Thousands

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Across the wine-dark sea they come, honing Kerry's message. They come from Harvard, K Street and the studios of CNN. ''Once more into the breach!'' they cry, as they join the conference call of thousands. 
 Look at them, these great, unhuddled masses, yearning to wear White House badges. They are consultants, flacks, spinners, strategists, Knights of the Palm lunch table. And yet they come as one, from all corners of the Democratic world, to figure out what John Kerry, age 60, should believe and say. 
 Into the valley of hope ride the 600, the inner ring of Kerry confidants. A year ago, there was just a small and hearty band. There was the campaign manager Jim Jordan. There was Gibbs, Cherny and Mellman. But under their reign, the message was not honed. The candidate did flounder. The quest for a Kerry conviction was not fulfilled.
 And so the great accretion began. The call went out to pollsters, wonks and wandering wordsmiths to come gather and fill the void of Kerry's core. Brave souls emerged from the Land of Ted -- the Kennedy brigades led by Cahill and Cutter are now abetting the mighty Shrum. 
 Boldly they rode and well, into the morass of Kerry's mind. Through the thicket of equivocations they ventured, across the paradoxical plains of Kerry's prose -- all in the quest for a conviction.
 Policy committees gathered. Of domestic policy councils there were 37. Of foreign policy councils, 27.
 And in each of these councils resided faculties and think-tankers by the score. On the justice policy task force there were 195 members, lawyers brave and strong. On the economic council, more than 200 economists did search for a conclusion. When these groups did meet, so long was the line of approaching Volvos that it was visible from outer space. 
 Yet still the message was not honed. King Kerry still did equivocate, hedge and reverse. Of flip-flops there were more than a few. He still did Velcro his principles upon the cathedral door, and change them by the hour. 
 The apparatus grew again. Elmendorf from the Land of Gephardt was hired, along with Lackey from the House of Edwards. Teams of de-equivocators gathered. And still the fog spread.
 And so the age of nymphomottomania did begin. Suddenly it was realized what was missing. A theme! A slogan! The muses were mobilized to find that motto, which would give shape and precision to the cause. Over the weeks ''A Better Set of Choices'' begat ''Safer, Stronger and More Secure,'' which begat ''The Real Deal,'' which begat ''Change Starts Here,'' which begat ''Let America Be America Again,'' which begat ''Hope Is on the Way.''
 Night and day the serial sloganators did work. And the seasons did turn and the conventions did come and go. Kerry's speeches were shortened, and parts of his life were edited out of his story (adulthood, for example). And yet there was still wailing in the House of Kerry for the message was still unhoned. 
 Kerry himself pinpointed the problem. Of advisers, there were not enough! So this month yet more were brought in, mostly from the camp of Clinton. There is McCurry, Lockhart, Carville and Begala. There is Greenberg and Wolfson.
 And so it came to pass there are no swing voters left, because they've all been hired by campaign Kerry. They form a great and mighty leviathan, dedicated to the proposition that John Kerry should believe in something. The flow chart is as clear as can be. Sasso reports to Lockhart, Devine, Sosnick, Cutter and Cahill, while Cutter reports to Devine, Mellman, McCurry, Shrum and herself -- except on weekends, when Devine reports to Mellman and Sosnick and Cahill reports to McCurry and Sasso. Lockhart handles strategic response, McCurry daily response, Cutter tactical response and Cahill metaresponse.
 Vast is the empire crafting Kerry's creed. Immense is the army of Michelangelos trying to sculpture the melted marshmallow of Kerry's core. And the seasons do turn and the polls do shift and the rending of garments gives way to the sunshine of hope and back again.
 And tumultuous is the cry of the strategists, and loud are the furies of the campaign, but in the center there is a silence. For in the beginning all was vacuum and a void, and while all the king's horses and all the king's men do build this grand and mighty structure, the sound of their hammers echoes limitlessly in the hollow within.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Aid to City Will Protect The Country

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that Congress was finally heeding his calls for more antiterrorism money for New York City and other potential targets, but that the work to secure the aid must go on.
 The mayor addressed the issue as Republican leaders in Congress were reconsidering the way that the federal government distributes antiterrorism funds to local governments. For months now, New York officials and many other critics -- including members of the 9/11 commission -- have charged that the process has become fraught with pork-barrel politics, and some of the Republicans, mindful of that study, are now saying the money should be doled out partly on the basis of a city's risk factor for terrorist attacks. 
 The mayor told listeners on his weekly radio program on WABC-AM that the shift in Congress was ''good news and bad news,'' adding, ''I think they recognize it, but I'm not sure that they've got the right solution yet.''
 New York recently received $5.47 per resident in antiterrorism money compared with a national state average of $7.77. In contrast, Wyoming received $38.31 per resident. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, one of the most outspoken critics of the antiterrorism spending formula, has contended that antiterrorism money should be distributed based solely on threat levels. Yesterday, he criticized proposed federal legislation that seeks to establish a commission to study the issue. 
 ''One of the suggestions is a blue ribbon panel that would look at who needs what,'' he said. ''And I guess my position is, enough with the panels. We've had them. We know who is the target.''
 Mr. Bloomberg said that New York has been spending an ''enormous amount of money'' -- money that he says the city does not have -- to protect residents from terrorism. City officials have estimated the cost of security, training and equipment at more than $500 million a year.
 The mayor said the extra expense ''means higher taxes'' or fewer services for city residents. He argued that the money would benefit not only New Yorkers but also the rest of the country because the city is the ''economic engine of the country to a great extent.''
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg rejected a suggestion that Congressional leaders were simply stalling. ''I think there's a lot of pressure on Congress, and they're responding, but you know it takes a long time,'' he said. ''Everybody is trying to represent their constituents, as well as the whole country, and it's being battled out. We haven't won, but I'd rather be in the situation where we are today than we were a month ago.''
 Mr. Bloomberg also attributed the shift among Republican leaders to behind-the-scenes pressure from city officials that has occasionally spilled into public view. In June, a luncheon for Republican Congressional leaders at the mayor's town house on the Upper East Side was canceled after the mayor withdrew an invitation to Bob Ney, an Ohio congressman who voted against an amendment that sought to shift more antiterrorism money to New York City and other high-risk urban areas. 
 ''I've never been reticent about standing up and pushing and demanding and cajoling,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''I just tend not to do it in public. Although every once in while if I disinvite somebody to my house because they didn't vote for New York City, I guess that does get into the newspapers.''

HEADLINE: Meager Job Growth in States Closely Divided on Candidates

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Less than seven weeks before the presidential election, employment figures released on Friday showed that job creation slowed to a crawl last month in some swing states hit hard by widespread layoffs in manufacturing.
 Ohio, which has 20 electoral votes and is seen as crucial for victory by both President Bush and Senator John Kerry, lost 11,800 jobs in August and has about 40,000 fewer jobs than when the nation's job market began to pick up a year ago.
 Missouri, another swing state, lost a total of 5,500 jobs in August and about 24,000 jobs since June. But in a bit of good news for the president, about 6,000 manufacturing jobs were added over the past year, and the state's employment is still slightly higher than it was one year ago. 
 Over all, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that employment climbed in 30 states and declined in 20 others during August. Nationwide, the Labor Department has estimated that employment rose by 144,000 jobs in August, slightly more than the number needed to keep up with increases in population, but not enough to significantly lower the unemployment rate, which stood at 5.4 percent.
 Florida, a major swing state with 27 electoral votes, added 16,600 jobs last month and has gained about 100,000 over the past year. But most of the other closely fought states have been treading water for the past three months, and some are barely ahead of where they were a year ago.
 Michigan, with an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, has lost 21,000 jobs since June and 45,000 over the past year. Minnesota has had virtually no employment growth since June. West Virginia, with 5.5 percent unemployment and a civilian workforce of 800,000, has added 7,000 jobs over the past year and 2,000 in the last three months. 
 Over all, the nation has added about 1.7 million jobs over the past year but has about 900,000 fewer than when Mr. Bush took office in January 2001. The unusually slow pace of job creation is one of Mr. Bush's biggest domestic weaknesses, and the most acute employment problems are in heavily populated industrial states like Ohio and Michigan.
 Mr. Bush and his advisers are well aware of the danger. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, addressing a conference on work-force training on Friday in Westerville, Ohio, acknowledged that the state's unemployment was higher than he would like.
 ''It is critical that we persevere because Ohio needs some good news,'' Mr. Snow said in his prepared remarks, noting that the state had added 12,000 jobs this year. ''It hasn't been enough, and gains haven't been as steady as we'd like.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's campaign immediately focused on the latest numbers for Ohio, contending that the state had lost 237,400 jobs since Mr. Bush took office. ''At this rate, Ohio will not see its first new job until 2017,'' the campaign said in a statement on Friday.
 Several recent polls show that a majority of voters are unhappy about Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, but that many are also uneasy about Mr. Kerry. In the latest New York Times/CBS poll, published Saturday, 56 percent of respondents were uneasy about Mr. Bush's economic leadership while 51 percent were uneasy with Mr. Kerry on the issue.
 A poll in August by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that only 33 percent of respondents described the economy as either ''good'' or ''excellent,'' while 55 percent said that jobs in their communities were hard to find.
 ''I think continuing concerns about the economy and Iraq are what is keeping Kerry in the game,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. 
 The state-by-state data released on Friday was consistent with a broader slowdown in economic growth that took hold around June and at least temporarily blunted the surge in employment last spring. Most economists say the slowdown is a temporary result of higher oil prices. 
 Political analysts and polling experts say voters' attitudes about the economy are largely cemented a few months before the election, suggesting that Mr. Bush is unlikely to benefit from widespread economic optimism or rising incomes.

HEADLINE: BUSH OPENS LEAD DESPITE UNEASE VOICED IN SURVEY

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry faces substantial obstacles in his bid to unseat President Bush, with voters saying he has not laid out a case for why he wants to be president and expressing strong concern about his ability to manage an international crisis, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 Less than seven weeks before Election Day, Americans continue to think that the nation is heading in the wrong direction and are distressed about how Mr. Bush has handled the economy. Yet the president, apparently lifted as much by what Mr. Kerry has done wrong as by what Mr. Bush has done right in the campaign, has an eight-point lead among registered voters, the poll found.
 In one particularly troublesome sign for Mr. Kerry, a majority of voters said he was spending too much time attacking Mr. Bush and talking about the past, rather than explaining what he would do as president. In contrast, half of the registered voters said Mr. Bush had offered a clear vision of what he wanted to do in a second term. 
 That finding, combined with an rising unfavorable view of Mr. Kerry, underlines the complicated challenge the senator confronts as he tries to attack Mr. Bush without alienating voters put off by negative campaigning.
 Mr. Kerry's problems have apparently been deepened by the relentless attacks on his Vietnam War record by a group of Vietnam veterans supported by backers of Mr. Bush. Three-quarters of respondents said they were aware of the advertisements produced by the group, many of which involved accusations unsupported by official records; of those, 33 percent called the accusations ''mostly true.''
 More than 60 percent of respondents said Mr. Kerry was either ''hiding something'' or ''mostly lying'' in discussing his service in Vietnam. At the same time, 71 percent said that Mr. Bush was ''hiding something'' or ''mostly lying'' about his Vietnam era service in the National Guard, which has been the subject of questions about how he got a coveted out-of-combat assignment, and whether he fulfilled the required service. 
 Sixty percent of respondents said they did not have confidence in Mr. Kerry to deal wisely with an international crisis; that is a jump from 52 percent in June. By contrast, 48 percent said they were uneasy with Mr. Bush's ability to manage a foreign crisis.
 For all of that, there are signs that the election remains competitive, and that the upcoming debates could prove pivotal to Mr. Kerry's hopes. Respondents said they were unhappy with Mr. Bush's handling of the economy and of Iraq, and said his policies had increased the cost of prescription drugs and decreased the number of jobs. 
 About 80 percent of respondents said that Mr. Bush was either ''hiding something'' or ''mostly lying'' in talking about the war in Iraq. A plurality of voters disapproved of how he had managed the war. But the disapproval was not as sharp as it was before the handover of power to an Iraqi government in June, even though Mr. Kerry has turned up his attacks on Mr. Bush's handling of the war and the American death toll recently passed 1,000.
 A plurality said Iraq had produced more casualties than originally expected.
 This poll and several others in recent days with differing findings have suggested that the electorate is in flux. Alternatively, the different results may reflect how difficult it is to poll a closely divided public, particularly when answering machines, caller identification devices and cellphones make people harder to reach on their home telephones. 
 For example, a Pew Research Center poll and a Harris Interactive poll released on Thursday found the race tied. A Gallup poll made public that same day found that Mr. Bush had a lead of 8 points among all registered voters, and 13 points among who Gallup said were likely voters.
 Still, the Times/CBS Poll suggested that Mr. Kerry faced a challenging six weeks. The percentage of Americans who said Mr. Kerry had exhibited strong leadership qualities dropped eight points since summer to 50 percent; by contrast, 63 percent said Mr. Bush had exhibited strong qualities of leadership.
 And on the issue that Mr. Kerry once hoped to ride to the White House -- the economy -- he is not faring much better than Mr. Bush. A slight majority, 51 percent, said they were uneasy with Mr. Kerry's ability to make the right decisions about the economy, compared with 56 percent who said the same about Mr. Bush.
 Over all, the Times/CBS Poll found that Mr. Bush had the support of 50 percent of registered voters, compared with 42 percent for Mr. Kerry. Among those who said they were likely to vote, Mr. Bush led 51 percent to 42 percent. When Ralph Nader was included, Mr. Bush led by 50 percent to 41 percent among registered voters, with Mr. Nader drawing 3 percent.
 Mr. Kerry's advisers said they thought the lead was probably closer to 2 or 3 points, while Mr. Bush's aides said it was around 5 points.
 The Times/CBS nationwide telephone poll of 1,088 registered voters was conducted Sunday through Thursday. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
 Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush adviser, said Mr. Kerry faced a difficult challenge in trying to turn the race around by November.
 ''They would have to defy history at this point,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''No incumbent has lost with a lead like this and a job approval in the 50's, post-Labor Day.''
 The percentage of Americans who said they approved of Mr. Bush's job performance reached 50 percent, the highest since March; that is up slightly from 45 percent just before the Democratic convention in July.
 A senior Kerry adviser, Joe Lockhart, said he did not think Mr. Bush had a significant lead, pointing to the Pew and Harris Interactive polls. He said that Mr. Kerry had begun laying out his plans for the future .
 ''I think he has spent this week talking about the present,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''The public is very concerned about where the country is going in and it's both important to be straightforward about the problems we have, which the president has chosen to ignore or gloss over, and talking about what we are going do to about them.''
 The poll found that 61 percent of respondents expected Mr. Bush to win the election this fall; in March, shortly after Mr. Kerry clinched the Democratic nomination, just 44 percent thought Mr. Bush would win.
 By any measure, Mr. Bush is proving to be a resilient candidate who may defy some historical trends. He has gained an advantage over Mr. Kerry even as polls show people are unhappy with the direction the country is heading. Mr. Bush's advisers have long argued that many Americans, in an election being held under the shadow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, are less apt to blame the president for the nation's heading in the wrong direction.
 Mr. Kerry's difficulties at communicating a defining message -- something that Democrats have urged him to do for months -- was reflected both in the poll and in follow-up interviews with respondents.
 ''I don't feel I have a clear enough picture of Mr. Kerry's agenda,'' said George Adair, 50, a Democrat and utilities manager from Alabama. ''I think Mr. Kerry has worked against himself in that area by making such an issue of his Vietnam War record, and that has backfired mightily. I don't know that what happened 30 years ago in either gentleman's case has much to do with their ability as president.''
 Mary Crawford, 81, a Democrat from Lakeland, Fla., said she intended to vote for Mr. Kerry because she thought Mr. Bush had taken the nation in the wrong direction. But she remained concerned that Mr. Kerry had not spelled out why he was running.
 ''I believe that Kerry truly wants to see employment and business back in the United States helping the people here,'' she said. ''I think Kerry believes that it's necessary for people to have health insurance. I think Kerry could explain it better.''
 There were signs that the Republicans had achieved some success in trying to undercut Mr. Kerry's credentials on fighting terrorism.
 Half of all registered voters said they had a lot of confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to protect the nation from another terrorist attack, while 26 percent said they had some confidence. By contrast, 26 percent had a lot of confidence in Mr. Kerry's ability to protect the nation from another terrorist attack; 37 percent said they had some confidence.
 More problematic, Mr. Kerry has lost ground among women, a decline that campaign aides attributed to Mr. Bush's ability to undercut Mr. Kerry on terrorism at his convention. In July, 52 percent of women supported Mr. Kerry and 40 percent Mr. Bush; in this latest poll, Mr. Bush had a 48 percent to 43 percent lead among women voters.
 The poll findings suggested that Mr. Kerry has been hurt by the attacks from the group of Vietnam veterans, known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, not only because they questioned his war record but also because they threw a spotlight on antiwar Senate testimony he gave when he returned from Vietnam. 
 Jim Rush, 57, an independent voter from Texas, said: ''His testimony came after some heavy fighting over there, and you wonder where his real patriotism is, Is it self or is it country? It points to his basic character, and I'll just leave it at that.''
 Mr. Bush's campaign has denied any involvement in the advertisements, but 42 percent of the respondents who were familiar with the ads said they believed the White House had a hand in them.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday through Thursday with 1,287 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 1,088 said they were registered to vote.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age and education.
 Based on the 2000 presidential vote, residents of heavily Republican counties, heavily Democratic counties and politically competitive counties were weighted to their proper share of the population. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Many See Musharraf Keeping Army Post to Cement Power

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE and SALMAN MASOOD; David Rohde reported from Karachi for this article, and Salman Masood from Islamabad.

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Gen. Pervez Musharraf says he has not yet made up his mind, but the men who owe him their posts, prestige and power certainly have.
 In a series of sometimes ham-handed public pronouncements this week, a parade of senior government officials appointed by General Musharraf called on him to break his promise to resign as Pakistan's army chief and serve only as the country's civilian president by the end of 2004.
 ''In my personal opinion, the president should remain in uniform in the national interest,'' Shaukat Aziz, a former Citibank executive whom General Musharraf made prime minister last month, told journalists on Thursday. ''There is no hitch in the constitution.'' 
 The general's promise, which was made last December, was hailed nationally and internationally as a step toward returning Pakistan to democratic rule five years after General Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup. But Pakistani political analysts said this week's pronouncements appear to be an orchestrated effort to prepare the Pakistani public for the latest in a series of power plays by Pakistan's president-general. 
 ''The president will continue with the strategy of concentrating power in his hands,'' Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst based in Lahore, said this week. ''It will undermine the autonomous growth of civil institutions and will negatively impact democracy in the country.''
 While General Musharraf wins high marks from American officials for his pursuit of members of Al Qaeda, growth in Pakistan's economy and public calls for ''enlightened moderation'' in Islamic countries, Pakistani political analysts say the political system he oversees is increasingly anemic. Pakistan's traditional political parties are the weakest they have been in the country's history, they say, while the army is at its zenith.
 The country's news media remain more or less free, but General Musharraf and his backers exert pressure when coverage is seen as too critical of Pakistan's powerful military, according to journalists. Instead of gradually ceding or sharing power, political analysts say, General Musharraf and his backers appear to be growing more brazen in their statements, actions and dominance.
 They cite a series of examples. This winter and spring, General Musharraf said he and other high-ranking officers never knew that the country's top nuclear scientist was operating the largest nuclear smuggling ring in history. Then the country's leading opposition figure was arrested and sentenced to 23 years in prison. The police flouted a Supreme Court ruling allowing the return to Pakistan of the younger brother of the civilian leader General Musharraf deposed. 
 This summer, Prime Minister Aziz, who had never before been elected to public office, won what was widely seen as a staged election.
 General Musharraf's defenders point out that there has been no widespread popular opposition to his rule and he continues to receive generally high marks in public opinion polls. The inept and corrupt rule of the country's two prime ministers in the 1990's, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, also appears to have diminished the public's faith in Pakistani politicians. 
 Western diplomats complain that while the country's opposition members are full of fiery rhetoric and criticism of General Musharraf, they have proven to be largely ineffective political opponents. 
 But Siddiqul Farooq, a spokesman for the anti-Musharraf faction of the Pakistan Muslim League political party, blamed Western countries for the situation.
 ''If the West does not believe in double standards and if the West believes in the democratic system, then it should also like to see the same system in Pakistan,'' he said. ''The West should put pressure on Musharraf.''
 The State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday that General Musharraf had made no final decision. But he told reporters in Washington that it was in Pakistan's interest to continue the transition to a fully functioning democracy.
 ''We do expect to see continuing progress towards this goal, which is central to Pakistan becoming a moderate and modern Islamic state,'' Mr. Boucher said, according to Agence France-Presse.
 Last December, after months of protracted negotiations with the opposition over military rule, General Musharraf announced he would step down as the army chief by Dec. 31, 2004. In return, an alliance of hard-line religious parties agreed to vote in Parliament for the ratification of a series of controversial constitutional amendments unilaterally enacted by General Musharraf, which empowered him to sack the government and to dissolve the elected Parliament.
 But General Musharraf, whose core source of power is his military position, showed signs of wavering just months after striking the deal. Pakistan's army has ruled the country for most of its 47-year history, and no civilian government has been able to complete its term in office. 
 In an interview with a Dubai-based television station earlier this month, General Musharraf was asked whether he thought the majority of Pakistanis would want him to take off his uniform and become the country's civilian president.
 ''Ninety-six percent will say 'do not remove,''' the general replied.


CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the possibility that Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, will break his promise to resign as the army chief by the end of this year misstated the country's age. It is 57 years old, not 47.

THORNBROUGH, ALBERT

 BODY:
 THORNBROUGH -- Albert Adam passed away September 8th as a result of complications from a stroke he suffered six weeks ago. He had just celebrated his 92nd birthday. He was born on the plains in Lakin, Kansas and lived there through the Dust Bowl and the Depression. After graduating from Kansas State University in 1934 with high honors, he began graduate studies at Harvard which led to a Master's Degree in Agricultural Economics before WWII intervened. He served in Washington in the Office of Price Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers during the War, eventually joining the Reserves as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1946. His business career began with Harry Ferguson Inc., the farm equipment manufacturer, in Detroit in 1946. After the company merged with Massey Harris in 1953, he advanced to the President of the combined entity in 1956. He became Chief Executive Officer in 1966 and served in that role until his retirement in 1978. He presided over Massey's global expansion in the 60's and 70's. During much of this period he and his family resided in Toronto, Canada. However, he considered Boca Raton his home for the last 40 years. During his career and his retirement he served as a director and trustee of numerous boards including the University of Guelph, Lynn University, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Farm Equipment Institute and the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. Mr. Thornbrough, devoted husband for 61 years to Virginia Thornbrough, is survived by his three children: Susan Thornbrough Staiger and Jon Staiger; Wayne Thornbrough and his wife Barbara; Grant Thornbrough and his wife Diana. 
In addition, he leaves six adult grandchildren and one new great-grandchild. He also leaves behind his beloved Marlene Fay whose companionship enriched his later years. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, September 26th at 2PM at the First Presbyterian Church of Boca Raton. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Albert Thornbrough Scholarship Fund at Lynn University, 3601 North Military Trail, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, or to the charity of your choice. His path from the plains, to the highest levels of academia, to successful global businessman while serving his country and community has been an inspiration to his family and friends around the world.

HEADLINE: Worst-Case Scenarios

 BODY:
Westchester residents can be forgiven for feeling jumpy, given the talk this month about the apocalyptic cloud that seems to be looming over the county. First it was the announcement that West Lake Drive, above Kensico Dam in Valhalla, would be closed to vehicles for good. Andrew Spano, the county executive, had to decide between traffic headaches from the closed road or the possibility of a 60-foot wall of water washing away White Plains and leaving New York City without drinking water. He chose the headaches, but only after demanding, and getting, a federal study showing that the risk from a terrorist truck bomb at the dam was too great to ignore. 
 Then came a report from the group Riverkeeper, detailing what could happen if terrorists attacked the Indian Point nuclear plant: tens of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands fatally sickened and economic consequences in trillions of dollars.
 The arguments in the report, ''Chernobyl on the Hudson?,'' are echoed in a new documentary film on HBO, ''Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable,'' by the filmmaker Rory Kennedy, whose brother Robert Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for Riverkeeper. The word ''imagining'' was well chosen, for the potential dangers the film describes exist in remote realms -- a hijacked jetliner damaging the containment dome or terrorists sabotaging the plant. Such events may seem too farfetched to worry about, but -- so did 9/11. 
 Riverkeeper and Ms. Kennedy freely admit to using scare tactics to further their impassioned advocacy, and we have no major quarrel with that, particularly if their strategy increases the pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Entergy Nuclear Northeast to keep security at the plant tight. Our impulse, though, is to be wary of arguments for rash action based on worst-case assumptions. Scary scenarios tend to remind us of President Bush's defense of the Iraq invasion -- that he had to protect us from the Armageddon that Saddam Hussein was planning in his dreams. 
 If Indian Point can be shuttered without disrupting the region's heavily strained power supply or increasing our dependence on dirty fuels like coal, fine. Mr. Spano, who has long wanted to close Indian Point, has commissioned a study by Levitan & Associates to explore ways to do that.
 Next month, the firm will seek public input on ways to do without Indian Point. The discussion, county officials say, will focus on whether the plant's energy is needed, how it could be replaced and how a shutdown or county takeover might affect energy costs and taxes. This discussion may not be all that dramatic, but it promises to be particularly useful in the real world, where most of us want to keep on living.

HEADLINE: Rising Market Helps End a Standoff

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IT is perhaps the ultimate New York developer's fantasy: finding a classic 12-story prewar Park Avenue building plus penthouse and restoring it from an empty shell into the sort of grand 4,200-square-foot apartments that haven't been built in a generation.
 But for the people who made their homes in the fancy building at 823 Park Avenue, at 75th Street, it was more of a nightmare as a series of would-be developers struggled to rid the building of tenants protected by rent control and rent stabilization laws.
 This time, however, the story has a mostly happy ending and a moral for our times: a rising real estate market can heal many wounds. Rising prices provided enough money for the building owner to sell it and make a huge profit, and provide millions for cash buyouts for tenants. 
 The tenants fought off a conversion plan in the 1970's, stopped another plan in the 1980's for a ''lollipop'' condominium, in which a new building would be built on top of the old one, and for a time in the early 1990's, ran the building themselves after a developer lost it for nonpayment of taxes. 
 Finally last spring, while both sides were waiting for a decision from the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal -- a process that had involved 170 hearing dates stretching more than three-and-a-half years that was recorded in a 100,000-page transcript -- the final 17 tenants took significant, but undisclosed, buyouts. 
 Their latest adversary, Robert Manocherian, the nephew of Freydun Manocherian, the owner of the New York Health and Racquet Club, had purchased the building for $4.1 million at a city auction in 1994. As the last of the tenants were packing up in recent months, he sold the building for $60 million, on the condition that he deliver it empty of tenants in what brokers and appraisers say is among the highest prices paid per square foot for a large apartment building, more than $1,050 a square foot. This is roughly the same price per square foot as the average for three-bedroom apartments on the Upper East Side last year. 
 The sale was made public last month, and the buyer, Property Markets Group, now plans to restore the 1912 building to its original grandeur and convert it to a condominium. The building will have one 50-foot-wide apartment per floor, with a library, living room and dining room across the front. 
 Elliott Joseph, a principal at Property Markets, says he plans to apply to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for permission to add an additional room in the rear on each floor, as well as a 1,500-square-foot bedroom suite on top of the existing penthouse, which would create a rooftop triplex with 8,500 square feet. Prices could run from $2,000 to $3,000 a square foot, or $10 million for a typical apartment. 
 ''This deal was a win, win, win situation'' Mr. Joseph said, ''for the tenants, for the seller, and for us.''
 In the 1940's, after a Depression-era default by a co-op that owned the building, the huge apartments were subdivided, usually into three apartments per floor, a two-bedroom apartment in the front and two one-bedroom apartments in the back, and converted to a rental building. 
 David Redden, a vice chairman of Sotheby's, said he was able to rent one of these 38 apartments in 1976, on a lunch break from his job as a young Sotheby's employee.
 Rents were low, and protected by rent control and rent stabilization laws. As values in the neighborhood rose and rose again, the relationship between owners and tenants deteriorated. Mr. Redden and other tenant leaders organized the building and hired lawyers, but were unable to buy the property at the tax auction in 1994. 
 Mr. Manocherian began a proceeding to evict the tenants in the building to rebuild it. 
 Under the law, he could evict the rent-controlled tenants only if he showed that he faced an economic hardship that would be reduced if he subdivided the apartments and added 20 percent more units.
 Most of the tenants hired David Rozenholc, a lawyer who specializes in demolition cases, and the case dragged on. But as time passed, condominium prices on the Upper East Side increased nearly two and half times, making possible a deal that one person involved in the settlement said was one of the largest buyouts ever for a group of tenants. ''Nobody likes to give money away, but both sides were happy,'' said Patti A. Stone, who represented Mr. Manocherian.

HEADLINE: White-Collar Stress? Stop the Whining

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WORKPLACE stress is back in the news. American workers are frazzled to the point of illness, experts say, and enlightened employers are offering yoga classes, massage and other palliatives to combat the problem.
 Talk about civilization and its discontents. If you find the modern, air-conditioned workplace stressful -- all that e-mail! -- just think back to the work most Americans used to do. Men were farmhands, coal miners, steelworkers and the like, working every day with the risk of death or destitution hovering nearby. Women who worked outside the home were poorly paid for difficult jobs -- often as domestics or millworkers, toiling at the whim of wealthy employers. Opportunities for minorities were extremely limited, and discrimination against blacks, for example, was so acute that most were excluded from all but the most menial jobs. Now that's stress. 
 Business cycles were far more jarring, too. In 1933, for example, unemployment reached 25 percent. Until the New Deal, the government provided virtually no social safety net. Most people back then worked 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, yet had little or no savings to cushion against disability or sudden dismissal. Tough antidiscrimination and workplace safety laws didn't come until the 1960's and 70's. 
 For many people today, work means 40-hour weeks in comfortable surroundings with legal protections against discrimination and sexual harassment and a higher standard of living than previous generations might ever have imagined. As a result of such affluence, life expectancy has climbed. Now when we say nobody's job is safe, we mean safe from capitalism's gales of creative destruction. People change jobs more often, but in terms of workplace hazards, most jobs are quite safe. Excluding homicide, workplace fatalities have fallen from 37 per 100,000 in 1933 to 18 in 1970 to roughly 4 today. 
 Minorities, traditionally disadvantaged in the job market, now have vastly greater opportunity, and millions of women and immigrants have been absorbed into the work force without raising unemployment beyond historical norms. The big health danger for many workers isn't stress; it's obesity. Modern work is so easy that it's making us fat.
 While sedentary doesn't always mean relaxed -- the executive suite and the trading pit are stressful in their own ways -- must we pity people with incomes in the six figures or higher? Work has always been stressful, and probably always will be. ''I don't think it's a new phenomenon,'' says Carl E. Van Horn, a professor of public policy at Rutgers and an authority on the history of work in the United States. ''Work is not a picnic. It's always tough for people.''
 So why, suddenly, all the talk of stress? The reason is not collective workplace amnesia, our therapeutic culture or the mistaken notion that all of our jobs are about to move to India, which conveniently popped up on the blame horizon when Japan's economic miracle faded. Sure, economic change is scary today, but it was scarier in the 70's, when inflation and unemployment were competing specters and empty factories symbolized America's economic decline. Remember stagflation?
 I have a different theory about workplace stress: In many households, even affluent ones, men and women typically both have jobs, leaving a void at home that no one seems to know how to fill. Life becomes a hectic blur -- even more so for single parents. 
 In a broad national survey released in 2002, Professor Van Horn has told Congress, workers were generally satisfied with their jobs but considered ''the ability to balance work and family as more important than any other job factor,'' including job security and salary. 
 It is noteworthy that in news media coverage of job stress, the emphasis is usually on educated middle-class professionals who, in fact, have many choices -- including a lower-pressure job or simply working less. All this hand-wringing over the suffering of the relatively fortunate only distracts us from the plight of Americans whose work lives are really stressful: those who are paid $7 or $8 an hour, don't have health insurance and lack the skills or education to better their lot. 
 Life for these workers is a tightrope act without a net, so the least that we lucky ones can do is stop whining. Better yet, we can honor their labor by adopting social policies, like national health insurance, a higher minimum wage and tougher limits on unskilled immigration, that will ease their struggle. It will cost us something, of course. But for the working poor, yoga won't cut it.

HEADLINE: Think New York Is Expensive? Try Tokyo or Paris

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Brace yourself, America. Breathe deeply. This may be a jolt to the national ego. Americans, after all, pride themselves on having the biggest, most expensive of everything, whether it's cars or houses or buckets of Coke. 
 But when it comes to cost of living, American cities are -- sorry -- down in the bargain basement. In its latest survey, in fact, the Economist Intelligence Unit -- the business information arm of The Economist's publisher -- reports that not one city in the United States was among the 25 most costly in the world. 
 How could that be, with all those tales of multimillion-dollar Manhattan garrets? Ah, but those are lowly dollars, not yen or euros or other powerful currencies. The dollar's continued woes have pushed New York to 27th place from 13th in just the last year. And Chicago and Los Angeles are way down there, tied for 33rd. 
 In other words, if you can make it in New York, New York, you can make it anywhere -- except, of course, Tokyo, Osaka, Paris, Oslo, Copenhagen, Zurich, London, Reykjavik . . .

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Interrupts a Dow Winning Streak

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average fell last week for the first time in five weeks, a small decline attributed mainly to the problems of one stock, Coca-Cola.
 Until last week, the Dow had enjoyed weekly gains since early August, for its longest streak since January. 
And if not for Coke, it might have had a good chance of continuing that run. But Coca-Cola fell 6.2 percent for the week, to its lowest level in more than a year. The stock's decline accounted directly for roughly two-thirds of the total weekly decline of the Dow, and it may have helped to pull down other stocks.
 The company, the world's largest soft-drink maker, said earnings in the second half would decline sharply, largely because its sales in North America and Europe have been weak, according to Bloomberg News. 
 For the week, the Dow, lost 28.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,284.46. The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, both gained slightly for the week. The Nasdaq rose 15.78 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,910.09. The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 4.63 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,128.55. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.11 percent from 4.19 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Struggling, Even With a Tuition Break

BYLINE: By Abby Ellin. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In his 60 years, Norman Maxwell has been a woodworker, a contractor and an administrative assistant at Citibank and Goldman Sachs. He has been an actor in ''Billy Bathgate,'' ''The Prince of Tides'' and ''The Sopranos.'' He is the father of four and a veteran of the Vietnam War.
 His most recent role has been that of teacher with the New York City Teaching Fellows, a four-year-old program that trains new recruits in the New York public school system. Some fellows are retired and embarking on second or third careers; others are recent college graduates. The fellows are placed at various schools in the city and earn master's degrees at the same time; typically, it takes about two years. Mr. Maxwell, who teaches special education at the Jeffrey M. Rapport School for Career Development in the Bronx, calls it one of the more rewarding experiences of his life. 
 If only the rewards extended into the financial arena.
 Mr. Maxwell and his colleagues earn an annual stipend of about $40,000, plus health benefits, during their two years as teaching fellows. (The salary goes up a few thousand once the degree is completed.) The Department of Education deducts the $4,000 tuition for the master's degree from the teaching fellows' paychecks. The fellows are responsible for books and other materials. The program places them where teachers are most needed, often in troubled schools.
 ''It's hard,'' admitted Mr. Maxwell, who is in his second year at Mercy College, in the Bronx. ''Just about everyone I know works two or three jobs, on top of teaching full time and going to school full time. A lot of teachers have part-time jobs as coaches or youth counselors in after-school programs, and many others work at night as teachers or janitors. Some have money saved, but if not, people will do anything.''
 Jim Kernochan, 47, is also a second-year fellow who teaches special education at Public School 721 in the north Bronx.
 A former statistician at Barron's magazine, where he worked for 26 years, Mr. Kernochan was laid off in May 2002. He had planned on becoming a teacher when he retired but revised his plans after the layoffs.
 ''I loved my corporate career, but I was not as satisfied in the 26 years I was there as I was last year, as a teacher,'' he said. ''I have emotionally disturbed teenagers, and I loved it. It's what got me up in the morning.'' For extra money, he transcribes tapes for PBS.
 Mr. Kernochan said he is ''obnoxiously good at organizing his time,'' but it is still a challenge. ''It was a good thing I had long-term friends who understood that I fell in a dark hole and couldn't come out except for holidays,'' he said. 
 Like Mr. Kernochan, Mr. Maxwell had not planned on becoming a teacher. Until 9/11, he was enjoying his stint as a temporary employee at Goldman Sachs. But he was let go after the terrorist attacks and was unemployed for three years. He survived on money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and royalties from earlier film and television jobs. 
 Then he heard about the fellowship program, and he applied in the spring of 2003. He was not sure he would be accepted; the application process is rigorous and very competitive. (According to the program's Web site, 17,000 people applied last year; about one in eight were accepted.) But he was admitted, and he began in the summer of 2003. He expects to be done by May 2005.
 He cites his expenses: $5,000 for school; $1,800 for rent on his downtown apartment, which he splits with a roommate; college tuition for his son, Sam. ''I'm paying out more for my son than I'm taking in,'' he said cheerfully. ''I made more as a temp doing PowerPoint and Excel then I do now.''
 The work is exhausting. Mr. Maxwell shuttles up to the Bronx at 7 a.m. and attends school at night or on Saturdays. ''One of my part-time jobs is writing papers,'' he said with a laugh. ''Too bad it doesn't pay.''
 So how does he survive? Very carefully. Since his savings were limited, he took out a loan. He recently enrolled in AmeriCorps, which offers a $4,725 award to fellows. He also gets $2,000 as a Vietnam veteran, as well as royalties from the Screen Actors Guild. He takes the occasional acting role. He carves wood sculptures and sells them. He does freelance graphic design work.
 ''I didn't do it for the money, although it's nice to have a regular paycheck again and be off in the summers,'' he said. 
 ''But I wanted to get a degree and give back to the kids, and the biggest pay I'm getting is keeping my brain alive. It kind of keeps you young. That's a payoff.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Said to Lift India Nuclear Curbs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The United States has lifted decades-old export restrictions on equipment for India's commercial space program and nuclear power plants, India said Saturday, in a sign of the increasingly close ties between the two nations.
 American firms have not been allowed to sell sophisticated equipment or technology to India as part of a ban in place for decades to prevent their use for military purposes. 
India was long seen by Washington as a cold war ally of the Soviet Union.
 But the Indian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the Bush administration had eased the export restrictions after India addressed concerns about weapons proliferation under the so-called Next Steps in Strategic Partnership plan set up in January.
 A State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli said, the two countries could now take cooperation a step further. ''They agreed to expand cooperation in three areas: civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programs and high-technology trade,'' he said. ''In addition, we agreed to expand our dialogue on missile defense. I think this shows a growing relationship.''

 BODY:

THE SECOND BILL OF RIGHTS
FDR's Unfinished Revolution and
Why We Need It More Than Ever.
By Cass R. Sunstein.
294 pp. Basic Books. $25.
 WRITING in defense of Britain's emerging welfare state in the aftermath of World War II, the sociologist T. H. Marshall divided the claims of citizenship, like Gaul, into three parts: civil, political and social. The first was composed of personal rights, including freedom of speech and religion. The second consisted in ''the right to participate in the exercise of political power.'' The first set of rights enabled the second; democracy depended on the personal liberty of individual citizens.
 Those concepts and their relationship to one another would have been easily comprehensible to the American founders. But the third, or social, citizenship Marshall rightly identified as an artifact of modernity, European modernity in particular. It included ''the whole range from the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in the society.''+The celebrated intellectual historian Isaiah Berlin concurred: ''To offer political rights, or safeguards against intervention by the state, to men who are half-naked, illiterate, underfed and diseased is to mock their condition. . . . What is freedom to those who cannot make use of it? Without adequate conditions for the use of freedom, what is the value of freedom?'' 
 The crucial importance of the links between social rights and effective citizenship is the theme of Cass R. Sunstein's provocative new book. He boldly addresses the central question vexing democracies for the last century or more: what is the legitimate role of the state in providing for social and economic welfare? Writers like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman have loudly denounced the exercise of state power for those ends. ''The Second Bill of Rights'' is meant as a rebuttal to their libertarian ideas.
 Curiously, Sunstein summons neither Berlin nor Marshall to buttress his argument. But he agrees with them that the conditions of modern life require guarantees of education, employment, housing, food and medical care if citizenship is to be meaningful and democracy to survive. A professor of both political science and law at the University of Chicago, Sunstein has written an eclectic, lawyerly brief to support his appeal for a comprehensive update of the American social contract. But the jury of his readers may reach a different and disappointing verdict. 
 Sunstein worries that since the 1980's ''a confused and pernicious form of individualism'' has displaced a social ethos whose origins he traces to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal era. Like Isaiah Berlin, whose thinking on this issue he may well have inspired, Roosevelt bundled economic and political rights into an indivisible package: ''Freedom is no half-and-half affair,'' he declared in 1936. And later: '' 'Necessitous men are not free men.' People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.'' Sunstein considers the second Bill of Rights that Roosevelt called for in 1944 ''a leading American export,'' the model for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Social Charter and several recent constitutions.
 Yet it is a paradoxical and sobering truth that the United States itself has never officially embraced the guarantees of social welfare common in most other Western societies. Dutifully citing America's shameful social deficits, like wretched schools and millions of citizens without health care, Sunstein proposes to tell us why we need a second Bill of Rights more than ever. But instead he inadvertently ends up explaining why we don't have one. His book is less an expose in the manner, say, of Gunnar Myrdal's indictment of segregation or Michael Harrington's of poverty, than a telling analysis of stubborn peculiarities of American political culture. 
 The United States Constitution was written in an age before the integral relation of social and economic rights to political vitality was properly appreciated. Further, our constitutional tradition is pragmatic, not merely aspirational, reluctant to incorporate claims that might prove difficult to implement (the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause is an interesting exception, which Sunstein lucidly explicates). Most important are several distinctive conditions, including the absence of a working-class political party, the persistence of largely delusional expectations of social mobility and tensions along the racial and ethnic frontiers that have long seamed American society. The failure during Reconstruction to provide emancipated slaves with the ''40 acres and a mule'' then seen as the minimum requirement for self-sufficiency, Roosevelt's inability to advance beyond the dramatic but limited achievements of the New Deal and the lack of a national health care system in our own time testify to Americans' durable wariness about state-sponsored social and economic rights.
 Sunstein clearly acknowledges those constraints, yet he insists that the real culprit is Richard Nixon, whose Supreme Court nominees reversed what Sunstein sees as a powerful judicial trend in the 1960's toward constitutionalizing a version of Roosevelt's second Bill of Rights. It's an ingenious argument, built on a cogent reading of the case-law history of the Warren Court, but it is ultimately less than persuasive. In the very 1944 speech that Sunstein makes the foundation of his brief, Roosevelt mentioned the ''second bill'' only as a kind of afterthought in an address that dealt mostly with the progress of World War II. He based his remarks on the report of an obscure agency, the National Resources Planning Board, that Congress had already legislated out of existence. The New Deal itself had been a spent force since the fiasco of his Supreme-Court-packing scheme in 1937. Even Sunstein ultimately concedes that the best one might hope for is the recognition of social rights as ''constitutive commitments,'' like Social Security, lacking constitutional standing but affirming a robust social promise. 
 That is a worthy ambition. But the sad fact is that it hasn't been realized through more than two centuries of the nation's history. Roosevelt's unfinished revolution may be destined to stay unfinished, for reasons embedded in our history and values. The ''pernicious individualism'' that so upsets Sunstein runs deep in American culture. It may or may not be pernicious, but it surely continues to make us who we are.

HEADLINE: Going Underground

BYLINE: By VINCE POLIMENI. 
Vince Polimeni, a former president of the Association for a Better Long Island, is president of Polimeni International, a development firm.

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY 

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND can no longer afford to run its economic lifeblood and millions of its residents through the boroughs of New York City. The terrorist assault on Manhattan and the region's static economy are two strong reasons for Long Island to have a direct connection to New England across the Long Island Sound. Creating such a connection would require significant money (an estimated $1.3 billion) and political courage, but unless we begin to study our strategic options, Long Island will remain a dead end for 2.7 million people.
 The idea of building a roadway to New England has been advanced before. In the late 1950's and 60's, the legendary urban planner Robert Moses, who had already drawn up the blueprints for a Long Island Sound bridge, ran into a buzz saw of opposition from the blue-blood residents of Long Island's Gold Coast. Once they enlisted the support of the governor at the time, Nelson Rockefeller, Mr. Moses' plan was quickly disposed of. Today, those residents still have the firepower to scuttle the construction of a Moses-like bridge. 
 The solution is a tunnel. In Robert Moses' day, a Long Island tunnel was considered impractical, but tunneling technology has advanced considerably since then. The most spectacular example of this is the Chunnel that links Great Britain to the rest of Europe. Tunneling across the Long Island Sound would present fewer technical challenges compared with that project. Indeed, what may be the greatest public works in New York's history, the water tunnel that connects upstate reservoirs to faucets throughout Manhattan, is taking place with virtually no one in New York being aware of what is occurring beneath their feet. 
 Digging a Long Island Sound tunnel is well within the ability of 21st-century construction technology. And it could be built without disturbing the usual opponents, the neighbors of its landfalls. Criticism can still be expected from Connecticut, whose attorney general took such great delight in opposing the creation of a Long Island Sound cable. Tunnel advocates could either seek federal intervention for a Connecticut terminus or route the underwater road into Rye, N.Y., in keeping with Mr. Moses' original concept of an all-New-York artery. 
 An existing north-south Long Island roadway, Route 135 (the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway), is the obvious access route to the tunnel; it already has convenient east-west connections to the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway. To begin tunneling at Jericho Turnpike would lengthen the route underground and cost more money but it would immediately solve the biggest concern of any construction project on Long Island: Nimby. Simply put, it wouldn't be in anyone's backyard. So while the technical issues can be resolved, and a tunnel avoids the hostility that faces construction, what are the reasons for creating a multibillion-dollar artery? Long Island's future depends on it. Today, every car, truck and train coming to the region must pass through New York City to reach Long Island. Even before 9/11 that choke point had become intolerable because of delays that could sometimes add a day to getting goods and products from New England to Long Island. Now we recognize that those New York City arteries could be shut off altogether. A tunnel would also significantly reduce the number of drivers navigating local roads in Nassau County looking for the least congested routes off Long Island.
 By allowing us to get local goods to national markets more quickly and cheaply, a tunnel would make us more competitive in manufacturing. But by cutting travel time, it would make the region far more attractive to tourists and visitors, strengthening a growing and critical part of our economy. It would encourage new investment, create jobs and add strategic depth to a complex Long Island economy that continues to evolve in a post-cold-war era. A tunnel would forge links between Long Island and New England. It would create a truly independent Long Island.
 There would, of course, be years of environmental studies, transportation reviews and probable litigation over such a proposal. But it is time for innovative planners, visionary elected officials and an awakening Long Island constituency to commit themselves to building an underground connection to the future.

HEADLINE: A New View Of Where Rates Will Go

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
OH where, oh where are interest rates going? No one knows, but the disagreement is growing.
 Federal Reserve officials have indicated that they will raise their benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- at a measured pace. Fed policy makers began the process in June, with a quarter-point increase, followed by another quarter-point increase in August, to 1.50 percent. They are expected to add another quarter-point when they meet on Tuesday. 
 From there, according to many analysts, Fed policy makers were expected to add a quarter-point at almost every meeting until the federal funds rate rose to somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 percent.
 Now come Merrill Lynch economists with an out-on-a-limb forecast that has highlighted a growing disagreement about what Fed policy makers will actually do. That disagreement could lead to some sharp swings in interest rates in coming months as new economic data and statements from Fed policy makers are interpreted one way or another.
 Last Thursday, Merrill Lynch economists revised their interest rate forecast, predicting that the Fed policy makers will stop pushing their short-term interest rate benchmark higher when it reaches 2 percent.
 That is just a half-point away from its current level -- and could be reached with a quarter-point increase at the meeting on Tuesday and another quarter-point increase at the next scheduled meeting, on Nov. 10. 
 After the November meeting, Merrill economists predict, the 2 percent target will hold until the end of 2005.
 They say economic growth will be slower than expected and that inflation, despite high oil prices, is not a threat, so the Fed will not have to push rates any higher than 2 percent for now.
 The release of the revised forecast helped push down the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note to 4.08 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since the beginning of April. While the 10-year yield popped up to 4.11 percent on Friday, it is still a long way from the 2004 high of 4.87 percent and way too low for those who disagree with Merrill. 

DATA THIS WEEK -- With the recent decline in Treasury rates, mortgage rates have been falling again. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 5.75 percent last week, down from 6.34 percent in May. But rates are not yet low enough to reignite a refinancing boom, and data due on Tuesday is expected to show that housing starts slowed in August.
 Orders for durable goods ought to help keep the outlook for growth cloudy. Over all, orders are expected to have declined by 0.3 percent in August, according to Bloomberg News. But the report, due on Friday, is also expected to show that orders, excluding those for transportation equipment, rose 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Why the Big Airlines Can't Get Off the Ground

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
A PALEONTOLOGIST might call it a mass extinction event. 
 US Airways has filed for bankruptcy once again, and it will need a miracle to keep flying more than a few months. Delta seems bound for Chapter 11 in the next few weeks as well. And no one can tell if United, in bankruptcy since 2002, will ever get back on its feet. 
 Clouds of imminent financial doom have surrounded one major airline or another for years, and experts have been looking for a culling of the herd at least since the deep slump in air travel after Sept. 11, 2001. 
 But now all six major airlines are suffering at once. US Airways, Delta and United are already stumbling like dinosaurs in a tar pit, and American, Continental and Northwest need only one big setback to push them in. And this is happening at a time when passengers are once again crowding planes and airports, and the industry should be enjoying a boom.
 Why are so many airlines struggling now? High fuel prices and the post-9/11 slump have taken a toll, to be sure. But many in the industry -- including some of the major-airline executives themselves -- say the traditional airlines are finally being brought low by a more fundamental problem of their own creation, one that has been building up for years. 
 Simply put, they have taught their customers to resent them, and to resist paying the fares they need to make a profit.
 ''People's expectations for airline service are pretty low,'' said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the Wharton School of Business. The situation is so dismal that ''things could deteriorate another 20 percent and I'm not sure you could calibrate the difference,'' he said.
 Year after year, under chronic financial pressure, the traditional airlines have made flying less comfortable and less convenient for most passengers. In addition to the cramped seats on crowded planes, with cutbacks or extra charges on nearly ever facet of service from the food to baggage allowances, travelers navigate complicated fare systems that still exact sky-high ''full'' prices from some passengers while dangling ever-changing discounts before others. These systems, intended to reap as much revenue as possible while still filling the plane, have left consumers feeling that there is no such thing as a fair price for air travel and have encouraged them to game the system.
 On top of that, the airlines have added one restriction after another to their tickets in recent years, making it expensive or impossible for passengers to change their travel plans after booking. The chief consolation offered for all these irritations -- frequent-flier miles -- have been drained of value as the airlines make redemption harder by limiting the available dates and seats.
 And in recent months, several of the major airlines have begun charging a $5 fee to buy tickets over the phone and $10 to buy them at an airport counter, where ''How can I help you?'' used to be free.
 Even the airlines' ''hub and spoke'' route systems became a nuisance for many passengers. Though they brought new air service to many smaller cities, they forced harried throngs of passengers to make connections in crowded hub airports to get where they wanted to go, rather than be able to fly nonstop. Meanwhile, the major airlines set a trap for themselves in the 1990's, when the long economic boom produced some fat years that many executives thought would go on indefinitely. 
 In an industry already famed for high pay and lavish benefits, companies locked in high, hard-to-cut costs with union contracts that were the envy of the labor movement. The airlines could afford those costs only as long as the public was willing to pay high fares for their reputation and service. 
 The rapid growth of discount airlines like Southwest and JetBlue, with their bare-bones service and lack of pretensions, shows what many passengers think of that proposition now. 
 These airlines, which have never held themselves out as anything more than a way to get from here to there, can charge much less than the old majors and still make money because they have avoided the big airlines' big mistakes. 
 The low-fare airlines' operations are simpler and leaner; their labor costs are much lower; they do not have the financial burden of pension obligations to thousands of retired workers, a major expense for the older carriers; and crucially, they have not annoyed their customers nearly as much. 
 On the low-fare carriers, passengers are not pampered, but they do not expect to be. People who might be disappointed with the quality of a United meal -- or resent being forced to pay extra for one on a Ted flight -- do not seem to mind when Southwest gives them just a drink and a bag of peanuts, because that is all Southwest has ever promised them. 
 While a segment of the market is still willing to pay premium prices for a substantially higher standard of service, it exists now mostly on long-haul and international routes. Flights of just a few hours have become a commodity bought strictly on price, and the market won't bear the fares that the big airlines need to cover their costs. So, in their current form, these companies are not viable any more. The question for the traditional carriers now is whether they can transform themselves into something like the low-fare carriers, or find niches where they can still thrive. 
 US Airways and Delta have each said in recent weeks that they would drop hubs and eliminate thousands of jobs in an effort to rein in costs. Each hopes to make its operations more like their low-fare rivals. But those hopes depend on the willingness of their workers to accept new cuts in pay and benefits, and investors to pump in more money. 
 Once the public would have had an emotional investment in the fates of storied names like Delta and United: witness the anguished reaction to Pan Am's closure in 1991. But not now. 
 There was some sympathy for the airlines in the dark days after Sept. 11, but despite the bailout that Congress approved after the attacks, the industry is still in turmoil, and the continuing drumbeat of bad news has had a numbing effect on customers. 
 ''It's been three years since 9/11, and I think they just have no energy to get awfully disturbed'' about the traditional airlines troubles, Professor Cappelli said.

HEADLINE: A Mural of Strength, But for Its Invisibility

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
The metallic-looking mural of four chiseled men working on an oil rig is as striking for its location as for the quality of the art: it is affixed to the back wall of a dank, cluttered storage room under a school library in Soundview, the Bronx. 
 ''For years, I've looked at that painting and wondered why nobody really wanted to restore it to the point of being viewable,'' said Tom Porton, coordinator of student activities for the James Monroe Campus, a collection of six high schools housed in a red-brick building on Boynton Avenue. Mr. Porton, who has taught at the school since 1970, believes that in 1934, the year the mural was painted, the room was a shop used for industrial arts classes, which would explain its presence. 
 According to Michele Cohen, director of the city's Public Art for Public Schools program, the artwork is one of 39 surviving murals in the city's public schools that were created under the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program to put the unemployed, including artists, to work. Most W.P.A. murals, however, are in far more visible places, like auditoriums. 
 The painter of the Soundview mural, Domenico Mortellito, was born in Newark and produced art for the Newark subway system, the post office in Port Chester, N.Y., and the National Zoo in Washington, among other places, said his daughter, Adria Mortellito Peterson.
 ''It's part of the whole machine age, coming out of the Depression,'' said Ms. Peterson, an artist who lives in Oakland, Calif., in explaining the subject of the mural. ''A lot of his imagery just celebrates human beings and what they were capable of.''
 Mr. Mortellito attended Pratt Institute in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in the 1920's, often sketching train riders on his commuting from Newark. He later created works for the 1939 World's Fair, served as a graphic artist during World War II and eventually became head of the design team at DuPont, where he was probably the first person (and maybe the last) to create art out of Teflon. He died in 1994 at age 87. 
 The mural is to be restored by the Public Art for Public Schools program. Once the restoration is complete, Mr. Porton said, the school plans to move the mural to its main entrance. He has seen the loss of many of the school's treasures, from a bronze memorial to World War II veterans that was thrown away years ago to some student murals that were accidentally painted over last month.
 ''It's my job to keep tradition alive,'' Mr. Porton said. ''So I'm protective of the few things we've got left.'' SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: NEW YORK HOPES TO WIN OLYMPICS BY DIVIDING VOTES

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
After talking privately with nearly every person who will vote on the site of the 2012 Olympics, the people behind New York City's bid for the Summer Games now think they have a realistic chance to win by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy against the four European capitals that are their competitors.
 They have also brandished American economic power by promising marketing and media assistance for governing bodies in lesser-known sports that have key votes on the International Olympic Committee.
 Many American boosters and some independent experts now say New York may be trailing only Paris, which is presumed by many people to be the front-runner, in part because it is the only finalist with an Olympic stadium in place. 
 But it is a long, twisting road. United States foreign policy is widely viewed as hurting the city's bid, and 9/11 sentiment has worn thin, according to people who have talked with voters. In May, New York placed fourth among the five cities in a preliminary evaluation by the Olympic committee's staff. Since then, the city has changed plans for housing, transportation and sites. 
 The Olympics sweepstakes will end with secret balloting by the I.O.C. in July. In addition to New York and Paris, the other finalists are London, Madrid and Moscow. Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor and the founder of NYC2012, the committee organizing the Olympic bid, said he had talked individually with 119 of the 121 Olympic committee members by the end of the Athens Games last month. Mr. Doctoroff will be in Athens again tomorrow and Tuesday during the Paralympics, involving about 4,000 disabled athletes from 136 countries, to do more lobbying. 
 If no city obtains an absolute majority of votes cast in the first round of voting by the I.O.C., the city with the fewest votes is eliminated and successive rounds are held until a city has a majority. If only two cities remain, the one with the greatest number of votes is elected. New York's advocates are counting on picking up support when the vote goes beyond the first round, as has consistently occurred. Many American officials, including Peter V. Ueberroth, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, say they think New York can win in later rounds by picking up support from European cities as they are eliminated. 
 The I.O.C. is dominated by European members. Because of a desire to share the Games among the continents, a Paris victory for 2012 would make it unlikely that other European cities could play host to the Summer Olympics until at least 2020.
 ''It's a factor not just in those four cities, but it's a factor in other places,'' Mr. Ueberroth said in a telephone interview Thursday. ''I know, for instance, Milan is interested in bidding in 2016, so their chances if Paris or Madrid were chosen makes it a little more of a reach.''
 Budapest, Prague, Lisbon and Berlin have also shown interest in the 2016 Olympics, along with the current contenders for 2012.
 Mr. Ueberroth, Mr. Doctoroff and other New York boosters have found many committee members are focused on promoting their sports. To meet that demand, the NYC2012 team is developing detailed plans to help sports like track and field, swimming, badminton and table tennis raise their profiles in America. The plans include staging events before and after the 2012 Summer Games. New York has presented a seven-year marketing plan to track and field's governing body.
 Dale E. Neuberger of Indiana, a vice president for FINA, the world governing body for aquatic sports, said, ''I'm not familiar with its plans in every one of the Olympic sports, but in swimming -- which represents four disciplines, swimming, diving, water polo and synchronized swimming -- New York leadership has demonstrated vision and enlightenment related to how facilities built for the Games would be useful for many years to come.'' 
 There is big money behind the New York bid, including Mr. Doctoroff, who donated about $2.5 million to NYC2012, and multinational corporations based in the United States.
 Of course, not everyone thinks New York's strategy will win the votes of a majority of the Olympic committee. Brian J. Hatch, founder of NewYorkGames.org, a Web site opposed to the Olympic bid, criticized the NYC2012 plan as driven more by a desire for real estate development than for Olympic ideals or athletic legacies.
 Mr. Hatch said there were serious flaws in the New York boosters' assumption that New York could come from behind to win the I.O.C. vote. No Olympic winner has finished lower than second on an initial ballot, he said. In 32 contested races, the front-runner has won 26 times and the city that was second in the first round has won six times, Mr. Hatch said.
 ''You've got to be the front-runner,'' he said.
 A New York City Olympics would please NBC and many leading corporate sponsors of the Olympics, said Kevin B. Wamsley, a professor of history and the director of the International Center for Olympic Studies at the University of Western Ontario. 
 NBC signed contracts to pay $5.7 billion for television rights for the Games from 2000 through 2012. Other sponsors, including Coca-Cola, John Hancock, Kodak, McDonald's, Sports Illustrated, Visa and Xerox, pay about $60 million over four years for branding rights. ''If the Olympics came to New York, there would be unprecedented opportunity for making money, beyond the imagination,'' Mr. Wamsley said. ''That would be the windfall NBC is looking for, and the corporate sponsors.''
 But money does not play as large a role as it might have in the past, Mr. Wamsley said, because the I.O.C. is now financially stable. 
 Mr. Ueberroth, widely credited with helping to save the Olympics by running the 1984 Games in Los Angeles after the 1980 boycott in Moscow, said Olympic revenue takes a huge leap any time the Games are held in the United States. The New York bid documents estimate that the Games would yield $800 million more in New York, because of higher ticket sales and sponsorships, than in Paris, London, Madrid or Moscow. 
 Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Universal Sports, declined to comment. Kevin Sullivan, a spokesman for NBC Sports, said in an e-mail message, ''We have no say and play no role in the selection of Olympic host cities.''
 James L. Easton, an American member of the I.O.C.'s executive board and the president of the archery federation, also talked with committee members in Athens. He and Mr. Doctoroff said a lot could change in how the United States is perceived between now and July.
 ''It's not looking bad,'' Mr. Easton said. ''Yes, Paris is the front-runner, because they've bid a couple times and haven't been successful, and they also came out ahead on the initial technical analysis of the first bid documents that were submitted.
 ''And Paris is a wonderful city. But the last Summer Games for which they were a contender, they also were first in the technical analysis, but didn't win the vote.''
 In fact, Paris captured only 18 of the 105 committee votes for the 2008 Olympics, finishing third behind Beijing and Toronto. Paris also lost the 1992 bid to Barcelona, Spain. But Paris built an 80,000-seat stadium to play host to the 1998 World Cup soccer final and to attract an Olympics, which it last staged in 1924. 
 ''It cannot go wrong every time,'' Valerie Amant, a spokeswoman for the bid committee Paris2012 Global, said Friday. But she added: ''I can't remember seeing such competition among five of the greatest cities in the world. It's quite amazing.''
 During the Olympics last month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spent two and a half days in Athens and talked to about 35 I.O.C. members. Mr. Doctoroff said the conversations he and the mayor had with I.O.C. members ranged from five minutes to many hours. ''The vast majority have been substantive conversations,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 Part of the substance involved learning about the members' connections to New York.
 ''I can think of many who have either gone to school here or have a child who went to school here,'' Mr. Doctoroff said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ''There have been many who came to New York on exchange programs when they were young. And then many who have business interests here or other personal connections.''
 Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Bloomberg have repeatedly said that construction of a stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan, which would be known as the New York Sports and Convention Center, must be under way by the time of the vote next summer. In fact, Mr. Bloomberg said last Sunday that New York would have to ''drop out of the competition for the Olympics'' unless the stadium project began soon.
 In an e-mail message Friday, Mr. Bloomberg expressed confidence that the stadium would be built. ''I am totally committed to our Olympic bid, and my visit to Athens confirmed that it is strong and well positioned to win,'' he said.
 If the city can begin construction on an Olympic stadium, Mr. Doctoroff and other proponents said they thought New York's bid could overcome international opposition to American foreign policy, memories of the bomb that went off at the Atlanta Games in 1996 and bribery charges in Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
 Thomas K. Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee, who was acquitted by a judge last year of charges that he illegally influenced I.O.C. members for their votes, said he thought the Salt Lake City scandal would not hurt New York's chances.
 Mr. Welch said that if New York could get about 25 votes in the first round of voting, it might win the 2012 Games by becoming voters' second or third choice in later rounds. He said New York would need the votes of committee members from South and Central America along with some support from members in Asia and the Pacific. Members of the committee from the countries competing for the bid -- including three from the United States -- will not be allowed to vote.
 ''For us to win, you've got to pick up votes in Europe, and Europe's a tough place for us to pick up votes,'' Mr. Welch said in a telephone interview. ''Now you've got to hope they get competitive enough that they get angry. You know, Paris is the front-runner. And the French are capable of making mistakes.''
 Many experts said it was too soon to count votes. The cities' final proposals are due Nov. 15, followed by site inspections by an I.O.C. subcommittee in February and March. The decisive Olympic committee vote will take place in Singapore on July 6, 2005.
 John A. Furlong, chief executive of the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Winter Games, saw parallels between his bid and New York's. Vancouver placed last in a technical report. Many people thought Salzburg, Austria, would win the voting. But Salzburg was eliminated in the first round, and Vancouver eventually beat Pyeongchang, South Korea, 56 to 53. ''You can't for a second take a single vote for granted,'' Mr. Furlong said. 
 Mr. Furlong said his conversations with committee members indicated that most of them were just starting to learn about the bids for 2012. ''It's all in front of them,'' he said. ''It's a long way to go to the end.''
 It is now 290 days until the International Olympic Committee votes.

 BODY:

THE FALLS
By Joyce Carol Oates.
481 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95.
 JOYCE CAROL OATES'S gravely ambitious new novel is set at Niagara Falls, and you practically need a rain slicker to read it. As usual, Oates pours out her story in great cascading sheets of prose in which words, sentences, paragraphs, even chapters often seem as insignificant individually as drops of water in the massive falls, their only function to contribute, by sheer volume, to the persistent fine spray of actions, perceptions and metaphors that is this writer's idea of a novel, and to the constant dull roar of Meaning that ''The Falls,'' like all her fiction, aims to generate.
 Her method, that is to say, has always been to overwhelm, to awe, to wear her readers down with the relentless pounding of her sensibility. But enough. Niagara Falls is such an apt metaphor for Joyce Carol Oates's force-of-nature aesthetic that the temptation to elaborate it further is nearly irresistible. In that direction, however, lies madness -- which, according to one of the book's epigraphs, attributed to a Dr. Moses Blaine, happens to be a possible consequence of allowing oneself to linger too long in the mysterious presence of the falls. Writing a hundred years or so ago, Dr. Blaine identified ''an uncanny effect called the hydracropsychic,'' a ''morbid condition'' that has been known to ''render even the will of the active, robust man in the prime of life temporarily invalid, as if under the spell of a malevolent hypnotist,'' with the result, in the direst cases, that ''the unfortunate victim throws himself to his doom if he is not prevented.''
 Oates takes Dr. Blaine's semiscientific observation as the jumping-off point (so to speak) of her narrative. Before the book is five pages old, a young man, apparently one of the hydracropsychically challenged, has hurled himself into the raging waters on, we presently learn, the morning after a pretty upsetting wedding night. The suicide, it turns out, is an earnest minister named Gilbert Erskine, from Troy, N.Y., who has just discovered that the sexual appetite of his new bride, Ariah, is quite a bit stronger than he had anticipated: a depressing revelation for him, because he is in fact (though not in practice) gay. So the enormous, ungovernable natural forces of Niagara Falls and a woman's desire somehow merge in Gilbert's delicate psyche, become a single voice -- a siren's, beckoning him to foamy oblivion.
 The first 100 pages of ''The Falls'' swirl around this melancholy event and its immediate aftermath, in which Ariah, quickly dubbed ''The Widow-Bride of The Falls,'' wanders like a specter by the edge of the water, waiting and watching and occasionally gracing helpful strangers with utterances like ''I believe I am -- damned.'' When you come across that line, and consider that in Ariah's mind her sexual aggressiveness was the cause of her husband's demise, it's hard to avoid the suspicion that on some level ''The Falls'' is really meant to be about the Fall -- the one in the Book of Genesis, which was, after all, just God's way of telling us that the honeymoon was over.
 Oates, as is her custom, toys with this notion for a while, then tires of it and drifts off into other areas, while remaining, always, within sight of her central metaphor, the falls. Ariah leaves the scene of her husband's suicide (and her damnation) briefly, but she hasn't been cast out of the newlywed's paradise forever. She soon returns to Niagara Falls to marry, and have children with, a lawyer named Dirk Burnaby, scion of a wealthy local family and possessor -- as too many characters in this novel are -- of a very silly soap-opera name. And although a sense of doom continues to hover over the heroine and her family, her fresh start does perk the novel up. In the middle third of ''The Falls,'' Oates largely shifts the focus from tense, gloomy Ariah to bold and beautiful Dirk, who, without realizing what deep waters he's getting into, becomes involved in a quixotic legal battle on behalf of the toxic-waste-sickened working- class residents of the area we now know as Love Canal. (In the early 60's, when this portion of the novel takes place, the name was years away from the notoriety it ultimately achieved.) Dirk's crusade against the chemical companies and the bought-off officials of local government acquires a kind of heedless, headlong momentum, and so, for a stretch, does the narrative. Oates may not have anything startlingly original to say about class, economic injustice and the destruction of the environment, but she speaks about them clearly and strongly. And besides, the Love Canal case allows the novel to work up some genuine suspense -- suspense more tangible and specific than the vaguely metaphysical free-floating anxiety that Oates relies on everywhere else in ''The Falls.''
 In the final section, set in the late 70's, the novel takes up the stories of the young and restless Burnaby children -- Chandler, Royall and Juliet -- and all Oates has to keep the reader, and herself, moving forward is that generalized sense of dread: who's going over the railing next? One of the consequences, probably unintended, of her slapdash narrative approach and her hectic, rushed prose is that she's unable to disguise the wild fluctuations of her interest in the stories she tells. When Oates is fully engaged, you feel her excitement; and when she's bored, as she obviously is with the fate of the younger Burnabys, you feel that too. There's nothing coy about the fiction of Joyce Carol Oates: she just keeps coming at you with that breathless voice, book after book after book, daring the reader to find her ridiculous, embarrassing, annoyingly insistent.
 And frequently I do. The funny thing, though, is that whenever I wearily arrive at the last sentence of an Oates novel, I also find myself sort of admiring her helpless emotional transparency, her stamina and her willingness to charge right at the big social problems of American life. At her best, as in the middle section of ''The Falls,'' she's like a contemporary Dreiser, both in her slovenliness and in her power. After 40 years and millions of words, Joyce Carol Oates remains implacable, unstoppable, and if she isn't truly a force of nature that's only because, as in any long relationship between a writer and her audience, there's not much mystery left. But hardened Oates veterans know that the surest way to survive, and even to get some pleasure from, her fictional world is to treat it as an interesting place to visit, where you wouldn't want to live. So read ''The Falls'' swiftly and don't look too closely, or too long. Then move on. Oates will.

HEADLINE: Too Few Cooks Can Spoil the Broth, Too

BYLINE: By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
WE'VE lost our cook! No soup kitchen until further notice.'' 
 The sign, printed in bold black letters on double-sided computer paper, was posted outside of St. Luke's Lutheran Church, a tall, neo-Gothic building that could easily be lost amid its more celebrated neighbors along Restaurant Row, the stretch of West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
 Did the cook run away with the spoon? 
 ''He is basically lost,'' Nhorie Leonardo, the church's administrator, said Monday as she explained what happened. According to Ms. Leonardo, the missing cook was a man in his mid-50's named John -- church officials declined to give his last name, saying they wanted to protect his privacy -- who had worked at the church for two years. Except for the pastor, the Rev. Paul D. Schmiege, and his family, John was the only person who lived in the building, in a small, monklike apartment off the bell tower.
 As others remember him, John was quiet but efficient, able to plan hearty meals on his own and get them on the table without much drama. While a dozen workers and volunteers helped to set up and serve the food on the two days the soup kitchen was open, he was responsible for all the cooking, generally because he was the only one in the kitchen who was certified by the city to prepare the food. 
 A typical meal centers around a warm dish and includes a meat-based soup or stew. Nutrition and time constraints trump flavoring. But donations from neighborhood restaurants spiced up the menu. On most days, offerings included salads and pasta from Joshua Tree. The Good and Plenty to Go restaurant donated breads and baked goods, and Starbucks sent leftover pastries.
 John, who used to eat at the soup kitchen before he was hired, also doubled as the church's superintendent, doing odd jobs around the building. Unexpectedly, he gave notice to the pastor shortly before Labor Day and promptly moved out, leaving no forwarding address and giving St. Luke's no time to line up a replacement. 
 The job of soup kitchen cook is not easy to fill, explained Ms. Leonardo, who has contacted other kitchens around the city to help find a new cook, so far with no success. 
 One person who isn't a candidate is Alfonzo Pinkney, 51, who worked as a server at St. Luke's and trained as a chef. ''I wouldn't take this job,'' he said. ''I like to take the time to see people enjoy food, see a smile on their face.'' Mr. Pinkney, who has been homeless, likes to recall a soup kitchen, now closed, on the Upper East Side in the 80's that provided tablecloths and waiter service for a three-course meal. 
 Feeding 200 people within three marathon hours requires almost aerobic energy. The cook must be able to prepare a meal solo and have energy left over to greet and serve patrons. The job also requires cleaning up afterward, handling kettles big enough to bathe in. And for this particular job, which will pay $12 to $14 an hour for eight hours of kitchen work per week, the successful applicant must also be comfortable working in the sweaty, near-medieval conditions of St. Luke's kitchen. 
 Although New York has roughly 300 soup kitchens, the one at St. Luke's, which has been serving meals since 1977 and costs $30,000 a year to operate, is distinctive in several respects. For one thing, it is known for letting patrons return for second helpings, something not all soup kitchens allow.
 For another, it operates in an unlikely space, the church's theater. Three nights a week, the theater is home to the long-running participatory musical ''Tony N' Tina's Wedding,'' at which time the stage is adorned with a trellis draped with artificial white roses under which the couple's vows are recited. 
 ON Tuesdays and Thursdays, the stage is broken down and the space is transformed into a dining area. (Other parts of the building accommodate a Montessori preschool, the offices of the Times Square Coalition, a men's shelter, and a refugee and immigration service.)
 The kitchen, which is behind the stage, is a narrow space with a black-and-white checkerboard floor, tiled walls and a 10-burner stove. The church is using the temporary vacancy to clean the kitchen thoroughly. The other day, three homeless men, all soup kitchen patrons who sometimes do odd jobs at the church, could be found scrubbing down the work spaces and organizing boxes of cutlery, disposable chefs' hats and other equipment with almost encyclopedic method.
 Attendance comes in a monthly tide. At the beginning of the month, the kitchen feeds 80 to 100 people a day, but as the month goes on and welfare checks are increasingly depleted, the number grows to 200. Most of the people who are fed by the soup kitchen are single unemployed men.
 While patrons of St. Luke's soup kitchen do not have to be homeless, one of the largest sponsors, United Way, stipulates that there be a sign-in policy, one result of which is that visitors often leave fake names, which the church tolerates in its mission to serve the hungry. ''One week we fed Peter Pan, on Tuesday and Thursday,'' said Pastor Schmiege. 
 One person who showed up at the church on Tuesday afternoon in search of a meal was Mike Koscinski, a frail, birdlike man with a white stubble beard who lives in the cellar of a nearby hotel. Mr. Koscinski, who is 76, paced back and forth in front of the ''Lost our cook'' sign several times before buzzing the church's offices. He was hungry, he explained, and wanted to know when the place would open. 
 The only other soup kitchen he thought would be open that day was uptown in the 80's. ''Very far,'' said Mr. Koscinski, explaining that he has a hernia. Grasping his stomach, he walked away.

HEADLINE: Selling Small Specialties, Chain Expands in a Big Way

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
ON June 27, 2003, there was not even one Laila Rowe store. The next day, there was one. Now there are eight. By the end of the year, there are expected to be 10.
 Laila Rowe sells necklaces, earrings, bracelets, brooches, handbags, scarves, hats and gloves. It's sort of one-stop shopping for women's accessories -- fashionable products at affordable prices. 
 ''It's a place where a woman can come in and get a great necklace for $18 that somewhere else would cost $70,'' said Judith Schwartz, Laila Rowe's co-founder and co-owner. The idea, Ms. Schwartz said, is to provide ''the same quality, but not at the same price, as a mass retailer like Banana Republic or Ann Taylor.'' 
 The story of Laila Rowe's rapid growth, of how it went from a seed to a garden in little more than a year, quickly positioning itself in high-profile retail positions around the city, is a very Manhattan tale -- one that is connected to the downturn in retail real estate and the New York economy after Sept. 11, and to the uptick both have seen in the last year.
 It begins in the minds of two women: Ms. Schwartz, a native of the Bronx, and her partner, Alexia Crawford, who came to New York from Sydney, Australia, about a dozen years ago. 
 The women, who design most of Laila Rowe's merchandise, have been friends for those 12 years. Ms. Schwartz has been designing crafts and fine jewelry all that time, and even had three Manhattan stores of her own, called Nemesis Jewelry -- though, largely as a result of economic woes after Sept. 11, she said, there is now only one, in the East Village. Ms. Crawford runs a wholesale company that supplies women's accessories to department stores, specialty chains and private brands, and also has a small retail store in New Haven. 
 ''Our growth looks sudden,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''But this is what my wholesale company does. This is what Judith does. We travel all over Europe and Asia; we spend a lot of time researching trends, designing and doing everything. The wholesale business produces for other stores. We simply became customers for ourselves. So it looks more rapid than it actually was. We had toyed with the idea, and we looked on Columbus Avenue for eight years, until we came up with the perfect location.''
 That store, at Columbus and 72nd, opened June 28, 2003. The other stores are at Third Avenue and 61st Street, 14th Street and Fifth Avenue, Avenue of the Americas and 17th Street, West Broadway between Prince and Spring Streets in SoHo, Broadway and 78th Street, Prince between Sullivan and Macdougal Streets, and Eighth Street near University Place. Their first non-Manhattan store, at Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., is scheduled to open Nov. 1, and a store at Lexington and 70th is tentatively set for a November opening.
 The Manhattan locations have been chosen carefully, Ms. Crawford said. ''New Yorkers have to have things right in their path,'' she said. ''You have to pick a well-traveled location. The West Broadway site has all those tourists visiting SoHo. Third and 61st is near Bloomingdale's. Broadway and 78th is near the new Barneys Co-Op at 75th, and in the corridor between Citarella and Zabar's. The Sixth Avenue store is near Old Navy. The 14th Street store is near the new Whole Foods Market,'' which is to open next year near Union Square.
 The name Laila Rowe was also chosen with care. ''We wanted a name that would appeal to everybody,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''Laila is eclectic and multiethnic. Rowe is traditional. And it's a pretty name.'' 
 The business is self-financed, Ms. Schwartz said. ''We scrounged the money together, did a little bit of begging and borrowing, and pooled our resources for the first store.'' The newer stores were financed from the profits of their predecessors, she said. ''We rolled it all back in,'' she said. ''And it seems to be working.''
 They look for stores that are about 1,000 square feet, though some are smaller and a couple are 1,400 and 1,800 square feet. They seek an annual rent of about $175 a square foot, though the Third Avenue store near Bloomingdale's is a little more expensive, about $200 a square foot. They spend $80,000 to $150,000 renovating a store, Ms. Schwartz said, ''depending on square footage and the work that needs to be done -- we try to use as much of what's existing as possible.'' 
 At several stores, they took leases with options to cancel after last Christmas, in case sales weren't strong -- but they didn't have to exercise the options.
 The two women acknowledge that the ease of their rapid growth is in part a result of the drop in the retail market after Sept. 11. ''We were lucky in that a lot of locations were available to us last year that might not have been around before Sept. 11,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''Landlords were more willing to take a chance on a start-up like us than they would have been before.''
 Faith Hope Consolo, the vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Store Leasing, which represented both Laila Rowe and the landlord in the lease at Third Avenue and 61st Street, said that Laila Rowe ''was able to position itself when some of the bigger national retailers were sitting on the sidelines -- last year was a year of uncertainty.''
 ''They were at the right place at the right time,'' Ms. Consolo said. ''If the market continues to get better, I'm not sure they'll be able to expand at the same rate.''
 She said Laila Rowe had beaten several national tenants -- midprice shoe and fashion retailers, electronics stores, fast-food outlets -- for the Third Avenue space. ''They're popular-priced, very well priced,'' she said. ''The owners have a very good fashion sense. That kind of store does well in both good times and bad times. And besides women buying for themselves, it's a great gift store. There are a lot of very well-heeled customers in the neighborhood, and Laila Rowe fits in.''
 Robin Abrams, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a retail brokerage, said that Laila Rowe ''is doing something a little bit different.''
 ''It's a casual, consumer-friendly store selling a good mix of product,'' said Ms. Abrams, who represents a landlord considering a proposal from Laila Rowe. ''Customers may go in not necessarily needing anything, but a lot of things are displayed. It's not intimidating, not very formal, and it's priced moderately enough so if you like something you buy it spontaneously.''
 But are they expanding too quickly? ''I don't know how many more stores they can open without saturating the Manhattan market,'' Ms. Abrams said. ''But most retailers come into Manhattan knowing they can easily do a half dozen or a dozen stores -- on the Upper West and East Sides, Flatiron, SoHo, 14th Street -- without having them encroach on one another.''
 Ms. Schwartz said Laila Rowe had other Manhattan locations in mind, including Midtown and the Columbia University area. But it is also looking beyond the borough. Its first Queens store, at Queens Plaza in Elmhurst, is to open in January, she said.
 ''And we are thinking regional,'' she said. ''We are looking at malls in the tristate area, in Connecticut, New Jersey, Westchester, Long Island. We're contemplating the eastern corridor -- Washington, Baltimore, Annapolis, Virginia. But that's for 2006.''

HEADLINE: Storm Chasing (the Wall Street Version)

BYLINE: By JEREMY KAHN; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
LONG before Hurricane Ivan began bearing down on the Gulf Coast last week, a special breed of money managers was carefully tracking its development. The managers monitored its intensity, searching for any sign that it might veer toward Florida's major coastal cities. They consulted forecasts from the National Hurricane Center in Miami and the Met Office in Britain. They scanned water temperature readings from ocean buoys and ran sophisticated computer models to try to predict the storm's likely course and to estimate the damage. Then they went hunting for cats.
 No, not the furry variety. The interest-bearing kind. Cat bonds, short for catastrophe bonds, are little-known securities through which investors bet on hurricanes, earthquakes and even terrorist attacks. Insurance companies issue them to help pay excess claims from such events. Most of the bonds are intended to protect insurers from disasters that happen once or maybe twice in a century, the sort they might otherwise have trouble covering. 
 Cat bonds pay unusually high interest rates -- between 5 and 15 percent annually, depending on the bond -- which is part of what makes them attractive to hedge funds and other institutional investors. But they are also somewhat riskier than other bonds: if the insured losses from a catastrophe exceed a certain threshold, the bondholders could lose their investments. 
 When cat bonds were developed after Hurricane Andrew devastated the insurance industry in 1992, some people predicted that they would revolutionize the way insurance companies handled risk, ultimately eliminating the need for reinsurance. That has not happened. Most insurance companies still lay off risk by buying traditional reinsurance, which is cheaper and can be arranged on shorter notice than a bond issue. But cat bonds continue to be issued. 
 When it comes to hurricanes, the trading of these bonds, and the computer models that investors watch, can provide insights into the kind of damage a storm might cause. That information is crucial for the insurance industry and its investors -- and, ultimately, it could help people in a hurricane's path, as well as emergency agencies, to be better prepared. 
 Last year, $1.73 billion in new cat bonds were issued in eight transactions, according to Guy Carpenter & Company, a tracking firm, and its affiliate, MMC Securities. At the end of 2003, about $4 billion in cat bond debt was outstanding worldwide, about $1.3 billion of it relating to North Atlantic hurricane risk. 
 The bonds are held by 100 to 200 investors, all large institutions or hedge funds with a high tolerance for risk. ''There are no widows and orphans investing in these bonds,'' said Christopher McGhee, head of investment banking for MMC Securities, which helps companies issue cat bonds. The bonds trade over the counter and through private transactions.
 For those who follow cat bonds, these have been hectic weeks. For the first time since 1964, Florida has been hit by three hurricanes in a year -- and the season is not yet over. ''It's been a rough month; let's put it that way,'' said James Doona, a director in the insurance capital markets area at Standard & Poor's. 
 Mr. Doona and his colleagues decide whether to downgrade cat bonds -- most of which are issued with BB, or marginal, ratings -- if it appears that a storm may trip their triggers and wipe out bondholders.
 Despite some nervous moments, S.&P. has not issued any downgrades. The triggers are not easy to trip; according to insurance trackers, most of the bonds have an expected loss of less than 0.8 percent a year. It would take something like a Category 5 hurricane scoring a direct hit against Miami or Tampa, an event that might cause more than $15 billion in insured losses, to force bondholders to surrender their principal.
 Hurricane Charley, which skirted Orlando, looked as if it might cause this sort of damage, but initial insurance claims now put insured losses from that storm at $6.8 billion. Estimates of the damage caused by Hurricane Frances range from $3 billion to $10 billion, according to various catastrophe-modeling firms that work with the industry.
 Most of the bonds have four-year maturities and have triggers tied to one event. A few are issued for one year, and some of these have triggers that cover multiple events -- meaning that they could be set off by several smaller hurricanes, rather than one big storm. 
 Still, even these, while not exactly Treasury notes, have been relatively safe bets for investors. For instance, the insurer USAA bought reinsurance from an offshore entity called Residential Re that issued $160 million in three-year hurricane and earthquake notes last year. The notes have a trigger that is tripped if the carrier sustains more than $653 million in claims -- beyond its other existing reinsurance -- from any number of events. So far, USAA estimates that it has sustained at most $260 million in insured losses from Hurricanes Frances and Charley -- meaning that it could endure much more damage from Ivan and other storms before bondholders have to worry.
 ''To my knowledge, there has never been a payment on a cat bond to date,'' said Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''It's not as if a lot of people have lost money on these things.''
 Investors are aware of that, which is why hurricane bonds trade mostly at par, or face value, if they trade at all. (Investors like to hold on to them to earn those outsize interest payments.) But when major storms approach the East Coast, nervous investors may start unloading cat bonds for less, and hedge funds often begin trolling for bargains. 
 Hedge fund managers reported bonds trading lower as Hurricanes Charley and Frances neared landfall. (Prices were down about 10 percent for Charley and 20 percent for Frances.) As Ivan approached, some hedge fund managers were eager for more trades. ''We would have thought the activity would have been greater early in the week as Ivan approached,'' said Greg Hagood, co-founder of Nephila Capital, a hedge fund in Bermuda that specializes in cat bonds.
 By the time Ivan made landfall, however, little trading was taking place. ''The general sense is that if there were nervous sellers, they sold in Frances and Charley already,'' said Mr. McGhee of MMC Securities.
 Another factor was that only a few hurricane bonds are linked to property outside of Florida. When Ivan turned west, toward Alabama, bondholders breathed easier. Though Ivan would cause much damage in the Florida Panhandle, the property values there are lower than in southern Florida. 
 But how do investors know if buying hurricane bonds is really a good risk? The answer lies in the catastrophe-modeling software developed for insurers and now used by cat bond investors. These models use meteorology, engineering and underwriting data to create real-time color maps of estimated damage. Most include information from every recorded tropical storm back to the late 1890's, detailed information on building construction and the effects of various wind speeds on different kinds of structures. They also include information on how property is insured -- applying, for instance, deductibles and policy limits. 
 ''We can go right down to the level of a city block on the coast in modeling the risk,'' said Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at RMS, a catastrophe-modeling company in Newark, Calif. Emergency agencies have begun to use the same modeling simulations to plan for possible hurricane damage. And the catastrophe-modeling firms often release alerts on damage estimates.
 DESPITE their sophistication, the models are not perfect -- particularly in forecasting how storms will behave as they come onshore. ''No one would have forecast Charley would be at Category 4 at landfall when it was only Category 2 a few hours before,'' Mr. Muir-Wood said. 
 The catastrophe-modeling companies now send teams of wind engineers to survey the damage immediately after hurricanes pass, and use the information they gather to improve their software. 
 ''There is no question that this marketplace could not exist if we did not have sophisticated natural-disaster models,'' Mr. McGhee of MMC Securities said. ''And the models are just getting better all the time.''
 Of course, the hedge fund managers who use these models had better hope that they don't become too good. If everyone knows exactly what a hurricane is going to do, there will be no reason to trade.

HEADLINE: Bringing Down the House In Fairfield County

BYLINE: By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
IT'S a milestone, yes, but not one that Fairfield County residents, preservationists, even some home builders are particularly proud of. 
 Homeowners and developers are ripping down homes at a faster rate than anyone can remember. With more than three months to go in 2004, many of the communities in Fairfield County are about to surpass the number of tear-downs for all of 2003 and some, including Fairfield, Stamford and Westport, already have.
 Indeed, the tear-down blitz has caused such alarm all over the state that more municipalities are beginning to pass laws to slow it, adding to the dozens of towns that already have such laws. Hamden, for example, recently passed a law to delay demolitions, while New Canaan, Ridgefield, and Guilford are debating similar restrictions. 
 ''This is extremely unusual, never happened before that I know of,'' said Marian Castell, Darien's town historian, about the level of tear-downs. ''There is no doubt we are at historic levels.''
 Tear-downs occur all over the state, but in many of the towns around Hartford, in Litchfield County, and from New Haven to New London, they are more of a trickle. Essex, for example, has had one this year; Litchfield none. But Fairfield County is a virtual deconstruction site, fueled by, developers and real estate experts said, increased demand for housing and, especially, larger housing.
 In Darien, 26 demolition permits for single-family homes were issued by late last week, just one shy of the 27 for all of last year. Ridgefield issued 27 permits in its fiscal year ending in June, compared with 24 last fiscal year. In Norwalk, the pace is a bit slower, with 24 permits issued as of late last week, compared with 34 last year. New Canaan issued 37 permits through June, the latest numbers available, compared with 57 last year.
 By the middle of this month, Stamford had already surpassed its 2003 tear-downs, with 28 permits, compared with 24 last year. So has Fairfield, with 41 permits, passing the 38 from last year, and Westport, with 74, up from 71.
 All of those communities were quiet by the standards of Greenwich, which issued 138 demolition permits in its fiscal year ending in June, compared with 82 the previous year.
 While the racket of tear-downs may be annoying to neighbors or a tacky McMansion replacing an old Greek Revival may wrinkle some noses, preservationists are concerned that some significant old homes are being destroyed. A group of Victorian homes in a neighborhood that was once an Irish and African-American working-class enclave in Greenwich is scheduled to be torn down, angering preservationists. Some Madison residents are trying to save a home built in the late 1600's from demolition, and in Ellington, a home built in 1776 was headed for the Dumpster until the developer had second thoughts after pleas from residents.
 ''This is a widespread problem, because the pace of it is faster than the ability to get hold of it,'' said Helen Higgins, the executive director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, which urges people to think twice before tearing down houses. ''The character of the community is clearly at risk when you rip apart its fabric.''
 Of course, old doesn't always mean historic. Some people involved in tear-downs said the new homes they planned to build would be much better than what was there.
 ''There isn't anything that remarkable about these homes,'' said Judy Larson, the architect on the Greenwich project, who described herself as a preservationist. ''But sometimes you have to make a call, and in the end, I want to make beautiful buildings.''
 In all cases, housing officials said a shortage of empty lots is driving the trend. And developers are ripping down one house and putting two or more in its place. That's happening in Westport, for example, where what land is left is either on a rocky ledge or in a wetland, said Don Miro, a builder who is also chairman of the town's Historic District Commission.
 ''There just isn't the land available, and there still seems to be huge demand,'' Mr. Miro said. Low interest rates are also having an effect by helping create increased demand for housing.
 ''When interest rates are low like they are now, the best return on people's money is in real estate,'' Mr. Miro said. ''The bottom line is, low rates are also good for spec builders.''
 In many cases, it has become cheaper to buy an old house, rip it down, and put up a new one, than it would be to, say, shore up crumbling foundations and strengthen supporting frames in a drooping two-centuries-old farmhouse.
 Still, the cost of this approach can seem staggeringly high. In Westport, according to housing experts, a lot with a home eyed for tear-down can start at about $700,000. In Greenwich, it's even higher, around $800,000. Builders said it can typically cost $15,000 for demolition and, in Fairfield County, about $250 a square foot, or $600,000 for a 2,400 square-foot home, to build a nicer house.
 Yet another, less tangible, factor is taste.
 People tend to want to live in historic neighborhoods, but not in old buildings, said Ms. Higgins of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation.
 ''Families today feel like they have to have a million different rooms, even though they really just spend time in one main room,'' she said.
 Tastes might be tough to change overnight, but one tool that is proving helpful against the tear-down epidemic are demolition delay laws, usually coordinated through a town's historic district commission.
 Typically, a delay of 90 days can be activated if a house that's scheduled to be torn down is located in a historic district; if it's more than 50 years old (60 in Greenwich); or if it's included on a special town list of noteworthy buildings (like in New Haven).
 During the delay period, any resident can come forward and make their case why the proposed demolition shouldn't take place. The idea is, the owner will hear the arguments, change their minds, and revise their plans.
 ''We're concerned just as all communities in Fairfield County about the ability to be notified once these permits are filed,'' said Gary Singer of the Ridgefield Historical Society, who is helping draft the delay law in that town. ''Once these resources are lost they are irreplaceable.''
 Although these laws can stall demolitions, they can't stop them, and town officials said it is rare when owners reverse course.
 That hasn't stopped a group of neighbors in Greenwich from trying to save three adjacent Victorian homes on Sherwood Place inside a 159-building National Register of Historic Places district.
 Local builders want to demolish the somewhat tatty turn-of-the-century structures to make way for new multifamily homes. In fact, the new buildings, with their planned wraparound porches and wood fish-scale shingles, may even improve on the originals' vinyl siding and aluminum trim.
 Yet neighbors said that the houses should be renovated, not razed.
 ''We recognize you can't save every single house,'' said Bill Schneider, who has galvanized support by handing out pamphlets and writing letters to local, state and national politicians. ''But when you see something coming in that looks like Levittown,'' he said, referring to the Long Island suburb, ''it will only encourage other developers.''
 Appealing to the state, Mr. Schneider has asked the Connecticut Historical Commission to delay demolition on the Sherwood Place homes for an additional 90 days, after the first 90-day delay ends this fall. Susan Chandler, the commission's historical architect, said she is discussing the matter with the builders.
 Meanwhile, the building industry in Connecticut is trying to cope with demolition delay laws while still faced with a seemingly insatiable appetite for larger and more luxurious houses.
 ''The demand for housing in Fairfield County is still very strong,'' said Greg Ugalde, a builder who also serves as president of the 1,100-member Homebuilders Association of Connecticut. ''It has required purchasers of homes to get creative to fulfill the need,'' which sometimes means having to tear homes down.
 Some battles over old homes, however, are igniting debates about how aggressive towns need to pre-empt the problem.
 In Madison, where tear-downs have almost doubled this year from last, going from four to seven, the most recent spat was over a clapboard saltbox on 10 acres known as the David Field House, whose oldest section dates to the late 1600's.
 Because there are no local demolition delay laws on the books, the town's zoning board easily approved Michael Montanaro, the builder, to put four new homes on the property.
 Even though preservationists are hopeful they can find a buyer for the Field House and move it before construction starts, they said they were hindered in their efforts to save it.
 ''I would like to see the town fathers do more to protect houses like this,'' said Jane Kuhl, former president of the Madison Historical Society. ''Our town is in the bull's-eye right now.''
 In Ellington, the Pinney House, a gable-roofed colonial completed in 1776 that is next to dozens of new, attached apartments, may be saved.
 Eric Santini, a developer who originally planned on demolishing the home, is working with the Friends of the Pinney House, a preservation group, to spare it by moving the house across the street.
 Still, many residents were caught unawares by the town's swift approval of the project.
 ''I was shocked that our zoning board approved this development site near this historic structure,'' said Dale Roberson, a lawyer and chairman of Friends of the Pinney House. ''This is the second-oldest house in our town.''
 Clifford Aucter, vice chairman of Ellington's Planning and Zoning Board, said the developer had at first thought the house could not be saved.
 ''The house wasn't even taken into consideration, not out of callousness, it just wasn't taken into consideration,'' he said. ''The developer found it wasn't economically feasible to save it.''
 Some homeowners who changed their minds during the demolition-delay process are outspoken about their conversions.
 Emily Laux bought her 1896 Westport farmhouse on two acres in June 1997 and after some frustrating attempts to renovate the place, decided to start from scratch. Yet a local architect intervened, convincing her the original structures were worth saving.
 Since then, Ms. Laux has become a strong advocate of the preservation approach, frustrated by the ''over-the-top'' McMansions with high fences, wide driveways, and treeless lawns that now line her Cross Highway neighborhood.
 ''I have developed a visual fondness for old properties when I pass by them,'' Ms. Laux said. ''I can only hope that what we did encourages others to do the same.''

HEADLINE: The Utility Company Around the Corner

BYLINE: By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
THE general manager of Norwich's utilities department was visiting an industrial customer one day when he learned the business was planning to leave the city.
 The owner said although railroad tracks and a road near his factory were essential to his business, they also were hemming it in and preventing him from expanding.
 ''We asked what we could do to keep him in the city and he talked about moving the road,'' said Richard E. DesRoches, general manager of the Norwich Department of Public Utilities.
 Utilities and community development officials then persuaded the city government to expand sewer and fire protection to the site and relocate a section of road to create five acres of developable land adjacent to the factory. The Otrobando Avenue business currently called US Foodservice, expanded three times since the initial conversation a decade ago, Mr. DesRoches said. In 2003, the company paid the city nearly $12,000 in real estate taxes. 
 ''The city has been collecting more taxes and selling more electricity there all along,'' he said. ''In the regular marketplace it wouldn't have happened because no one goes to that kind of trouble.''
 Personalized attention and community-oriented service is typical for municipally owned utility companies, however, Mr. DesRoches and other municipal utilities officials and their customers said.
 In Norwich, the utility not only works to keep and attract businesses, but also promotes environmental friendliness by undertaking projects such as the operation of a fleet of natural gas vehicles and building a $2.5 million fish lift that has allowed several species of fish to return to the upper reaches of the Shetucket River. 
 In Groton, the utility company expanded into the cable television business after its customers asked it to do so. 
 Now, Glenn M. Wilson, the Groton Utilities Director, said Groton was the first area in the state where customers have a choice of what will provide their cable television service: the privately owned Comcast or the municipally owned Thames Valley Communications.
 Representatives of other municipal utilities in the state said their utilities also participate in a variety of educational programs in local schools, work to keep their rates lower than their privately owned competitors, help lower property taxes by contributing money directly to their municipalities and generally restore power more quickly after outages.
 ''Traditionally, public power is about better service,'' Patrick Hyland, executive director of the Northeast Public Power Association in Milford, Mass., said. ''The crews and maintenance staff are closer to the customers and live in the community. And typically, the rates are lower by between 10 percent and 15 percent.''
 Connecticut Light and Power lists $64.04 as an average monthly bill for a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours of electricity during a summer month, according to information posted on its Web site. A similar Norwich Utilities customer would pay $58.20 -- about 9 percent lower -- for the same electric use at the same time of year, utilities officials said. Nationally, there are more than 2,000 public power companies and about 43 million Americans, or 14 percent of all customers, get their electricity from publicly owned utilities, according to statistics from the American Public Power Association in Washington, D.C.
 In Connecticut, however, just 4.2 percent of customers get electricity from a municipally owned utility, Madalyn Cafruny, director of communications for the national association, said.
 There are six municipal electric companies in the state: Norwich, Groton, Wallingford, Jewett City and two separate companies that serve different areas of Norwalk. The Norwich and Groton companies are celebrating their centennials this year, while those in Jewett City, Wallingford and South Norwalk are older. Norwalk's Third District Electric Department, now 91 years old, is Connecticut's youngest municipal electric company.
 All electric companies, including municipally owned ones, trace their roots to the 1880's, when Thomas Edison introduced the concept of generating electricity at a central facility and sending it by wires to remote locations. Many private entrepreneurs jumped into the business.
 Maurice Scully, chief operating officer of the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, said many of the state's original electric companies later merged or were bought by private, for-profit companies such as Connecticut Light & Power. Some municipalities entered the electric business to power streetlights and then expanded to light up homes and businesses. Other municipalities bought up the private companies that set up shop in their towns.
 Today, municipal utilities are not regulated by the state's Department of Public Utility Control. Instead, local utilities commissioners are appointed to oversee operations and make policy decisions for each municipal utility.
 ''The public utilities that survived, the municipalities saw some benefit to keeping them,'' Mr. Scully said. ''In some places, they are now the hallmarks of their communities. They show foresight on the part of their forefathers.''
 The Norwich-based electric cooperative formed in 1976. All of Connecticut's municipal utilities belong to the cooperative, which provides them with more buying power on the wholesale electric market.
 The smallest of Connecticut's municipal electric companies is in Jewett City, a borough of the town of Griswold. The director, Joseph Dudek, who has worked for the company for 44 years, said it provides power to 2,000 customers. 
 On the other end of the size spectrum is Wallingford's electric utility that serves 24,000 customers, including a number of large industrial users, said Richard Hendershot, general manager of the electric division there.
 Groton Utilities also serves industrial customers such as Pfizer's pharmaceutical research and development operation, General Dynamics' Electric Boat submarine shipyard and the United States Navy Submarine base.
 Utility commissioner Julio Leandri said these three entities account for about 60 percent of the Groton company's energy output.
 ''When Pfizer came here, their big concern was how much water we could supply,'' said Mr. Leandri, who worked at the utility for 38 years before retiring in 1985. ''We promised to give them what they needed.'' 
 Groton Utilities supplies both water and electricity to its customers.
 While officials at all municipal utilities said they work to keep their rates lower than those at privately owned utilities, they said local taxpayers also benefit from utility company payments made directly into municipal coffers.
 ''The property taxes would double in the city if we weren't here,'' Mr. Wilson of Groton said.
 In Norwich, Mr. DesRoches said 10 percent of the utilities' billed revenues go directly to the city's general fund. This year, Norwich utilities contributed more than $5 million to the city in this manner.
 Mr. Leandri, who has served as a Groton utilities commissioner since 1987, two years after retiring from his utilities job, said although customers appreciate lower rates and lower taxes, they especially enjoy being able to talk to a real person no matter what time they call to report a problem. 
 ''Municipal utilities have more focused service,'' Mr. Scully said. ''It's more a part of the fabric of the community. Everything the employees and the management do tends to focus on what they can do for the community.''
 Mr. Wilson in Groton puts it this way, ''Our customers are our investors.''
 ''We've been here 100 years and we'll be here another 100,'' Mr. Leandri said. ''Customers know we make no decision without them in mind.''

HEADLINE: Many Say Redevelopment Along Hudson Would Displace Their Homes and Businesses

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Real estate developers hunting for new development sites call the far West Side of Manhattan the last frontier. The Bloomberg administration calls it a blighted wasteland ready for radical transformation.
 But Benoit Lagarde, Kitty Burke, Richard Silver and others who live or own businesses in the neighborhood call it home. Along with Mercedes-Benz Manhattan and Federal Express, which operate large operations on the far West Side, they have begun to resist the city's sweeping redevelopment plan for the area, fearing that it will dislodge them from their houses and offices.
 In a city where residents battle developers with the same fervent determination that developers try to enlarge the skyline, they say they are not knee-jerk opponents of development. Indeed, they want the sometimes drab streets and battered brick buildings of the old industrial area spruced up. They also favor building more apartments and office towers, and expanding the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 Ms. Burke, who owns the industrial building on 34th Street that houses Federal Express and is designated for demolition, said the city should rezone the area and let the real estate market take its course, rather than specifying development sites and putting her and others out of business.
 After enduring life on the West Side in the bad old days when prostitutes were among the most aggressive entrepreneurs on 11th Avenue, she and others do not want the wrecking ball to destroy their homes or businesses to make way for what they say is an unprecedented level of development: the equivalent of 13 Empire State Buildings and 12,800 apartments envisioned in the city's ambitious master plan.
 It is not hard to see why the seemingly inexorable march of development is edging closer to the West Side, where about 30 percent of the 60-block area west of Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River, from 28th to 42nd Streets, is vacant or underused. The small scale of the neighborhood's industrial past is evident in its factory buildings, warehouses and tenements, which once housed longshoremen who worked the docks nearby. Bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues, between 30th and 33rd Streets, the railyard where the city and the Jets want to build a riverside football stadium is 150 years old. To the north, the area is crisscrossed by entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel and ramps leading to the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
 Like many of the city's other once-grimy neighborhoods, the West Side has already been undergoing something of a renaissance, with new businesses, art galleries and restaurants opening alongside industrial operations. Residents say the city's plan will be inhospitable to the small- and medium-size businesses that have been there for years and those that are just beginning to take root.
 ''I'm very much concerned with where the small-business man can set up his establishment within Manhattan to serve all the needs of Manhattan,'' said Mr. Silver, president of American Pipe and Tank on West 35th Street, near 11th Avenue. ''What will happen to fellows like myself or my son? Where do we go? How do I service my client base if they take this area away?''
 Mr. Silver's company builds and installs the wooden and steel water tanks that adorn the crowns of many high-rises. Under the city's plan, the building he has owned since 1972, along with dozens of others, would be condemned and razed for a new boulevard stretching from 42nd to 34th Streets, between 10th and 11th Avenues.
 The city's draft environmental review, which identifies specific sites for residential or commercial development, estimates that at least 225 businesses and 4,269 employees would be directly displaced, as well as 139 residents in 10 buildings.
 Like Federal Express and Mercedes-Benz Manhattan, Mr. Silver says he must be near his customers and would be unable to find an alternative location in Midtown.
 In some cases, property would be condemned by the city. Property owners seeking compensation would then have to debate the value in court.
 The Bloomberg administration says the relatively low-scale far West Side is the only place in Manhattan where the city can expand to meet the need for first-class office space over the next 30 years. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who has led the city's West Side effort, says that it is crucial to the city's future that it be able to expand and that the West Side is the logical place to do it. The city estimates that the development would generate 110,930 jobs by 2025 and about $2 billion in annual tax revenues.
 The rezoning plan, which would allow for large-scale development, is currently wending its way through the city's approval process, with a public hearing on Thursday at the Department of City Planning.
 Some property owners in the area agree with the city's plan, saying it will speed the neighborhood's rebirth and be a boon to the rest of the city.
 ''This isn't about me; it's about greater New York,'' said Richard Zakka, who owns several buildings on West 36th Street that would face demolition and favors the city's plan, known as Hudson Yards. ''The Hudson Yards plan is brilliant.''
 Frank Ford, who runs O'Farrell's, a tavern one block from the Javits Convention Center, at 10th Avenue and West 33rd Street, has embraced the plan. His customers are split between conventioneers and locals, but the tavern is closed most weekends for lack of business.
 He said an expanded convention center, a proposed 75,000-seat stadium for the New York Jets over the nearby railyard, hotels and other development in the area would mean more jobs and more customers. ''It'll be good for every small business and large hotel on the West Side,'' he said.
 Mr. Ford dismissed criticisms of the city's plan and the $1.4 billion stadium, which is widely opposed in the neighborhood. ''There are some people who still want the hookers over here,'' he said, in a reference to the 1970's and 80's. ''People resist change.''
 But others want a slower pace. Members of Community Board 4, whose district embraces the Hudson Yards site, say the area must be developed, but not as aggressively as the city proposes. Like some economists, the board has suggested that the city is being overly optimistic in projecting the need for expensive office buildings on the far West Side, where more than 20,000 people make their home. For one thing, more than 10 million square feet of new office space is planned for Lower Manhattan in the coming years. 
 ''We're fully in favor of developing the area,'' said the community board chairman, Walter Mankoff. ''We support a bigger Javits and think this should be a major residential area with a significant commercial component. It's a question of whether you want 30-story buildings or 80-story buildings.''
 Camilla Pettle, who lives in a four-story walk-up across the street from Mr. Silver's business and works at the Cupcake Cafe on Ninth Avenue, said she worried that the city's plan for wholesale development would destroy the vibrant mix of retail, residential and industrial life taking root here. 
 ''They keep saying there's nothing here,'' Ms. Pettle said. ''But this neighborhood has a real personality. There's enough space here for everyone to get some of what they want. But they're tearing a hole in the middle of a neighborhood that's already been destroyed by the tunnels and stuff like that.''
 There are dozens of small and medium-size businesses scattered through the district and an increasing number of residents. New residential development has made the leap across Eighth Avenue, especially in west Chelsea and along 42nd Street, spurred in part by the rejuvenation of Times Square.
 In the migratory patterns of New York real estate, art galleries forced out by rising rents in SoHo have moved to west Chelsea at the southern end of Hudson Yards, and nightclubs like the Copacabana have opened on 11th Avenue.
 Benoit Lagarde, a founder of Splashlight Studios at 529 West 35th Street, said he loved the eclectic mix of his street and the way his photographic studios feed off the printer next door and the lighting and motion picture equipment business across the street. In 2001, Mr. Lagarde and a partner invested $8.5 million in an old industrial building, transforming it into busy fashion studios and creating a small restaurant on the ground floor. But under the city's plan, the building would be demolished.
 ''We need to be on the West Side, where all the fashion directors, photographers and modeling agencies are,'' Mr. Lagarde said. ''This could destroy us. It would stop my business as it is today.''
 Next door, Wayne Sapper, president of King Displays, a company that prints most of the signs, displays and marquees for the theater district, said the building he is in would also be razed. He said he moved to West 35th Street in 1987 to be close to his customers. ''The West Side is doing fine on its own,'' he said. ''We need an expansion of the Javits, but I don't think we have to destroy a neighborhood to do it.''
 Federal Express, which has a large distribution center at 34th Street and 11th Avenue, has told the city that it would probably have to move to New Jersey because it could not find an alternative location in Midtown that would accommodate the 129 vans that now operate there. That would mean, Federal Express told Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, that it would have to send more trucks through the Lincoln Tunnel, adding to traffic congestion and pollution. 
 Ms. Burke, the company's landlord, opposes the condemnation and demolition of the building her grandfather built, when he created the Bulwark Corporation, the family's heirloom against poverty and dissolution.
 ''The West Side needs and deserves to be developed to a certain degree,'' Ms. Burke said. ''It's the last frontier. But they shouldn't destroy things that are good for development and the city.''

HEADLINE: In Crete, Mobility With a Guide and a Glide

BYLINE: By MARILYNNE RUDICK. 
MARILYNNE RUDICK is a writer in Chevy Chase, Md.

 BODY:
AS our plane landed in Iraklion, I considered whether sea kayaking in Crete was going to be a peak experience or a long way to go for a gyro sandwich. For years I'd listened enviously to my friends' tales of adventure travel. I have multiple sclerosis, so trekking in Tibet was out. But kayaking -- which requires upper body strength, not leg power -- seemed like a good bet. 
 After seeing an ad in Outside magazine for inn-to-inn kayaking in Crete, I called the outfitter, the Northwest Passage, and explained what I could do (kayak) and couldn't do (walk more than a short distance). Could they accommodate me on their September trip? ''Absolutely,'' Adam Walsh assured me. He described an eight-day kayaking adventure that combined physical challenge, great natural beauty and the comfort of staying in a family-owned inn -- a firm mattress and a hot shower -- after a hard day of paddling. 
 Despite Adam's assurances, I worried about my abilities and disabilities. Along with my quick-dry wardrobe and headlamps for exploring sea caves, I packed a hefty supply of books as a hedge. 
 Our kayaking adventure began in Matala, on Crete's south coast. In addition to my husband, Bob, and me, there were seven other paddlers ranging in age from 23 to 58. We were the only couple; the others were assorted singles from New York, Chicago, Santa Fe, San Diego and British Columbia. Our group of six women and three men was a mixture of experienced kayakers and novices. 
 Our two guides were Rick Sweitzer and Mike Agostinelli. We learned that Rick, the Northwest Passage's founder, has led expeditions all over the world, including the North and South Poles. Mike is a kayak instructor, firefighter and paramedic, whose remarkable talents unfolded throughout the week. 
 The morning after our arrival in Matala, outfitted with paddles, life jackets and spray skirts, which keep the sea out of the cockpit, we gathered at the beach for our initiation. Strong winds rattled the palm trees, and whitecaps whipped up the bay as Mike initiated us in paddling basics. Nevertheless, we gamely launched our kayaks. 
 Bob and I shared a double kayak, which promised stability and comfort. In the front, I was to set the pace; in the back, Bob provided power and steered, using foot pedals to control the rudder. It seemed as though we'd been out all day when we took a break -- two hours! My arms and shoulders ached, and I wondered about the afternoon, let alone the entire week.
 That night, an optional easy sunset hike was planned. I asked Rick whether he thought I could do the hike on my lightweight electric scooter. He said no, but he proposed another way. ''How do you feel about being carried?'' My initial reaction: ''I'll skip the hike and meet up for dinner.'' But Janie, another kayaker, gave me a sharp jab. ''Are you crazy? Rick and Mike are hunks. Don't turn this down!'' 
 I envisioned Mike and Rick rigging up a seat in which I'd be carried like a Mediterranean potentate on a litter. But my litter carrier turned out to be just Mike, and my litter was Mike's back. Mike hoisted me -- 120 pounds -- and carried me piggy-back as he rock-scrambled up the mountain. 
 From then on, Mike had Zeus-like status. And that was before Mike, also a massage therapist, set up his table on the roof of the hotel, and accompanied by a soft breeze and starlit sky, massaged away my stiff neck and shoulders. Mike's postdinner massage (included in the trip) became a nightcap for three or four of that day's neediest. 
 When Adam assured me that the Northwest Passage could accommodate me, I had imagined the normal arrangements: ground-floor rooms, van transportation if needed, help getting in and out of kayaks. I had not anticipated making the mountain accessible. 
 But over the course of the week as I watched Rick and Mike gracefully attend to everyone's different needs, I realized that figuring out how to make this trip accessible for me was just another expedition challenge -- like getting a team of dog sledders to the North Pole.
 The plan was to travel to the westernmost point of our trip, Agia Roumeli. Then we would spend the rest of the week paddling our way along the southern coast back to Matala, a distance of about 75 miles. We'd paddle five to seven hours a day, covering between 8 and 24 miles daily.
 We were kayaking in that part of the Mediterranean known as the Libyan Sea. In Crete, we were about halfway between Athens and Libya. 
 When we launched our kayaks from the beach at Agia Roumeli, the winds had died down and the water was as advertised -- smooth as sea glass. Our days took on a comfortable rhythm: an after-breakfast launch, a midmorning cappuccino stop at a beach taverna, a few more hours of paddling to our lunch taverna, and then several hours of paddling to that night's destination. Most days, our pace was leisurely, leaving plenty of time, in Rick's words, ''to follow our inner bliss.'' 
 That meant meandering along the coast, paddling in water that reflected the muted grays of the hills and the sky's color wheel of blues. The weather was perfect, both the air and the water in the high 70's, without a hint of humidity and only an occasional cloud. 
 Each day was a variation on the theme. Our stops included Agios Pavlos, where an 11th-century stone chapel honors St. Paul, reputedly shipwrecked on the shores of Crete; Sweetwater Beach, where icy springs bubble out of the sand; and Palm Beach, where a fresh-water estuary blends into the sea. Some days we explored sea caves, carved out of the craggy limestone cliffs that line the coast. 
 While all our overnights were in charming seaside towns, Loutro, where we spent two nights, was the stand-out, its brilliant white buildings, all with blue trim, set against a backdrop of fawn and peach hills.
 At a family-owned restaurant in Loutro, we dined as a group, as we did all but one night.Typically we'd shared a groaning board of appetizers: stuffed grape leaves, eggplant salads, saganaki (fried cheese) and always tzatziki (yogurt, cucumber and garlic dip) and Greek salads.
 Our main courses were traditional: lamb, fish, moussaka. Dinner ended with ouzo, or more commonly raki, the Greek version of white lightning. 
 The Crete trip was rated a 1 by the Northwest Passage -- easy, no experience needed. But Gordon, an experienced kayaker from British Columbia, thought it could best be described as covering a range from novice to expert. A van, driven by George Stavroulakis, a retired Cretan sea captain, tailed us, meeting us at our midmorning break, then again at lunch. That meant you could kayak for as long or as short a distance as you liked. 
 One day Janie and I shaved five miles off a 24-mile paddle, opting for a leisurely breakfast, a ferry and a van ride with George, meeting up with the kayakers mid-morning. Van rides had their own rewards: a chance to switch back through mountains, olive groves, vineyards and small villages.
 MOST days, Rick also proposed a hiking alternative for those who did not want to kayak for the entire day. You could, for example, hike in the morning then join the kayakers for the afternoon portion. Obviously, I kayaked rather than hiked. 
 There was only one day when there was just a hike, an 11-mile downhill through the Samarian Gorge. On that day, I ferried with George to the day's destination, Agia Roumeli, at the foot of the gorge, and spent the afternoon on the beach. Another way to change the pace was to trade off between stable double kayaks and the expedition single kayaks. 
 In reading the pretrip briefing material, I felt sure I wouldn't do the final leg on the last day, an eight-mile open-water paddle from Agia Galini back to Matala, described as ''a challenge for the hardiest of paddlers.'' Other than this stretch, we had skimmed the coast, in easy reach of land. 
 But here I was on Day 8 in the front of a double kayak, with Bob in the back, feeling confident about my ability and eager for one last paddle. Rick scheduled an early launch to take advantage of the calm seas. But by the time we were beyond the sheltered harbor, wind and sea had whipped up.
 Rick paddled over to check our comfort level and offer us a chance to turn back. But we'd honed our skills during the week and we felt up to the challenge. For the first hour, Bob and I fought the sea and heavy winds that pummeled our port and pushed us off course.
 But then the wind shifted, and we were on a comfortable run. Our kayak became a surfboard, carried along by the motion of the waves. We relaxed and enjoyed the ride, the crossing and the week ending much too soon. 
 For my final meal in Matala, I had a world-class gyro and tallied my accomplishments. I had kayaked about 90 miles. I was aided by a convivial, supportive group -- and above all, Rick and Mike, who were willing to move mountains to make my trip a success.

HEADLINE: Housing Costs Make Ohio Look Appealing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The article, ''Don't Tell Anyone, but There's This Rich Joke Going Around . . . ,'' Sept. 5, about the high cost of living in New Jersey inspires comment. Apparently the median family income in New Jersey is now the highest in the nation at $70,263.00. I'm single, earn more than that, and I still can't afford to buy a home in Hoboken, where I live. 
 But if I could afford a home here, I don't think I could psychologically bear to pay the ridiculously high taxes. Unfortunately, I can afford a home in New Jersey towns or sections of towns where I don't feel safe, or which are remote from the community I've built. I can't be the only person with semi-deep pockets facing this problem. Is there a politician or developer listening? So, while I'm not eager to move out of state, Ohio, with it's median income of $51,522, looks very attractive. There I'll truly be rich, happily relaxing in the shade of my buckeye trees, and content in the knowledge that if global warming continues along its simmering path, I'll be the proud owner of waterfront property just in time for retirement.

HEADLINE: Not From Around Here, Are You?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
IN today's global auto industry, Chinese workers bolt bumpers onto Jeeps while good ol' boys drive Nissan trucks off the assembly line in Mississippi (and polish Mercedes's three-pointed star in Alabama). 
 But few cars are quite as cosmopolitan as Suzuki's latest sedans, the compact Forenza and midsize Verona.
 Not only were their names inspired by Italian geography, they were styled by Italian designers. They are built in South Korea and sold by an American subsidiary of a Japanese company. Their path to the marketplace began with a complicated deal in which an American conglomerate, General Motors, bought major assets of a bankrupt Korean automaker, Daewoo. G.M. also owns 20 percent of Suzuki, which helps to explain how the Japanese automaker got a piece of the reconstituted Daewoo pie. 
 G.M. now sells various Daewoo models worldwide, including some that wear Chevrolet and Buick nametags. For instance, the Chevrolet Aveo subcompact is known overseas as the Daewoo Kalos.
 But rebadged Daewoos are only a drop in G.M.'s big American bucket, whereas they are a crucial part of the American Suzuki Motor Corporation's strategy to triple its sales here by 2007, to 200,000 a year. In addition to the Verona and Forenza, Suzuki will start to sell the Reno, a car-based utility wagon built by G.M. Daewoo, this fall.
 Suzuki's strategy with the Verona and Forenza is similar to that of the South Korean automakers Kia and Hyundai: offer well-equipped models at lower prices and with longer warranties than the Japanese competition. All Suzukis come with a basic warranty of 3 years or 36,000 miles and a powertrain warranty of 7 years or 100,000 miles; unlike most warranties, these are transferable when the cars are sold. Buyers also receive free roadside assistance for 3 years or 36,000 miles.
 The similarities of the newest Suzuki twosome to other Korean models don't end there. After weeklong test drives of both the Forenza and Verona, I concluded that the Suzukis indeed offer a lot of content at a somewhat lower price, with a warranty that should provide some peace of mind. 
 But the cars lack the refinement and engineering sophistication that consumers have come to expect from the Japanese -- and even from some recent American models like the Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Focus.

Forenza: Pleasing at First Glance
 The smaller of the new Suzukis, the Forenza, was designed by Pininfarina, the studio responsible for some of the most beautiful Ferraris, Maseratis and Alfa Romeos that ever graced the roads of the world. While the Forenza is contemporary and handsome, it will never make the short list of lovely Italian-design automobiles.
 The compact Forenza sedan -- a station wagon version goes on sale next year -- is based on the Daewoo Lucetti. That car replaced the Nubira, which fell in the middle of a Daewoo threesome sold in the United States from 1999 to 2002.
 (When G.M. bought Daewoo's Korean assets, it declined to pick up the American subsidiary, Daewoo Motor America, leaving dealers and existing customers in the lurch. In August, a federal judge in Orlando, Fla., dismissed a suit filed by the Daewoo subsidiary and its dealers against G.M., saying they had no exclusive rights to vehicles manufactured by the new G.M. Daewoo company. A spokesman for Daewoo Motor America said it planned an appeal.)
 The Forenza takes aim at some well-established small cars like the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, and at a glance it seems quite competitive.
 The picture darkens a bit when you look at the powertrain. The 2-liter 4-cylinder engine is a modern design (with dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder), but it is rated at just 126 horsepower and 131 pounds-feet of torque. Though many of the Forenza's competitors have smaller engines, they manage to squeeze out as much power, or more; the Focus gets 10 more horsepower out of the same size engine.
 Larger engines that put out less horsepower than smaller ones are a common theme in Korean cars. The front-drive Forenza not only feels underpowered, its government fuel economy ratings are the lowest in the class; 24 miles per gallon in the city and 31 m.p.g. on the highway (with a five-speed manual transmission). Mileage of comparable compact sedans falls broadly in a range of 26 to 40 m.p.g.
 The other available transmission, a four-speed automatic, takes a further toll in both performance and mileage.
 While a Forenza owner will be making more stops at gas stations than those who drive Civics, he or she will ride in reasonable comfort. The cabin is attractively appointed with high-quality materials, comfortable seats and extremely good fit-and-finish. At 12.4 cubic feet, the trunk space is on par with that of other compact cars, and the rear seats fold nearly flat, adding to the potential cargo capacity.
 Acceleration is adequate around town. The ride is smooth, the handling is decent and the stopping is confident, thanks to four-wheel disc brakes. Still, the driving dynamics are not nearly as sporty as some of the offerings from Japanese and American car companies. In particular, the new Mazda 3 and Ford Focus have crisper Euro-style handling and a firmer ride. 
 Indeed, the driving dynamics of many Korean-built automobiles remind me of the soft, floaty cars that American companies used to make. Perhaps Korean engineers think Americans prefer a cushy ride and softer handling. In any case, I suspect that many prospective Forenza buyers care more about reliably getting from Point A to Point B than doing it in a spirited manner.
 The Forenza comes fairly well equipped with one glaring exception: it does not offer side air bags or side curtain bags. In government crash tests, the Forenza scored four out of five possible stars for front passengers but only three stars for side impacts.
 Antilock brakes are a $500 option.
 The Forenza comes as the base S, the midlevel LX and the top-line EX, which can be dressed up further with leather seats and a sunroof. Even the S comes with air-conditioning and power features (windows, door locks and mirrors) that are optional on some rivals. In this class, only Suzuki has standard heated outside mirrors. It also has an audio system with both CD and cassette players, with eight speakers and controls on the steering wheel. The LX and EX add more features, including cruise control. 
 The Forenza starts at $13,994 including destination charge and tops out around $18,000. My test car, a ''desert green'' LX with manual transmission, was well equipped without benefit of options for a price of $14,395. So for less than $15,000 you get a complete car you can probably live with, plus a long warranty and free roadside assistance.
 Automotive Lease Guide, a Santa Barbara, Calif., company that predicts how much specific cars will depreciate, gives the Forenza just one star out of a possible five. That is on par with the Hyundai Accent, but below the Nissan Sentra (four stars), Toyota Corolla (three stars) and Mazda 3 or Ford Focus (two stars each).

Verona: Low Price, Less Power
 The midsize Verona is pitted directly against the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. It, too, was styled in Italy -- in this case, by another famous design firm, ItalDesign. Like the Forenza, it is pleasing to look at, but hardly a knockout.
 The Verona's interior space essentially matches the Camry's, which is to say it is more than adequate for most people in the market for a midsize sedan. The controls are good and the general environment is quite comfortable -- relatively upscale, even. My chief complaint was that the on-off switch for the radio was poorly positioned on the steering wheel; my finger constantly hit it, turning off the radio, while I was driving.
 The front-drive Verona has an in-line 6-cylinder engine, unusual in a class where V-6's dominate. The 2.5-liter power plant is a new design developed with help from Porsche, with dual camshafts and 24 valves. While in-line 6's are typically smoother and quieter than V-6's -- they continue to be a chief attraction of midrange BMW's -- the Verona's was noisier and rougher-running than I had anticipated.
 The transmission is a four-speed automatic; unlike many of its competitors, the Verona doesn't offer a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic. The Verona's power falls far short of other six-cylinder engines in this class; its 155 horsepower and 177 pounds-feet of peak torque are closer to the ratings of competitive cars with four cylinders. In contrast, the Accord's 3-liter V-6 makes 240 horsepower and the Camry's like-size engine generates 210; the Altima's 3.5-liter V-6 tops the group with 250 horses.
 The Verona's gas mileage, like the Forenza's, falls at the lower end of its class: 20 miles per gallon in town and 28 on the highway.
 The Verona's ride and handling are decent, however, even though the car's suspension is tuned more for comfort than for sport.
 Like the Forenza, the Verona comes in three versions: base S, midlevel LX and top-of-the-line EX. Base prices, including delivery charges, range from $17,994 to $21,494. A top-of-the line EX with the only available option -- the $500 traction control -- tops out at $21,494. A midtrim Camry SE V-6 starts at $25,000 before options, and the top-drawer Camry XLE is more than $26,000. The Accord EX approaches $30,000.
 All Veronas have fog lights, four-wheel disc brakes and heated outside mirrors, not to mention standard power windows and door locks, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, keyless entry and a stereo with CD, cassette player and six speakers. The uplevel versions add antilock brakes (they are $500 extra on the base model) and automatic climate control. 
 But like its smaller sibling and unlike its rivals, the Verona does not have side air bags or inflatable curtains that cover the windows in a side crash. The government has not yet crash-tested the Verona.

THIS IS BURNING MAN
The Rise of a New
American Underground.
By Brian Doherty.
Illustrated. 304 pp.
Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
 Among the many bizarre summer rituals that compel otherwise sensible Americans to travel thousands of miles and behave like lunatics -- excluding those with the words ''national'' and ''convention'' in their names -- none is as perplexing as the annual observation of Burning Man. The very nature of the weeklong event, which begins in late August in the desert outside Reno, almost defies articulation: is it an outsider art festival or a spontaneous civics experiment? A flash point for a neotribalistic revival? Or just a great place to go get high on Labor Day weekend? 
 Despite the declarative promise of its title, Brian Doherty's book, ''This Is Burning Man,'' barely scratches beneath the surface of those enigmatic alkali flats. This is a shame, because Doherty, a senior editor at Reason magazine and a veteran of ''the Burn'' since 1995, would appear to possess ideal qualifications to explicate the 18-year-old rite for an uninitiated audience. But from the book's opening pages, he seems more concerned with preserving Burning Man's mythology, playing down the festival's obvious roots in centuries-old predecessors like the (possibly apocryphal) rite of Wicker Man, while overstating its philosophical connections to the counterculture movements of 1960's-era figures like Ken Kesey. When Doherty asserts that Kesey's experiments ''struck devastating blows that made chinks in consensual reality'' and that Burning Man ''is now bulldozing boldly and heedlessly through those chinks,'' you may wonder if the author has left behind more than just his objectivity in the Black Rock Playa. 
 The first half of the book is a folksy retelling of Burning Man's mostly organic evolution from an informal gathering of friends on a San Francisco beach to a temporary city with a population of over 30,000, one that now charges an admission fee of up to $250 per person. It's an account that depends heavily on the fuzzy recollections of Burning Man's earliest attendees, particularly its founder, Larry Harvey, a charismatic Bay Area iconoclast who often speaks in proverbs. (Sample aphorism: ''It's not enough to be Jesus. You have to have some disciples.'')
 From there, ''This Is Burning Man'' starts to sketch out some of the festival's longstanding customs -- its barter-only economy, its tradition of dangerous and highly flammable art installations -- but gets continually bogged down in hagiographies of its zanier participants and their eccentric projects, in endlessly cataloging who built what out of what while under the influence of what. Both the author and his subjects frequently employ words like ''faith'' and ''glory'' and ''magic''; they speak of feelings of purposelessness and isolation that weren't resolved until they found Burning Man. No one seems to recognize that this same slanted phraseology could just as easily be wielded by advocates of the Shriners, the Church of Scientology or the Atkins diet -- that there is nothing inherently cool, or even unique, about institutions that derive their power from insularity and take pride in their inability to be understood by nonbelievers. 
 Amid his talk of ''consensual reality,'' ''emotional reality'' and ''raw reality,'' there is a palpable disdain in Doherty's writing for people who are content to exist in boring old real reality, who ''refuse to open their hearts'' to Burning Man ''because of a protective shell of contempt.'' He never sees it as his responsibility to make the festival comprehensible to these same people. That's fine if he wants to write a recruitment guide or a travelogue, but it's not necessarily a commendable impulse in composing a work of journalistic nonfiction.
 When Doherty sheepishly describes Burning Man as ''an event whose impact depends very much on direct experience,'' it's just another way of saying, You had to be there.

THE GOOD FIGHT
Declare Your Independence
and Close the Democracy Gap.
By Ralph Nader.
294 pp. Regan Books. $25.95.

IN PURSUIT OF JUSTICE
Collected Writings, 2000-2003.
By Ralph Nader.
519 pp. Seven Stories Press.
Paper, $19.95.
 FOR much of his career, stretching back better than four decades now, journalists have found it hard to call Ralph Nader what he was. They labeled him a consumer advocate. The phrase was less threatening, but also less complete, than the reality. For as the power of corporations expanded across the years, Ralph Nader's place as their most relentless critic grew too. Now, in ''The Good Fight,'' and in a collection of previously published columns, ''In Pursuit of Justice,'' Nader, a Harvard-trained lawyer, offers his case that virtually all of America's woes can be traced to the rise and growing power of what he calls multinational corporate predators. 
 It would seem a timely argument. The rise of the global corporation is surely a defining aspect of modern history, and the view that corporations are just highly efficient mechanisms for maximizing economic good has taken a real drubbing in the Enron era. ''Autocratic global corporations are deep into strategic planning,'' Nader roars. ''They openly and confidently strive to control our jobs; our environment; our political and educational institutions; our food, drugs and other consumptions; our savings; our childhoods; our culture; even our genetic futures. Toward these ends, they incessantly move to control our elections and our governmental institutions.''
 There is of course a polemic power in the overdrawn. What Philip K. Dick is to fiction Ralph Nader is to politics. The future, a la Nader, is a darkening place if we fail to act before the ''artificial entities called corporations'' complete their takeover. ''Is it not time for real people to plan for their own futures together?'' Nader asks. (When he finishes his tour as governor of California, perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger can play Ralph Nader in the movie.) Nader's voice is full of anger and frustration. He rages as much as reasons. This will no doubt please those who already follow him. But for the doubters, and there are more now than before his 2000 presidential campaign helped toss the election into the Supreme Court, his unmeasured tone suits the role of campaigner better than that of conscience. 
 In fairness, the language above, from Nader's introduction to ''The Good Fight,'' is followed by 286 pages in which he details his specific case on each point. On some he is fascinating. He offers a trenchant treatment of the argument that trial lawyers, far from being money-grubbing ambulance chasers, perform a public service by forcing corporations to consider the potential financial cost (via liability actions) of pollution, unsafe products and mistreatment of workers.
 Nader's books make something of a matched set with ''The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power,'' by Joel Bakan, a Canadian law professor. Where Bakan tries to offer an intellectual overview of what he describes as the amoral nature of the modern corporation, Nader assembles his evidence from the rubble of his 40 years of combat -- and also by lifting from Bakan. 
 Bakan argues that corporations behave ''pathologically'' because of their inherent logic and legal obligation to pursue profit without regard to external costs borne by others. Nader says he made a similar argument to a conference of psychologists years ago. Both then seek to show how the restraints that hold this drive in check -- unions, communities, even national governments -- have been overridden by the scale of the modern corporation. Both cite Milton Friedman and others in defense of the focus on profit. Nader also quotes Peter F. Drucker, the preeminent student of American management: ''If you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibility, fire him. Fast.'' The quotation is eye-catching, because it directly contradicts Drucker's earlier views. ''In modern society there is no other leadership group but managers,'' Drucker wrote in the 1970's. ''If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.'' 
 Now, Nader's book doesn't have footnotes. But Bakan's (which is in Nader's bibliography) does, and in Bakan's footnotes the current comment is attributed to an interview.
 There is something quite unsettling about Drucker's 70's vision of the noblesse oblige of the corporate executive (Drucker says, by the way, that he hasn't changed his views but that Bakan, and then Nader, took his current comment out of context). Surely, Nader and Bakan could have made a more sophisticated hay with that idea. Evidently turning an icon into a straw man was so appealing that neither of them was willing or able to grapple with Drucker's full thinking on a topic both of them say is profoundly important. If society's fate hangs in the balance, as Nader argues, once over lightly isn't good enough.
 Nader has written a number of previous books. Exactly how many is hard to pin down. In ''Crashing the Party,'' his description of his 2000 presidential campaign, in which he played the iceberg to Al Gore's Titanic, he lists 16 previous books, including many written with colleagues from the various citizens groups he has spawned. In the front of ''The Good Fight,'' he lists only four, including ''Crashing the Party'' and a book on corporate lawyers with Wesley J. Smith. Why he dropped those other books is a puzzle, but a minor one. Because whatever the number only one work will be long remembered, his first. ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' is his detailed portrait of how the auto industry willfully resisted safety innovations and thus contributed to thousands of highway deaths a year. That book deserves a place in the canon of American muckraking alongside the works of Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell.
 His battle with the automakers established Ralph Nader. In his history of the Ford Motor Company, Douglas Brinkley says Nader ''stalked General Motors like a big game-hunter desperate for a kill.'' That intensity changed the balance of power between the makers and the buyers of automobiles. Brinkley relates a visit by Henry Ford II and Lee Iacocca to the Oval Office of Richard Nixon (who of course taped the session). ''They're a group of people that aren't really one damn bit interested in safety or clean air,'' the ever-calculating Nixon told the auto executives. ''What they're interested in is destroying the system. They're enemies of the system.''
 Whether that was true of Nader then he will have to tell us in a more autobiographical book. But it is certainly true of him now. Or perhaps he would prefer to say that he wishes to destroy the power of megacorporations so as to retrieve the American system of representative democracy. ''The Good Fight'' includes Nader's disclaimer that ''this book is not about my current political campaign.'' But if not, then what is his current political campaign about? 
 Democrats like to blame Nader for costing them the White House in 2000. He was in fact only one of a variety of reasons. But he was one, and he offers no apology. ''More and more the major parties become Coke and Pepsi, frantically highlighting their dwindling differences and masking their growing similarities,'' he writes. And his collection of columns includes several fierce attacks on Al Gore, including an almost cruel one in which he holds Gore up as a disappointment compared with his father.
 Like most of Nader's life, ''The Good Fight'' is fundamentally a call to action. ''The subjugation of civic values to commercial values represents one of the worst crises of our times,'' he writes, and is happening because corporations have filled a political vacuum left by apathetic citizens. The disengagement of many Americans from politics is surely one of the nation's great problems. Robin Toner, Richard L. Berke and I wrote that 13 years ago for The New York Times, and the problem has only deepened since. But Nader goes a step further and, in my view, too far. Civic disengagement has several interwoven causes, including the satisfaction of some Americans with their share of the nation's enormous wealth. It can equally well be argued that the political power of corporations is an effect of declining civic participation, not its cause. But subtlety is not Nader's strong suit. The intensity that forced safety measures in cars and saved thousands of lives four decades ago now makes it harder for the uncertain -- including those who might think there is a difference between John Kerry and George W. Bush -- to listen to his calls for action. 
 ''Democracy does take a no-excuses attitude, a positive refusal to become discouraged,'' Nader writes. ''The reverse option is to continue losing more and more control over most everything that matters to us.'' So learn the issues, participate, vote, he urges. Oh, forgive me, I forgot. This book is not about his current campaign. Or maybe some corporate lawyer from his publishing house told him he had to say that.

HEADLINE: Bringing the Battle to the President

BYLINE: By Paul Glastris. 
Paul Glastris, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, is editor in chief of The Washington Monthly.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry will lose the election unless he turns the issue of national security to his advantage. He began to do so, for the first time in weeks, with his speech on Thursday in Las Vegas, where he took President Bush to task for not being honest about the war in Iraq. In an earlier speech on the economy, he also tore into Mr. Bush's penchant for shifting blame to others. 
 This general strategy, of tracing the president's policy failings to his character flaws, is the right one. But to make it work, Mr. Kerry is going to have to show some character himself.
 First, he must offer a forthright defense of his vote in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq. But that defense will never be accepted unless he also accepts some responsibility for the consequences of his vote.
 Indeed, he could create a ''Richard Clarke moment'' for himself by saying something like the following: ''I voted to give my president the authority he needed to unite the world in confronting Iraq. He abused that authority. But I trusted him, and I now share responsibility for the failing situation in Iraq. As president, I will take responsibility for fixing it -- and that, Mr. President, makes one of us.''
 Second, Mr. Kerry must offer a better plan for Iraq than Mr. Bush's. Mr. Kerry has recently set a goal of pulling American troops out of Iraq in four years. That's the right policy. But as presented, it sounds more like a plan for managing failure than for achieving success.
 A better formulation would be along these lines: ''History shows that no nation can win its freedom unless its people are willing to fight for it. The president is undermining the motivation of the Iraqi people by making an open-ended promise that America will fight their battles for them. We made that mistake in Vietnam; we must not make it now. America will equip and train the people of Iraq, but in the end, they are responsible for choosing their own destiny.''
 Third, Mr. Kerry must offer a better plan for fighting Al Qaeda. So far, he has put forth the worthy but rather airy promise that he will work more energetically with America's allies. The vagueness of that pledge only heightens the average voter's suspicions about the effectiveness of international organizations like the United Nations.
 For the argument to work, Mr. Kerry must show that he understands the limits of existing international institutions and present a plan to create a new one. He could say something like this: ''Fifty years ago, at the dawn of the cold war, America led our allies in the creation of a new institution to fight communism. That institution was NATO. While NATO remains vital to our security, the world today faces a new threat, and we need a new institution, a new alliance to fight the war against Al Qaeda and its allies. President Bush should have built that new alliance. He has failed. I will not.''
 John Kerry has begun to make the case that the president's adherence to failed policies shows not strength of character, but weakness. To turn that critique into victory, however, Mr. Kerry is going to have to show some character, too -- by being honest as well as bold.
