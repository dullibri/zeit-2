HEADLINE: Book Fair Buzz Is Not Contained Between 2 Covers

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The book publishing industry is notorious for jumping on bandwagons: witness the flood of ''Da Vinci Code'' knockoffs that clogged tables at the front of bookstores a few years ago, and the stream of novels featuring vampires that are crowding bestseller lists now.
 So it should be no surprise that at BookExpo America, the publishing industry's annual trade convention that ended Sunday in New York, publishers seemed to be putting their own stamps on the increasingly frenzied conversation about electronic books that has hijacked the business. 
 There were the panels: ''Giving It Away: When Free eBooks Make Sense and When They Don't,'' ''Red Hot Readers: Market Adoption of Mobile eReading Devices'' and ''Jumping Off a Cliff: How Publishers Can Succeed Online Where Others Failed.'' Tina Brown, rasping with a bad case of laryngitis, kick-started a discussion with the chief executives of four New York publishing houses by asking if they were shocked when Amazon.com began charging $9.99 for e-books -- ''that paltry, pitiful sum.'' 
 Interead, a British company that introduced its new Cool-er electronic reader the first day of the Expo, sponsored a booth at which two blond women in tankinis handed out nonalcoholic margaritas and more potent pina coladas to a steady stream of conventiongoers who stopped by to watch demonstrations of the new devices. HarperCollins decided mostly to forgo the traditional giveaways of advance paperback editions of forthcoming books, and instead gave out gift cards redeemable for electronic galleys of titles like Neil Gaiman's ''Odd and the Frost Giants'' and Mary Karr's ''Lit.'' 
 So far e-books represent 1 to 3 percent of total book sales. But they make up the fastest growing part of the industry, and publishers, authors and booksellers have no idea just how big they will become and how they might affect profits and reading habits in the future.
 Inevitably there was a backlash. At a panel of authors speaking mainly to independent booksellers, Sherman Alexie, the National Book Award-winning author of ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,'' said he refused to allow his novels to be made available in digital form. He called the expensive reading devices ''elitist'' and declared that when he saw a woman sitting on the plane with a Kindle on his flight to New York, ''I wanted to hit her.''
 Anxiety over digital publishing was heightened by the recession that has dampened book sales, and belt tightening was in evidence throughout the convention. Attendance at the event, which gathers publishers, booksellers, authors, agents, consultants and, increasingly, technology companies, was down by 14 percent from the last time the convention was held at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York two years ago. 
 Robert Sindelar, managing partner of Third Place Books, an independent bookstore in Lake Forest Park, Wash., a suburb of Seattle, said that this year he brought only three people to the convention, as opposed to five in previous years. He said sales were down nearly 5 percent in the first four months of the year, following a 9.5 percent decline in 2008.
 Still, he said he would never consider giving the BookExpo a miss altogether. ''It is good for us to come to remind them as they are seeing those 10 Kindles on the subway on the way to work what value we feel we bring to the industry,'' Mr. Sindelar said.
 It was a bit more difficult for booksellers to find some publishers at the convention this year as several of them had decided not to build their customary large booths on the exhibition hall floor. Some small presses had no visible presence at all, while venerable publishers including Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Macmillan, the company that owns Farrar Straus & Giroux and St. Martin's Press, holed up in bunkerlike rooms in the bowels of the convention center, far from the fray of the exhibition floor.
 Random House, the world's largest consumer publisher, provoked endless chatter about its decision to take a vastly reduced space on the exhibition floor with room for just four autograph signing stands, moving all its meeting space into a windowless room downstairs. 
 But as rival publishers carped that Random House was missing the opportunity to make serendipitous connections with booksellers walking the exhibition floor, a schedule of book signings by authors like Lorrie Moore and Tracy Kidder attracted crowds. Even though Pat Conroy canceled an appearance because of his health, hundreds of people waited in line for an hour to pick up an advance copy of his latest novel, ''South of Broad.''
 Whether all those people were actually going to help sell the book was another question. One of the first three women in line for ''South of Broad,'' an elementary school librarian from Pennsylvania, confessed she was just grabbing a free copy for herself. 
 Some publishers wondered how much value they were getting from the show. It has been a perennial question for a long time but one made more urgent by changing economic times. ''Frankly, standing out there it's like Groundhog Day,'' said David Shanks, chief executive of Penguin Group USA. ''It seems like one B.E.A. after another every year, and you all sort of run into each other.''
 Rick Joyce, marketing director of Perseus Books, said that ''in a weird way, these conventions were like the Internet before the Internet'' in that they enabled networking. The challenge, Mr. Joyce said, was to figure out how BookExpo ''could do something that the industry needs rather than continuing to do something that is better done on the Internet.''
 For Perseus, the answer was a stunt: over 48 hours, the company produced ''Book: The Sequel,'' a collection of first sentences to imagined sequels of famous books submitted online by readers around the world. Editors, designers, production staff and publicists worked in a corner of Perseus's booth wearing baseball jerseys emblazoned with the book's logo. On Saturday the publisher distributed 13 editions, including paperbacks, e-books, audio and even Braille versions. 
 But for many attendees the Expo remained much the same as always: a chance to schmooze and reconnect with contacts throughout the industry, even if some of the parties were more subdued than in years past. 
 And booksellers, a reliably starry-eyed lot, still craved interaction with authors. At a party given by Hachette Book Group on the roof of the Hotel Gansevoort in the meatpacking district, Mary Yockey, a buyer at Anderson's Bookshops in Naperville, Ill., said she was thrilled to meet Julie Powell, author of ''Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen.'' That book has been made into a movie, to be released in August, starring Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. Ms. Powell also has a new book, ''Cleaving: A Story of Marriage, Meat and Obsession,'' coming out later this year. 
 ''I'm going to read the first book again,'' Ms. Yockey said. ''We sold tons of them.'' And she hopes to do it again for the new one.

HEADLINE: Cast Out, But Still Reporting

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR.

 BODY:
Public libraries have become substitute offices for the recently disenfranchised, so it wasn't unusual that 40 bright, talented and unemployed people found themselves in a conference room on a dreary day at the Montclair Public Library last January.
 But they had something else in common: they were all refugees from The Star-Ledger, which had required deep layoffs to stay in business. And while journalism seemed to be done with them, they were not done with journalism. 
 Less than three months later, NewJerseyNewsroom (newjerseynewsroom.com), a Web site owned and operated by journalists, is up and running. Last Friday, the site was topped with an article by Tom Hester, a longtime State House reporter, deconstructing the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court. It upheld Gov. Jon Corzine's decision to upend a 34-year-old formula that pushed the most public school financing to the poorest districts. 
 Sitting last Friday at the same public library where the enterprise was conceived, Mr. Hester, 65, talked with wonder about the ability just to push a button and find an audience, bypassing the editors, printing and trucks that used to convey his work. 
 ''It's amazing,'' he said. ''We just kept updating the story as it went along, and it was there instantly, for everyone to read.''
 And he didn't seem to mind that he was paid exactly nothing for his lifetime of experience and the article. It's a tough time to be a journalist but, hey, it beats working for a living.
 The site went live on April 13 and now counts about 51,000 page views since then. The venture capital for the site all comes in the form of human sweat. The site is incorporated, but the work is voluntary, with the founding members doing journalism for the sheer love of it, and if something of value is created, they will eventually receive a share of the company. (So far, the site hosts a modest number of ads.) 
 They all have business cards that identify them as working journalists, but they paid for them themselves. It's a long shot effort at creating an alternative source of news, although few could argue that the state, which is a virtual Superfund site of corruption, doesn't need it. 
 ''This is a start-up, but we are not doing it without resources,'' said Garrett Morrison, 42, a sports editor who is handling much of the business side. ''We have Tom Hester's experience, his Rolodex, and people are happy to return his calls. There are a lot of people like him.''
 Sitting between them, Matt Romanoski, 43, a guy who says he has trouble getting rid of the blinking programming light on his VCR, explains how he came to serve as Webmaster. 
 ''I bought a book called 'HTML for Dummies' and just started putting it together as best I could,'' he said. Andrew Lagomarsino is in charge of recruiting people to work for nothing, or an occasional hourly fee for particularly difficult technical issues. 
 ''For the price of a good seat to a Yankees home game, we've gotten this site up and running,'' he said. Total cash outlays have been about $300, excluding the price of business cards. 
 It helps that there's a lot of talent at loose ends. Across the country, various bands of journalistic hardies -- newsroom pros whose services are no longer salient to a crippled and disrupted information economy -- have taken matters into their own hands. Several hybrid models have sprung up in San Diego, Minneapolis, Denver and Chicago. 
 Not only is no one getting rich, but also no one has come close to cracking the code on a sustainable business model. Even absent trucks, newsrooms and administrative costs, making the calls and reporting is an arduous, expensive endeavor. 
 ''People are still interested in good content, real stories put together by experienced people,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''Look at Carol Ann Campbell, the health reporter who worked at The Star-Ledger who has been doing stuff for us. She is not the kind of person who should reinvent herself. She is better at what she is doing than almost anyone I can think of.''
 Back in 2007, I used to see Ms. Campbell at our children's bus stop. Montclair, where we both live, is lousy with journalists because it has the kind of houses and schools that midrange professionals can afford (if they have jobs, of course). Back then, we would chat about navigating the increasingly unpredictable shoals of journalism while our kids ran around at the bus stop.
 At the time, Ms. Campbell was doing significant reporting in The Star-Ledger about the infection-ridden environs of hospitals, work that resulted in a law requiring that medical institutions publish their rates of infection. Another piece about the resources being given to patients with little chance of getting better rather than providing hospice or home care also made a big splash. 
 In April 2008, she was named the state's journalist of the year by the New Jersey Press Association. 
 ''Seven months later, I was taking the buyout,'' she recalled on Friday. ''It was a gun-to-your-head buyout and I was really torn. If I had made the decision 24 hours earlier, I might have stayed, but I had to ask myself, 'Is this position going to sustain me until my kids are out of college?''' 
 As the swine flu epidemic unfolded recently, Ms. Campbell did several articles for NewJerseyNewsroom. ''It's a great adventure, an idealistic one, and I'm thrilled to be part of it.'' But the big projects that she received so much notice for require significant resources that are currently beyond the reach of NewJerseyNewsroom.
 ''They are going to need the kind of work that is provocative and interesting, and that takes time and money,'' she said. ''They are sort of in a chicken-and-egg situation.''
 For the time being, she is doing other freelance writing and looking for other work, while kicking in the occasional piece for the site. ''They asked, and how could you not be part of it when they are pouring their heart and soul into it?'' she said, adding, ''NewJerseyNewsroom is a sign of extraordinary optimism from a profession known for its cynicism.''
 Working from her basement office has had its challenges and satisfactions, but she finds herself thinking about what she left behind at The Star-Ledger.
 ''Going in there every day was such a joy -- the wit, the cleverness, the feeling of being together and making something happen every day. A newsroom is a completely magical place,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Complex Math, Simple Sum: 3 Awards in 5 Years

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
What are the odds?
 That's a question the King of Norway asked Srinivasa S. R. Varadhan in 2007 when he was awarded the Abel Prize, widely regarded as the Nobel of mathematics. A professor at New York University, Dr. Varadhan had won for his work in probability theory, becoming the second N.Y.U. professor so honored since the prize was first awarded in 2003.
 ''When I met with the king and queen, he said, 'Since you're a specialist in probabilities, what is the probability that you'll have another prize winner from your institution?' '' Professor Varadhan recalled. ''I said, 'Probably very small,' but I was wrong.''
 Indeed, on May 19 another math professor from N.Y.U., Micha Gromov, traveled to Norway to pick up his Abel, given for what the prize committee called ''his revolutionary contributions to geometry.'' In the process, N.Y.U.'s math department, which has long ranked among the top in the nation, along with those at Princeton, Harvard and Berkeley, has assumed an almost cultlike status. 
 ''It really is phenomenal,'' said Donald E. McClure, executive director of the American Mathematical Society, a leading professional organization of research mathematicians. ''It has the same distinction as a Nobel Prize, and there's no other institution in the United States or in the world that has had such a concentration of these awards.''
 That the field of mathematics was left out of the Nobel lineup has been a source of mystery and, among mathematicians, irritation for more than a century. (There are, after all, Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine.) Some speculate that Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite and who established the prizes, simply wasn't a math guy. Others cite a bit of lore that he harbored a grudge against math because a love interest rejected him in favor of a well-known mathematician.
 Whatever the reason, in 2001 the Norwegian government sought to fill the void, announcing the creation of the Niels Henrik Abel Memorial Fund. Abel was a Norwegian mathematician who died at 26, but whose genius is legend: Professor Gromov likened him to a ''supernova'' in his remarks in Norway.
 Efforts to finance an international Abel prize date all the way back to 1902, on the centennial of Abel's birth, but fizzled with the breakup of the union between Sweden and Norway a few years later. Like the Nobel, the Abel comes with a substantial bounty: 6,000,000 kroner, or about $950,000 at the current exchange rate. 
 Dr. Gromov said he was not sure how he would spend the money. ''I haven't thought about that yet,'' he said. ''I haven't had time.'' 
 The three N.Y.U. recipients are faculty members in the university's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Two of them, Peter D. Lax, who won the Abel in 2005, and Professor Varadhan, are lifers, having taught and conducted research at N.Y.U. since the middle of the last century. Dr. Lax, a professor emeritus who, at 83, is retired from teaching, earned both his B.A. and Ph.D. from N.Y.U. in the 1940s.
 Born near St. Petersburg, Russia, which was Leningrad at the time, Dr. Gromov was a more recent hire, arriving in 1996 from the University of Maryland. He divides his time between N.Y.U., where he teaches in the spring, and the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in France, where he is based in the fall.
 The citation from the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, which administers the prize, called Dr. Gromov, 65, ''one of the leading mathematicians of our time.'' It went on to say that his name was ''forever attached to deep results and important concepts within Riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry, string theory and group theory.''
 He insists that N.Y.U.'s triple Abel victory is the result of careful recruiting. ''That's not a coincidence,'' he said. ''It was the policy of the administration of the university and specifically the institute, which was making right guesses. You have to make these choices judiciously.''
 Until several years before Dr. Gromov's arrival at N.Y.U., the department was known more for its research in pure mathematics and differential equations than in geometry, he said. It was Dr. Lax who helped put N.Y.U. in the vanguard of such research, according to his Abel Prize citation, with ''groundbreaking contributions to the theory and application of partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions.''
 Dr. Lax, who was born in Hungary, fled to the United States with his family after Hitler's rise to power. His undergraduate education at N.Y.U. was interrupted in 1944 when he was drafted into the Army. The government quickly realized his mathematical prowess, and the following year, at age 19, Dr. Lax found himself in Los Alamos, N.M., working on the secret Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. ''It was like living science fiction,'' he said.
 A longtime Upper West Side resident, Dr. Lax is still busy with research. ''I'm struggling with some quite interesting problems,'' he said with more than a little understatement, nodding toward a chalkboard in his office that was a jumble of numbers and symbols.
 While toiling in the same 13-story building off Washington Square Park, the three Abel winners cross paths only occasionally. ''Our fields are rather separate, but whenever I have a question about probability I go to Varadhan,'' Dr. Lax said. 
 Dr. Varadhan, 69, was born in Chennai, India. After moving to New York in 1963 for a postdoctoral fellowship at N.Y.U., he quickly made Greenwich Village home. He and his wife have lived in the same university-owned building since 1966.
 The Abel Prize committee hailed Dr. Varadhan for his ''fundamental contributions to probability theory and in particular for creating a unified theory of large deviations.'' It said the subject has ''concrete applications to fields as diverse as physics, biology, economics, statistics, computer science and engineering.''
 Sitting in his sun-filled office, Dr. Varadhan was happy to translate. ''Large deviations deals with the probability of rare events -- how likely or unlikely something will happen,'' he said. ''I started on that when I came here in 1963 and I'm still doing it, so it's gradual progress, not one moment.'' 
 Like his colleagues, Dr. Varadhan developed a passion for math at a young age. ''We had a very good math teacher in high school who instilled in us the idea that math didn't have to be work,'' he remembered. ''You could do it for fun.''

HEADLINE: After Many Stumbles, the Fall of an American Giant

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
It is a company that helped lift hundreds of thousands of American workers into the middle class. It transformed Detroit into the Silicon Valley of its day, a symbol of America's talent for innovation. It built celebrated cars, like Cadillacs, that became synonymous with luxury. 
 And now it is filing for bankruptcy, something that would have been unfathomable even a few years ago, much less decades ago, when it was a dominant force in the American economy.
 Rarely has a company fallen so far and so fast as General Motors. And while its bankruptcy appeared increasingly likely in recent weeks, the arrival of the moment is still a staggering blow, particularly for anyone with ties to the company. 
 ''I never ever could have believed that one day this thing would go that way,'' said Jim Wangers, a retired G.M. executive who was part of the team that developed the Pontiac GTO, and the author of ''Glory Days,'' about Pontiac's heyday in the muscle-car era of the 1960s. ''We were so successful,'' he added. 
 Founded in 1908, G.M. ruled the car industry for more than half a century, with a broad range of vehicles, reflecting the company's promise to offer ''a car for every purse and purpose.'' 
 The expression ''What's good for General Motors is good for the country'' entered the lexicon, even though it was a slight misquotation of Charles E. Wilson, G.M.'s president in the early 1950s. 
 But then G.M. began a long and slow process of undermining itself. Its strengths, like the rigid structure that provided discipline early on, became weaknesses, and it lost its feel for reading the American car market it helped create, as Japanese automakers lured away even its most loyal buyers.
 Only eight months ago, Rick Wagoner, then its chief executive, stood before hundreds of G.M. employees to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary. ''We're a company that's ready to lead for 100 years to come,'' Mr. Wagoner said. 
 Instead of leading, G.M. will instead be following other failed companies on a well-worn path into bankruptcy court. 
 The moment will reverberate beyond G.M.'s epicenter in Detroit, to factory towns in other parts of Michigan and in states like Indiana, Tennessee and Louisiana. It will even be felt on Fifth Avenue in New York, where it built its financial headquarters, and Epcot at Walt Disney World in Florida, where G.M. sponsors the Test Track Pavilion, a showcase of its latest cars. 
 G.M. factories churned out family cars, pickup trucks and memorable muscle cars with taut, sculptured body panels that were rolling displays of American DNA. 
 A G.M. plant was a ticket to prosperity for the communities lucky enough to land one. G.M. literally put Spring Hill, Tenn., on the map when it picked the town outside Nashville for its Saturn plant in 1985, prompting the hamlet to swell with new homes, motels and restaurants. 
 Now city officials around the country, including those in Spring Hill, nervously await phone calls on Monday to tell them if their plants will be among the 14 G.M. is expected to announce it will close in the latest round of cuts. 
 But even after its deep cuts, G.M. can still claim to be the country's largest automaker. 
 For G.M., that simple fact -- its sheer size -- was long used as a trump card to end debates. If the critics were so right about all that was wrong with G.M., why did so many people buy its cars?
 The company did have vast numbers of loyal buyers, but G.M. lost them through a series of strategic and cultural missteps starting in the 1960s. 
 It bungled efforts in the 1980s to cut costs by sharing the underpinnings of its cars across different brands, blurring their distinctiveness. 
 G.M. gave in to union demands in 1990 and created a program that paid workers even when plants were not running, forcing it to build cars and trucks it could not sell without big incentives. 
 Its finance staff argued with product developers and marketers who pushed for aggressive spending on new cars and trucks. But forced to feed so many brands, G.M. often resorted to a practice called ''launch and leave'' -- spending billions upfront to bring vehicles to market, but then failing to keep supporting them with sustained advertising. 
 With its market share shrinking, G.M. could not give its multiple brands and car models the individual attention that helped Honda attract customers to the Accord and Toyota to its Camry. 
 It also lost interest in vehicles that needed time to find their audience, as happened when the company introduced the EV1 electric vehicle and then dropped it in 1999 after only three years. 
 Now G.M.'s brand lineup is being halved, with the company jettisoning divisions like Pontiac. 
 ''Nobody gave any respect to this thing called image because it wasn't in the business plan,'' Mr. Wangers said. ''It was all about, 'When is this going to earn a profit?' '' 
 Over the years, G.M. executives became practiced at the art of explaining their problems, attributing blame to everyone but themselves. 
 That list included the United Automobile Workers, for demanding health care coverage and pensions (even though G.M. agreed to provide them); government regulators, for imposing rules that G.M. said hampered its competitiveness; the Japanese government, for unfairly helping its own carmakers break into the United States market; and the news media, for failing to appreciate G.M. vehicles and the strides the company was making to improve them. 
 Asked in 1995 why he had not moved faster to reorganize the company, the late G.M. chief executive Roger Smith replied, ''Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have flipped a switch?'' 
 Even last week, G.M.'s newly retired vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, said the automaker had experienced a ''world of hurt, much of it not of our own doing.'' 
 Sloganeering was not backed up by execution. Executives wore lapel pins, for example, in 2002, with the number ''29'' -- referring to the market share the company vowed to regain (most companies focus on profits). Through April of this year, its share was 19 percent, a steep drop from its peak of 54 percent in 1954. 
 Consumers started blaming G.M. for sub-par vehicles. They may have given them second and third chances, but many eventually started switching to other brands, which will make it that much harder for G.M. to win them back. 
 Mr. Wagoner was able to hold on to his job for longer than people expected, as G.M.'s stock fell steadily from about $70 when he took charge at the start of the decade. It closed at 75 cents a share on Friday. 
 Mr. Wagoner was pushed out by the Obama administration, which is now making the call to push the company into bankruptcy court. 
 A judge will then start the process of building a new, though much diminished, G.M. into a company that might have a shot at a second century. But the automaker that so dominated center stage in the American car market for so long will have to earn that place back.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Do Hard Times
 Alter Spirituality?
 The recession's toll on your material life is plain enough. But what about the impact on stuff that has no bottom line? 
 In her book ''A History of God,'' Karen Armstrong, the British historian, wrote that all religion ''starts with the perception that something is wrong.''
 A lot of people have the feeling something is wrong, all right. But is that making us hungrier for life's deeper meaning -- or drawing us to meditation, kirtan chanting or our local church or temple?
 The reports on church attendance since the beginning of the recession have been all over the map. I wrote an article on that topic in December that led to a lively debate between the Gallup poll people and the researcher whose study was featured in my report.
 But church attendance aside, how has the recession affected your religious, spiritual or philosophical approach to life? PAUL VITELLO

HEADLINE: Slumping Economy Puts Test To an Aid System Tied to Jobs

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, Americans have built a safety net that is tough on those who fail to work and rewards those who do.
 Insisting that the poor should work and agreeing that work should pay, policy makers spent the 1990s cutting welfare rolls while pouring billions of dollars into programs like wage and child care subsidies aimed at the working poor.
 But joblessness, not welfare dependency, is now the national scourge. And as a poverty conference convened here last week, custodians of the safety net confronted an obvious question: If aid is reserved for people with jobs, what happens when the jobs go away? 
 ''We have a work-based safety net without work,'' said Timothy M. Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin. ''We're really in a pickle.''
 The economic crisis is the toughest test yet of a safety net refashioned 13 years ago when President Bill Clinton kept a pledge to ''end welfare as we know it'' and joined a Republican-led Congress in sharply restricting cash aid. In the boom years that followed, millions of people left welfare for work and poverty rates plunged, though skeptics warned that needy families would be left with nothing when the economy faltered.
 Few people thought the faltering would prove so swift and severe. Within weeks of taking office, President Obama had signed off on measures to spend more than $100 billion to shore up the safety net. 
 Some of the money goes to programs reserved for people who work (like unemployment insurance and wage subsidies). Even more bolsters programs that include the nonworking poor (like food stamps and Medicaid).
 While that might suggest a desire for a broader safety net than the one that has emerged in recent years, aides say the package was as much an effort to jump-start the economy as an expression of aid philosophy.
 ''We're not at the moment narrowly focused on, Is there a work-based safety net?'' said Martha Coven, a White House official who spoke at the poverty conference. ''We're focused on, Is there work?''
 A crisis this large would challenge any safety net. Nearly 14 million Americans are unemployed, and more than 100,000 people join their ranks each week. Eight states have double-digit unemployment rates; California and Michigan have counties where the rate reaches Depression-era levels of 25 percent.
 Still, the challenges seem especially stark when set against the assumption on which the modern safety net was built: that low-wage jobs, however onerous, were at least easy to get. Urging the needy to take them, policy makers expanded wage subsidies (which now top $5,000 a year in some states), while putting time limits on cash benefits, cutting access to training and giving states wide discretion to turn aid-seekers away.
 The new welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, also gave states financial incentives to cut the rolls, and critics warned that the program would fail to grow in tough times to meet rising need. Now millions of jobs have disappeared, and caseloads have scarcely budged. 
 In many places they have continued to fall, including Mr. Obama's home state, Illinois, which trimmed the rolls 8 percent last year as joblessness surged. Nationally, the rolls are down about 70 percent from the 1990s highs.
 To encourage states to expand the welfare rolls, the recovery package Mr. Obama signed includes $5 billion of subsidies for programs with caseload growth.
 Another essential safety net program, unemployment insurance, reaches just 44 percent of the unemployed, with the lowest-paid workers most often left out. The recovery package offers $7 billion for states that broaden coverage, though several Republican governors have spurned it, saying the costs would lead to higher business taxes.
 The program that responded most readily to the recession, food stamps, has done so in large part because it serves the working poor and jobless alike. In the 12 months ending this February, the rolls grew 17 percent. One in 9 Americans now gets food stamps, and the recovery package temporarily raised the average benefit about 19 percent, to about $500 a month for a family of four.
 All in all, ''that's a remarkable boost to the safety net, and it's all been under the radar,'' said Sheldon H. Danziger, a University of Michigan economist who spoke at last week's gathering of researchers, advocates and government officials.
 Much of the recovery act spending expires in two years. What happens then?
 No one envisions a return to the time of unconditional aid. Even critics of the tougher welfare system credit it for raising employment rates; and poverty, though on the rise, is lower than in the early 1990s.
 ''It worked better than, I think, a lot of people anticipated,'' Mr. Obama said at a campaign event last year. ''One of the things that I am absolutely convinced of is that we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy.''
 But progress had stalled even before the recession began, and two sets of problems had emerged. One is that the neediest people -- the addicted, disabled or mentally ill -- often fell through the cracks, finding neither welfare nor work. Another is that most low-wage workers were failing to advance. 
 Last week's conference was filled with calls to knit more training opportunities into the safety net, a theme Mr. Obama often repeats. Still, as the conferees recognized, past training programs have often failed. 
 Beyond the recession, several big poverty challenges remain. Wage inequality has continued to rise. So has the share of children born to unmarried mothers, which increases their odds of growing up poor. 
 And huge deficits have made the long-term budget outlook bleak, as Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warned fellow conferees in Washington. Even as the meeting got under way, California was mulling its governor's cost-saving plan to outright abolish programs of cash welfare and children's health insurance.
 Mr. Greenstein called for scrapping marginal programs to save the most essential.
 ''A budget tsunami is coming,'' he said. ''That threat should be taken a hell of a lot more seriously than it is now.''

HEADLINE: Expecting New Tax, Firm Prepares to Track Carbon

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
If Congress passes legislation that puts a price on carbon emissions, companies will need to track and report the waste from their operations. 
 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, is betting that such a cap-and-trade law or carbon tax will open the door for a new kind of software company. 
 Since 2007, it has been quietly incubating Hara, a start-up that on Monday will start selling software to help businesses measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. 
 ''This is not 'greenwash.' It's dollars to the bottom line,'' said John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, which invested $6 million in Hara. 
 Mr. Doerr, who has been a strong advocate for legislation that puts a price on carbon, says software like Hara's will be vital to making it work. ''We can pass all the laws we want, but if we don't track, manage, verify and achieve the goals, we're going to be lost, and we're only going to be doing that with information technology,'' he said. 
 Amit Chatterjee, the founder and chief executive of Hara, says the name comes from the Sanskrit for ''green.'' He previously ran a group at SAP, the software giant, that helps businesses navigate accounting regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 When Mr. Chatterjee thought about the next set of regulations for which businesses would need compliance software, he came up with greenhouse gas emissions. 
 ''A post-carbon economy is arriving in this decade,'' he said. ''This creates an environmental record for your company.'' 
 Hara's Web-based software tracks the resources used by the company, like electricity and water, and emissions like carbon and other waste. 
 The software then forecasts future emissions and helps a company choose ways to reduce them, like new lights or a different type of refrigerator. It tracks its progress and creates an audit trail. 
 Most companies are flooded with such proposals but baffled by which to choose, Mr. Chatterjee said. ''Everyone has a pile and all will do good, but the moment you put them into a Hara business case scenario, most of them fall by the wayside,'' he said. 
 Most companies that track their greenhouse gas emissions do so with spreadsheets; Mr. Chatterjee said Hara's biggest competitor is Microsoft Excel. But that gets complicated quickly, especially for companies with operations scattered across the world, and would not hold up in an audit when carbon becomes a commodity. 
 The Coca-Cola Company has been using Hara's software as part of a pilot project to track greenhouse gas emissions for its 1,000 facilities worldwide. It helps Coca-Cola keep track of projects that vary by country. In South Africa, for example, Coca-Cola is switching from heavy crude oil to natural gas. In the United States, where plants have not been using heavy oil, the company has been updating its lighting systems.

HEADLINE: A Town Fights to Save An Oasis Of Baguettes

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: COLEBROOK, N.H. 

 BODY:
 A French couple came to town several years ago in search of something. Here, amid the swelling mountains and struggling businesses, the Red Sox hagiography and Yankee taciturnity, they were looking for just the right place to sell madeleines.
 And croissants. And tarts. And long, thin loaves of French bread that all but dare you to tear at their heel before you're out the door.
 The couple converted a run-down building near an abandoned gas station into Le Rendez-Vous, a cozy bakery whose blend of bread, coffee and conversation soon charmed this rural community. After a while it seemed that the owner, Verlaine Daeron, and her partner and baker, Marc Ounis, had always been here, and always would be.
 That is, until several weeks ago, when a telephone's ring interrupted Mr. Ounis's daily ritual of baking before daylight. It was Ms. Daeron, in tears, calling from Paris to say her application to renew her E-2 investor visa -- for foreign investors and business owners -- had been denied because her bakery had been determined to be ''marginal.'' 
 As in the State Department stipulation that an investment by a foreign national seeking an E-2 visa ''may not be marginal.'' In addition: ''It must have the capacity to generate significantly more income than just to provide a living to the investor and family, or it must have a significant economic impact in the United States.''
 Mr. Ounis, by now an American citizen, saw no choice. He sadly announced plans to close the bakery and leave for France once the last of a month's worth of flour was gone, prompting outraged customers to begin the often-maddening task of parsing the language of government. 
 In the context of a remote county of 33,000 in northern New Hampshire, where timber and paper are down and the next big thing has yet to reveal itself, what does ''marginal'' mean? What does ''significant economic impact'' mean? 
 The State Department presumably based its decision on the modest financial statements Ms. Daeron submitted with her visa application. But two spokesmen for the department declined to comment, saying they could not discuss individual cases. Clearly, though, whoever denied Ms. Daeron's visa did not understand what madeleines meant to that part of the United States called Colebrook.
 This low-flame matter of international intrigue began in 2000, when the French couple came upon Colebrook while searching New England for a place to open a bakery. The Chamber of Commerce referred them to a French-speaking man named Benoit Lamontagne, who also happened to be the owner of the local Radio Shack, a town official and the champion for economic development in an area that needs it. He immediately saw opportunity.
 Before day's end, Mr. Lamontagne had found the visitors an apartment, some furniture and even a television, courtesy of his Radio Shack. They were also given a heads-up about the town's plans to auction off the old bank building, a historic but dilapidated structure recently seized for back taxes.
 Ms. Daeron won the bid with an offer of about $50,000, covered the windows with paper and began a yearlong renovation. Some people wondered what these outsiders were up to; for one thing, they were upsetting the drab Main Street color scheme of white, gray and white-gray by painting their building's exterior a joyous golden yellow with a trim of -- maroon?
 ''It is burgundy,'' Mr. Ounis says. ''Burgundy.''
 When Le Rendez-Vous finally opened in late 2001, Colebrook swooned. The elegant restoration, the classical music, the enticing smells and, especially, the baked goods -- it was all so civilized, so right, in part because the couple wisely left out one ingredient: that sprinkling of judgment often added by people new to the region.
 ''Old Yankees don't like to be told what to do and how to do it,'' Mr. Lamontagne says. ''Boy, that's the kiss of death.''
 Instead, he says, the couple accepted Colebrook for what it was: a community of loggers and farmers and artisans and people working two and three jobs to get by. And Colebrook accepted them for who they said they were: transplants who had given up medical careers in Paris to make bread someplace where the air was fresh. 
 Mr. Ounis, 62, would rise at 2 in the morning to bake bread in silent solitude, no radio, no television. He would not have his coffee until Ms. Daeron, 51, descended from their apartment upstairs around 7:30. They would savor this time. Then he would return to the ovens, and she would open the door.
 The bakery became an arts center, a community hangout, an economic engine, a source of pride featured in guidebooks. Once known as the ''potato capital'' of New Hampshire, the town could now add to its boasting this old-world oasis -- ''Not something you'd expect in Colebrook,'' says George Bald, a customer and the state's commissioner of resources and economic development.
 So when the State Department denied Ms. Daeron's visa, it became personal, for a couple, a town, a region. 
 While Mr. Ounis baked bread and shyly worked the counter -- usually the domain of the more outgoing Ms. Daeron -- Colebrook made some noise. Thousands of people signed petitions, while hundreds more, including Mr. Bald, sent letters to every official they could think of, from Washington to Paris.
 The letters, typewritten and handwritten, all but demanded reconsideration. Many complained that a lot of businesses in the north country might be considered ''marginal'' by State Department standards; that a paper mill in Groveton closed not too long ago; that a small restaurant beside Le Rendez-Vous shut down this past winter. That everything is relative.
 ''Colebrook and this region of New Hampshire don't fit neatly into the bureaucratic formulas created by officials apparently removed from real life circumstances,'' Jayne Lytle, of North Stratford, wrote to Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Le Rendez-Vous, Ms. Lytle wrote, is a tourist draw, a good neighbor -- ''an integral part of the economy.''
 Perhaps Jack and Sandra Riendeau put it best in their letter to Ms. Shaheen. Of Ms. Daeron and Mr. Ounis, they wrote, ''We want them here where they belong.''
 Days passed, then weeks. Elected officials made their calls while Mr. Ounis made his bread, the supply of flour dwindling like hourglass sand. Ms. Daeron telephoned from her mother's home in Paris three, four, five times a day, asking about developments.
 Then she called to say she had been instructed to appear for an interview at 9:15 on the morning of May 19 at the following address: Ambassade des Etats-Unis d'Amerique, Service des Visas d'investisseurs; 4, avenue Gabriel, Paris. Her case, it seemed, was being reconsidered.
 At 6 that morning, New Hampshire time, Ms. Daeron called Mr. Ounis at the bakery, excited: Her visa had been renewed. In notifying her, she said, the embassy official explained how struck he was by the sense of community reflected in all those letters; how much it reminded him of his hometown back in Wisconsin.
 That day Mr. Ounis told everyone who walked through the door. And Ms. Daeron made another telephone call from Paris, this time to order more flour.

HEADLINE: Newspaper for Dogs Has Bite, if Not Taste

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
They say that the newspaper business is going to the dogs. A campaign for a new product has been making that sentiment come true, with humorous results.
 The campaign is for a line of dog food from Mars Petcare U.S., a division of the giant marketer, Mars. The line is called Cesar Sunrise, part of the Cesar brand of offerings for small dogs, and it is being billed as ''the first-ever gourmet canine cuisine breakfast.''
 Yes, it has come to this: dividing dog-feeding occasions into day parts and designating the morning meal as requiring something special for Spot. It is, no doubt, just the kind of innovative get-up-and-go that will help pull us out the Great Recession.
 Kidding aside, marketers often refer to new products as providing ''news'' for consumers, assisting a brand to stand out in a crowded category. Mars Petcare U.S. and its agency, the BBDO West division of BBDO Worldwide, have taken that literally, by creating a make-believe newspaper to chronicle the arrival of Cesar Sunrise. 
 The newspaper, an eight-page broadsheet, carries the fanciful name of The West Highland Herald. There is an accompanying Web site as well, from which a PDF version of the paper may be downloaded.
 An estimated 306,000 copies of the print edition of The Herald were distributed in a promotion that took place in eight major markets, including Atlanta, Chicago and Miami.
 In two of those markets -- New York and San Francisco -- the free (fake) paper was accompanied by free (real) cups of coffee.
 The jest behind the paper is that it was reported and edited by dogs for dogs. From the weather forecast (''It's going to rain men and women'') to the classified ads (''For sale: Used stick. Hardly chewed. Has most of its original bark''), The Herald is completely canine-centric.
 After all, if they say ''Dog bites man is not news; man bites dog is news,'' how newsworthy must it be when ''dog writes newspaper''?
 The mock newspaper is a time-honored tactic in advertising, but it would not be surprising if the decline of the newspaper industry led to fewer marketers undertaking such efforts. 
 That has not happened, at least not yet. In addition to The Herald from Mars Petcare U.S., the HBO division of Time Warner plans to publish a parody of the giveaway tabloid AM New York. The spoof, reported by AdAge.com, will promote the coming second season of the series ''True Blood.''
 Or, as a man asks as his dog brings him the paper in a cartoon in the June 8-15 issue of The New Yorker magazine, ''Yes, we still love print, don't we?''
 The campaign for Cesar Sunrise includes, in addition to The Herald, television commercials, magazine ads, coupon inserts and content on the cesar.com Web site. The campaign carries the theme ''Wake up to something special,'' along with the slogan for the Cesar brand, ''Love them back.''
 It may seem risky to bring out a breakfast food for dogs during a severe economic downturn, but that has not proven to be the case, says Anne Herrington, marketing director for Mars Petcare U.S. in Franklin, Tenn.
 ''We've had some really strong results'' since Cesar Sunrise was brought out in late March, Ms. Herrington says. ''It is such a perfect extension of the core brand.''
 Over all, ''our core consumers have stayed quite strong,'' she adds, reflecting that ''Cesar's loyalty rate is the highest in the category.''
 Assisting Cesar's sales performance is the fact the brand is perceived as an ''affordable luxury,'' Ms. Herrington says, because ''in most parts of the country it's under a dollar per unit.''
 Cesar Sunrise is ''another opportunity to increase purchase frequency,'' she adds.
 The idea for the new product grew from Cesar's brand DNA as ''gourmet food for the small dog you adore,'' Ms. Herrington says, and the new line ''leverages the strength of the connection consumers have with their small dogs.''
 ''Most of our line is meat-based, acknowledging the humanization trend,'' she adds, referring to the increasing predilection for dog owners to feed their pets the types of food they themselves eat. The Cesar varieties include pork tenderloin, grilled chicken, turkey and filet mignon.
 But ''you don't want to eat filet mignon for breakfast,'' Ms. Herrington says, hence the concept to develop varieties that would be ''customized for the breakfast occasion.''
 The three flavors of Cesar Sunrise are smoked bacon and egg; chicken and cheddar cheese souffle; and grilled steak and eggs.
 Is it any reason that the expression ''It's a dog's life'' is changing from one that means how hard things are to one that means to have it easy?
 The belief that dogs, like their owners, ought to have special food in the morning came from a study conducted by BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, about behaviors that become daily rituals -- for humans, not pets.
 ''We learned a lot about breakfast rituals'' from the study, says Jim Lesser, executive creative director at BBDO West, based in San Francisco, primarily that ''people are on autopilot and you have to shake them awake, no pun intended, to get them to change behavior.''
 The make-believe newspaper, along with the coffee giveaways, were ''to really plug the brand into the morning ritual in exciting ways,'' he adds, so that Cesar Sunrise would seem as much a part of breakfast as French toast, oatmeal or pancakes (for humans, that is).
 As part of that strategy, some ads are being scheduled to appear during ''morning media,'' Mr. Lesser says. So, for instance, the television commercials run only in early day parts.
 And The Herald was, of course, a morning newspaper, distributed to commuters and passers-by early in the work day. The parody paper was very low-key in its peddling, limiting references to Cesar Sunrise to ads on inside pages.
 The ads, which are doubling as the print campaign that is running in magazines, show small dogs mimicking the morning behavior of humans. In one ad, a dog is yawning with its eyes practically closed.
 In another ad, the fur atop a dog's head is askew, as if it was suffering from a bad case of bed head.
 Mixed in with the real ads in The Herald are hilarious fake ads for products like a fragrance named Heat (''Bring out the animal in him''); a canine lawyer, Merv the ''legal beagle''; and a language course called Rosetta Bone, for dogs that want to ''bark in a different language.''
 Then there are the classified ads, which take up only a small part of a page of The Herald -- just like in an actual newspaper. (Are dogs using Craigslist, too?)
 In addition to the for-sale ad for the used stick, there are classifieds seeking a lost human (''Responds to 'Knuckles' ''), romance (''Are you my Tramp?'') and canines that want jobs like junkyard dog (''Must provide own chain'') and start-up mascot (''Hip Internet software company seeks dog to lie around on poured concrete floors to give office casual air'').
 The dog paper has many other features that are staples of papers for humans. There is a daily horoscope, a fashion and life style page, sports news, a crossword puzzle and even a Op-Ed page with articles carrying headlines like ''Sorry Big Dogs, Small Is Way Better'' and ''Begging: Is It Always Beneath You?''
 There are also articles that mock the conventions of real journalism. Some report court news (''Catnip Pyramid Scheme Sends Pooch to Pound''). Some report medical news (''Chasing Tail Okay, Vets Say''). And some are breathy bearers of scandal (''Pics of Dog Show Winner Drinking From Toilet Posted on Web'').
 ''It was a tremendous amount of work to write all that content,'' Mr. Lesser says, ''but it was really worth it.''
 The laughs continue from the print edition of The Herald to the Internet. Careful readers of the article about the dog-show winner caught ''bleary-eyed with a rabid gleam as she dives snout-first into the toilet of an unidentified human'' will notice a reference to a Web site called chokingbone.com.
 On that site, part of the Cesar Sunrise campaign, are photographs of additional imaginary canine scandals bearing sensational write-ups worthy of tmz.com or perezhilton.com.
 Among them are photos of ''once glamorous Chou-Chou LaRue caught ungroomed'' and ''a disoriented and disorderly Rex Ruff found rummaging through neighbor's garbage.''
 The funniest item may be a report about ''notorious French bulldog-about-town Rowdy,'' spotted outside a Kabbalah Center wearing a yarmulke.
 ''When questioned about his new faith, Rowdy barked, 'Until Kabbalah, my life was just about the next bone -- but now I want something more,' '' the item reads. ''Is our little mutt becoming a mensch?''
 Hmmmm. Perhaps the next flavor of Cesar Sunrise will be smoked salmon with a schmear.

HEADLINE: Even in Crisis, Banks Dig In For Battle Against Regulation

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.

 BODY:
As the financial crisis entered one of its darkest phases in October, a handful of the nation's largest banks began holding daily telephone sessions. Murmurs were already emanating from Washington about the need for a wide-ranging regulatory overhaul, and Wall Street executives girded for a fight. 
 Atop the agenda during their calls: how to counter an expected attempt to rein in credit-default swaps and other derivatives -- the sophisticated and profitable financial instruments that were intended to limit risk but instead had helped take the economy to the brink of disaster.
 The nine biggest participants in the derivatives market -- including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America -- created a lobbying organization, the CDS Dealers Consortium, on Nov. 13, a month after five of its members accepted federal bailout money. 
 To oversee the consortium's push, lobbying records show, the banks hired a longtime Washington power broker who previously helped fend off derivatives regulation: Edward J. Rosen, a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. A confidential memo Mr. Rosen drafted and shared with the Treasury Department and leaders on Capitol Hill has, politicians and market participants say, played a pivotal role in shaping the debate over derivatives regulation.
 Today, just as the bankers anticipated, a battle over derivatives has been joined, in what promises to be a replay of a confrontation in Washington that Wall Street won a decade ago. Since then, derivatives trading has become one of the most profitable businesses for the nation's big banks.
 The looming fight over regulation is the beginning of a broader debate over the future of the financial industry. At the center of the argument: What is the right amount of regulation? 
 Those who favor more regulation say it would offer early warning signals when companies take on too much risk and would help avert catastrophic surprises like the huge derivatives losses at the giant insurer the American International Group, which has so far received more than $170 billion in taxpayer commitments. The banks say too much regulation will stifle financial innovation and economic growth. 
 The debate about where derivatives will trade speaks to core concerns about the products: transparency and disclosure.
 There are two distinct camps in this argument. One camp, which includes legislative leaders, is pushing for trading on an open exchange -- much like stocks -- where value and structure are visible and easily determined. Another camp, led by the banks, prefers that some of the products be traded in privately managed clearinghouses, with less disclosure.
 The Obama administration agrees that more regulation is needed. A proposal unveiled recently by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner won plaudits for trying to make derivatives trading less freewheeling and more accountable -- a plan that hinges in part on using clearinghouses for the trades. 
 Critics in both the financial world and Congress say relying on clearinghouses would be problematic. They also say Mr. Geithner's plan contains a major loophole, because little disclosure would be required for more complicated derivatives, like the type of customized, credit-default swaps that helped bring down A.I.G. A.I.G. sold insurance related to mortgage securities, essentially making a big bet that those mortgages would not default.
 Mr. Rosen and other bank lobbyists have pushed on Capitol Hill to keep so-called customized swaps from being traded more openly. These are contracts written for the specific needs of a customer, whose one-of-a-kind nature makes them very hard to value or trade. Mr. Rosen has also argued that dealers should be able to trade through venues closely affiliated with banks rather than through more independent platforms like exchanges.
 Mr. Rosen's confidential memo, dated Feb. 10 and obtained by The New York Times, recommended that the biggest participants in the derivatives market should continue to be overseen by the Federal Reserve Board. Critics say the Fed has been an overly friendly regulator, which is why big banks favor it.
 Mr. Rosen's proposal for change was similar to the Treasury Department's recently announced plan to increase oversight. Treasury officials say that their proposal was arrived at independently and that they sought input from dozens of sources. 
 Even so, market participants, analysts and members of Congress who have proposed stricter reforms worry that the Treasury proposal does not go far enough to close several important regulatory gaps that allowed derivatives to play such a destructive role in the current financial crisis.
 But increased transparency of derivatives trades would cut into banks' profits -- hence the banks' opposition. Customers who trade derivatives would pay less if they knew what the prevailing market prices were. 
 ''The banks want to go back to business as usual -- and then some. And they have a lot of audacity now that everyone has bailed them out,'' said Yra Harris, an independent commodities trader who was involved in an effort to regulate derivatives nine years ago. ''But we have to begin with the premise that Wall Street doesn't want transparency, because more transparency means less immediate profits.''
 Legislators in the Senate and the House of Representatives have introduced bills offering stricter controls than those pushed a decade ago. The pending legislation goes even further than Mr. Geithner's proposals.
 ''These mathematical geniuses who create these things can find a way to turn anything into a customized swap,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, who has introduced legislation that would require all derivatives to be traded on an exchange. ''You'd get a loophole big enough to drive a truck through. It could be worth trillions and trillions of swaps.''
 Lessons From History
 Hotly contested legislative wars are traditional fare in Washington, of course, and bills are often shaped by the push and pull of lobbyists -- representing a cornucopia of special interests -- working with politicians and government agencies.
 What makes this fight different, say Wall Street critics and legislative leaders, is that financiers are aggressively seeking to fend off regulation of the very products and practices that directly contributed to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In contrast, after the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980s, the clout of the financial lobby diminished significantly.
 The current battle mirrors a tug-of-war a decade ago. Arguing that regulation would hamper financial innovation and send American jobs overseas, Congress passed legislation in December 2000 exempting derivatives from most oversight. It was signed by President Bill Clinton.
 The law passed despite the strenuous objections of Brooksley Born, a former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who left the government after her unsuccessful effort to impose more regulation. In a recent speech, Ms. Born said big banks are again trying to water down oversight efforts. 
 ''Special interests in the financial-services industry are beginning to advocate a return to business as usual and to argue against any need for serious reform,'' Ms. Born, now a lawyer in private practice, said at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, where she received a Profile in Courage Award.
 After the 2000 legislation was passed, derivatives trading exploded, helping the biggest traders earn immense profits. 
 The market now represents transactions with a face value of $600 trillion, up from $88 trillion a decade ago. JPMorgan, the largest dealer of over-the-counter derivatives, earned $5 billion trading them in 2008, according to Reuters, making them one of its most profitable businesses.
 Among the companies that expanded rapidly was A.I.G. Straying from its main business of providing property and life insurance, A.I.G. wrote a type of contract known as credit-default swaps that protected holders of mortgage securities against defaults. When millions of subprime borrowers stopped paying their mortgages, A.I.G. had to provide cash collateral that it did not have to clients that had bought its insurance.
 Before the crisis, few market participants knew the size of A.I.G.'s exposure. Some derivatives transactions occur on exchanges, where the value and nature of the contracts are disclosed, but many do not. Credit-default swaps trade privately. This kept risk in these trades under wraps, leaving regulators unaware of how dangerously stretched and poorly managed the market was.
 Where to Trade
 On Capitol Hill, banking lobbyists have argued that derivatives should be traded on clearinghouses rather than exchanges, legislative leaders and their staffs say. The Geithner plan favors clearinghouses, where an intermediary would guarantee trades between participants, instead of participants dealing directly with one another as in an exchange. 
 A major New York clearinghouse is ICE U.S. Trust, an entity closely affiliated with banks that are also members of Mr. Rosen's group, the CDS Consortium.
 Although the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a more established place for derivatives trading and is independent from the big New York banks, ICE seems to be the clearinghouse of choice, especially among policy makers in Washington, said Brad Hintz, a brokerage firm analyst at Bernstein Research. That is because under the Treasury proposal, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would oversee ICE, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would oversee the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Critics say the Fed has been too easy on those it oversees.
 Theo Lubke, a senior New York Fed official, countered Mr. Hintz's view, saying the Fed wants a market where a variety of clearinghouses can succeed.
 Analysts say that because major banks that deal derivatives are so closely affiliated with ICE, they could seek to have many of the products classified as ''customized'' -- the only category that would keep them off regulators' radar screens under Mr. Geithner's proposal.
 This worries Mr. Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, whose constituents include agricultural concerns that want better oversight of trading. 
 This is needed, he said, to ''add openness, transparency and integrity in futures trading to rebuild the financial system.'' 
 Letting ''customized'' derivatives -- like many credit-default swaps -- trade without detailed disclosure is a way to keep regulators in the dark, he said.
 Mr. Harkin said Mr. Geithner visited the Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill three weeks ago. At that meeting, Mr. Harkin said, he challenged Mr. Geithner to ''define customized swaps.'' Mr. Harkin said the Treasury secretary told him he would have to get back to him. 
 The big dealers, including major banks, say exchange trading would impose overly strict rules. But requiring exchange trading would have another effect: it would reduce the profits dealers make on derivatives. 
 Members of Congress say the lobbying efforts by big banks promise to produce one of the most intense political face-offs in Washington in years.
 ''The swaps and derivatives people are all over the place up here,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''They sure are trying hard to win. A lot of money is on the line.''
 Lobbyists for the banks plan to make a renewed push on Capitol Hill this week.
 The Financial Lobby
 Through political action committees and their own employees, securities and investment firms gave $152 million in political contributions from 2007 to 2008, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission data.
 The top five companies -- Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Credit Suisse -- gave $22.7 million and spent more than $25 million combined on lobbying activities in that period, according to election data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
 All five companies are members of the CDS Dealers Consortium, the lobbying group formed in November. Lobbying records show that the group has paid Mr. Rosen, the Cleary Gottlieb partner, $430,000 for four months' work. Mr. Rosen declined to comment, a spokeswoman said, citing ''client sensitivities.''
 Mr. Rosen, co-author of a treatise on derivatives regulation, frequently counsels the industry on these complex contracts. In late January, according to e-mail messages, he asked the members of the CDS dealer group if they would support his testifying before Congress on behalf of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. The CDS dealers are a much smaller group with a far larger interest in derivatives than Sifma as a whole.
 Mr. Rosen received an e-mail response from Mary Whalen, managing director for public policy at Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, which is active in the derivatives market:. ''It is a good idea for Ed to write the testimony and if necessary testify. That way we can be sure that the banks' point of view is expressed, rather than taking a chance on testimony that Sifma might craft.'' 
 Sifma's members include 650 firms of varying size and interests, many of which do not trade complex derivatives. By taking the lead, Mr. Rosen was able to position himself as the main advocate on derivatives for the securities industry and to make sure that the group of nine banks in the CDS Dealers Consortium had a loud voice within Sifma.
 A spokeswoman for Ms. Whalen declined to comment.
 Testimony to Congress
 At a House Agriculture Committee hearing on derivatives in February, Mr. Rosen testified on behalf of Sifma. He did not mention that he was also a paid lobbyist for the CDS Dealers Consortium, whose interests might be different from Sifma's.
 Those testifying at such hearings are not required to disclose all of their affiliations. But when asked, Representative Collin C. Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said he had not known of Mr. Rosen's relationship to the consortium. He said he would have liked to have known because it would have guided his questioning and interpretation of Mr. Rosen's testimony, given that his clients in the smaller CDS group represented a narrower interest group with a more specific agenda.
 Mr. Peterson, whose constituents include farmers, who are historically suspicious of Wall Street and whose livelihoods depend on efficient markets, is a longstanding critic of loose regulation. And since his committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he would retain more of his prerogatives overseeing the market if the C.F.T.C. were the main regulator.
 Mr. Peterson's bill specifically bars derivatives trading in a clearinghouse regulated by the New York Federal Reserve, which he said in an interview ''is a tool of the big banks'' that ''wouldn't do much'' to regulate the contracts.
 Because the banks' lobbyists persuaded some of his Republican colleagues to resist more sweeping changes, Mr. Peterson said, he has had to modify a bill he introduced that is similar to Mr. Harkin's in calling for wide-ranging limits on derivatives.
 ''The banks run the place,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''I will tell you what the problem is -- they give three times more money than the next biggest group. It's huge the amount of money they put into politics.''
 As a result of the lobbying efforts, champions of broad-based regulation are concerned that proposals will be significantly limited by banking interests.
 ''The outrage among the public means that things have a chance to change, if things move quickly,'' said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School and a former director of trading and markets at the C.F.T.C. ''We're in this brief moment of time when the average citizen is on a level playing field with the lobbyist.''

HEADLINE: Once a Key to Recovery, Detroit Adds to the Pain

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
With General Motors about to follow Chrysler into bankruptcy, the nation's ability to bounce back from the steep recession is being hobbled. 
 Although housing and a credit freeze caused the current collapse, manufacturing has played an outsize role in past recoveries, with the auto industry contributing significantly to the growth. It was manufacturing that led the economy back from the last steep recession, in 1981-82. It did so by stepping up production and hiring more quickly than others in anticipation of rising demand. 
 Even now, in its diminished state -- representing only 11.5 percent of America's output, down from 20 percent in 1980 -- manufacturing could have a bigger impact than its size suggests, because of its tendency to respond quickly. 
 ''Back then, it supercharged the recovery,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, ''and today it could have played a decisive role if G.M. and Chrysler had remained viable companies. Without their contribution, the economy simply can't recover as quickly as it has in the past.'' 
 Those two giants alone accounted for 10 percent of the upturn after the early 1980s recession, Mr. Zandi said, but this time they will be a drain on growth rather than a contributor to it.
 In the early 1980s, once the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates, the nation's manufacturers led the way in turning the economy from contraction to growth in less than four months. Economists described that recession, which lasted 16 months, as ''V-shaped,'' meaning a precipitous decline followed by an equally rapid return to growth once the recession had run its course. 
 That was a common characteristic of earlier recessions in the postwar years. After the 1980s, however, there were two declines, in 1990-91 and 2001, both shallow, as were the subsequent recoveries. 
 Now one leg of the V is back, suggesting a sharp rebound soon, if the recovery were to conform to past patterns. That seems unlikely, largely because of the drag from autos -- not just the big assemblers, like G.M. and Chrysler, but also the thousands of small companies that supply them with parts. 
 ''No other industry is stepping up to the plate to replace the Big Three and their suppliers as engines of growth,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist for I.H.S. Global Insight, ''and without the kick they once provided -- resuming production and recalling workers faster than others -- the recovery will be slow in coming and muted at best.''
 Chrysler's decision to shut down its factories and G.M.'s move to idle most of its locations this summer will inevitably have a domino effect on the nation's 4,000 suppliers, most likely undoing the fledgling improvement that forecasters see in slightly stronger retail sales and consumer confidence. 
 The automakers' problems are forcing some of the suppliers to close and others to cut more jobs, a process likely to accelerate unless other big assemblers like Ford, Honda and Toyota somehow pick up the slack. 
 Together, the suppliers employ many more people than the assemblers -- Detroit's Big Three and the foreign automakers operating here -- and they are eliminating jobs at the same rapid pace, putting tens of thousands of people out of work each month. 
 The struggling suppliers are companies like Yarema Die and Engineering, in Troy, Mich., which in better times employed 110 people stamping out metal auto parts like fuel tank straps, roof supports and brackets. Most of its products went to Chrysler and G.M., and now with those operations cut way back, Yarema has suspended production, cutting its staff to just two people from 25 a month ago. 
 ''Basically, we are in hibernation,'' said Greg Boulard, director of manufacturing operations. ''We are filling what orders there are from inventory, and we have laid off the entire staff.'' 
 The damage already done by the auto industry is sobering. Of the 5.7 million jobs lost since this recession began 18 months ago, 1.6 million were in manufacturing, and 289,000 of those were in motor vehicles, split almost evenly between the assemblers and their supplier networks. 
 During the worst months of the recession, from September through March, these twins also accounted for nearly 20 percent of the decline in the nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.
 And the damage continues, with G.M. preparing to enter bankruptcy, just as Chrysler exits to begin what may be a slow transformation as part of Fiat. Both American companies usually shut down or scale back production for one month in the summer, but they are stretching that to two months or more.
 The production of cars and sport utility vehicles had stabilized in early spring at roughly 423,000 vehicles a month, down from nearly 600,000 late last year. Then with the government bailouts proceeding in earnest, auto assemblies plunged to just 371,000 in May, as Chrysler entered bankruptcy, halting production. Another drop is likely in June as G.M. cuts way back -- one goal being to allow dealers to work down their inventories.
 That means the worst is still ahead for the suppliers. They deliver parts to the assemblers on an as-needed basis and are normally paid 60 days after delivery. Short-term bank loans carry them until payment comes from the automakers. That system broke down in the credit crisis, but the federal government stepped in, supplying $8 billion to maintain the payments.
 Now a new issue looms. With Chrysler shut down and G.M. preparing to cut back sharply, deliveries to those giant assemblers are grinding to a halt.
 Once payment is made by early August for the most recently delivered parts, the flow of money to the suppliers will fall way off, forcing further layoffs across a network of parts companies that employ 450,000 people. The American and foreign-owned assemblers, by comparison, employ only 309,000 in the United States today. 
 ''There will definitely have to be more government aid flowing to the suppliers to keep them afloat,'' said Haig Stoddard, an automotive analyst in Detroit for I.H.S. Global Insight.
 This new damage to the auto industry, particularly to the suppliers, is likely to show up first in the statistics as a surge in job losses in June. The monthly tally, covering every industry, had dipped to 539,000 in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, from more than 680,000 in February and again in March. 
 The May report, to be released on Friday, is likely to be close to the April number, but then is likely to jump as auto suppliers cut back their operations or go out of business.
 ''The exact timing is hard to say, but we'll get the first signal from new claims for unemployment insurance,'' Mr. Gault said, referring to a number issued weekly by the bureau. ''They are likely to spike soon.'' 
 Unless demand unexpectedly begins to rise and new-car sales perk up as consumers who had put off trading in their aging vehicles begin to do so. Then the foreign auto companies operating assembly plants here might lead the way in recalling workers, contributing to a recovery -- a gradual one, to be sure, without the bang that G.M. and Chrysler once made possible.

HEADLINE: Hearst's Contrarian Strategy Pays Off

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
LAST year, Hearst Magazines said its new Food Network magazine would have paid circulation of 300,000 by this summer, a robust total given the economic climate. Instead, that figure is already over 900,000, making Food Network one of the 100 best-selling American magazines, and Hearst says that within months, it will rise above 1.1 million.
 A different kind of Hearst consumer is likely to see the actress Megan Fox smoldering through a three-minute video on Esquire's Web site. But to see Esquire's extensive article about her, the reader has to get the printed magazine. The piece is not available on the Web -- a standard practice at Hearst but a rarity in an industry that puts the bulk of its printed work online. 
 Hearst Magazines, a unit of the Hearst Corporation, has repeatedly gone against the grain, from its traditional tight cost control in an often profligate business, to lagging years behind in building magazine Web sites, to recently raising prices and increasing the physical size of its pages. As part of a privately held company, Hearst does not report financial information, but indications are that its willingness to defy conventional wisdom has been working.
 ''I give a lot of credit to Hearst for being willing to go in one direction when everyone else is going in the other direction,'' said Samir Husni, chairman of the journalism department at the University of Mississippi and editor of MrMagazine.com, which follows the industry. ''They're doing well in a tough time, and Food Network is the big success story of 2009.''
 Not that Hearst, publisher of 15 American magazines -- including heavyweights of the women's market like Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan and O the Oprah Magazine -- has been immune to the steep downturn battering magazines. In the last two years, it has shut down O at Home, Quick and Simple, Teen and Cosmo Girl. But the surviving magazines have almost all held steady in circulation, and their combined advertising pages dropped 6.7 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent industrywide.
 ''We want to come out of this recession that everybody is in feeling strong and confident and introducing new things,'' said Cathie Black, president of Hearst Magazines.
 Food Network, produced in partnership with the cable television channel, has a staff of just 44 people. Like another recent success story, Every Day With Rachael Ray, published by the Reader's Digest Association, Food Network magazine combines two of the most recessionproof magazine categories, cooking and celebrity, emphasizing the work of the network's star chefs.
 Generations ago, there were many popular, large-format magazines like Life and Look, but gradually, standardization in production, shipping and display racks, and high mailing costs, pushed magazines toward a standard size that is slightly shorter and narrower than an
 8 1/2 -by-11-inch sheet of paper.
 But Hearst is pushing in the other direction, making a growing set of magazines that are up to an inch taller and wider than the norm, including Food Network. It increased the size of Redbook and House Beautiful in 2007; Good Housekeeping is already larger in some markets and will grow nationwide in January; and Country Living will stretch starting this summer.
 Experts say that the larger size gives pictures an added flair that can appeal to readers and advertisers, and that Hearst has the market clout to gain cooperation from retailers.
 ''In the competition to grab people's attention, size does actually matter,'' Mr. Husni said. ''And if other companies see that this is working well for Hearst, they will do this, too.''
 Publishers have generally been wary of charging too much for magazines, fearing a loss of circulation; in fact, after subscription discounts, the average price actually paid for many of the biggest magazines has declined.
 But Hearst has raised the newsstand prices of most of its magazines in the last two years, several of them by more than 25 percent, and did not significantly change subscription prices or discounting. Despite the increases, sales of most of the magazines barely budged.
 There was some trepidation about price increases, especially once the recession took hold, but it turned out consumers who are committed to certain magazines needed little persuading, said Michael Clinton, executive vice president of Hearst Magazines.
 Hearst has long forged its own path digitally; for years, most of its magazines were housed within the iVillage Web site, which limited expenses but also restricted reader traffic. The magazines established their own sites in 2007, and their traffic has risen sharply.
 ''We had the advantage of not having any legacy of old technology, of being able to learn from what others had done,'' said Chuck Cordray, senior vice president and general manager of Hearst Magazines Digital Media.
 The magazines keep much of their printed material offline, though the practice varies widely from one to another. Their sites try to tantalize readers with what they can see only in print -- and drive them to buy subscriptions. Last year, more than one-quarter of new subscriptions were sold through the sites, and this year that could reach one-third.
 Though the strategy defies conventional wisdom, Ms. Black said it seemed fairly obvious.
 ''I want 1.6 million women to go to the newsstand every month to buy Cosmo, and they do,'' she said. ''We don't want that genie out of the bottle. I don't have any interest in challenging that economic model.''

HEADLINE: Effects of Opel Deal Ripple Across Europe

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY and DAVID JOLLY; Judy Dempsey reported from Berlin and David Jolly from Paris. Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The ink is hardly dry on the deal to salvage the German automaker Opel, but already the political recriminations are echoing across Europe. 
 In Berlin, the government was in turmoil Sunday after Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the conservative economics minister, broke ranks with Chancellor Angela Merkel by criticizing the deal to hand Opel, the European unit of General Motors, to a Russian bank and a Canadian-Austrian auto parts maker. 
 In Rome, it was Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government that was under fire, accused of having not sufficiently aided Fiat in its rival bid. 
 G.M. is expected to file for bankruptcy protection Monday in New York after bondholders accounting for more than $27.2 billion of the company's debt voted Saturday to exchange their debt for an ownership stake as high as 25 percent. 
 The deal for Opel was essential to keeping it going after a G.M. bankruptcy filing, because the European automaker needs short-term funds to make payments. Under the arrangement, Opel is being put under the stewardship of a trustee. Sberbank, which is majority owned by the Russian government, and G.M. each will take a 35 percent stake in Opel. The Canadian-Austrian car parts maker Magna International will own 20 percent and Opel employees will hold the remaining 10 percent.
 German officials had become increasingly frustrated with the commitment of Washington, which has extended about $20 billion to G.M., to reach a deal on the company's European units. Mrs. Merkel spoke by telephone Friday with President Obama to smooth the deal. On Saturday, she sought to distance her government from Opel's problems, saying the root problem was ''a major mismanagement in the United States of America by G.M.'' 
 Mr. Guttenberg, one of Germany's lead negotiators in the effort to save Opel, offered to resign Saturday after he came out publicly against the deal, saying the government was risking billions of euros for a short-term solution. ''The concept is not without risks for the state and the guarantees it has promised for Opel,'' Mr. Guttenberg told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
 With an election looming in September, Mrs. Merkelpersuaded Mr. Guttenberg, a rising star in German politics, to remain in his post.
 In Rome, the talk was of how politics trumped Fiat's offer, which many analysts had thought held greater commercial logic. But in the end, Sberbank and Magna's promise to cut fewer jobs seems to have carried the day.
 ''Italy lost an opportunity by not backing Fiat's offer,'' Dario Franceschini, head of Italy's Democratic Party, told the newspaper la Repubblica. ''Our government was distracted,'' he said -- a not-so-subtle reference to a public scandal about Mr. Berlusconi's involvement with a young model, adding: ''They left the game to the Russians and the Germans.''
 Fiat lost, Reuters quoted the Italian finance minister, Giulio Tremonti as telling Italian state television, because ''our industry went to Berlin to play soccer in good faith and by the rules.'' Instead, ''they started playing rugby and used their hands.'' He added: ''Governments came onto the pitch, the German government, the Russian government.''
 The agreement was a success for Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin's policy of supporting Russian business expansion in Western Europe, which he has characterized as a natural balance to Western interest in investing in Russia's oil and natural gas fields.
 That a state bank, Sberbank, took the lead on the Russian side comes as another indication of Kremlin backing for Russians to buy a piece of G.M.'s European operation and increase their corporate footprint in the West.
 In Britain, Belgium and Poland, where thousands more jobs are at stake, officials were trying to get assurances that factories would be kept open. But it is possible that in Germany, where G.M. employs 25,000 workers, that the effects will linger longest. 
 Once a proponent of limited state intervention, Mrs. Merkel has increasingly backed a large government role in the economy to protect or rescue businesses that have been hit by the economic downturn. But even before the onset of the crisis, she had abandoned her more laissez-faire instincts to attract center-left voters to her conservative bloc.
 Fighting to remain in power and needing every vote in September, she overruled Mr. Guttenberg, cutting a deal in the hope that Opel would not become a major election issue.
 ''For Opel and Magna, the work is now just beginning and there are several difficulties still to be overcome,'' she said after the marathon negotiations concluded in the early hours of Saturday. 
 When the Opel crisis first emerged last November, Mrs. Merkel said the state would not intervene. But as the problems at Opel and G.M. mounted, Mrs. Merkel opted for a rescue, on condition that an investor promise to protect jobs in return for government aid.
 Mrs. Merkel's acceptance of Sberbank signals another shift in her attitude toward saving jobs at any price, as she had in the past been reluctant for Russian companies to take major stakes in some of Germany's big companies. 
 But after talks over the past week with Mr. Putin, Mrs. Merkel insisted on better terms if Magna was to obtain a stake in Opel. Officials close to the talks said that the assurances that Mrs. Merkel received swung the balance in favor of Magna and away from Fiat, which made it clear it would have to shed many jobs if it wanted to invest, and save Opel.
 Magna pledged to keep all of Opel's German factories open and limit job cuts to 2,500.
 Germany's European partners have criticized Berlin's stance, accusing the government of putting German jobs first before protecting the other plants across Europe. Their concern is that Magna will start making Opel cars at a factory in Russia that could lead to job losses in Britain and Belgium. Magna has already said it plans to lay off one in five workers, without saying where and when.
 The part of the deal that provoked Mr. Guttenberg to offer his resignation was that the German taxpayer would act as guarantor for about <4>3 billion, or $4.2 billion, worth of loans and the government would also make the emergency <4>1.5 billion bridge loan. State governments have agreed to put up half of the bridge loans. Fiat had also sought aid.
 Mr. Guttenberg, 37, had at one stage during the negotiations suggested that Opel could be declared insolvent for the purpose of an orderly restructuring rather than depend on state guarantees with no certainty that the company would return to health.
 But Mrs. Merkel and the Social Democrats, her coalition partners, rounded on Mr. Guttenberg, who has been economics minister for only a few months, of not taking the rescue attempts seriously.
 ''We were pushing from the very start to find a way to save Opel while some conservatives kept looking for reasons why Opel should not be saved,'' said Franz Muntefering, chairman of the Social Democrats. And referring to Mr. Guttenberg, he added: ''We are going to examine the role some individuals played and at the aversions by the conservatives to help.''
 No cabinet ministers supported Mr. Guttenberg. But the parliamentary economics wing of Mrs. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, whose more laissez-faire views about the economy fell on deaf ears in the Chancellery, spoke out for Mr. Guttenberg. 
 ''With the Opel rescue we are throwing taxpayer money out the window with a sort of 'free-beer-for-everyone' mentality,'' said Michael Fuchs, chairman of the business wing of Mrs. Merkel's party.

HEADLINE: Modifying Conciliatory Stance, South Korea Pushes Back Against the North

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and CHOE SANG-HUN; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
After years of incendiary threats and weapons tests, the world has become accustomed to provocations from North Korea. More unusual this time is that South Korea is pushing back.
 After North Korea's nuclear test last week, South Korea swiftly moved to join an American-led effort to search ships for unconventional weapons, despite threats of war from the North if its ships were boarded. South Korea has also lobbied China and Russia to take a unified stance against the North, and supported calls at the United Nations Security Council for new sanctions.
The assertive moves by South Korea's right-leaning and generally pro-American president, Lee Myung-bak, are a sharp departure from the conciliatory stance that the South took in previous standoffs, particularly after the North's first nuclear, test three years ago, when it continued economic aid and investment. South Korea's reluctance to challenge threats from its neighbor, along with China's more accommodating policies, made it difficult in the past to enact or enforce tough sanctions on North Korea. Now, the South's decision to stop acting as the North's leading protector may open a wider range of options in responding to the nuclear and missile tests, analysts say. 
 ''South Korean aid gave North Korea leverage against the United States,'' said Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a state-run research organization. ''Lee Myung-bak has emptied their pockets and weakened their bargaining position.''
 It remains to be seen how much that will translate into punitive actions against the North at the United Nations, where the five permanent Security Council members -- Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France -- have been joined by Japan and South Korea in trying to hammer out a new resolution that includes sanctions. 
 There is broad agreement on the need to send a tough message to North Korea, senior diplomats have said, but less consensus on what that should be. Given the sensitivities of China, which is the North's one ally, the resolution will probably not involve any new sanctions. Instead, it may impose some of those approved in the resolution after the 2006 nuclear test but never enacted because the North cooperated in entering six-party talks on its weapons program. 
 That earlier resolution focused on cutting trade and financing for North Korea's military and hampering the ruling elite with a ban on the import of luxury goods. No one expects rapid action, however. ''It is not a normal country, so we have to act cautiously,'' Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview on Sunday. ''It is a very closed place, so they act abnormally.'' It is not even clear that China has the influence to sway the North Korean government, he added.
 It is also unclear how far South Korea is willing to push the North, whose troops and artillery sit just 35 miles north of Seoul along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. While Mr. Lee did gain office last year promising a tougher line, most South Koreans still abhor tensions with the North and are fundamentally in favor of reconciliation, said North Korea experts.
 ''If North Korea actually tests South Korea's resolve, it will put South Korea in a very tough spot,'' said Kim Il-young, a North Korea specialist at Seoul's Sungkyunkwan University. Indeed, South Korean officials have been careful to cast their new approach not as a drastic departure but as more a shift in tone. They say the South remains willing to offer economic aid to the North, but only if it responds with good-faith efforts to curtail its weapons programs. 
 They also say that they are not trying to provoke the North, which has seemed particularly volatile since its leader, Kim Jong-il, appears to have had a stroke in August. ''This is not at all a hawkish or hard line,'' said Kim Tae-hyo, the secretary to Mr. Lee for national security. ''We still seek contacts with the North. Where we differ is that we demand mutual respect and reciprocity.''
 Still, by moving the nation closer to Washington, the South Korean president's approach has deprived North Korea of one of its usual policy options in such standoffs: driving a wedge between Seoul and its traditional allies in Washington and Tokyo. 
 Emblematic of Seoul's new tilt toward the United States was its sudden decision on Tuesday to join the Proliferation Security Initiative, the effort to stop global trafficking in unconventional weapons, after years of refusing to do so for fear of riling the North. North Korea responded by reiterating that it would consider any search of its ships to be an act of war.
 Even during the current crisis, however, South Korean officials said they were still trying to reach out to the North. They also said they were talking with China, Russia, Japan and the United States about putting together a ''grand plan'' of aid and other economic incentives to persuade the North to dismantle its nuclear program.
 As a possible model, they cite Ukraine, which relinquished its Soviet-made nuclear arsenal in exchange for a huge aid package and entree to the West. However, with the North's fear of the instability that greater openness could bring, many analysts doubt that even a generous aid package could coax it to end its weapons program.
 The emerging view here is that last Monday's nuclear test and the ensuing series of test missile launchings reflect North Korea's attempt to ensure its survival by creating an independent nuclear deterrent. The displays of technological achievement are also seen as a bid to create domestic support for the ill leader and his moves to install a successor, South Korean officials said.
 South Korean officials play down their role in provoking the North, saying officials in Pyongyang are engaging in the same brand of nuclear brinkmanship they have used in previous crises, though with a markedly faster pace. They say that despite the North's recent threats against the South, the main target audience remains the United States, with which the North wants to hold bilateral negotiations on a new footing as a nuclear nation. 
 ''You can't connect the dots between South Korean policy changes and the scale and pace of North Korea's current provocations,'' said Wi Sung-lac, the South Korean Foreign Ministry's top negotiator on Korean peninsula security affairs.

HEADLINE: Congress Returns, to Full Plate and Tests for Democrats

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress returns this week to face an agenda stuffed with difficult, high-profile issues that will test the ability of Democrats and the White House to deliver health care, energy and spending legislation while simultaneously contending with a Supreme Court nomination.
 ''This is where the rubber meets the road,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who will be central to trying to meet a daunting timetable for making significant progress this summer on measures sought by President Obama. 
 While acknowledging the challenge, Mr. Emanuel and others say expanded Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate have defied expectations so far and won approval of a series of contentious bills, including the $787 billion economic stimulus package, enacted a budget and finished off the spring with a series of consumer-oriented economic measures.
 But Republicans say the earlier legislation could prove to have been fairly easy in comparison with the coming battles on health care and energy because Democrats have yet to find a balance among their own members of Congress, let alone with Republicans.
 ''It is pretty clear that both sides have a lot they want to get done in a limited amount of time on issues that don't yet have a lot of consensus,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
 It is a pivotal moment for Democrats. Lawmakers say polls point to a sense of public readiness for major legislation, particularly on health care. Democrats have hefty majorities in the House and the Senate, where they are on the cusp of reaching the 60 votes needed to break any filibuster.
 Mr. Obama remains popular and retains the momentum of his first months in office. A failure to achieve a breakthrough in some policy areas would be a significant setback, both politically and substantively, heading into the 2010 midterm elections.
 Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue say they expect to succeed and to enlist some level of Republican support in the bargain. But to do so, they will have to overcome disagreements within their own party on the details of complex legislation governing health care, climate change, taxes and overall federal spending. 
 One such division emerged last week as a new health care proposal being developed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the health committee, was viewed as leaning more toward public coverage than the approach being pursued by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee. The two issued a joint statement on Saturday saying they intended to produce ''similar and complementary legislation that can be quickly merged into one bill for consideration on the Senate floor before the August recess.''
 In the House, where the focus has been more on climate change legislation, the leadership intends to push a carbon emissions proposal from the Energy and Commerce Committee to the floor in the coming weeks to allow lawmakers to focus on health care at the committee level. 
 Either a health care or an energy bill would typically be enough to consume an entire Congressional summer. Now the Senate will also have to contend with a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, with Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the president's nominee to replace Justice David H. Souter, to begin meeting with senators on Tuesday. Members of the Judiciary Committee, which will review the nomination, are also engaged in the health care and energy debates, complicating the logistics of those issues.
 At the same time, Democrats are also trying to complete the 12 annual spending measures by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, a goal Congress has been unable to meet in recent years. Those measures contain scores of possibilities for potential conflict, including whether to provide money to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a decision Congress temporarily sidestepped before Memorial Day.
 Hoping to squeeze all the spending bills through the House by August, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat and majority leader, has warned lawmakers to prepare for long hours and full weeks in June and July.
 ''House committees have been very busy the first half of this year, and therefore over the next two months we have a tremendous amount of work to bring to the floor, hopefully to include major health care, energy and appropriations legislation,'' Mr. Hoyer said in a statement.
 Congress also hopes to move forward with an overhaul of how financial institutions are regulated, with administration and Congressional plans to be rolled out in the next few weeks. But the outlook for completing it by the end of the year is mixed, given the complex issues involved and the lobbying power of the industry.
 Other difficult topics are also percolating, like new tobacco regulations the Senate could consider this week. Congress is also likely to be distracted by simmering side issues like the disagreement between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the C.I.A over terrorism suspect interrogations and a federal inquiry into ties between lawmakers and Pentagon contractors.
 But Democrats are optimistic about their overall prospects. 
 ''Nobody is underestimating the steep incline of this,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''But there has been a high level of confidence building on the capability and capacity of the Congress because it has it hit every major legislative mark to date.''

HEADLINE: The 31-Year-Old Who Is Dismantling G.M.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It is not every 31-year-old who, in a first government job, finds himself dismantling General Motors and rewriting the rules of American capitalism.
 But that, in short, is the job description for Brian Deese, a not-quite graduate of Yale Law School who had never set foot in an automotive assembly plant until he took on his nearly unseen role in remaking the American automotive industry. 
 Nor, for that matter, had he given much thought to what ailed an industry that had been in decline ever since he was born. A bit laconic and looking every bit the just-out-of-graduate-school student adjusting to life in the West Wing -- ''he's got this beard that appears and disappears,'' says Steven Rattner, one of the leaders of President Obama's automotive task force -- Mr. Deese was thrown into the auto industry's maelstrom as soon the election-night parties ended. 
 ''There was a time between Nov. 4 and mid-February when I was the only full-time member of the auto task force,'' Mr. Deese, a special assistant to the president for economic policy, acknowledged recently as he hurried between his desk at the White House and the Treasury building next door. ''It was a little scary.'' 
 But now, according to those who joined him in the middle of his crash course about the automakers' downward spiral, he has emerged as one of the most influential voices in what may become President Obama's biggest experiment yet in federal economic intervention. 
 While far more prominent members of the administration are making the big decisions about Detroit, it is Mr. Deese who is often narrowing their options.
 A month ago, when the administration was divided over whether to support Fiat's bid to take over much of Chrysler, it was Mr. Deese who spoke out strongly against simply letting the company go into liquidation, according to several people who were present for the debate.
 ''Brian grasps both the economics and the politics about as quickly as I've seen anyone do this,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the head of the National Economic Council who is not known for being patient whenever he believes an analysis is sub-par -- or disagrees with his own. ''And there he was in the Roosevelt Room, speaking up vigorously to make the point that the costs we were going to incur giving Fiat a chance were no greater than some of the hidden costs of liquidation.'' 
 Mr. Deese was not the only one favoring the Fiat deal, but his lengthy memorandum on how liquidation would increase Medicaid costs, unemployment insurance and municipal bankruptcies ended the debate. The administration supported the deal, and it seems likely to become a reality on Monday, if a federal judge handling the high-speed bankruptcy proceeding approves the sale of Chrysler's best assets to the Italian carmaker. 
 Mr. Deese's role is unusual for someone who is neither a formally trained economist nor a business school graduate, and who never spent much time flipping through the endless studies about the future of the American and Japanese auto industries. 
 He lives a dual life these days. He starts the day at a desk wedged just outside of Mr. Summers's office, where he can hear what young members of the economic team have come to know as ''the Summers bellow.'' From there, he can make it quickly to the press office to help devise explanations for why taxpayers are spending more than $50 billion on what polls show is a very unpopular bailout of the auto industry. 
 Several times a day he speed-walks to Treasury, taking a shortcut through the tunnel under the colonnade, near the kitchens. The other day he talked about how sharply perceptions of the industry's future changed after Mr. Obama's election.
 ''At the first meeting with Rick Wagoner,'' he said, referring to G.M.'s recently deposed chief executive, ''they were in a very different place. He said publicly that bankruptcy was not a viable option. It's been a long process getting everyone to look at the options differently.''
 In fact, from before Inauguration Day, few in Mr. Obama's circle saw any other choice. Every time Mr. Deese ran the numbers on G.M. and Chrysler, he came back with the now-obvious conclusion that neither was a viable business, and that their plans to revive themselves did not address the erosion of their revenues. But it took the support of Mr. Rattner and Ron Bloom, senior advisers to the task force charged with restructuring the automobile industry, to help turn Mr. Deese's positions into policy.
 ''The president's instruction to us was that we had to come up with a solution that would work on a commercial basis, that didn't involve indefinite federal financing,'' Mr. Deese said. ''But we didn't want liquidation, which would have even worse effects. So the question was how do you design a very substantial restructuring, and do it fast.'' 
 Mr. Deese's route to the auto table at the White House was anything but a straight line. He is the son of a political science professor at Boston College (his father) and an engineer who works in renewable energy (his mother). He grew up in the Boston suburb of Belmont and attended Middlebury College in Vermont. He went to Washington to work on aid issues and was quickly hired by Nancy Birdsall, a widely respected authority on the effectiveness of international aid and the founder of the Center for Global Development. 
 But he wanted to learn domestic issues as well, and soon ended up working as an assistant for Gene Sperling, who 17 years ago in the Clinton White House played a similar role as economic policy prodigy. Eventually, Mr. Deese headed to Yale for his law degree. But his e-mail box was constantly filled with messages from friends in Washington who were signing up to work for the Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns. Mr. Deese chose Senator Clinton's.
 ''He was pretty quickly functioning as the top economic policy staffer through her campaign,'' Mr. Sperling said. ''He could blend the policy needs and the political needs pretty seamlessly.'' On the day that the Clinton campaign ended, Mr. Deese left her concession speech and received a message on his BlackBerry from a friend in the Obama campaign urging him to sign on immediately to Mr. Obama's team. 
 He resumed his policy work there, and found himself stuck in Chicago -- unable to fly to Washington with his dog -- as the economic crisis deepened. Finally, one night, he decided to get into his car with his dog and just started driving back to Washington. Tired, he pulled over to catch some sleep in the car. 
 ''I slept in the parking lot of the G. M. plant in Lordstown, Ohio,'' he recalled. The giant plant, opened during G.M.'s heyday in the mid-1960s, is where the Pontiac G5 is produced. Under the plan Mr. Deese worked on when he arrived in Washington, Pontiac will disappear. 
 ''I guess that was prophetic,'' he said, shaking his head.

HEADLINE: Bragging Rights for Ford Motor

BYLINE: By ROB COX, ANTONY CURRIE and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
Ford Motor stands alone among Detroit's Big Three in dodging a shareholder-crushing government bailout. If automobile sales continue to slide, that may be a short-lived accolade. If not, it is a testament to the carmaker's hard work, smart financial planning and competent management.
 So what does it get for its virtue? So far, not much. President Obama gave Ford's products a plug and its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, a slap on the back when announcing new emissions standards last month. But the competitive advantage the government's life-support package would give General Motors, as well as the billions it has injected into Chrysler, must worry Ford. 
 After Ford's two domestic rivals emerge from swift trips through the Chapter 11 car wash, they will have cleaned up their legacy cost problems and scaled back their dealer networks in ways Ford, outside of bankruptcy, cannot. As G.M.'s majority shareholder, the government has an incentive -- perhaps even a fiduciary obligation -- to favor G.M. 
 To dispel that notion, the government would have to level the playing field. But there's not much it can do. The White House could expedite the ''cash for clunkers'' bill now slowly wending its way through Congress and speed up the arrival of cheap Energy Department loans to help develop fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 And it should continue to bolster the financing markets that Ford Motor Credit depends on to make loans to buyers. These measures would help all carmakers. But if Ford is smart, it can use its status as the only financially virtuous domestic carmaker to good advantage in its advertising as a way to scoop up greater market share.
 The government can do one thing to specifically help Ford: give fast-track approval to its finance unit's application to open an Industrial Loan Corporation. That would allow Ford Motor Credit to collect deposits and lower its financing costs -- matching the advantage that Chrysler's and G.M.'s financing partner GMAC has as a bank holding company.
 Aside from that, Ford is on its own. The good news is that its executives have already demonstrated restructuring savvy. Combined with what little help the government can give, Mr. Mulally may be confident enough to keep Ford competitive without resorting to the bankruptcy court. If not, all the company's virtuous diligence will be for naught.
 Geithner in China
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner visits Beijing this week for the first time since taking office. But don't expect a reprise of the angry tone in January, in which he invoked ''manipulation'' in describing how China had managed the value of its currency. This time, Mr. Geithner is likely to leave the verbal grenades at home.
 He will ask China to accelerate its transformation from a country driven by exports into one driven by private consumption. That's a bit like shouting at the moon. Private consumption in China is growing, but remains tiny for such a large economy. China's previously announced fiscal stimulus of 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) is a temporary stopgap. 
 Premier Wen Jiabao will no doubt ask that the United States act responsibly on the value of the dollar, in which China holds some $1.7 trillion of foreign exchange assets. Trillion-dollar deficits mean there is little chance of that, but Mr. Geithner will no doubt agree anyway.
 Nice-guy diplomacy is fine, as far as it goes. There certainly is not any point in either side lashing out at the other. America needs China to keep buying bonds to fuel its giant deficits, and China needs an export market.
 But this should not disguise the fact that the China-United States trade relationship needs rebalancing. Eventually, the Chinese export sector has to slim down, with painful consequences for its displaced workers. 
 The adjustment should also include a further rise in the renminbi against the dollar. Beijing's previous policy of gradual appreciation, which had the currency rise 20 percent in three and a half years, was suspended when the crisis hit. A costlier renminbi would help reduce the trade deficit and spur Chinese consumers to import cheap goods. 
 Mr. Geithner has learned that lashing out is pointless. Turning around supertanker economies during a recession takes a long time. But turn around they must.

HEADLINE: Afghan Valley Offers a Test for Obama's Strategy

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting.

DATELINE: JALREZ BAZAAR, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A year ago, the Taliban were tormenting this lush valley just miles from the Afghan capital, kidnapping people and blocking the road. 
 All that changed when American troops arrived in February. They dropped from helicopters and set up three camps where there had been none, expecting a fight. Instead, the Taliban put up almost no resistance and left for other areas. Now trucks travel freely and merchants no longer fear for their lives.
''Compared with last year, it's 100 percent different,'' said Muhamed Zaker, an apple farmer from the area. 
 The Jalrez Valley is a test case, the first area in Afghanistan where President Obama's strategy of increasing troop levels has been applied, and it is a promising early indicator. 
 But in Afghanistan, a complex patchwork of tribes, ethnicities and rivalries, it remains unclear whether the early success in this area can be replicated. In the painstaking business of counterinsurgency, security requires more than just extra troops. It means giving Afghans reasons to reject the insurgents by providing the basic trappings of a state -- an effective police force, enough government services, and economic opportunity so they can work rather than fight.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has said the troops here have about a year to show they can turn around the momentum of the war, before Afghan and American patience runs out. 
 But Afghanistan is a country where only a third of the population can read and even the most rudimentary infrastructure is lacking, and commanders on the ground say rushing the process would be a mistake.
 ''It's construction, not reconstruction,'' one American officer said, comparing the task with that in Iraq, where the American effort was referred to as reconstruction. 
 One problem is that the gains in Jalrez could still be temporary. Insurgents regularly leave areas where Americans appear, only to resurface later. ''We are hearing it's better now,'' said Hoji Mir Ahmad, a fruit merchant based in Kabul, ''but God knows what things will be like when the harvest comes.''
 When the Americans came to the Jalrez Valley, a skinny finger of green just 30 miles west of Kabul, the capital, Taliban fighters had controlled it for more than a year, taking advantage of a virtual absence of American troops. A unit of about 200 American soldiers had patrolled an area of half a million people and was so thinly spread that its captain had to drive 12 hours to hold a meeting with a local leader.
 Humiliations had become routine: The Taliban would blacken the faces of men they said were thieves and parade them. In Jalrez Bazaar, a town west of the valley, eight people were killed in 2008, residents said.
 ''It looked like we didn't have any destiny,'' said Momin Shah, a farmer, sitting on a crate in a small supply shop. 
 Fearing that the Taliban were tightening their hold around Kabul, the Americans were sent to secure the two provinces just south and west of it, Logar and Wardak, the gateway to the capital and the location of the country's main north-south highway.
 Then came the first surprise: The Taliban left for other areas rather than fight. Musa Hotak, a member of Parliament from Jalrez District who is a former Taliban commander, said the two main militant leaders had moved with their families to Pakistan. 
 The reason, American officers said, was simple math. The new contingent increased the number of Americans tenfold. ''Mass counts,'' said Lt. Col. Kimo Gallahue, a commander in the new battalion. 
 What is now causing unrest in Jalrez is an assortment of low-level criminals, Americans and Afghans said, men who may be thought of as Taliban, but whose main pursuit is money, not infidels. (The main target in Jalrez is a man whose last big crime was stealing solar panels.) That gives the Americans hope that if they bring money and jobs fast enough here and to the rest country, they could substantially weaken the insurgency.
 ''I learned everything I know about the Jalrez insurgency from 'The Sopranos,' '' Colonel Gallahue said. ''At the foot soldier level, it's economically driven.''
 For Afghans, life has improved, a fact that, for Jalrez Bazaar residents, has trumped the irritation at having foreign troops on Afghan soil. ''People hate them but it's better to have them here,'' said Shah Mahmoud, a farmer, 70. If security is established, ''we don't need the Americans and they don't need us.'' 
 In the rules of counterinsurgency, soldiers must move quickly -- but carefully -- to solidify gains. 
 The Americans are trying to strike a delicate balance between wooing villagers with public works projects and continuing to put pressure on insurgents in the same areas. Progress is slow. 
 Lt. Col. Michael Gabel, the commander responsible for channeling money into villages, said one early frustration was the discovery that the provincial governor had no funds at his disposal. So the Americans set aside $500,000 per district for projects like roads, bridges, and cows for widows. 
 The money is tied to the central part of the American plan for Afghanistan -- local guard forces. The program, which got its start in Jalrez, pays local people $120 a month to guard their villages. A similar program in Iraq aimed at winning over Sunnis, among them insurgents, grew into the major tipping point of the war. But Afghanistan is not Iraq, and Afghans fear that the program could create warlords. 
 Afghanistan's complex ethnic ties proved to be the next problem. Part of Jalrez District is made up of Pashtun, the ethnic group most closely associated with the Taliban, and a number of those villages refused to offer guards, a blow to American plans. 
 In the Pashtun village of Ziwalat on a recent Sunday, a crowd of residents ticked off a list of complaints: Americans forbid driving at night; Americans talk to shop owners without buying anything; Americans block traffic, forcing pregnant women to wait. 
 But questions about recent violence -- an asphalt machine belonging to a Chinese construction company was burned, and a bomb set on the road wounded eight Afghan soldiers -- drew blank looks. Who is laying mines? ''We don't know,'' said a man in a brown scarf. 
 Mr. Hotak, the member of Parliament, who is from Ziwalat, argues that villagers still do not feel safe. If the Americans abandon them, the Taliban will return to kill them. But American commanders suspect the reticence has more to do with political jockeying by former mujahedeen commanders like Mr. Hotak, who want posts in the government. Mr. Hotak said his brother wanted to be police chief, but did not qualify because he was illiterate.
 The Americans say the effort in Wardak could succeed if given enough time. Pashtuns are slowly coming forward to join the guard forces. Local residents are beginning to call in tips. 
 ''It's moving as fast as it can,'' said Matthew Sherman, the Americans' political adviser. ''If we force it, then it won't work.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Heads to Bankruptcy Protection as U.S. Steps In: Obama Makes a Bet That the Carmaker Can Recover

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, JEFF ZELENY and BILL VLASIC; David E. Sanger and Jeff Zeleny reported from Washington, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

 BODY:
This article was reported by David E. Sanger, Jeff Zeleny and Bill Vlasic, and written by Mr. Sanger.
 WASHINGTON -- President Obama will push General Motors into bankruptcy protection on Monday, making a risky bet that by temporarily nationalizing the onetime icon of American capitalism, he can save at least a diminished automaker that is competitive. 
 The bankruptcy, to be filed in New York, is a moment of reckoning for an industry that was once at the heart of the American economy. It culminates a remarkable four months of confrontation between Washington and Detroit that is expected to result in a drastic downsizing of the company. 
 It also places the government in uncharted territory as a business owner, as it takes a 60 percent ownership stake in the company during its restructuring. 
 Reflecting the government's extraordinary intervention in industry, aides say, Mr. Obama plans to tell the nation on Monday that he believes G.M. can be brought back from the brink of insolvency, even if the company looks almost nothing like the titan of old.
 Meanwhile, a federal judge late Sunday night cleared a path for Chrysler to get out of bankruptcy by approving a sale of most of that carmaker's assets to a new entity to be run by Fiat of Italy. 
 Administration officials briefed reporters on the G.M. plans Sunday night, as President Obama began to inform members of Congress. But the White House insisted that the aides who talked to reporters could not be named.
 In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Obama will spell out a strategy in which a shrunken G.M. can make money even if new car sales remain at a sluggish 10 million a year in the United States and even if G.M., once the giant of the industry, drops below its current 20 percent market share in this country. 
 But to get there, American taxpayers will invest an additional $30 billion in the company, atop $20 billion already spent just to keep it solvent as the company bled cash as quickly as Washington could inject it. Whether that investment will ever be recovered is still an open question. 
 The company will also have to shed 21,000 union workers and close 12 to 20 factories, steps that most analysts thought could never be pushed through by a Democratic president allied with organized labor.
 Forty percent of the company's 6,000 dealers will close, the workers' union will be forced to finance half of its $20 billion health care fund with stock of uncertain value in the restructured G.M., and bondholders, including many retirees, will be forced to take stock worth 10 cents for every dollar they lent the company.
 The company's last steps toward bankruptcy took place over the weekend as a majority of G.M. bondholders agreed not to challenge the filing in court and to exchange their debt for stock. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, who as head of the National Economic Council serves as one of the co-heads of the auto task force, argued in an interview on Sunday that the bailout of the auto industry was fundamentally different from the Mexican bailout in 1994, the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, and the continuing banking crisis. 
 General Motors and Chrysler, he said, were ''clear cases of insolvency,'' in which mere loans would not accomplish the goal of getting the automakers past a temporary crisis. ''There was no argument that they were solvent, no argument they could meet their obligations.''
 He said that left the Obama administration to decide whether to allow ''a laissez-faire, uncontrolled bankruptcy, which would have had an enormous cost,'' or a ''controlled process,'' in which the goal was to make sure that the auto companies not only restructured, but were not overburdened with debt. So, in return for what amounted to debtor-in-possession financing, Mr. Obama chose to accept equity in the new company -- while insisting that he had no intention of exercising day-to-day control over the company.
 ''It's a fine line,'' Mr. Summers said, ''but we think it is manageable.''
 To assist in the restructuring, the automaker is expected to hire the consulting firm Alix Partners, which has worked on several major bankruptcies, including those for Enron and Kmart. One of the firm's partners, Al Koch, is expected to manage the liquidation of corporate assets that G.M. will shed during its Chapter 11 restructuring, people with knowledge of the strategy said.
 Mr. Obama is taking several risks under the plan. None may be bigger than the decision that the United States government will take its 60 percent share of the stock in a new G.M., leaving taxpayers vulnerable if the overhaul is not successful. (Canada, for its part, is taking a 12 percent stake.)
 ''We don't think that after this next $30 billion, they will need more money,'' one administration official said. ''But the fact is there are things you don't know -- like when the car market will come back, and how much Toyota and Honda and Volkswagen will benefit from the chaos.''
 On Monday, Mr. Obama is expected to argue that any alternative to his plan would be worse, and that a liquidation of G.M. -- the only other real option -- would send the unemployment rate soaring over 10 percent and would radiate damage throughout the economy. 
 But aware of the hardships the plan will impose on regions across the country that depend on auto production, the White House is dispatching a dozen Cabinet members and other officials across four states this week to reassure residents. 
 Aides say Mr. Obama will portray himself on Monday as a reluctant shareholder, eager to sell the company back to private investors, perhaps within 6 to 18 months. 
 Officials say the president will insist that once the government sets up new management and a board of directors, it will remove itself from G.M.'s day-to-day operations. But even his aides anticipate intense pressure as the company's managers are called to testify in Congress and face questions like why they decided to build new cars in Mexico and South Korea, rather than in Michigan or the South.
 ''Congress and many Americans are going to say, if we own it, why can't we make these decisions?'' one of Mr. Obama's top economic aides said, ''and it's going to be a challenge to answer that.''
 To ease the way, the White House on Sunday briefed reporters on a new set of principles for how the government should behave as a majority shareholder. It argued that the government's role should be limited primarily to the beginning of the process, but that it should then recede, becoming a passive investor, one seeking to sell its stake quickly.
 At the same time, Mr. Obama has laid out goals for all the Detroit automakers that will presumably affect their major strategic decisions. He has urged them, for example, to build smaller cars with significantly better fuel efficiency. 
 Six months ago, even the suggestion of such deep intervention into G.M.'s operations would have raised huge objections. But by the time the denouement came, the company seemed almost relieved. Robert Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, said that ''for the first time in our history, the American auto industry has the ear of the administration. Their number one goal is to make us successful.''
 Nonetheless, Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said the decision would ''mean a new chapter in the history books on American capitalism.'' He added, ''How we think about American free enterprise is really hanging in the balance.'' 
 For Mr. Obama, whose ascent to the White House depended on carrying states across the industrial Midwest, the political risk is significant.
 The G.M. bankruptcy will ripple across several states where hundreds of parts suppliers and car dealerships face imminent closings. 
 Indeed, the four states where Cabinet secretaries are focusing their efforts this week -- Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin -- all were carried by Mr. Obama last November. It was the first time Indiana has supported a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.
 These Main Street political challenges will almost certainly be an issue for Democrats on the ballot in next year's midterm election campaign and in the president's own re-election effort in 2012. If those jobs shift to nonunion plants in the South, where German and Japanese carmakers have built their facilities, or overseas, Mr. Obama could face criticism inside his own party.
 ''It is unacceptable to ask U.S. workers to subsidize the exportation of their own jobs,'' said Representative Dennis Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes Cleveland. ''The taxpayers' investment should be used to protect American plants so that American workers can build the next generation of automobiles.''
 In his presidential campaign speeches last year, often delivered in the shadow of closed manufacturing plants, Mr. Obama bluntly conceded that most of the jobs would not come back. Instead, his administration is pointing to investments that the economic recovery act will make in communities.
 Rob McNabney, chairman of the Madison County Democratic Party in Anderson, Ind., a onetime booming automotive center, said the problems for Mr. Obama were severe. ''He's going to be judged by what he does,'' Mr. McNabney said.

HEADLINE: Sony Agrees to Provide Its Older Songs to eMusic

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
In another example of struggling major music labels and Internet services finding common ground, Sony Music Entertainment has agreed to make its back catalog of songs available on eMusic, one of the largest music retailers on the Web. 
 EMusic, a company based in New York City, has some 400,000 subscribers who pay a monthly fee to download a certain number of songs. Its service is primarily aimed at adults who are fans of music from independent labels.
The company plans to announce on Monday that it will add all Sony Music tracks that are more than two years old, including material from artists like Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. 
 The major labels had long been skeptical of the economics behind eMusic's proposition to consumers. Subscribers to eMusic's ''basic'' plan, for example, pay $11.99 a month to download 30 songs -- or about 40 cents a song, far below the prices on Apple's iTunes. Songs are in the MP3 format and do not have restrictions against copying.
 As part of the deal, eMusic says it will slightly raise prices and reduce the number of downloads for some of its monthly plans. 
 Danny Stein, eMusic's chief executive, said he had been talking to the major labels about adding their music for several years. Talks continue with Warner Music, the Universal Music Group and EMI, he said. He added that many of the independent labels had been asking the company to raise its prices. 
 ''We have been looking for a catalyzing event to do it, and we think introducing this vast, quality catalog from Sony is that event,'' Mr. Stein said.
 The deal highlights several shifts in the online music landscape. The major labels gave up their objections to selling songs in the unprotected MP3 format in 2007. They also prevailed upon Apple this year to move to variable pricing in its iTunes store. Apple now sells older songs for 79 cents and new tracks for $1.29. 
 The major labels have also been more willing lately to strike more flexible and less expensive deals with start-ups like Imeem that are trying new approaches to online music.
 Sony Music and eMusic would not disclose the particulars of their deal. An executive at Sony Music, a subsidiary of the Sony Corporation, said the company was interested in seeing multiple models for digital music coexist on the Web. 
 ''We think the model of buying a set amount of music each month under an MP3 allowance is an attractive subscription option for consumers,'' said Thomas Hesse, president of Sony's Global Digital Business unit. ''We are supportive of offerings that encourage fans to dig deep into the repertoire of our artists and discover the richness of our catalog.''

HEADLINE: Reagan Did It

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''This bill is the most important legislation for financial institutions in the last 50 years. It provides a long-term solution for troubled thrift institutions. ... All in all, I think we hit the jackpot.'' So declared Ronald Reagan in 1982, as he signed the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act.
 He was, as it happened, wrong about solving the problems of the thrifts. On the contrary, the bill turned the modest-sized troubles of savings-and-loan institutions into an utter catastrophe. But he was right about the legislation's significance. And as for that jackpot -- well, it finally came more than 25 years later, in the form of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. 
 For the more one looks into the origins of the current disaster, the clearer it becomes that the key wrong turn -- the turn that made crisis inevitable -- took place in the early 1980s, during the Reagan years.
 Attacks on Reaganomics usually focus on rising inequality and fiscal irresponsibility. Indeed, Reagan ushered in an era in which a small minority grew vastly rich, while working families saw only meager gains. He also broke with longstanding rules of fiscal prudence. 
 On the latter point: traditionally, the U.S. government ran significant budget deficits only in times of war or economic emergency. Federal debt as a percentage of G.D.P. fell steadily from the end of World War II until 1980. But indebtedness began rising under Reagan; it fell again in the Clinton years, but resumed its rise under the Bush administration, leaving us ill prepared for the emergency now upon us.
 The increase in public debt was, however, dwarfed by the rise in private debt, made possible by financial deregulation. The change in America's financial rules was Reagan's biggest legacy. And it's the gift that keeps on taking.
 The immediate effect of Garn-St. Germain, as I said, was to turn the thrifts from a problem into a catastrophe. The S.& L. crisis has been written out of the Reagan hagiography, but the fact is that deregulation in effect gave the industry -- whose deposits were federally insured -- a license to gamble with taxpayers' money, at best, or simply to loot it, at worst. By the time the government closed the books on the affair, taxpayers had lost $130 billion, back when that was a lot of money. 
 But there was also a longer-term effect. Reagan-era legislative changes essentially ended New Deal restrictions on mortgage lending -- restrictions that, in particular, limited the ability of families to buy homes without putting a significant amount of money down. 
 These restrictions were put in place in the 1930s by political leaders who had just experienced a terrible financial crisis, and were trying to prevent another. But by 1980 the memory of the Depression had faded. Government, declared Reagan, is the problem, not the solution; the magic of the marketplace must be set free. And so the precautionary rules were scrapped.
 Together with looser lending standards for other kinds of consumer credit, this led to a radical change in American behavior.
 We weren't always a nation of big debts and low savings: in the 1970s Americans saved almost 10 percent of their income, slightly more than in the 1960s. It was only after the Reagan deregulation that thrift gradually disappeared from the American way of life, culminating in the near-zero savings rate that prevailed on the eve of the great crisis. Household debt was only 60 percent of income when Reagan took office, about the same as it was during the Kennedy administration. By 2007 it was up to 119 percent.
 All this, we were assured, was a good thing: sure, Americans were piling up debt, and they weren't putting aside any of their income, but their finances looked fine once you took into account the rising values of their houses and their stock portfolios. Oops.
 Now, the proximate causes of today's economic crisis lie in events that took place long after Reagan left office -- in the global savings glut created by surpluses in China and elsewhere, and in the giant housing bubble that savings glut helped inflate. 
 But it was the explosion of debt over the previous quarter-century that made the U.S. economy so vulnerable. Overstretched borrowers were bound to start defaulting in large numbers once the housing bubble burst and unemployment began to rise. 
 These defaults in turn wreaked havoc with a financial system that -- also mainly thanks to Reagan-era deregulation -- took on too much risk with too little capital.
 There's plenty of blame to go around these days. But the prime villains behind the mess we're in were Reagan and his circle of advisers -- men who forgot the lessons of America's last great financial crisis, and condemned the rest of us to repeat it.

HEADLINE: In Race for Governor, Republican Rivals in New Jersey Plead for Turnout

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HAMILTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
The two Republicans vying to challenge New Jersey's unpopular Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine, crisscrossed the state on Sunday, scrounging for people who will show up for the primary election on Tuesday and telling them their votes would matter that much more.
 ''This is going to be the most important Republican primary in the nation!'' shouted Steven M. Lonegan, the ultraconservative candidate, as he urged voters in Ocean City to cast their ballots as much for him as ''against the Republican party bosses and their record of miserable failure.'' 
 His more centrist rival, Christopher J. Christie, a former prosecutor with a healthy lead in the polls and the backing of the party's moderate establishment, pleaded for a chance to give Mr. Corzine the boot in November and revive New Jersey's victory-starved Republican Party. 
 ''We really have to show some hope here in the Northeast,'' Mr. Christie said in Millville, near Delaware Bay, after riding in the pace lap of a classic cars race at the New Jersey Motorsports Park.
 On a day that began with thunderstorms but gave way to broiling sun, the two contenders each made their way from South Jersey to the north, revving up mostly small but enthusiastic crowds. At diners, firehouses, town squares and a crawfish festival, they promised swift, bold changes in a financial crisis marked by choking debt, recurring deficits and grim choices between cutting services and raising taxes. And they promised to reverse what they said was an exodus of hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans and jobs to states where it is less expensive to live and do business.
 Mr. Christie largely ignored Mr. Lonegan, except to urge supporters to ''dig in'' and help get out the vote. He said his volunteers had made 21,000 calls on Saturday and expected more of the same until the polls close. ''We don't want any surprises on Tuesday night,'' he told about 100 supporters outside the Burlington County Republican headquarters in Mount Holly.
 But at a rally an hour later in Hamilton, a Trenton suburb, his crowd of only 20 or so was outnumbered by the organizers. ''Our biggest challenge, as we're 72 hours away from this election, is no longer Steve Lonegan,'' Mr. Christie said. ''The biggest challenge we face is complacency.'' 
 Getting out the vote for a primary is usually a challenge, even in a governor's race; in 2005, only 12 percent of eligible voters participated in the New Jersey primary.
 Mr. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, in Bergen County, ripped into Mr. Christie all day long and used even stronger language to criticize Republican moderates. He urged 40 people at Music Pier in Ocean City to ''stand up against the mushy, moderate middle'' -- perhaps also a figurative jab at Mr. Christie, who is not shy about professing his weakness for doughnuts.
 Later, before a larger, louder crowd at an American Legion hall in Rockaway, in Morris County, Mr. Lonegan said Tuesday's vote was ''not just a primary, it's a revolution,'' adding: ''We're going to decide what the Republican Party stands for, not only in New Jersey but also in the nation.''
 Mr. Lonegan's talk is belied somewhat by his double-digit deficit in recent voter surveys, but participation in primaries is typically so sparse that conservatives, often motivated by social issues, have pulled off shockers before.
 Their candidates have failed in general elections in New Jersey, though. The last Republican to win any statewide election was another moderate, Christie Whitman; she won two terms, beginning in 1994, before heading to Washington to head the Environmental Protection Agency, but left what critics said was a legacy of debt that is now hobbling state finances.
 Mr. Corzine took office vowing to solve those problems. But Mr. Christie says the governor has failed. He drew roars of approval when he promised to ''show Jon Corzine out of the statehouse and back to Illinois where he belongs.''
 Mr. Corzine, a native of Illinois farm country and veteran of Wall Street who has been faulted for not relating well to everyday New Jerseyans, spent part of his day walking in the Salute to Israel parade in Manhattan.
 Mr. Christie also took note of about $1.2 million in attack ads that he said Democrats have run against him so far, saying that Mr. Corzine had spent $100 million to ''buy the Democratic Party, lock, stock and barrel,'' and now wanted to control Republicans, too, by trying to tip the primary to Mr. Lonegan.
 But Mr. Corzine will have more advantages than money and incumbency going for him in the general election. His campaign announced on Saturday that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would appear with him at his fall campaign kickoff party on Tuesday night.
 New Jersey voters will choose nominees for governor and General Assembly in primary elections on Tuesday.
 GOVERNOR The Republican candidates are Christopher J. Christie, the former United States attorney for New Jersey; Steven M. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota; and Rick Merkt, an assemblyman from Morris County.
 The winner will face the incumbent, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who is opposed in the Democratic primary by three little-known candidates: Roger Bacon, Carl A. Bergmanson and Jeff Boss.
 STATE SENATE There is also a hotly contested Republican primary for a special election to the State Senate in the 23rd Legislative District, which spans Hunterdon and Warren Counties: Marcia A. Karrow, the incumbent, is being challenged by Assemblyman Michael J. Doherty. The seat was vacated in January by Leonard Lance after his election to Congress.
 Ms. Karrow, previously an assemblywoman, was elected by a convention of Republican committee members. Mr. Doherty is giving up his Assembly seat to challenge her again, this time before the voters.
 Polls are open on Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Voters can find their polling places at the Web site of the New Jersey Department of State: https://voter.njsvrs.com/PublicAccess/jsp/PollPlace/PollPlaceSearch.jsp.

HEADLINE: In Beijing, Geithner Emphasizes Cooperation

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Monday that the global financial crisis seemed to be easing, but that the United States and China would have to work together to rebalance the world economy. 
 In a speech at Peking University, Mr. Geithner encouraged China to diversify its economy away from a heavy reliance on exports while offering Beijing assurances that Washington intended to tackle its deficit and protect the value of China's huge investments in United States government debt.
 In his first visit to Beijing since becoming treasury secretary, Mr. Geithner also is scheduled to meet on Tuesday with President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
 Under the pressures of the global economic crisis, relations between the United States and China are undergoing some fundamental changes, and China is growing more assertive on the international stage.
 China is now the largest holder of United States government debt, and a growing number of Chinese officials and economists have expressed concern in recent months that the value of those debt holdings will plunge if inflation takes off or the dollar weakens because of bigger deficits. In fact, interest rates on United States Treasury notes have been rising lately, cutting their value by just over 5 percent. 
 Some Chinese economists are pressing Beijing to slow its accumulation of Treasury bills and are even pushing for the creation of an alternative reserve currency as a hedge against the dollar.
 Concerns about the dollar and the stability of the American economy have led the Obama administration to take a conciliatory tone with China and to search for ways to coordinate efforts with Beijing to combat the global financial crisis.
 In his speech, Mr. Geithner encouraged Beijing to work with Washington to create more balanced, sustainable growth for the nations' economies. ''China and the United States individually and together are so important in the global economy and financial system that what we do has a direct impact on the stability and strength of the international economic system,'' he said.
 Some economists have long argued that China's currency is kept intentionally weak in order to spur exports to the United States, and Mr. Geithner did urge China to move toward a more flexible exchange rate. 
 Currency debates and trade frictions had flared during the Bush administration, even though relations were solid over all. For now, the Obama administration seems determined to avoid tense issues and to search for ways to cooperate with China. 
 Under President George W. Bush, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. held regular meetings with his counterparts in Beijing as part of the so-called the strategic economic dialogue. The Obama administration has decided to broaden those discussions, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton taking part, in what is now being called the strategic and economic dialogue.

HEADLINE: Bad Blood on the Tracks

BYLINE: By ELLIOT G. SANDER. 
Elliot G. Sander was the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from January 2007 until last month.

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S straphangers breathed a collective sigh of relief last month when Gov. David Paterson and the Legislature offered up $1.8 billion to allow the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to impose only modest fare increases and make no deep cuts in subway, bus and commuter-rail service. But in the political process that led up to this rescue, damage was inflicted on the M.T.A.'s reputation. 
 Elected state and city officials leveled the old and discredited accusation that the agency keeps two sets of books, one real and one for public consumption, and suggested that agency officials were untrustworthy and corrupt, comparing them to Bernard Madoff, the self-confessed mastermind of an enormous Ponzi scheme. These false charges landed enough sensational headlines to help camouflage the politicians' own inability to reach a timely agreement on how to finance public transportation. 
 The M.T.A.'s shortcomings are well known: crowded subway cars (ridership has increased by 50 percent in the past decade), outdated signal technology that limits the number of trains that can run per hour, decaying subway stations, buses stuck in traffic, the still incomplete Second Avenue line. But long-time New Yorkers who remember the transit system's sorry state during the 1970s know how much it has improved in 25 years. Even today, despite a global recession, the agency continues to make progress. 
 In March, on-time performance for the subway system's seven numbered lines rose by 3 percent overall and by as much as 11 percent on some lines. These improvements came after each line was assigned a general manager responsible for improving service. 
 The M.T.A. has long been burdened by convoluted and overlapping operating charters, work rules and politically dictated mandates. But during my two years as chief executive we made significant progress in consolidating the back office functions of seven regional agencies -- those in charge of trains and buses as well as bridges and tunnels. We arranged for the two commuter railroads, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, to save money by jointly purchasing equipment and supplies. And we merged what had been three bus companies into one. 
 Only with genuine support from our elected officials can the next chief executive keep improving the transit system. With enough financing, for example, the M.T.A. could form a single regional bus authority to provide seamless service from Suffolk County to Westchester County. And with the Legislature's political support for labor negotiations, the agency would be better positioned to conduct serious and respectful conversations with its nearly 60 unions about modernizing work rules to increase productivity and embrace new operating technologies. 
 The Legislature and the governor have allocated enough money to cover the first two years of the M.T.A.'s new five-year plan to rebuild and improve tracks, signals, stations, buses and trains, and that's a decent down payment. But it's wrong to retreat from the practice of fully financing the M.T.A.'s five-year capital programs, which a former M.T.A. chairman, Richard Ravitch, instituted in the 1980s. Two decades and $76 billion later, New York's century-old transit network is reliable and functional. 
 With an adequate budget, the M.T.A. could not only maintain but also expand the transportation system. Rather than just finish projects under way -- the first phase of the Second Avenue line, the extension of the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal and of the 7 train to Manhattan's far West Side -- we could extend the Second Avenue line into Brooklyn and the Bronx, have Metro-North service at Penn Station, modernize the subway signal system and provide high-speed buses to underserved city neighborhoods as well as Long Island and the Hudson Valley.
 This summer, the M.T.A. and New Jersey Transit will cooperate to run trains from New Haven to the New Jersey Meadowlands. This experiment could become a model for other cross-region trains, allowing commuters a single-seat ride from Montauk, N.Y., to Trenton, or from White Plains, in Westchester, to Hicksville, on Long Island, speeding past irrelevant transit-agency borders and revolutionizing the way people move around the region.
 The governor has begun an international search for a new M.T.A. chief executive. All of us should wish that whoever takes the helm gets the backing of all of New York's elected leaders. As the people who call the shots on M.T.A. financing, they really are the agency's shadow board of directors. 
 If, on the other hand, politicians continue to run against the M.T.A., their rhetoric may become self-fulfilling prophecy, and the system may devolve into the state of dysfunction they denounce.

HEADLINE: Owning G.M.

 BODY:
The government is about to own a controlling stake in one of the largest car companies in the world, if, as is virtually certain, General Motors files for bankruptcy protection on Monday. If all goes according to plan, the American and Canadian governments will own nearly 75 percent of the company that emerges from the process -- and could end up holding their stake for several years. 
 President Obama owes American taxpayers and voters a candid and detailed explanation of the government's goals and the levers it intends to use to achieve them. He should make clear that the overarching objectives are to create a profitable company that makes cars that people want to buy, and that are more fuel-efficient.
 In particular, he should be explicit about how the government will handle the conflicts between those goals, the administration's perception of the public interest and the narrower goals of members of Congress.
 Owning a car company like G.M. is likely to be politically trickier than it appears at first blush. The administration's insistence that it has no intention of getting involved in the day-to-day decisions of General Motors is a reasonable response to concerns that the vagaries of the political process could run the company into the ground.
 We agree that if taxpayers' interests as shareholders are to be protected, G.M. cannot be micromanaged from Washington. Neither the Treasury nor members of Congress should decide which plants or dealerships are to be closed, how many workers are to be laid off or hired, what specific designs G.M. adopts and where it should make them. If the objective is to turn G.M. into a profitable carmaker as soon as possible so it can be sold back into private hands, it is a sound decision to let professionals run the company.
 The government would still have the votes to appoint a majority of the members of the board, and should make certain that its appointees are dedicated to the big goals of profitability and fuel-efficiency. 
 Mr. Obama must tell the American people that these, indeed, are the overriding objectives. The decisions of G.M.'s new managers should not become entangled with the government's other policy priorities -- such as maximizing employment in the United States or reducing job losses in Michigan. And he should specify what is supposed to happen if the goals of profitability and fuel efficiency collide.
 It was only March when the Obama administration let G.M. slide toward bankruptcy by denying it more taxpayer money, partly on the grounds that the company was too heavily dependent on S.U.V.'s., while its biggest stab at fuel economy, the Volt, was too expensive to work in the near future. Since then, a government task force has been deeply involved in all sorts of strategic decisions about the structure of the company's operations. 
 It is not unimaginable that the government could have similar qualms about G.M.'s strategy in the future and may want to intervene again. The president should tell Americans what to expect if that time comes.

HEADLINE: No Winners on the Horizon in Somalia's Long Battle With Chaos

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
Somalia is once again a raging battle zone, with jihadists pouring in from overseas, preparing for a final push to topple the transitional government.
 The government is begging for help, saying that more peacekeepers, more money and more guns could turn the tide against the Islamist radicals.
 But the reality may be uglier than either side is willing to admit: Somalia has become the war that nobody can win, at least not right now. 
 None of the factions -- the moderate Islamist government, the radical Shabab militants, the Sufi clerics who control some parts of central Somalia, the clan militias who control others, the autonomous government of Somaliland in the northwest and the semiautonomous government of Puntland in the northeast -- seem powerful enough, organized enough or popular enough to overpower the other contenders and end the violence that has killed thousands over the past two years. 
 Somalia analysts say the main event, the government versus the Shabab, will drag on for months, fueled by outside support on both sides. The United Nations and Western countries see the transitional government, however feeble, as their best bulwark against piracy and Islamist extremism in Somalia, and are pumping in hundreds of millions of dollars for the government's security. At the same time, the Shabab are kept afloat by an influx of weapons and fighters, much of it reported to be flowing through neighboring Eritrea. 
 The Shabab, more than anyone else, have succeeded in internationalizing Somalia's conflict and using their jihadist dreams to draw in foreign fighters from around the globe, including the United States. The Shabab, whose name means youth in Arabic, are a mostly under-40 militia who espouse the strict Wahhabi version of Islam and are guided, according to American diplomats, by another, better-known Wahhabi group: Al Qaeda. 
 Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the top United Nations envoy for Somalia, said that there were now several hundred foreign jihadists fighting for the Shabab. He noted that they were ''more motivated, better organized and better trained'' than typical Somali street fighters, who tend to be teenagers paid a few dollars a day to charge blindly into battle with rusty Kalashnikov rifles. These young combatants know as much about military tactics as they do about school, which is not a lot. Class has essentially been out for the past 18 years, since Somalia's central government collapsed.
 But the Shabab have limitations, too. In the past few weeks, the Shabab and their allies all but seized Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and sealed the escape routes out of the city. In the end, though, they were unable to overrun those very last, but strategically vital, areas the government still controls, like the port, the airport and the hilltop presidential palace.
 The new Shabab overseas recruits have imported to Somalia the tricks of Al Qaeda's trade, like remote-controlled explosives and suicide bombs. But as Iraq and Sri Lanka have shown, insurgents need more than suicide bombs to take over a country. They need overwhelming force, or a persuasive ideology and governing strategy, all of which the Shabab currently lack. The only role that seems fit for them right now is that of spoiler.
 ''The Shabab can't govern,'' said Hassan Gabre, a retired engineer in Mogadishu. He said the Shabab were simply part of Somalia's industry of violence, trying to defend ''the anarchy regime.''
 Shabab clerics are quick to put their austere version of Islam into effect in the territory they seize, recently amputating the hand of a convicted thief and then dangling the lifeless, bloody results in front of a shocked crowd in Kismayo, a port town in southern Somalia. But this may be just a gruesome side show.
 Mr. Ould-Abdallah spoke of a ''hidden agenda'' and suggested that the real reason the Shabab and their allies were in control of Kismayo was a confluence of sinister business interests like gun-running, human smuggling and the underground charcoal trade.
 ''There's an economic dimension here,'' he said.
 It was not always like this. The Shabab were a crucial part of a functioning mini-government in 2006, when an alliance of Islamic courts briefly controlled much of south-central Somalia. The Shabab's controversial religious policies were tempered then by moderate Islamists, who delivered services like neighborhood clean-ups and community policing, and as a result the whole Islamic movement won grass-roots support. In the end, the experiment lasted only six months, until Ethiopian troops, backed by American military forces, invaded and drove the Islamists underground.
 That intervention failed. The Islamists returned as a fearsome guerrilla force and the Ethiopians pulled out this January, setting Somalia more or less back to where it had been in 2006, with 17,000 people killed in the process (according to Somali human rights groups). Moderate Islamist leaders then took over the transitional government, nominally protected by 4,300 African Union peacekeepers.
 But no one is especially well liked in Mogadishu these days, not even the peacekeepers, who may have the most dangerous peacekeeping mission of all. Many Somalis turned against them after a deadly episode in February when a roadside blast hit an African Union truck and the peacekeepers responded by firing wildly into a crowded street. According to Somali officials, the peacekeepers killed 39 civilians, though the African Union said that the true figure was much lower and that the people had died in a cross-fire. Radical Islamists are now calling the African troops ''bacteria.''
 All this could be an opportunity for the transitional government. After all, the new president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, rose to popularity as a neighborhood problem solver, best known for helping free kidnapped children.
 But Sheik Sharif's government seems hobbled by the same tired, intractable clan divisions and lack of skills that torpedoed the 14 previous transitional governments. There have been glimmers of hope, such as the government passing a national budget for the first time in years and using legitimate tax money from Mogadishu's port to pay its soldiers. But the bigger picture is grim. In the past few weeks, it proved very difficult for the government even to organize its various militias to jointly defend the few blocks it still controls.
 The pattern is clear, and may not be broken anytime soon: A weak government means more violence, means weaker government, which means still more violence, and so on. 
 ''With all the fighting that's going on, this government can't attract the best Somalis,'' said Mohamed Osman Aden, a Somali diplomat in Kenya. ''The good Somalis are not going to come when it's so violent. Would you?''

HEADLINE: Money Sent Home by Mexican Workers in U.S. Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
The amount of money sent home in April by Mexicans working in the United States fell by almost one-fifth compared with a year earlier, the central bank said Monday, marking the largest decline since the authorities began keeping track of such transfers. 
 Remittances, as the transfers are known, have been sliding since the end of 2007, when the construction industry in the United States began its sharp decline. Many Mexicans who had found work in building and landscaping during the boom years quickly lost their jobs. Then, as the overall United States economy fell into a recession, Mexicans in other industries, including restaurants and manufacturing, also lost their jobs. 
 But the pace of decline in the money transfers gathered speed this year, falling 8.7 percent over the first four months compared with the same period last year, the central bank, the Bank of Mexico, reported. Migrants sent $1.8 billion in April, 18.7 percent less than in April 2008. 
 There is no single explanation for the sharper drop in April, said Eliseo Diaz Gonzalez, an economist who studies remittances at the College of the Northern Border outside Tijuana. 
 Migrants have either lost their jobs or taken jobs with lower pay. At the same time, without good prospects of finding work in the United States, many Mexicans have decided not to risk crossing the border illegally. 
 ''We are seeing the aggravation of all these trends,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''With opportunities for employment in the United States shutting off, we cannot continue to export labor to the United States anymore. The prize for migrating no longer exists.'' 
 Philip Martin, an expert on migration at the University of California, Davis, said it was too early to say if the sharp drop would be repeated in the statistics for May. ''It's going to be down in 2009,'' he said, ''but the question is how much.'' 
 Along with the big jump in unemployment in construction and the decline in new arrivals -- who tend to send more money -- Mr. Martin said a possible factor in the newly released figures was that some illegal immigrants might have paid taxes in April in the hope of an eventual amnesty. 
 Last year, remittances fell 3.6 percent compared with the previous year, to $25 billion. In a recent report, the Bank of Mexico said Mexicans in the United States were disproportionately employed in sectors of the economy, like construction, that had declined the fastest. In addition, a crackdown on illegal immigration, both along the border and in the workplace, has made it harder for Mexicans to find jobs. 
 Although remittances are one of Mexico's largest single sources of foreign exchange, their effect is concentrated in particular states and regions. Remittances have helped to reduce poverty in those areas, but that could be reversed if the steep decline continues, Mr. Diaz said. 
 April was a particularly difficult month for the Mexican economy. Another source of foreign exchange, the tourism industry, was devastated in April by the outbreak of swine flu.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sale of European Units Keeps Them Out of the Fray

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
While the future of the American operations of General Motors is in the hands of a federal bankruptcy judge, Opel and the rest of G.M.'s European business escaped that fate with help from the German government as well as Magna International, the Canadian auto parts maker set to acquire Opel. 
 The Berlin government, under heavy political pressure in an election year to save nearly 25,000 Opel jobs in Germany, brokered a deal over the weekend for an alliance led by Magna and the Russian bank Sberbank to acquire the carmaker and to provide 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in bridge financing.
 As a result, G.M.'s European operations, which include Opel, as well as Vauxhall, a venerable British brand, were not included in the American filing. 
 ''With the financing, even with the G.M. actions in the U.S., we can now confidently say to our employees, customers, suppliers and dealers that it's business as usual as we go through the process of creating a new, more independent Opel/Vauxhall,'' said Carl-Peter Forster, the president of G.M. Europe, who will run the new company.
 Workers outside Germany, however, fear they could pay a price for Berlin's role in providing crucial financing. As part of the deal, Magna is expected to try to keep German job losses down, setting off complaints by union leaders in Britain and Belgium that G.M. workers there will bear the brunt of layoffs. 
 More than 2,000 workers are employed at a G.M. plant in Antwerp that G.M. has long sought to close, and nearly 5,000 in Britain. But Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who will soon face elections, also vowed to protect G.M. workers at home. 
 The tensions over the issue of protecting local workers versus sticking with the single-market vision of the 27-member European Union will probably continue even after the Magna deal for Opel is completed. France has also sought to safeguard domestic auto industry jobs, infuriating newer members of the European Union in Central Europe that are home to auto plants.
 Risking billions in loan guarantees and other aid for a single company has also stirred criticism. On Sunday, the German economy minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, offered his resignation and warned in an interview with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag that the ''concept is not without risks for the state and the guarantees it has promised for Opel.''

HEADLINE: Workers' Wages at Issue In Subsidized Housing

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

DATELINE: Two seemingly like-minded political allies 

 BODY:
-- labor unions and nonprofit developers of lower-cost housing -- have taken opposing sides in Albany over a bill that would require the developers to pay construction workers the prevailing wage, essentially a union-level wage far higher than nonunion pay. 
 The developers, many of whom rely on government subsidies to build housing for low- and moderate-income families, say the bill would cut the production in half and increase rents at a vulnerable time for the industry, when the economic downturn has hampered the financing of low-cost housing. Supporters, however, argue that a prevailing-wage law would ensure quality construction and a decent standard of living for workers. 
 The bill, introduced in the Assembly in January and in the State Senate in April, would require developers of government-subsidized residential housing projects to pay the prevailing wage. It will be debated as part of committee hearings in Albany on Tuesday. Another bill in the Assembly and the Senate would require prevailing wages on projects financed by industrial development agencies.
 Under state law, laborers on public works projects must be paid the prevailing wage, which varies according to the trade and location. The proposed legislation would expand the definition of public works to include all government-subsidized building projects by for-profit and nonprofit developers. Most workers who build subsidized low-cost housing in New York City are not currently required to be paid the prevailing wage. Projects receiving federal subsidies are required to pay it, under federal law.
 ''There is always arguing about what is public work and what is not public work,'' Assemblywoman Susan V. John of Rochester, chairwoman of the Assembly's Labor Committee, who introduced the bill, said in a phone interview on Monday. ''This is an effort to try to clear it up.'' 
 A report released last year by a nonprofit policy research group found that imposing prevailing wages on low- or moderate-cost housing projects could increase total development costs by about 25 percent and increase rents in a typical apartment by about $400 a month. The report was prepared by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which is made up of housing developers, construction company executives, bankers and academics. 
 The median nonunion wage for New York City construction workers in selected trades was $13.50 an hour in 2007, and the union median wage was $19.57, according to the report. Because of the increased costs associated with paying the prevailing wage, developers would need larger government subsidies to build the same number of units, according to the report. 
 ''It will mean a lot of projects will not be feasible, or in order to make them feasible, they would be feasible for higher-income residents,'' said Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit lending consortium that has financed about 125,000 low-cost units around the state. ''It will really have a direct impact on all the affordable housing being done. Much of that affordable housing is what has rebuilt New York's urban neighborhoods.''
 The New York State Building and Construction Trades Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., an influential labor group that represents the state's major construction unions, has been pushing lawmakers to expand the prevailing-wage requirements for years.
 ''Is the cost of construction higher? Yes it is,'' said Edward J. Malloy, president of the group. ''But I think we deliver a better product, on time and in budget.'' 
 Phillip Morrow, president and chief executive of the nonprofit South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which builds low-cost units, said the financial impact of paying the prevailing wage was only one concern. Mr. Morrow said he also worried that the nonunion, largely black and Hispanic work force that builds these projects would be replaced with mostly white union labor. ''The unions don't have the best record for employing minority workers and workers from the community,'' he said.
 Mr. Morrow said that if he had to pay the prevailing wage, his options would be limited. ''We're going to ask for more public dollars. In the Bronx, we don't have the option of raising the rents. The market is not going to support these higher rents. We have to get more subsidy per unit.''
 Opponents of the bill said federally financed projects receive additional money in order to pay the prevailing wage, but the proposed state legislation includes no extra financing. They said that because many of these projects receive private financing, they should not be considered public works, like schools or roads. ''It's absurd,'' Mr. Lappin said. ''Who thinks of public works as a 40-unit apartment building in the Bronx that needs some public help to keep it affordable?''
 Assemblywoman John said developments such as Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, a residential and commercial project for which the city and the state have agreed to provide subsidies, were clearly public works. ''I do believe that it's important that we uphold the provisions of our State Constitution that say that when we're spending tax money, people are paid prevailing wage,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Asia Production Up as Europe's Falls Less

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity rose in China and India in May, while the rate of decline in manufacturing in the euro zone slowed, according to data released Monday. 
 The figures appeared to show that the interest rate cuts and stimulus measures adopted quickly by governments around the world since late last year were beginning to affect the global economy. The data also highlighted the gap between the rate of recovery in Asia and that in Europe. 
 While the manufacturing sectors in China and India have expanded for two or three consecutive months, manufacturing activity in the euro zone continued to shrink last month -- albeit at a much slower pace than early this year.
 China's official purchasing managers' index came in at 53.1, the third successive month that the reading was above the 50-point level that separates expansion and contraction. The April reading was 53.5. 
 ''For the first time, the P.M.I. shows genuine evidence that policy really is gaining traction,'' Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA, an Asian brokerage firm, said in a research note. He added that the results pointed to months of sustained output growth.
 The reports bolstered the view of many economists that China's gross domestic product, helped by the government's ability to deploy vast amounts of cash to support growth, could expand by about 8 percent this year.
 Although that rate of growth would be well below the double-digit rates of recent years, it would contrast starkly with the recessions in most other large economies.
 India, which is less reliant on exports than many other emerging economies in Asia, is also expected to have significant growth this year. A purchasing managers' index there was at 55.7 in May, the second month of expansion after an April reading of 53.3.
 By contrast, the May purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector in the euro zone remained well below the 50-point level, though it improved to 40.7, from 36.8 in April.
 Taken together, the data appeared to indicate that a global recovery remains some way off and is likely to be feeble.
 Even in Asia, which was relatively insulated from the initial financial crisis, renewed growth will be hampered by weak demand in the United States and Europe for Asian goods.

HEADLINE: The Traveler's Upper Hand

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
This may actually be a good time to be a business traveler.
 Industry experts and travelers say service has improved in many ways, prices are down, and the experience, in general, is often better than it has been in a long while. 
 ''In a sense, it is easier and cheaper to be a business traveler these days,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Forrester Research. ''There is an approximately 20 percent decline in the number of people traveling for business. Airlines are putting coach and premium-class service on domestic and international flights on sale. It's easier to snag upgrades. And business travelers are generally able to get rooms at hotels they want at a decent price point.'' 
 Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, agreed. ''Every guest is being treated like a V.I.P.,'' Mr. Hanson said, at both midprice and luxury hotels, because fewer people are traveling. Room assignments are being made in a ''much more thoughtful'' way, he said, and repeat guests are being offered free nights, airport transfers and free use of fitness equipment or the Internet, among other amenities. 
 Carla DeLuca, a marketing consultant in San Francisco, for instance, said she was able to take advantage of declining air fares. She bought a round-trip, three-day advance purchase ticket between San Francisco and New York from JetBlue for less than $300 in early February to see a prospective client. 
 ''I found out three days before that I had an opportunity to go to New York for a meeting,'' Ms. DeLuca said. ''The flights were so inexpensive, I could justify it.'' 
 David Grayson, managing director of Auerbach Grayson & Company, a brokerage in New York, said that in January he called a hotel in London where he regularly stays and asked if it would reduce his normal room rate. The hotel cut the rate by around $145 and gave him an English breakfast.
 Not surprisingly, Tim Winship, editor at large for SmarterTravel.com, said loyalty programs were being especially generous. This year, most hotel loyalty programs have been offering perks like double points for a stay or a free room night after two stays. Although most of these expired April 30, Mr. Winship said he expected the bonuses to be extended or similar ones offered. 
 In March, American Airlines said its frequent fliers could earn double elite status qualifying miles if they travel by June 15, an offer that was quickly matched by its competitors. A promotion like American's is ''typically an end of the year thing, when people tend to take stock of where they are so they can reach elite status,'' Mr. Winship said. ''This promotion is unusual in its timing and its widespread adoption.'' 
 Still, the downturn in travel has its drawbacks as well as benefits for travelers. Ted Stimpson, president of Imagitas, a marketing services company in Waltham, Mass., said that on the plus side ''airports are a pleasure now, there's nobody there.'' And parking is easier. ''There are shorter lines.'' 
 But, he added, the fees for checked bags mean that once on the plane, ''there's a mad rush to get baggage into the space above the seats, and there is never enough.''
 Some travelers said they have experienced more cancellations than before, because of capacity cuts.
 Since January, Keith Bronitt, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., said he had bought a ticket for an Air Canada flight and another for a US Airways flight, both out of La Guardia and departing at midday, that were canceled and combined with later flights. In the future, he said, he may book flights earlier in the day to try to avoid cancellations. ''Instead of spending more time in the office,'' he said, ''I'll be spending it in the airport or on a plane, or I'll get to my destination earlier than I need.'' 
 Chris Kenworthy, a senior vice president at McAfee, the antivirus software company, and a participant in Marriott's loyalty program, said he used to regularly eat a free breakfast of bacon and eggs at the concierge club in the Santa Clara Marriott in California.
 ''It helps me keep my costs down,'' he said. ''But suddenly there's been no more bacon. It's a whole new world.''
 And, he said, when he is on extended business trips overseas, he often spends weekends in London but has found that the Marriott concierge clubs there are closed on weekends.
 But, in general, the travel experience has improved, travelers said, as airlines and hotels vie for customer loyalty.
 Jim Graham, a Singapore-based sales director for Avid Technology in Boston and a participant in United Airlines' loyalty program, said that on a third of his flights in the last year, the lead attendant or the pilot has approached him to thank him for his business.
 ''That used to happen maybe once a year,'' Mr. Graham said. 
 Similarly, Robert C. Landis, a vice president for Raymond James Tax Credit Funds in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he was waiting for a late US Airways flight at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in February when a pilot appeared in the gate area to explain the delay. ''I've never seen that before,'' Mr. Landis said. ''I was kind of impressed.'' 
 Some things, however, never seem to change. 
 Gary E. Hayes, a consultant in New York who often visits London, said he found that it continued to be hit or miss whether cab drivers at Heathrow Airport accept credit cards.
 ''It's somewhat surprising in this climate,'' Mr. Hayes said, ''that a lot of travel-related businesses haven't stepped up their level of service.''

HEADLINE: Mayor and Council Agree On 2 Sales Tax Measures

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has backed down on a plan to charge a 5-cent fee on plastic shopping bags and to add sales tax on all clothing purchases as part of a budget agreement reached with the City Council on Monday night, aides said. 
 To close a gap of about $1 billion in next year's budget, Mr. Bloomberg and the Council have instead proposed increasing the city's sales tax by half a percentage point, to 8.875 percent. In addition, the city would begin charging sales tax on clothing over $110. All clothing was previously exempt from such taxes.
 A typical household in New York City making $35,000 a year would have to pay an extra $74 a year in sales taxes, clothing included, according to estimates by the city's Independent Budget Office. A household making $125,000 would pay an additional $237 a year, and one making $500,000 would pay $687 more.
 Mr. Bloomberg said that with the city's tax revenue down $5 billion ''the economic crisis provided us with a menu of onerous options to balance the city's budget.''
 The mayor and the Council have agreed on a package of taxes that will raise $887 million for the 2010 fiscal year, which begins in July. 
 But the tax revenue is about $160 million less than the mayor had originally proposed to balance the budget. The city will probably seek to make up the difference through spending cuts or new taxes. 
 The new tax package must be approved by the State Legislature and the governor. 
 The budget agreement represents a significant victory for the Council and its leader, Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who vigorously opposed the plastic bag fee and sales tax on clothing under $110. 
 The lawmakers had argued that both taxes would have a disproportionate impact on lower-income New Yorkers who are already struggling in a down economy. 
 The clothing tax on items above $110 is specifically aimed at high-end goods. A vast majority of clothing purchases are under $110, Council members argued. The tax on clothing over $110 is expected to raise $119 million. The tax on clothing under $110 was expected to raise $275 million in revenue. 
 Ms. Quinn said the decision to tax high-priced, rather than inexpensive clothing ''will make sure that families aren't taxed on necessities.''

PERSON: Paul Haney 

HEADLINE: Paul Haney, Voice of Mission Control, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Paul Haney, who was known as the voice of NASA's mission control for his live commentary during the Gemini and Apollo space flights in the 1960s, died Thursday in Alamogordo, N.M. He was 80.
 The cause was melanoma, which had spread to the brain, said his wife, Jan.
 It was Mr. Haney's voice as director of public affairs that broadcast audiences heard live from the Houston control room, explaining what was going on. The calmness that the public heard from 1965 to 1969, as Mr. Haney announced tense events like launchings and difficult recoveries, contrasted with some behind-the scenes conflict. 
 Working as a newspaper reporter before and after his time at NASA, Mr. Haney pushed the space agency to share more information with reporters and often clashed with engineers and astronauts who sought to avoid disclosures that might be embarrassing.
 ''He believed it should all be open,'' said Bill Johnson, who worked for Mr. Haney at NASA. ''That was his conflict with the other branches of NASA. Eventually that was what got him fired.''
 One clash in spring 1969 was with Donald K. Slayton, known as Deke, the astronaut who then was head of the astronaut office, over access to a lunar landing practice session by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. 
 Some NASA officials did not want reporters present. Mr. Haney did. In a compromise, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin performed the session twice, once for the officials and once for journalists.
 Mr. Johnson said Mr. Haney profusely thanked the astronauts, who were exhausted by the end of the day, but said the incident was ''the straw that broke the camel's back.'' 
 Mr. Slayton, who died in 1993, maintained a friendship with Mr. Haney in later life. 
 Mr. Haney also had disagreements with Julian Scheer, the top NASA public affairs official in Washington, although they agreed on a need for openness. Mr. Scheer died in 2001. 
 A few days after the clash with Mr. Slayton, Mr. Scheer told Mr. Haney to report to a new post in Washington, far from the main Apollo activities in Houston. 
 In an oral history recorded by the NASA Johnson Space Center in 2003, Mr. Haney recalled that he replied: ''I guess I have some options here, and I choose to exercise one. I quit.'' 
 That was only a few months before the historic moon landing.
 Mr. Haney went to London, where he provided NASA commentary for the Independent Television News in Britain and wrote for The Economist. 
 Paul Prichard Haney was born July 20, 1928, in Akron, Ohio. He worked at night for The Associated Press while attending Kent State University. After receiving a journalism degree in 1945, he worked at several newspapers before moving to The Evening Star in Washington.
 In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite. The newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration was looking for public information officers. Mr. Haney signed on and started work during the week of Christmas in 1958.
 In 1963, after almost leaving NASA for IBM, he became director of public affairs at Johnson, then known as the Manned Space Flight Center. Among his duties, he provided mission commentary of the Gemini and Apollo missions through Apollo 9.
 After leaving NASA, Mr. Haney worked at a variety of jobs, including handling public affairs for the Astrodome in Houston, the Port of Galveston and a broadcast lobbying group. But ''he always went back to newspapering,'' Mrs. Haney said.
 He also worked for newspapers in Houston, Charleston, S.C., and St. Petersburg, Fla. 
 In 1983, he and his wife bought The Homesteader News, a small community newspaper in a town east of El Paso. Mr. Haney was the writer, editor and publisher for six and a half years.
 His first marriage, to Jane Bramley, ended in divorce.
 In addition to his second wife, Jan, Mr. Haney is survived by two daughters, Maura Ford and Megan Reeves, both of El Dorado Hills, Calif.; a stepson, Richard Shrum of El Paso; a sister, Mary Wilson of Stow, Ohio; and seven grandchildren.
 The Haneys eventually moved to High Rolls, N.M., where they bought a cherry orchard. 
 ''At that point, he pretty much retired,'' Mrs. Haney said.
 People would come to pick cherries and talk to Mr. Haney about the space program. ''Oftentimes,'' she said, ''I had no help with the orchard, because he was talking to people.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Tuesday about Paul Haney, the voice of NASA's Mission Control for early manned space flights, misstated the year he received a journalism degree from Kent State University. It was 1949, not 1945. The obituary also misstated the original name of the Johnson Space Center. It was the Manned Spacecraft Center, not the Manned Space Flight Center.

DATELINE: GLENDORA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The world's greatest athlete, as he is often called, pulled a cardboard box from a shelf in the one-car garage of his three-bedroom home. It held his mementos from the Beijing Olympics, not counting the Wheaties boxes with his picture on them stacked on the kitchen counter.
 Bryan Clay pulled out a framed photo. 
 ''This one picture speaks everything to me,'' he said. 
 Shot from a high perch, it showed his faceless silhouette standing alone on the wet track of the Bird's Nest, the Olympic stadium. 
 The decathlon was once a star-making event of the Olympics, but Clay has gone largely unnoticed since winning the gold medal last August. 
 Wait a minute. Where is the gold medal? 
 ''That's a good question,'' Clay said. He pulled open an empty drawer. He shrugged. He seemed unconcerned about the one thing that makes him different from anyone else in the world, but that did not change him much at all. 
 Clay, 29, lives in the same house, drives the same cars (a Chevrolet Tahoe and a Toyota Avalon), and has the same two sponsors (Nike and Hawaii Pacific Health, from his home state) that provide him a comfortable income. He spends most days training at Azusa Pacific University, where he went to college and met Sarah, his wife. They spend most nights at their home, much of which they renovated themselves, with their children, Jacob, 4, and Kate, 2. 
 When Clay returned from a recent workout, Sarah greeted him with news that five tiny tomatoes had sprouted on a plant in the backyard. He was excited to find more. One of the children soon called from the bathroom to have a bottom wiped.
 ''I still have to change diapers, clean the house, fix things,'' Clay said. ''It doesn't change who you are or what it takes to get through day-to-day life. But it was a dream come true.''
 How many world-class athletes dream like this -- for memories in a box, for a medal they cannot find, for few of the tangible prizes that increasingly reward athletic prowess? How is it that backup quarterbacks, utility infielders and winless golf professionals live more extravagantly than someone deemed the world's greatest athlete?
 ''I try not to think about it,'' Clay said. ''You do kind of feel slighted sometimes, just because of all the hard work you put in.''
 He is preparing for the national championships later this month and the world championships in August, his first major competitions since the Beijing Games. Neither will garner much attention in this country. Maybe becoming the first man to win three Olympic decathlon medals (he won silver in 2004 and is aiming for London in 2012) will give Clay wider recognition. Or not. 
 Some people stare and cannot place him. Some confuse him with Tiger Woods, to whom he bears some resemblance. The biggest change for Clay is that more people want more of his time. His BlackBerry is usually filled with messages he has not read or heard. His manager and wife sift through the requests. 
 ''Lots of people want you to do something for free,'' Clay said. ''Which I don't mind, but it's hard to say, 'You know, this is how I make my living.' ''
 Clay was at an event recently with Bruce Jenner, the 1976 Olympic decathlon winner. People zipped past Clay to glimpse Jenner, who may be better known now as the father and stepfather on the E! reality series, ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians.''
 ''You would not believe how many young people knew who Bruce Jenner is,'' Clay said. ''But it's mostly because of the Kardashians.''
 The swimmer Michael Phelps eclipsed all athletes in Beijing, but Clay barely had his 15 minutes of fame in his own sport. Soon after he fell to the track, victorious and exhausted, Jamaica set a world record in the 4x100-meter relay, ushering Clay to the highlight sideline.
 Dan O'Brien understands. He won the 1996 Olympic decathlon gold medal in Atlanta and is now a volunteer track coach at Arizona State. He gives speeches, makes appearances and does infomercials, a sort of mini-Jenner. He recently took part in a Crayola promotion for outdoor exercise by breaking a Guinness hopscotch record. 
 ''When I won the gold medal, I really thought I would wake up the next day and feel different -- Everything's changed for me,'' O'Brien, now 42, said. ''But the hype of the Olympics goes away, they ask you onto the Dave Letterman show and the Jay Leno show only once, and it subsides.''
 He added: ''You still have to figure out: How am I going to make a living the rest of my life? How am I going to parlay this into something? You didn't just sign a 12-year, $100 million contract and never have to work again. That's the difference between our sport and a lot of others.''
 Clay would seem the perfect pitchman -- scandal-free, and with a model's looks. Oh, and by the way, he is the Olympic decathlon champion. A few companies stepped forward after the Games, Clay said, only to retreat with the worsening recession. 
 He is building his fan base, one tweet at a time. As of Monday, he was up to 1,197 followers on Twitter, where he constantly updates his happenings, and is campaigning to reach 8,832 -- his top score in the decathlon. The actor Ashton Kutcher and Oprah Winfrey each have more than a million followers.
 Clay spent a recent day visiting six elementary schools in the high desert towns of Phelan and Hesperia, northeast of Los Angeles, thanking children for participating in a walk-a-thon sponsored by the Bryan Clay Foundation, which benefits children. Dave Stewart, a principal of one of the schools and a longtime workout partner of Clay's, helped organize the event. His first hurdle was to sell the idea to school officials after the Olympics.
 ''I asked people, 'How many of you remember Bruce Jenner?' '' Stewart said. ''Everyone raised their hand. I said: 'How big a deal would it have been if Bruce Jenner had come to your school right after he won the gold medal when he was a kid? How many of you would still remember that today?' ''
 About 4,000 students raised more than $65,000. Clay presented new Nikes to each school's top earner. He answered questions, signed autographs and smiled for photographs. Children, teachers and school officials were smitten. 
 It was stifling hot two days later as Clay trained at Azusa Pacific. A small canopy provided shade, a mango-flavored smoothie offered relief, and a portable radio supplied a top-40 soundtrack. The longtime coach Kevin Reid and a few other track athletes were there.
 News had just broken that the Dodgers slugger Manny Ramirez was suspended for violating baseball's drug policy. Someone mentioned that he would lose $7.7 million of his salary for missing 50 games -- about two months of work.
 ''Success, how good you are, seems to be defined by how much money you make,'' Clay had said two days before. ''That's just crazy to me.''
 He positioned himself in the starting blocks. A gun went off. Clay sprinted and hurdled, sprinted and hurdled down the straightaway in front of an empty grandstand. 
 A teenage girl approached as he walked back. 
 ''Are you the one that won the medal at the Olympics?'' she asked. 
 Clay smiled. 
 ''Oh my God!'' the girl screamed. She ran to tell a friend. 
 Clay returned to the shade, took a tug of his smoothie and walked to the starting blocks. There were more hurdles to clear.

HEADLINE: Banks May Soon Get Approval To Leave the Bailout Program

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Zachery Kouwe contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Since the government pressed billions of dollars in taxpayer support on the nation's banks, several strong institutions have been pushing to give it back. Now a few of them may get the go-ahead next week -- a crucial step in disentangling themselves from Washington. 
 If federal regulators approve the plans, it would pave the way for a group of large institutions, among them JPMorgan Chase, to leave the bailout program far earlier than many had envisioned. It would also signal that the bankers and regulators believed that the worst was over for these banks, even though confidence in the broader financial industry remained fragile. 
 JPMorgan Chase said on Monday that it expected to reimburse its $25 billion taxpayer investment this month. The bank plans to raise $5 billion of common stock on Tuesday to prove to regulators that it is healthy enough to obtain capital without government support. Goldman Sachs also said it aimed to repay $10 billion in bailout funds this month. 
 The Federal Reserve, which oversees the safety and soundness of the biggest banks, said it planned to announce next week an ''initial set'' of banks that were approved for repayment. The Treasury Department has the final say on whether a bank is allowed to repay the money, and once regulators sign off, the bank may return the money within days. 
 The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was intended last fall as a long-term investment by the government to get the financial industry through the worst crisis since the Depression. But when compensation and other restrictions were attached to calm political furor over Wall Street bonuses, banks lobbied hard for permission to leave the program. 
 Banks have been sparring with the Obama administration and lawmakers for months over how quickly they may repay bailout money. The government has prohibited the banks from reimbursing it unless they can prove they are healthy enough to raise money in the capital markets on their own, to avoid having to dole out a new round of support should the recession deepen. 
 In recent months, many of the strongest banks began jockeying to demonstrate their ability to repay the government's money. As the credit markets have improved, they are now issuing debt without guarantees from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And all eight big banks that received bailout money and passed the government's stress tests have also raised capital by voluntarily selling common stock to private investors, even though regulators did not require them to do so. JPMorgan Chase and American Express, which announced a similar $500 million offering on Monday, were the last in that group. 
 Early repayment of these funds, and of warrants the government received from banks last fall, may mean less of a return to the taxpayer for rescuing the banks. But it will have the benefit of letting the government rechannel some of the money in the $700 billion bailout program to other smaller banks that need it. 
 Even before the stress test results were released, bank officials had been pressing their regulators to let them repay the money. Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation and U.S. Bancorp have already sent their regulators letters of intent to repay the government, a federal official briefed on the situation said.
 ''If we didn't get out of TARP, we'd be very surprised,'' Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said Monday, although he acknowledged the government could still change its criteria. ''Obviously, you know, they can do anything they want,'' he said.
 On Monday, the Federal Reserve added a new requirement that big banks seeking to repay the government sell a sizable amount of common stock to private investors. A similar list last month included requirements on borrowing money without government backing and maintaining an extra capital cushion to protect against a worsening economy.
 Regulators expect to review the applications over the next few days and decide next week. But even banks that repay the money could face another showdown with federal officials. To fully extricate themselves from government, they will have to either allow the Treasury to auction off warrants that taxpayers received last fall or buy them back themselves. 
 If they repurchase the warrants, the move could cost the banks billions of dollars. Taxpayer warrants in JPMorgan Chase, for example, are valued at at least $1.6 billion, according to some estimates. 
 Mr. Dimon said that he did not know how much they would wind up costing the bank, although he argued the government should cancel half ''out of fairness'' since new restrictions and a change in public perception had stigmatized the program. A few small banks have sought to reduce the amount they need to pay the government for their warrants.

HEADLINE: Despite Bleak Economy, Crime Numbers Take Positive Turn

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

 BODY:
Most types of crime declined nationally last year, despite the economic downturn, according to new data released by the Department of Justice on Monday.
 The data assuaged fears that job losses, foreclosures and reduced social services would lead to increased crime, crime statistics experts said. 
 Preliminary statistics from the Uniform Crime Report, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual compilation of crime reports from local and state police agencies, showed that murders declined by 4.4 percent in 2008, rapes declined 2.2 percent, robberies declined 1.1 percent and assaults dropped 3.2 percent.
 Property crimes were also down over all. Burglaries increased 1.3 percent, but motor vehicle theft dropped by 13 percent and arson declined 3.9 percent.
 ''Everybody knows that because of our economic problems, crime must be skyrocketing -- except that it's not,'' said David M. Kennedy, a crime trend expert at the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''Historically -- and our current experience on the ground around the country proves this -- increases in crime are not inevitable when the economy goes sour.''
 Crime experts said there was no historical correlation between tough economic times and crime in the United States. Rather, the big shifts in crime trends have more to do with policing strategies and the ebb and flow of illegal substances: alcohol in the prohibition area, heroin in the 1960s and 1970s, and crack cocaine in the 1980s and 1990s.
 A marginal concern for some crime researchers, however, was a rise in violent crime in towns with populations under 10,000. Those places had a 5.5 percent increase in homicides, a 1.4 percent increase in rapes and a 3.9 percent increase in robberies. 
 The F.B.I. report did not specify the overall number of crimes in these areas, which generally have far fewer incidents than larger cities. Crimes in these areas had a minimal impact on national percentages.
 ''It's hard to make a lot of sense about the numbers,'' said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston. ''Generally, smaller areas have low homicide rates, so a small increase could create a large percentage increase.''
 Professor Fox said the economy rarely affected the national crime rate because many of the people who typically commit serious crimes were only tangentially connected to the greater economy.
 ''Serious criminal behavior is so intensely concentrated in pockets of the nation that the kids who are committing crimes are usually not part of the factory layoff, they're not affected by the credit freeze or failing mortgages,'' said Frank Zimring, a criminologist at University of California, Berkeley.
 New policing technologies allow law enforcement agencies to learn about local crime trends in real time and to deploy resources to hot spots. And community efforts to cut down on crime with after-school programs and other social services probably have a bigger impact on crime than the economy in general, Professor Kennedy said.
 But he also emphasized that interpreting national crime statistics demanded humility.
 ''Anybody who tells you they know exactly what's going on here is lying,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Questions About G.M.? Here Are Some Answers

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD, RON LIEBER and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
General Motors followed Chrysler into bankruptcy on Monday in a case that will be one of the largest and most complex in history. Here is a quick look at some basics of the G.M. bankruptcy and how it may affect owners of G.M. vehicles and company stock. The questions were answered by Micheline Maynard, who writes about the auto industry; Ron Lieber, the Your Money columnist; and Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal-finance reporter.
 Q.Is G.M. going out of business?
 A. No. G.M. is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The law allows companies to sell assets, restructure debt, cancel contracts and close operations that normally would have to continue running. Once the companies secure financing to emerge from bankruptcy, they are reconstituted as new legal entities. 
 Q.How long will this take?
 A. Senior White House officials say the essence of the case should take 60 to 90 days. General Motors plans to use Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to sell assets, rid itself of liabilities and restructure its debt, creating a new version of G.M.
 Late Sunday, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Chrysler assets to Fiat, only a month after its case began. The remaining pieces of Chrysler will remain in bankruptcy for at least several more weeks. Such quick bankruptcies are unusual; most take much longer. 
 Q.Who will make decisions about G.M.'s future car and truck models?
 A. G.M. says it will. But the Obama administration recently announced stricter fuel economy standards, and the president is an advocate for hybrid electric vehicles and small cars. So G.M. may indirectly be guided by government priorities.
 Q.What happens to G.M. dealers?
 A. G.M. is able under bankruptcy to cancel franchise agreements with its dealers. It has already announced plans to eliminate 1,100 dealers and may cut more. The company wants those dealers to close within 18 months. Dealers can sue to block the action, but a final decision would be up to the judge. In the meantime, G.M. will continue to provide dealers with vehicles.
 GMAC, with support from the government, will provide financing for G.M. customers. It is also providing financing for Chrysler.
 Q.What's the biggest difference between the G.M. and Chrysler cases?
 A. Chrysler had reached an agreement to sell assets to Fiat before its case began. G.M. is trying to restructure on its own, with financing from the Treasury. The Treasury is providing G.M. with $30 billion in debtor-in-possession financing so it can operate while in bankruptcy, in addition to about $20 billion G.M. has already received. It is likely the Treasury will provide more scrutiny and guidance in the G.M. case, since such a large amount of taxpayer money is at stake.
 Q.What happens to G.M. employees?
 A. G.M. employees who are not union members do not have any job security. The company can ask a judge for an immediate pay cut for its salaried employees, and can announce job cuts and close offices, just as it can outside bankruptcy,
 Contracts covering members of the United Automobile Workers union and other unions will remain in force, unless the company asks a judge to void them. But U.A.W. members approved changes last week, and the new G.M. is expected to honor that contract. 
 Q.Are pensions and retiree health care benefits protected?
 A. The White House said Sunday that, assuming the sale went forward, G.M. workers' pensions and health care benefits would transfer to the new company and remain in force.
 Companies have the right under bankruptcy law to ask to terminate their pension plans. If pensions were terminated, employees would still receive about a third of their benefits through financing from the federal pension agency.
 A company can also eliminate retiree health care benefits for nonunion employees; they would subsequently be covered by Medicare if they were 65 or older. 
 Q.What happens to G.M. suppliers?
 A. The White House said supplier contracts would remain in force, and it has created a program to provide federal help to parts makers. But in bankruptcy, supplier contracts can be canceled.
 G.M. is likely to tell the court which suppliers it wants to keep doing business with and which contracts it wants to reject. Suppliers can challenge the rejection of their contract, but most likely they will have to reach a settlement with G.M.
 Q.Will the warranty for G.M. vehicles be honored?
 A. Yes. The Treasury Department has already said it will stand behind warranties for cars purchased during the restructuring period for both G.M. and Chrysler. And G.M. itself said that it would honor existing warranties. If you own, say, a Saturn and the company ultimately does away with the brand, other G.M. dealers will perform the repairs.
 Q.Are any current stockholder's shares worthless? What options exist for stockholders?
 A. Sell, if you possibly can. 
 The shares will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange beginning on Tuesday. But the stock is likely to trade, in a limited fashion, on the Pink Sheets, an electronic quotation system for companies that do not meet the listing standards for the stock exchanges.
 Most shareholders are typically wiped out in bankruptcy, financial planners said, which is why G.M. stockholders should probably dump their shares if they can. Warren F. McIntyre, a financial planner in Troy, Mich., said that many people ''don't realize that usually a new share class is issued and the holders of the old shares are wiped out.''
 But getting rid of the stock may be difficult, and if you have too few shares, the brokerage commission alone may wipe out any proceeds from the sale. 
 If you have the actual stock certificates, you might try to sell them on eBay. You may be able to get more for them as collector's items. It's worth a shot.
 Q.What is a G.M. car worth?
 A. The value of G.M. cars will probably fall faster than it would have absent bankruptcy. How much further the value falls will depend on the model, the year, economic conditions in the future and how the company handles itself in bankruptcy.
 Q.What will happen to the Hummer brand, servicing for owners and buying out a leased Hummer? 
 A. There's some good news here. It appears that G.M. will be able to sell the Hummer brand and all of its dealers to another company. If this happens, the new company will aim for a seamless transition. It probably won't be seamless, but it most likely will beat the alternative, which is G.M.'s dropping the brand altogether.
 Q. Is G.M. still going to honor recall notices? 
 A. They'd be crazy not to, but we can't confirm this yet. Here's what Kelly Cusinato, a G.M. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message: ''We understand that customers have many questions. As you know though, there are certain things we cannot answer until the judge makes rulings.'' 
 Keep an eye on http://gm.com/restructuring for more information as it becomes available. Or call (866) 405-4005, though so far the people answering the phones there seem to be mostly reading off scripts or from the Web site.
 Q.Why would anyone buy a G.M. product during bankruptcy?
 A. Some of the cars are going to be real bargains. A dealer being forced to close will want to get rid of inventory quickly. Or, if you visit a dealer with nearby Japanese or German competition, that dealer needs to move the metal. 
 Anyone worried about disappearing dealers and parts shortages could hedge a bit by buying one of the few G.M. cars with above-average reliability ratings. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 2009

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Tuesday about the practical implications of the bankruptcy filing by General Motors described incorrectly the size of payments to retirees should the automaker terminate its pension plans. While many retirees would receive lower benefits from the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation than they were expecting from G.M., the payments would depend in part on their age at retirement and would not necessarily be ''about a third'' of their expected benefits. The error also appeared in a similar article on May 1 about the implications of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing.

HEADLINE: A Reader Q.&A. on G.M.'s Bankruptcy

 BODY:
Updated 7:30 p.m.
 The Times asked readers who own cars made by General Motors, are considering buying one or are investors in the company to write with any questions now that the company has filed for bankruptcy protection. Ron Lieber, the Your Money columnist, and Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal-finance reporter, will be responding to selected questions here. Questions can be sent to yourmoney@nytimes.com, along with your name and hometown.
 Warranty Worries
 Q.We own a G.M. car and have a question. Will the warranty be honored? -- Bob Diehl 
 A. Yes. The Treasury Department has already said it will stand behind warranties for cars purchased during the restructuring period for both G.M. and Chrysler. And G.M. itself says that it will honor your existing warranty. If you own, say, a Saturn and the company ultimately does away with the brand, other G.M. dealers will perform the repairs. 
 The question is, how much friction will there be. If your dealer disappears, how much farther will you have to drive to get warranty service? G.M. also says that replacement parts are and will continue to be available. It's not clear how the company can say that with such certainty, however, with many parts suppliers in bankruptcy themselves or on the brink of it. That said, many of those suppliers service many manufacturers. So sporadic parts shortages or waits to get parts may happen no matter what kind of car you buy or own.
 Rewards Credit
 Q.I have accumulated several thousand dollars of credit toward a G.M. vehicle purchase from my G.M. Rewards MasterCard. Will this credit be lost because of the GM bankruptcy? -- David A. Mickelson
 A. No. The company has asked the bankruptcy court to maintain the G.M. card program.
 Those G.M. Shares
 Q.Are any current stockholder's shares worthless? If not, what are they worth moving forward? What options exist for stockholders? -- Adam Gianulis, Las Colinas, Tex. 
 A. Sell, if you possibly can.
 The shares will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange beginning on Tuesday. But the stock may begin to trade, in a limited fashion, on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and/or the Pink Sheets, electronic quotation systems for companies that do not meet the listing standards for the stock exchanges. Contact your stock broker for more information on how that is done.
 Most shareholders are typically wiped out in bankruptcy, financial planners said, which is why G.M. stockholders should probably dump their shares if they can. ''People assume that there is upside even in bankruptcy because they know that companies emerge from bankruptcy as ongoing enterprises and the stock trades again,'' said Warren F. McIntyre, a financial planner in Troy, Mich. ''However, they don't realize that usually a new share class is issued and the holders of the old shares are wiped out. This is what happened to Kmart, which was also a Detroit company.''
 But getting rid of the stock may be difficult at this point. And if you have too few shares, the brokerage commission alone may wipe out any profit you would stand to make. 
 If you have the actual stock certificates, you may try and sell them on eBay. You may be able to get more as a collector's item. It's worth a shot.
 Declining Car Values
 Q.Should I be concerned that my Impala, my Impala SS and my Lumina will be worth less now that G.M. is in bankruptcy? Will I be able to write down any value loss on my federal income tax return next year as the bankruptcy was forced by the Obama White House? -- John Howlett
 A. Yes. The value of your cars will probably fall faster than it would have absent bankruptcy. How much further it falls will depend on the model, the year, economic conditions going forward and how the company handles itself in bankruptcy. As for the tax break, while we admire the ingenuity and the subtle bit of social commentary, it isn't likely to happen.
 Hummer's Prospects
 Q.What will happening to the Hummer brand, servicing for owners, and buying out a leased Hummer? -- Bruce Rosenthal, Rumson, N.J.
 A. There's some good news here. It appears as if G.M. will be able to sell the Hummer brand and all of its dealers to another company. If this happens, the new company would aim for a seamless transition. It probably wouldn't be seamless, but it most likely beats the alternative, which is G.M. shuttering the brand altogether. Then resale values would probably fall even further, and you'd need to go to another G.M. dealer for warranty service. Maybe the old Hummer mechanics would land at other G.M. dealers and offer expert service on your vehicle there, but maybe they wouldn't.
 Factory Guides
 Q.I'm having trouble finding a factory guide for my new Pontiac G8, since the company doesn't seem to have published it yet. Should I expect to wait even longer for it now that the company is in bankruptcy? -- Mike Pitt, El Cajon, Calif.
 A. I think that's a safe bet. There are a lot of distracted people at headquarters right now, plus they're likely to fire a bunch more white-collar workers. Have you asked your dealer for information, though? The people there might know something about this, or know how to get the answer. Readers who have ideas about this (or any other answers) can share them with us by e-mail. 
 Liability and Recalls
 Q.The government will honor the warranty on G.M. vehicles, but what about accidents caused by a defect in the vehicle? Will G.M. be accountable to those who are injured because of product defects? Will the government? -- Sherlyn Manson, Lenexa, Kan.
 Q. I own a Chevrolet pickup which still has a pending recall notice I have not yet had time to have installed. Is G.M. still going to honor recall notices? -- Bob Jones, Carrollton, Tex.
 A. They'd be crazy not to. But we can't confirm this yet. Here's what Kelly Cusinato, a G.M. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message when we put these questions to her: ''We understand that customers have many questions. As you know though, there are certain things we cannot answer until the judge makes rulings. Again, we are committed to keeping customers informed as we go through this process. I am sorry but this is all we can offer at this time.'' 
 Keep an eye on http://gm.com/restructuring for more information as it becomes available. Or call (866) 405-4005, though so far the people answering the phones there seem to be reading off scripts or the Web site, mostly.
 Effects on Derivatives
 Q. I am an investor in G.M. LEAP options (derivatives). I would like to know what happens to them if G.M. is delisted from the N.Y.S.E.? Also, what does the G.M. management have in mind for the G.M. shareholders? -- Rahul Mukerjee, Plano, Tex.
 A. Once the stock stops trading, the underlying options will also stop trading. But your right to exercise the option does not cease, said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. ''You can continue to exercise the option right through the expiration date,'' he added.
 Exercising the options gives you the right to buy or sell the shares at a certain ''strike price.'' But Mr. Schwartz notes that the lowest strike price for June is $1. The shares are currently trading at 73 cents, which means your options are currently ''underwater'' -- you can get a better deal on the open market.
 So, if you need the shares, for instance, to cover a short position, you're better off buying the stock on the open market and forgetting about your options.
 But as long as they are trading, you should sell out your position as soon as you possibly can. ''As long as it is trading and has some value, sell it,'' Mr. Schwartz said. 
 Run, don't walk. Shares of the company will stop trading on Tuesday, according to the New York Stock Exchange.
 The stock may continue to trade on what's known as the ''Pink Sheets,'' an electronic quotation system for companies that do not meet the listing standards for the stock exchanges. But even if it didn't trade anywhere, you could still exercise your options, Mr. Schwartz added. But no new or ''opening'' trades are permitted, according to the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
 Preferred Shares
 Q. I have preferred stock in G.M. What happens to my stock, and more importantly, what will happen to me? Do I have no alternative except to keep the stock until I am dead and gone (I am a young 55) and transfer the stock in a will to my heirs? -- Denise D., Seattle
 Q. I own G.M. preferred shares. Should I be looking to sell them, or hold on? I bought them at $25 a share when they were issued in late 2001. -- Karen, Manhattan
 A. When a company files for bankruptcy, its various stock and bondholders essentially get in line. The first investors to be repaid are secured debt holders, then senior bond investors, followed by subordinated debt holders. Preferred shareholders are next, and lastly, holders of common stock. 
 In a bankruptcy, preferred shares are usually worthless, much like shares of common stock. But in the case of G.M., there may be some good -- or at least somewhat better -- news. Most of G.M.'s preferred shares are actually senior notes or ''quarterly interest bonds,'' which means you will be treated as a bondholder, according to Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management. So you will be able to exchange your preferreds for G.M. stock (bondholders will receive 10 percent of the new company's stock). It's not the best deal, but it beats the empty bag true preferred shareholders would have been left holding.
 And Karen, Ms. Cohen believes you are holding senior notes that were sold at $25 apiece in 2001.
 Competing With Japan
 Q.Will it be possible that the NEW General Motors can build a car of the quality and durability of Toyota, Honda, Acura, Infiniti, Nissan and others known for their reliability? Will it be possible to get a warranty combined with the service that these Japanese companies have provided for the past 40 years? -- Ray Bayles, Green Valley, Ariz.
 A. Well, why not? There are all sorts of American industries that manage to produce world-class products. And there's nothing like a near-death experience to scare a company straight. G.M.'s chief executive, Fritz Henderson, said in his news conference on Monday that gone are the days when the company can foist 15 cars on the world and hope that five of them end up working out. ''Give us another chance,'' he said. ''The G.M. that let too many of you down is history.'' 
 So it's possible. But whether I'd buy a car from the company right now is a whole nother question. Which someone has helpfully asked next. 
 The Buying Climate
 Q.Why would anyone buy a G.M. product during bankruptcy? -- Warren Ruder, Phoenix
 A.(Ron Lieber)-- I wondered the same thing after Rick Wagoner, then G.M.'s chief executive, insisted that nobody would buy the company's cars if it went into bankruptcy. I was so curious that I wrote a column about it. And now, we'll get to see if he was right.
 Here's one reason to buy. Some of the cars are going to be really cheap. So, let's say you go to a dealer that G.M. is forcing to close its doors. That dealer probably wants to get rid of its inventory quickly and just be done with it. Or, let's say you're visiting a dealer situated on a stretch of highway with plenty of Japanese and German competition. The dealers at those competitors are doing a lot of trash-talking right now. And if you're a G.M. dealer that doesn't want to get cut in the next round of dealer death sentences, you need to put money on the hood right now to survive (and counter the nasty talk down the highway). 
 If you're worried about disappearing dealers and part shortages, then you could hedge a bit by buying a G.M. car with (way) above average initial and long-term reliability ratings. 
 Ford, Lately
 Q.Is Ford going to try to capitalize on the G.M. bankruptcy by offering special deals to G.M. customers? Joseph A. Kinney, Pinehurst, N.C.
 A. Wouldn't you if you were a Ford dealer? Officially, the company is trying to be gentlemanly. And there don't seem to be any special offers aimed squarely at G.M. or Chrysler customers. (Anyone know anything different? Let us know.) But if I'm a Ford dealer right now doing my own thing far away from headquarters, you can bet I'm filling potential customers' heads with all sorts of doubts about what is going to happen to G.M. and Chrysler dealers, raising the possibility of parts shortages, mouthing off about how distracted the two companies' designers and engineers must be right now, and all of the rest. If you want to buy American and sleep at night, they're undoubtedly saying right now, then buy a Ford. 
 In which case, I'd tell them this: Match the deals and discounts that the G.M. and Chrysler are offering right now, and then we'll talk. 
 Small Bondholders
 Q.My husband is executor of his father's estate, which includes a G.M. bond. I would like to know where we can find out more about the process taking place and how it is likely to affect this small investment in the company.-- Tucker Respess, Charlottesville, Va.
 Q.I owned a G.M. bond (relatively small denomination) for 15 years. To meet the May 26 deadline I opted to keep the bond rather than accept the offer for a stake in the future company. After hearing of the extended deadline to May 30 and reading about that the big bondholders were accepting the 10 percent stake, I tried to change my decision and to accept the stake for the bond. I was told by my broker that the extension only applied to large bondholders like institutions. Was I misinformed? What is the likely value of my bond? -- David Wallace, Massachusetts
 Q.As a bondholder who did not agree to the settlement, where do I stand? -- G. Hurn, Lady Lake, Fla.
 A. All bondholders would be able to exchange their bonds for fresh stock in the new G.M.: bondholders will get 10 percent of the new company's equity, with warrants that could allow them to receive another 15 percent. 
 But how much is that in real dollars? Nobody really knows yet. ''Over time, if the economy turns around, and if G.M. produces cars that people want to buy, and if you live long enough, the stock will probably go up,'' said Marilyn Cohen of Envision Capital Management. ''If you are not a risk taker, get out and put your money elsewhere.''
 On Monday, most of G.M.'s intermediate-term bonds were selling anywhere from $130 to $150 (for bonds with a $1,000 face value), Ms. Cohen said. ''All of the news is baked into the bond price,'' she added. Keep in mind that your G.M. bond's coupon payments will stop.
 Bonds and the Courts
 Q. Bondholders would receive only 10 percent equity plus warrants to purchase 15 percent more under certain conditions in exchange for their claims of $27 billion. Meanwhile, the Treasury will receive 60 percent equity in exchange for its investment of only $20 billion. This is obviously unfair. Are bankruptcy courts likely to approve this obviously distorted distribution? (The unions also would get a hugely disproportionate distribution.) -- Allan R. Drebin, Evanston, Ill.
 A. Is it fair that the taxpayers are bailing out these companies to begin with? The question of fairness is a debate for the ages. Regardless, the distribution plans are probably final. Why? Since the Treasury is providing G.M. with such a huge sum of money so it can operate while it's in bankruptcy ($30 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, in addition to the $20 billion it already received), the government is likely to keep a tighter grip on the proceedings.
 ''The government is in the drivers seat in bankruptcy court due to the significant amount of restructuring funding provided to G.M.,'' said Gary Cloud, a senior portfoliomanager with the AFBA Funds. ''Therefore, it is unlikely that challenges to the final equity apportionment to G.M. creditors will change dramatically from the current blueprint.'' 
 OnStar Service
 Q.My OnStar contract is up for renewal in a few weeks. What is the effect of the G.M. bankruptcy on On-Star? -- Ellen, Palos Park, Ill.
 A. G.M. says that there will be no impact on OnStar service, and that subscriptions will remain in place. Given that this service is, arguably, one of the best products of any sort that the company has come up with in the last decade or two, there's little chance that it's going away or changing much.

HEADLINE: Chamberlain Provides Eight Strong Innings and One Defensive Gem

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
Joba Chamberlain took three hurried strides off the mound and leaped. It was more of a belly flop than a swan dive, but the 230-pound Chamberlain had enough hang time to catch a bunt before it touched the grass. Then he whipped the ball to second to complete a dazzling double play.
 After Chamberlain's display of athleticism in the fifth inning, he pumped his fist and shook his glove against his body a few times. The Yankees were thrilled to see Chamberlain make a remarkable play, pitch economically for a career-high eight innings and help power them to a 5-2 win over the Indians. 
 On a warm evening when seagulls and some late-arriving insects invaded Progressive Field, Chamberlain consistently showed why the Yankees want him to be a starter. From his 98-mile-per-hour fastball to his dancing curveball to his wicked slider, Chamberlain had the look of a pitcher who could be a front-of-the-rotation starter for a decade. For one night, he also had the look of a diver.
 ''It was quite a belly flop is the way I'd describe it,'' Manager Joe Girardi said. ''It's an unbelievable play. It changed the game.''
 There were a few dozen seagulls parked in the outfield and a Yankee parked on every base in the seventh. Nick Swisher's chore was to create some movement. If Swisher blasted a ball into the outfield, he could scatter the annoying birds and push the Yankees around the bases. That is exactly what he did.
 Swisher smashed a ball off the 19-foot-high left-field fence and missed a grand slam by a few feet. But Swisher's two-run double broke a 1-1 tie and allowed the Yankees to exhale. Derek Jeter had warned Swisher that it was about to rain so the Yankees needed to score quickly.
 ''Not only that, there's, what, 8,000 seagulls out there?'' Swisher said. ''This ain't even the beach. It's Cleveland.'' 
 The Yankees set a major league record by playing their 18th straight game without an error, eclipsing the 2006 Red Sox. 
 In addition, the Yankees have won 15 of their last 19 games to maintain their grasp on first place in the American League East. 
 Chamberlain gave up two runs and four hits and needed 106 pitches to get 24 outs. If he can routinely pitch deep into games, the Yankees will have the formidable starter they have long touted and they might silence the shouting about sending him to the bullpen. Chamberlain has had difficulty maintaining his velocity, but he was throwing 97 m.p.h. in the eighth.
 ''Hands down, that's the best I've ever seen him,'' Swisher said.
 With runners on first and second and no outs in the fifth, Kelly Shoppach popped up a bunt toward the third-base line. Chamberlain hustled after it, made his memorable leap and grabbed it. After he completed the double play, a dangerous second and third situation had been nullified.
 ''They say we're not athletes,'' Chamberlain said, ''but I think we proved them wrong there.''
 When Chamberlain began his flight, Girardi said, ''I didn't think he had a chance at it.'' But Chamberlain made a great break on the pop-up and extended his body to snare it.
 ''He laid out for it,'' C. C. Sabathia said. ''That was a great play.''
 For as long as Chamberlain pitches in Cleveland, he will be remembered for Game 2 of the 2007 division series. That is when Chamberlain was swarmed by midges as he tried to protect a 1-0 lead. The insects covered Chamberlain's back and neck and hovered around his face. He lost the lead and the Yankees lost the game.
 In the eighth, insects again buzzed around Chamberlain. 
 ''Man, I started to see them come, I'll be honest with you,'' Chamberlain said. ''I actually swallowed one when I was walking around the mound to start that inning.''
 The Indians reliever Greg Aquino rumbled through a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the sixth, but he could not do the same in seventh. Swisher doubled in two runs. After Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, Alex Rodriguez's two-run single boosted the lead to 5-1. The Indians walked 11, and four Yankees scored after they walked.
 Chamberlain was an intimidating presence as he retired the first 11 Indians, a streak that ended with Victor Martinez's home run in the fourth. 
 But Chamberlain made a snazzy play in the fifth and pitched effectively into the eighth, and the Yankees kept cruising. Girardi could not explain why Chamberlain's velocity was better on Monday.
 ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Maybe he's mad at the midges.''
 INSIDE PITCH
 Andy Pettitte (stiffness in lower back) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session Monday and reiterated that he would make his next start Wednesday. ... Xavier Nady (torn ligament in elbow) felt discomfort as he threw for the first time in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. ... Jose Molina felt pain his quadriceps as he ran to first in a rehabilitation game in Tampa. He is expected to return to New York to be evaluated. ... The May 3 game with the Los Angeles Angels, which was postponed by rain, has been rescheduled for Sept. 14 at 7:05 p.m. at Yankee Stadium.

HEADLINE: A Humbling Day for an American Icon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''G.M. Heads to Bankruptcy Protection as U.S. Steps In'' (front page, June 1): This is one American taxpayer who could not be more pleased with our virtual nationalization of the American auto industry. Unbridled capitalism put our nation in its mess; thank heaven we have a brilliant and progressive young president to lead us to dry ground.
 For decades, profits were put ahead of fuel efficiency and environmental protection. The Big Three's response to skyrocketing oil imports and environmental degradation: Hummers, Suburbans and Excursions. And in the end, no profits. 
 Well, that's all going to change. With the American people now the majority owner of General Motors, and holding a minority stake in Chrysler, cars will be built that are in the nation's best interest.
 It is a national disgrace that our government and corporate leaders allowed our auto industry to slip so far behind foreign competitors.
 And that will change, too. Under our new president, we will once again lead the world in science and technology -- laying the groundwork for a better, smarter American auto industry.
 Paul Bartlett St. Paul, June 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The government's taking a 60 percent stake in G.M. is a radical departure, but seen in a broader perspective, government rescue of an industry is not new. 
 Around the time of World War I, the agricultural industry in the United States was failing. Prices fell so low that it was not economical. Problems continued into the 1930s. The government rescue plan was price supports, which interfered in the market for agricultural products, and subsidies, which manipulated production. 
 The government did not take an ownership interest, but it took control of the industry in a broad way. Some of the controls exist in one form or another today. 
 There are two lessons. First, government management of an industry can be good economic and social policy. Second, when the need for the government management ends, Congress needs the independence to end it. The risk of ''socialized'' farming is much clearer than the risk of ''socialized'' medicine or ''socialized'' banking.
 David C. Roston Iowa City, June 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In ''Driving the Bond Markets to Ruin,'' by James K. Glassman (Op-Ed, May 30 ), the tired old canard of blaming the government and the United Auto Workers as ''the same hands that shaped much of G.M.'s trouble in the first place'' once again takes center stage. 
 Missing, of course, is the undeniable fact that the primary cause of General Motors' decline is the poor quality of its product and, inevitably, the inability to compete with foreign-run manufacturers.
 Now, the credit markets are sure to be afflicted with long-term damage by the same two operatives, the government and the U.A.W., in fashioning the latest offer to bondholders, not to mention the short-term damage to G.M.'s competitors.
 In the current crisis, a myriad of government rescue plans emerged and have been put into place. Each one has found its critics with the ultimate predictions of gloom and doom. Better to leave everything to the unfettered free market, the consequence of which put us into this economic debacle. 
 Jerome M. Langenthal Hauppauge, N.Y., May 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 James K. Glassman, a former Bush administration official, argues that in reorganizing General Motors, it's fairer to give preference to bondholders than to autoworkers, and that President Obama's efforts are nothing but a political payoff to the U.A.W. This is classic Reagan-Bush trickle-down economics. 
 Many autoworkers worked a lifetime for less pay upfront in order to live with dignity in their old age. If a 70-year-old retired autoworker loses his pension, he might also lose his home, worsening the housing crisis, further shrinking demand and placing greater strain on government budgets. That's fairer than giving bondholders a haircut? 
 Fair bankruptcy law must balance the rights of investors so they will continue to capitalize productive companies with those of workers who produce goods and services. By giving somewhat greater preference to workers' pensions, President Obama is creating a fairer balance than the old trickle-down economics, not paying off political supporters.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Push The Dow 2.6% Higher

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The bankruptcy of General Motors, once the world's largest automaker, gripped Washington and Detroit on Monday. But on Wall Street, investors were already turning their attention to other matters.
 Stocks ripped higher, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its best levels in five months. Traders homed in on signs of economic growth in China, stability in Europe and more signs of improvement in construction and manufacturing in the United States.
 But as the markets rallied globally, the dollar and the value of United States debt fell. Investors worried about the prospect of rising inflation and unprecedented government deficits moved away from Treasury notes. They also pushed the value of the dollar lower and bid up the prices of oil -- a commodity that gains value as the dollar weakens. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 23/32, to 95 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.67 percent, from 3.46 percent late Friday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 221.11 points, or 2.6 percent, to 8,721.44, as investors piled into shares of two new pending additions to the closely watched market index. Early Monday, just after G.M. declared bankruptcy, Dow Jones & Company said it would drop G.M. and Citigroup from its index of 30 blue-chip companies and replace them with Cisco Systems and the Travelers Companies. The changes are set for next Monday. 
 It was a humbling reminder of how far two of America's largest companies had fallen. Citigroup was once the largest American bank on Wall Street and commanded a share price of more than $50. But its stock now trades for less than $4, and it has taken billions in government aid. And G.M. is a shadow of the company that once had a market share in America of 54 percent.
 Bankruptcy aside, traders on the New York Stock Exchange focused on G.M. on Monday. It was the second most-traded stock of the day, and shares briefly crossed above a dollar before closing at 75 cents. The exchange said it would suspend trading of G.M. shares before markets open on Tuesday.
 ''The company is no longer suitable for listing,'' New York Stock Exchange Regulation said. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.73 points, or 2.58 percent, to 942.87, led higher by gains in consumer stocks like Target, Home Depot, Amazon and the Walt Disney Company. New reports showed that personal disposable incomes grew 1.1 percent in April while consumer spending declined less than expected. The news seemed to buoy investors' hopes for an economic turnaround.
 Still, the government reported that consumers in the United States were continuing to save more and more money as the job market got worse. The Commerce Department said that the personal saving rate increased to 5.7 percent in April, its highest point in more than a decade, as people socked away the tax cuts they received as part of the government's stimulus package.
 Americans have saved an average of 7 percent of their incomes since the 1950s, but that frugality disappeared this decade as consumers went on a binge of easy credit, racking up big credit card bills and tapping home equity loans. The saving rate dropped briefly below zero in August 2005, but has rebounded as people worry about losing their jobs.
 Economists are split on how personal incomes and spending will shift in the months ahead. Some expect the stimulus package to buffer income against the weak economy, but others warn that unemployment will continue to rise and salaries will fall.
 ''There will be little momentum for consumer spending over the months ahead,'' Richard F. Moody, chief economist at Forward Capital, wrote in a note. 
 Industrial companies and home builders gained ground after the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose 0.8 percent in April from a month earlier. Spending on residential projects was up modestly, while office buildings and manufacturing operations also rose.
 Overseas, investors fixed on reports showing that manufacturing activity rose in China and India in May, while the pace of manufacturing decline in the battered euro zone slowed during the month, according to data released Monday. 
 The figures appeared to show that the interest rate cuts and stimulus measures rushed through by governments since late last year were beginning to have an effect on the global economy. The data also highlighted the gap between the pace of recovery in Asia and in Europe.
 The whiff of recovery heightened expectations that oil prices would keep rising, especially if Chinese demand rises. Traders pushed the price of oil $2.27 higher, to $68.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The average price of a gallon of gasoline rose to $2.51 a gallon, up nearly 10 cents from a week ago, according to AAA, the automobile club.
 Still, many analysts cautioned that actual recovery would take many months to bring about improved company earnings.
 ''As far as the recent recovery in the markets is concerned, I am convinced that it is largely due to deeply oversold conditions seen in the autumn crash and the fact that central banks have flooded the system with trillions of dollars,'' Puru Saxena, chief executive of PuruSaxena Wealth Management in Hong Kong, said in a note Monday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Judge in Case Is Known For His Brisk Approach

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bankruptcy lawyers involved in the filing of General Motors may want to catch up on sleep now, because the presiding judge is known for midnight hearings.
 Robert E. Gerber, the bankruptcy judge, spent 30 years at the New York firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, and sometimes still runs his courtroom as if he was billing by the hour, on occasion producing a lengthy opinion the morning after a marathon, late-night hearing. 
 Though the judge was selected at random, some of his decisions in big bankruptcies suggest the government's arguments may find a sympathetic ear. In one case, he approved controversial tactics that helped protect a lender and that the government may want to use to protect its interest in G.M.; in another he permitted one of the biggest sales ever of a company's assets out of Chapter 11. 
 ''He's all business,'' said David M. Friedman, a partner at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, which represented the creditors' committee in the bankruptcy case of Adelphia, the cable company. ''He wants to focus on the issues and he wants to get the issues briefed, argued and then get to work. He will work as hard as he has to to rule in a timely fashion.''
 That brisk approach was apparent at Monday afternoon's hearing in the G.M. case, when the judge quickly approved a flood of first-day motions, including access to a little less than half of its $33.3 billion in debtor-in-possession financing from the government.
 Of course, making predictions about G.M.'s reorganization, with all the political interest and concerns about the company's role in the economy, is tricky, lawyers cautioned. The company's size and its international reach will complicate a process that the government hopes to complete in no more than three months.
 ''We are really headed into uncharted territory,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''Any bankruptcy judge is going to look at this and expect it to explode.''
 Judge Gerber, 62, has been willing to take potentially controversial steps to move big cases along. In the Chapter 11 proceedings of Lyondell Chemical Company this year, he approved a financing arrangement that allowed lenders to convert some of the prebankruptcy debt they held into a higher priority postfiling obligation. 
 That bodes well for any effort by the federal government to get the loans already extended to G.M. to be treated as higher priority obligations after the filing, said Stephen J. Lubben, a law professor at Seton Hall.
 In the Adelphia bankruptcy, the judge approved a $17.6 billion sale of the company to Time Warner and Comcast, using the same kind of auction procedure drawn on by Chrysler in its sale to Fiat. That sale procedure, under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code, may also be an important part of any reorganization of G.M., lawyers said.
 Judge Gerber also worked the lawyers in the Adelphia case hard, Mr. Friedman said. ''He kept his courtroom open on at least one circumstance, and I think there were more, well past midnight in order to complete a hearing that was critical to the company's survival,'' he recalled. 
 In that case, the judge produced dozens of opinions, some of them lengthy and at least one scathing, said Edward R. Morrison, a law professor at Columbia. Judge Gerber slammed a group of creditors, accusing them of pursuing ''scorched-earth litigation strategy,'' after they raised objections that could have hindered the sale to Time Warner and Comcast. 
 That kind of blunt language is not common in judicial opinions, Professor Morrison said, and it may be a sign of some sympathy toward those trying to get a case concluded more quickly. 
 ''But perhaps this was an unusual case in which the hedge funds were more aggressive,'' Professor Morrison added. ''It's hard to know.'' 
 A graduate of Rutgers and Columbia Law School, Judge Gerber interrupted his private practice to serve about two years in the Air Force before he was appointed to the bankruptcy bench in 2000. While practicing, he handled securities and commercial litigation before moving into bankruptcy work.
 Not surprisingly, in the small world of big bankruptcy lawyers, no one had a harsh word to say about Judge Gerber on Monday. Many lawyers will appear before him in the G.M. case, after all, and many others will down the road.

HEADLINE: G.M. Bankruptcy Loomed for Years

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE, ROB COX and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
What drove General Motors into bankruptcy? It's tempting to blame the broader financial crisis, which torpedoed the United States economy, dragged down car sales and shut carmakers out of the capital markets. That overriding factor certainly precipitated the demise of America's largest carmaker, but it was not the ultimate cause.
 Insolvency has, in fact, been looming over G.M. for several years. In April 2005, for example, while markets were worrying about rating agencies downgrading the carmaker's debt, G.M.'s onerous unfunded health care and pension liabilities looked to have punched a multibillion-dollar hole in its balance sheet. Even then, some suggested that a filing for Chapter 11 protection might be the only way to get G.M. back on track. 
 That's not to say G.M.'s executives sat back and did nothing. In the last four years they have halved the union work force in the United States; laid off white-collar employees in droves; renegotiated labor contracts and health care expenses; and sold businesses like Allison Transmission and GMAC, the financial services arm, to raise cash.
 But none of that was enough. G.M. was losing market share faster than it could shrink its operations, even before the precipitous declines of the more recent credit crisis. Other measures were slow to materialize, like a cut in its the dividend. And other options were shunned as taboo by its then-chief, Rick Wagoner, including the closing or sale of some of G.M.'s crowd of eight brands.
 While on government life support and under imminent threat of bankruptcy this last year, G.M. executives moved too slowly. Twice they had to revise rosy assumptions for their restructuring plan.
 Still, even for those who have argued strongly in favor of G.M. seeking bankruptcy protection, there's no pleasure in being proved right. The generous support of American and Canadian taxpayers, whose $60 billion or more in loans are unlikely to be repaid in full -- as well as some luck -- will help. And G.M.'s expedited bankruptcy process will allow it to emerge in a position to compete profitably again. If not, another bankruptcy will be in the cards.
 Canada Investing, Too 
 Canada's biggest bailout investment to date is not of an indigenous company, but of the local arm of General Motors. The country's banks are relatively sound, its recession is shallower and its budget and payments deficits smaller than those in the United States. With an economy strong in fast-appreciating resources and a fiscally careful government, Canada looks a safer haven than its southern neighbor.
 Like American financial institutions, Canadian banks found themselves in trouble when the housing boom collapsed. They were better capitalized, however, and had been somewhat more cautious. So the simple, if substantial response of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the government housing finance agency, involving an increase to market liquidity rather than any actual investment in the banks, proved adequate to alleviate the Canadian financial sector's problems.
 Canada's only other bailout -- other than those of financial companies -- has been the local arm of General Motors. Even here, the aid is less generous than in the United States, partly because in Canada there is no government obligation to assume the pension liabilities of bankrupt companies.
 More broadly, Canada's budget position is relatively sound. Its projected 2009 deficit is only 2.3 percent of its gross domestic product, against more than 10 percent in the United States. In the early 1990s, Canadian government and provincial spending was much higher in relation to the size of the economy than in America. But the two countries have now converged, even though health care costs in Canada are primarily borne by the public sector. At 10 percent of G.D.P., Canada's health care spending is far below the 16 percent in the United States.
 Canada also has plentiful natural resources. With high production costs -- for example, to extract oil from tar sands -- the country appeared vulnerable to a recession in which commodities and energy prices collapsed. But the sharp recent price rebound, in advance of any global economic recovery, has improved Canada's prospects.

HEADLINE: An Overhaul of Financial Rules Is Taking Shape

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Washington is asking some painful questions about how to prevent the next financial meltdown. Should it reinvent the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation? Abolish the seemingly feckless overseer of savings and loans? Grant new powers to the Federal Reserve? 
 All that -- and more -- is on the table as the Obama administration prepares to overhaul the regulatory apparatus that failed to prevent the gravest economic crisis since the Depression. Under consideration is a new agency to regulate mortgages and credit cards, as well as tighter federal oversight of hedge funds and insurance. One possibility is creating a regulator to watch over companies that might put the financial system in peril again should they run into trouble. 
 The plan, a central plank of the administration's response to the current crisis, has already provoked a fierce lobbying battle by the various financial services industries that it could touch. The Treasury Department aims to complete the effort by mid-June, and senior Democrats in the House and Senate have vowed to complete legislation by the end of this year. 
 One radical proposal -- combining the four federal agencies overseeing banks and savings and loans into a single, super-regulator -- already seems to be losing favor, lawmakers and policy makers said. But there is a growing consensus that one of the four, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was responsible for oversight of the American International Group, should be eliminated as part of an effort to streamline oversight. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, his counterpart at the House Financial Services Committee, said they would be surprised if the Obama plan called for folding four bank regulatory agencies into one. 
 ''I don't mind overlap as much as the idea of concentrating too much power in the hands of one agency, like the F.S.A. in London,'' Mr. Dodd said, referring to the Financial Services Authority, the British agency that Parliament in 2000 created out of six other agencies as the sole financial regulator. ''The Department of Homeland Security makes me nervous for that very reason.''
 Mr. Frank said the idea of a single agency ''would be a good one if you were starting from scratch.'' But he said it simply wasn't ''worth the political cost'' that it would inevitably entail.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, another senior Democrat in regular discussions with the administration, said there appeared to be a consensus among senior officials that there were too many bank regulators, but the debate in recent days had centered on whether it was politically wise to propose a plan that might face significant opposition in Congress.
 ''The question is whether they should put down the ideal plan and whether they should make the political compromises before they issue the plan or after,'' Mr. Schumer said. The administration has been strongly considering abolishing the O.T.S., which regulates savings associations. (The O.T.S. was the primary federal regulator for A.I.G. because the company bought a small savings association a decade ago.) Its elimination was proposed last year by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the idea has gained political currency since then.
 ''The Office of Thrift Supervision has very little political support given its track record,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 A merger of two other federal agencies -- the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- would face fierce political resistance. In recent years, both agencies have been accused of weak oversight. But the industries regulated by the agencies have traditionally opposed a merger, and the Congressional committees with jurisdiction over each agency historically have been reluctant to cede any authority. 
 Mr. Frank and Mr. Dodd said they expected the House would move first on legislation and could complete a package of measures by the August recess, which would then go to the Senate for consideration. Unlike many other measures, regulatory overhaul does not break along party lines as much as along regional lines. The views of lawmakers from states with big banks and financial institutions often differ from those with smaller institutions. 
 A central goal of the plan is to more tightly control companies that are now largely unregulated but could pose risks to the financial system if they failed, such as hedge funds. Under the proposal, hedge funds would be required to register with the S.E.C. and provide access to their books. Many hedge funds already do so. 
 Administration officials were considering this week how to resolve many of the crucial details of the plan, such as whether the umbrella regulator for systemic risk should be the Federal Reserve alone, as Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, had previously suggested, or whether it should be a council of regulators. 
 Another difficult and unresolved question is how the federal government should more aggressively regulate insurance companies, which are now exclusively under the supervision of a patchwork of state agencies. 
 As part of its overhaul, the Obama administration announced three weeks ago that it would seek new authority over the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, which were a major cause of the financial crisis and have gone largely unregulated for decades. While some in Congress are pushing for tougher oversight, the financial industry is lobbying hard against it, arguing that too much regulation would thwart financial innovation. On Thursday, Gary Gensler, the new chairman of the C.F.T.C., is expected to provide more details about that proposal at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.
 For years, the debate over how to regulate such instruments has been mired in disagreement between the C.F.T.C. and the S.E.C., reflecting the rivalries between markets in Chicago and New York. But officials said this week that Mr. Gensler and Mary L. Schapiro, his counterpart at the S.E.C., had reached an informal understanding that would enable their respective agencies to share authority over the derivatives market. 
 The understanding, which the regulators hope Congress will ultimately ratify, would essentially give the S.E.C. authority over derivatives that are related to publicly traded securities and other instruments under the S.E.C.'s jurisdiction, such as credit-default swaps, while the C.F.T.C. would oversee commodities-based derivatives, the officials said.

HEADLINE: South Carolina Stimulus Case Is Given to State Court

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who has refused to accept $700 million in federal stimulus money, was dealt a major blow on Monday when a federal judge said two lawsuits seeking to require him to take the money should be heard in state court. The legislature has ordered Mr. Sanford to request the money, most of which would pay for education, but he has refused. 
 In a news conference after the ruling, Mr. Sanford said he would accept whatever decision the state court made, and acknowledged that he faced long odds in a state with a notoriously weak governorship and several previous court rulings that favor the legislature's authority over the governor's.
 ''It looks like we will be bound to spend that money,'' Mr. Sanford said. 
 Molly Spearman, the executive director of the South Carolina Association of School Administrators, which filed one of the lawsuits against the governor, applauded the announcement.
 ''Thank goodness for the people of South Carolina,'' Ms. Spearman said. ''He's realizing that he's going to lose and there's no reason to try and delay this any longer.''
 Judge Joseph Anderson of Federal District Court did not rule on a third lawsuit, filed by Mr. Sanford against the legislature, which argued that accepting the money would increase state spending to a level that would be unsustainable when the stimulus money runs out in two years. 
 The lawsuit contends that only governors can decide whether to accept the money in question.
 In March, Mr. Sanford, a Republican who vocally opposed the Obama administration's stimulus plan, said he would not accept the $700 million unless the legislature agreed to use the money to pay down debt. Legislators scoffed, saying it would be impossible to pay down debt and still maintain the financing required to qualify for the stimulus plan. 
 Instead, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a budget that included the $350 million the stimulus would have brought this year. Mr. Sanford vetoed that part of the budget, but the legislature overrode his veto. 
 Mr. Sanford's critics say he has used his opposition to the stimulus package to boost his national profile for a presidential run while South Carolina suffers from the nation's second-highest unemployment rate. 
 Mr. Sanford has appeared several times on national television and written opinion articles complaining that the package is fiscally irresponsible. 
 Although he is not running for re-election, he has run an advertisement in South Carolina in which he explained why he did not want the money, saying, ''The easy thing isn't always the right thing.'' 
 But Mr. Sanford, the only governor to reject such a large portion of stimulus funds, has said his refusal to take the money has more to do with his desire to strengthen the state executive branch. 
 ''This is not about the vetoes, and this is not about the stimulus,'' he said in a news conference when he filed his lawsuit. ''If you allow the legislative branch to come in and usurp power that's been granted through a federal law, where are we in terms of balance of power in this state?''

HEADLINE: Next for the Administration: How to Time an Exit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama boiled down his three goals as the reluctant majority shareholder of General Motors this way on Monday: ''To get G.M. back on its feet, take a hands-off approach and get out quickly.''
 If only it were that easy. 
 Over the next few months, Mr. Obama and his auto task force will face many tests as they try to create a new paradigm for the nationalization, however temporary, of a storied and troubled emblem of American industry.
 While Mr. Obama will most likely come under extraordinary pressure to sell the government's 60 percent stake in the ''new G.M.,'' his own auto task force has warned him that the exit strategy could be messy: the faster the government sells its stake to private investors, the less it is likely to recover its investment of more than $50 billion in the company.
 And the longer the government holds on to its stake, the longer the pressures will build, from Congress and elsewhere, to intervene. 
 That process has started already. Mr. Obama has made it clear that he wants G.M. to produce small, fuel-efficient cars with a modest carbon footprint. But exactly what role the government will play in pressing G.M. to get on that long-delayed path, beyond the regulations it sets for the entire industry, were left curiously vague on Monday.
 ''What we are not doing -- what I have no interest in doing -- is running G.M.,'' Mr. Obama insisted at the White House, trying to pre-empt the suggestion that just because Washington has ultimate responsibility for the company does not mean he plans to exercise his prerogatives. Asked later what exactly Mr. Obama meant, Steven Rattner, a key figure on Mr. Obama's auto task force, said: ''No plant decisions, no dealer decisions, no color-of-the-car decisions.''
 Walking that fine line between micromanaging and making sure G.M. gets back on track after 40 years of ignoring market realities is the drama that is about to play out in Detroit and Washington. 
 Already there are signs that both Mr. Obama and the company will face inevitable tradeoffs when political pressures, manufacturing realities and the need to maximize the interests of taxpayers and consumers come in conflict. 
 Mr. Obama has gotten a taste of them already. Members of Congress have called the leaders of his auto task force to complain about the closing of a single Chrysler dealer -- one with powerful political friends. On Sunday, as Mr. Obama briefed Congressional leaders on the impending G.M. bankruptcy, one pressed him for a commitment that the ''new G.M.'' will not move its headquarters out of Detroit.
 ''He said that was a commercial decision, that he wouldn't get involved,'' said one senior administration official who had seen a summary of the call. ''But that's not the last request like this we are going to get.''
 Or the hardest, by far. G.M. insists that under the new, more flexible arrangements it has negotiated with the United Automobile Workers, it will be able to build more small cars in the United States than ever before. 
 But sooner or later, the company's environmental goals are bound to come into conflict -- again -- with its overarching need to prove that the new G.M. can turn a profit, the necessary step before private investors and lenders will step back in. 
 Profits will also dictate decisions about building cars in lower-cost countries like South Korea or China, decisions that the old G.M. faced every day. As soon as that happens, there will be protests in Detroit and on Capitol Hill that as long as G.M. is owned by American taxpayers, its cars and components should be produced on American soil. 
 Conversely, if the Obama administration sought to block a Chinese or Indian auto start-up from entering the American market, it would most likely be accused of protectionism. That would be an echo of the charge the United States used to level against Japan. 
 In interviews in recent days, Mr. Obama's economic team said it anticipated those pressures, and had moved to cut them off early.
 ''It started right around the time of the bank stress tests,'' said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, in an interview on Monday. During one of the president's daily economic briefings, Mr. Emanuel added, ''he said that taking over companies like this is a big deal, and that no president has ever faced anything like this before. And he said he wanted to see some rules of the road about how the government should act'' when it suddenly becomes the biggest shareholder in the market.
 Mr. Obama clearly wanted protection: a set of principles he could hand to angry members of Congress, campaign contributors or executives to explain why he would not call Fritz Henderson, G.M.'s chief executive, to discuss whether an engine should be made in Saginaw or Shanghai. 
 The result was an interagency task force informally called ''The Government as Shareholder,'' headed by Diana Farrell, the deputy director of the National Economic Council and formerly the head of the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of McKinsey & Company. 
 It was Ms. Farrell's report, delivered to the Oval Office fewer than 10 days ago, that laid out the principles that Mr. Obama described on Monday.
 The White House insists the principles will apply equally to the government's investment in the American International Group, the fallen insurer, or in Citigroup and other banks that the government has rescued.
 So, just as George Bush spent much of his presidency seeking a way out of Iraq, Mr. Obama may spend much of his seeking a way out of the morass of new government investments in the private sector. The hardest part will be knowing how to time the withdrawal of government support -- a balancing act between maximizing the investment of taxpayers and risking the company's fragile state. 
 ''The more uncertain the economic environment, the stronger the tension,'' Ms. Farrell acknowledged in an interview on Monday. ''The view is that we want to reduce the ownership stake as quickly as practicable, and to do so deliberately as part of a considered exit strategy.''

HEADLINE: A New Iran Overture, With Hot Dogs

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR 

 BODY:
Having sent the Iranian people a video greeting on their New Year, President Obama is now inviting them to help celebrate a quintessentially American holiday, the Fourth of July.
 Last Friday, the State Department sent a cable to its embassies and consulates around the world notifying them that ''they may invite representatives from the government of Iran'' to their Independence Day celebrations -- annual receptions that typically feature hot dogs, red-white-and-blue bunting and some perfunctory remarks about the founding fathers.
 Administration officials characterized the move as another in a series of American overtures to Iran. The United States has not had relations with Iran since the American Embassy in Tehran was seized by protesters in 1979; the country's diplomats have not been formally invited to American events since then. 
 ''It is another way of saying we are not putting barriers in the way of communicating,'' said one administration official. ''It is another way of signaling that there is an opportunity that should not be wasted.''
 A second official said the ban no longer made sense, at a time when the United States was actively engaging with Iranian officials elsewhere. In March, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, chatted with Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, at a conference in The Hague.
 The authorization to issue the invitations was disclosed by a senior State Department official on the eve of a three-day visit to Latin America by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the new policy was not public.
 Even as the United States reaches out to Tehran, it is trying to reclaim American influence in Latin America, where Iran has made inroads while the United States has been waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was in El Salvador to attend the inauguration of Mauricio Funes, whose election as president represents the first time the country has swung to the left since its civil war ended in 1992. She will be in Honduras on Tuesday for a meeting of the Organization of American States. The United States is expected to face intense pressure from Cuba's neighbors to reinstate the island's membership in the group.
 Mrs. Clinton has said Iran's rising influence in the region is ''quite disturbing.'' In May, she told State Department employees that the Bush administration's policy toward Latin America had created an opening for Iran and China, which are using commercial and other assistance to bolster anti-American leaders like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.
 ''They are building strong economic and political connections with a lot of these leaders,'' she said. ''I don't think that's in our interest.''
 While Iran's influence in the region is dwarfed by that of China -- which is a huge buyer of raw materials from Latin American countries -- Tehran's role has touched a nerve among senior administration officials like Mrs. Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has also spoken publicly about it.
 ''The specter of Iran raises red flags in a way that China doesn't, because China tends to respect the American sphere of influence,'' said Julia E. Sweig, a Latin American expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 Iran's motives are murkier, according to administration officials. It has cultivated wide-ranging economic ties with Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua. But it has also been linked to the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, which killed 85 people.
 Iran is not known to have a big presence in El Salvador, officials said, and it was not represented at Mr. Funes's inauguration. But the change in power after 17 years of a pro-American right-wing government could offer an opening.
 Mr. Funes's victory continues the ascension of the political left across Latin America; some analysts worry he will adopt the anti-American rhetoric of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. His party, the F.M.L.N., has its roots in guerrillas who fought El Salvador's American-backed army in the 1980s and 1990s. But Mr. Funes is viewed as more centrist than his party. American officials said Mrs. Clinton's presence was meant to signal that Washington would not take El Salvador for granted. 
 ''Some might say President Obama is left of center,'' Mrs. Clinton said after meeting with Mr. Funes.
 Speaking earlier to American diplomats, she alluded to the vagaries of American influence in the region. 
 ''Some of the difficulties we've had historically in forging strong and lasting ties in our hemisphere,'' she said, ''are a result of our perhaps not listening, perhaps not paying close enough attention.''

HEADLINE: City Students Gain in Math; Racial Gap Shrinks

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; David W. Chen, Robert Gebeloff and Kenny Porpora contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York City's public school students showed large gains on state math tests this year, particularly in the middle school grades, and black and Hispanic students continued to edge closer to their white counterparts, the city and state education departments announced on Monday.
 In New York City, 82 percent of students in Grades 3 through 8 passed the test, compared with 74 percent last year and just 57 percent three years ago. Statewide, 86 percent of students passed the test, compared with 81 percent last year. 
 The results, coupled with similar gains on English tests released last month, were a boon for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is lobbying Albany to keep control of city schools in the mayor's hands. 
 At a news conference at a school in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg trumpeted the results as evidence that mayoral control had produced revolutionary improvements and brought city students within spitting distance of state averages after years of mediocrity. 
 ''Our reforms are working,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Our schools are heading in the right direction.''
 New York was not, however, the only urban school system to register large gains. Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers and Syracuse showed similar increases. 
 Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the state's Board of Regents, said there was reason for caution amid the impressive results. She said that the tests had become too predictable, and that the state was considering raising the scores required to pass next year. 
 ''Just because scores have gone up dramatically does not mean that our youngsters are ready to go to college,'' Dr. Tisch said at a news conference in Albany.
 She said the results in New York City showed ''positive, strong movement in a right direction.'' But she pointed out that 74 percent of public school graduates need remedial education in English and math when they enter the City University of New York. 
 ''No one should interpret this as an enormous victory,'' Dr. Tisch said.
 Mr. Bloomberg and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, disputed that characterization, pointing to what they described as ground-breaking results: for instance, that the achievement gap between city students and their state counterparts had been cut in half over the past three years and is now 7 percentage points.
 There was also evidence that the gap among students of different races was narrowing in a city whose public school students are more than 70 percent black or Hispanic. Black students, for instance, trailed white students by 17 percentage points this year, on average, compared with 31 points in 2006.
 And middle school students, whose performance the city has historically struggled to improve, showed large gains. For example, 71 percent of eighth graders passed the test this year, compared with 60 percent last year.
 The students' average scores on the tests, often cited by testing experts as a better measure of progress on tests, showed an 8-point increase in the city, to 680, compared with 6 points statewide, to 684. Test scores range from the upper 400s to upper 700s, with 650 considered passing.
 Mr. Klein said in an interview that the results marked a milestone in his reform efforts and showed that urban districts with large numbers of disadvantaged students could compete with their better-off counterparts.
 ''This is a big victory for the city, and we should really bask in it,'' he said, adding that he supported the call to develop national standards.
 Even Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, lavished praise on the mayor and his chancellor. ''What we've seen in the last seven years is a cohesion and a stability and resources that we did not have beforehand,'' she said.
 But several scholars cautioned against viewing the scores as evidence of dramatic change.
 Michael J. Petrilli, a vice president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, an educational research organization, said the numbers most likely reflected a pattern that has emerged in cities that have implemented high-stakes testing programs.
 ''This is mostly about educators getting used to the exams, rather than some sort of intervention having a big impact,'' he said. 
 Mr. Petrilli said claims that the achievement gap was narrowing needed to be weighed against the fact that in many cases, the scores of white students have reached a plateau, making gains by black and Hispanic students appear more significant than they might actually be.
 Daniel Koretz, a Harvard professor of education and an expert on testing, said it was important to consider the possibility of score inflation.
 ''If you have a bunch of schools that are making substantial gains, some may be doing the hard work, but some may be introducing shortcuts,'' he said. ''The changes in percentages may look huge, but in fact kids might not know much more about math than before.''
 Mr. Klein chuckled at suggestions that the gains in test scores could be attributed to students' mastering the testing process. ''There's no way you're going to memorize the answers to these tests,'' he said.
 Another indicator of how well the city performed will come in the fall, when results of nationwide testing are released. The last results, in 2007, showed largely flat scores for the city, although fourth-grade math scores saw increases.
 At Public School/Middle School 15 in the University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, where Mr. Bloomberg held his news conference, teachers attributed the gains to the efforts of a math coach for teachers, Haydee Santino. Among other gains, 93 percent of fourth graders at the school met state standards, up from just 31 percent in 2002.
 Students at the school are tested at the beginning of the year and mid-year to gauge their progress, and then take the actual test in the spring, teachers said. Doreen Luckey, an eighth grade math teacher, said the curriculum worked in test-taking, with morning enrichment and after-school programs to work on test skills. She said that at first, she thought too much emphasis was being placed on test results, ''but then I started to see that you can prepare them without teaching to the test.''
 A sixth grade math teacher, Svetlana Isakharov, pondered how to describe her thoughts on test preparation. ''Overwhelming, that's a good way to say it, like it's all about the test,'' she said.
 One of her students, Matthew Sepulveda, said that he ''used to think the tests weren't worth it and we used to do a lot of test prep.''
 ''But now,'' he said, ''I feel like it really does help us learn.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosures: No End in Sight

 BODY:
A continuing steep drop in home prices combined with rising unemployment is powering a new wave of foreclosures. Unfortunately, there's little evidence, so far, that the Obama administration's anti-foreclosure plan will be able to stop it. 
 The plan offers up to $75 billion in incentives to lenders to reduce loan payments for troubled borrowers. Since it went into effect in March, some 100,000 homeowners have been offered a modification, according to the Treasury Department, though a tally is not yet available on how many offers have been accepted. 
 That's a slow start given the administration's goal of preventing up to four million foreclosures. It is even more worrisome when one considers the size of the problem and the speed at which it is spreading. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported last week that in the first three months of the year, about 5.4 million mortgages were delinquent or in some stage of foreclosure. 
 Not all of those families will lose their homes. Some will find the money to catch up on their payments. Others will qualify for loan modifications that allow them to hang on. But as borrowers become more hard pressed, lenders -- whose participation in the Obama plan is largely voluntary -- may not be able or willing to keep up with the spiraling demand for relief. 
 One of the biggest problems is that the plan focuses almost entirely on lowering monthly payments. But overly onerous payments are only part of the problem. For 15.4 million ''underwater'' borrowers -- those who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth -- a lack of home equity puts them at risk of default, even if their monthly payments have been reduced. They have no cushion to fall back on in the event of a setback, like job loss or illness. 
 This page has long argued that a robust anti-foreclosure plan should directly address the plight of underwater homeowners by reducing the loans' principal balance. That would restore some equity to borrowers -- and give them a further incentive to hold on to their homes -- in addition to lowering monthly payments. The mortgage industry has resisted this approach, and the Obama plan does not emphasize it. 
 With joblessness rising, lower monthly payments could quickly become unaffordable for many Americans. In a recent report, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston argued that unemployment is driving foreclosures and to make a difference, anti-foreclosure policy should focus on helping unemployed homeowners. The report suggests a temporary program of loans or grants to help them pay their mortgages while they look for another job. 
 The government will also have to make far more aggressive efforts to create jobs. The federal stimulus plan will preserve and generate a few million jobs, but that will barely make a dent -- in the overall economic crisis or the foreclosure disaster. Since the recession began in December 2007, nearly six million jobs have been lost, and millions more are bound to go missing before this downturn is over. 
 President Obama needs to put more effort and political capital into promoting the middle-class agenda that he outlined during the campaign, including a push for new jobs in new industries, expanded union membership and a fairer distribution of profits among shareholders, executives and employees. 
 There will be no recovery until there is a halt in the relentless rise in foreclosures. Foreclosures threaten millions of families with financial ruin. By driving prices down, they sap the wealth of all homeowners. They exacerbate bank losses, putting pressure on the still fragile financial system. Lower monthly payments are a balm, but they are no substitute for home equity. And until more Americans can find a good job and a steady paycheck, the number of foreclosures will continue to rise.

HEADLINE: The Latest Stray Words Of an Off-the-Cuff Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
 When you're worth $16 billion, it's all relative.
 On Monday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- who owns homes in Bermuda, Florida, Colorado and London; travels the globe on two private jets; and plans to spend $80 million of his own money on a re-election bid -- said that President Obama ''does not get paid that much.''
 That is, if a $400,000-a-year salary, a $50,000 expense account and a $19,000 entertainment budget qualifies as not much. 
 It was the latest puzzling remark in a re-election campaign filled with colorful foot-in-mouth mayoral utterances. 
 Campaign aides to Mr. Bloomberg are seeking to portray him as a sympathetic chief executive in touch with ordinary New Yorkers (witness a parade of commercials featuring a tieless mayor talking about jobs). 
 Mr. Bloomberg, however, has not made it easy. Since deciding to seek a third term last fall, he has declared that ''we love the rich.'' Reaching for an economic barometer, he described dwindling crowds at Bergdorf Goodman, the luxury department store. 
 He has scolded a disabled blogger, Michael Harris, who uses a wheelchair, for accidentally turning on a tape recorder at a news conference. And, last week, he bitterly rebuked a reporter, Azi Paybarah, who asked about his decision to overturn the city's term limits law, telling him, ''You're a disgrace.''
 Given Mr. Bloomberg's commanding lead in the polls -- he remains at least 10 points ahead of any rival -- the missteps suggest that the biggest obstacles to his re-election are his own, unpredictable words.
 Of course, New Yorkers have long admired candor from their leaders -- and Mr. Bloomberg is nothing if not frank. After parents complained about dangerously hot rubber safety mats on city playgrounds, he responded: ''If it's hot, don't sit on it.'' About crowded subways, and the griping they engender, he once said: ''So you stand next to people. Get real. This is New York.'' 
 William T. Cunningham, who served as Mr. Bloomberg's communications director during his first term, said: ''He does not try out phrases. He does not poll his language. He says what's on his mind.'' 
 He added, ''The public cares more about actions and deeds than the stray word here and there.''
 On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg had intended to placate critics -- or at least, the reporters who cover him -- by announcing he would take questions at campaign events. He has previously shunned the practice, forcing reporters to ask questions about his campaign at formal City Hall press briefings. Several testy exchanges have resulted.
 But the mayor's new policy arrived with strict new rules -- only campaign questions at campaign press conferences, and only questions about city government at city government press conferences -- that touched off immediate protest from reporters. 
 Then came the mayor's remarks on Mr. Obama's pay. Mr. Bloomberg was asked about Republican criticism of the president and first lady for their whirlwind trip to New York on Saturday night, just as General Motors prepared to file for bankruptcy. 
 Mr. Bloomberg defended the romantic jaunt, saying it would bolster the economy, before adding that the president, whose income puts him in the top 1 percent of Americans, ''does not get paid that much'' and ''lives on a budget.''
 Head scratching ensued. Aides said he was referring to the cost of the president's travel and security (which is paid for by taxpayers.) And later on Monday, the mayor sought to clarify the remarks, saying ''The president is worth a lot more than we pay him.''
 As for his eyebrow-raising remarks, the mayor had this to say: ''I am 67 years old. I am who I am.''

HEADLINE: Democratic Senators Set to Visit White House to Discuss Health Care Overhaul

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will meet with influential Senate Democrats on Tuesday to discuss overhauling health care, as the White House releases a report asserting that revamping the system would increase the income of a typical family of four by $2,600 in 2020, and by $10,000 in 2030. 
 The Democrats on two Senate committees that are drafting health legislation have been invited to the White House to meet with Mr. Obama, hours before he leaves for the Middle East and Europe. As part of a push to secure Congressional passage of a bill this year, the administration will also make the case on Tuesday that reforming health care is critical to fixing the economy. 
 ''If we don't do this we're going to be facing a real mess 30 years from now,'' Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Monday on a conference call to discuss her new report, ''The Economic Case for Health Care Reform.''
 Also, six health care organizations followed up Monday on a commitment they made last month to Mr. Obama to trim $2 trillion in health care costs over 10 years. The groups, representing doctors, hospitals, drug companies and a labor union, proposed eliminating unnecessary medical tests and procedures, slashing red tape and better managing chronic diseases.
 They said the potential savings could be $1 trillion to $1.7 trillion over 10 years.
 Health care spending in the United States accounts for 18 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the White House report, and is expected to rise sharply, to as much as 28 percent in 2030 and 34 percent in 2040. The administration says it can slow the growth of health spending even as it expands coverage to the more than 45 million people who are now uninsured. 
 Republicans are doubtful. Referring to the health care groups' proposals, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said Monday, ''I'm skeptical that these proposals will add up to anywhere near $2 trillion.'' 
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, called the White House report ''nothing more than smoke and mirrors,'' and said the administration had not offered a credible plan to expand coverage ''without raising taxes or rationing care.'' 
 The White House report -- 51 pages, with charts, graphs and algebraic formulas -- estimated that slowing the growth rate of health care spending by 1.5 percent a year would increase economic output by more than 2 percent in 2020 and nearly 8 percent in 2030. The report also states that revamping the health care system would ''prevent disastrous increases in the federal budget deficit.'' 
 The 1.5 percent figure was cited as a goal by the six organizations that proposed cost savings to the president. Each submitted recommendations, though it was not clear how much each was willing to sacrifice. 
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, representing drug companies, advocated greater use of certain prescription drugs, like medicines for high blood pressure -- a move it said could save lives and money by keeping people healthier and reducing hospital admissions. 
 Doctors, represented by the American Medical Association, promised to try to curb the overuse of imaging services, like magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and the shoulder, and to reduce surgeries that might not be necessary, like Caesarean section deliveries and angioplasties in patients with stable coronary artery disease.
 The Service Employees International Union said Medicaid and Medicare could save money by encouraging the use of home care services, instead of nursing homes. The union recommended that the federal government temporarily increase Medicaid payments to the states for home- and community-based services.
 America's Health Insurance Plans, representing insurers, vowed to establish standard claim forms and Web sites that allowed doctors to communicate more easily with insurers. 
 Congress may try to put some proposals into legislation, to help offset the costs of providing coverage for millions of the uninsured. This week, the chairmen of the two relevant Senate committees are finishing legislation to be considered by their panels this month.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s New Owners, Labor and Government, Adjust to Roles

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
For decades, the United Automobile Workers had a simple strategy for getting what it wanted from the carmakers -- it would go on strike. The tactic proved so successful that the mere threat of a walkout often won better wages, benefits and job security.
 Now, with General Motors and Chrysler in bankruptcy and the union a major shareholder in both through its retiree health fund, life has become a lot more complicated for the U.A.W. 
 The union, which was born of labor strife, has pledged not to go on strike against the two companies before 2015, as part of the rescue plan hammered out by the Obama administration. Whether this brokered peace helps end the antagonistic relationship between union and management could determine the future not only of G.M. and Chrysler, but also of the U.A.W. itself.
 With the union's health fund set to own 17.5 percent of G.M.'s shares and 55 percent of Chrysler's, the U.A.W. will both represent workers and be an owner, a novel dual role. 
 ''We don't run corporations. We represent people,'' said Brian Fredline, president of the local representing 3,000 workers at a G.M. plant in Lansing, Mich. 
 Some industry experts predict that the union, far more than before, will help management increase profitability -- with the goal of pushing up the automakers' stock prices. A higher share price could mean billions more for the retirees' health plan, helping to ensure ample funding for decades to come. 
 But other experts say the union will stick to its traditional truculence, focusing on preserving jobs rather than maximizing profits and share price. As evidence, these experts point to the union's recent, successful campaign, directed at G.M. and the Obama administration, to prevent the automaker from importing small cars from China, a move that would have increased G.M.'s profits while very likely reducing the number of domestic automobile jobs.
 ''I don't think the union is going to act that different,'' said Harry C. Katz, dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. ''I wish it would, but mostly things won't look that different.''
 In fact, over the years the U.A.W. has taken two different postures toward Detroit: by turns, hard-charging adversary and strategic partner. Sometimes the union has been an unyielding bargainer, leading to strikes that have lasted for months as well as to much-derided perks, like overtime pay for union members who work less than 40 hours a week. But other times the union has worked with management to assure labor peace, raise productivity and, over the last few years, push down labor costs. 
 One example: when G.M. was hurting in 2005, the union agreed to establish the retiree health plan, known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association, to save the automaker $1 billion a year in health costs.
 Union officials acknowledge their discomfort with the union being a major shareholder. ''The reason we've received this equity stake is we're trying to help the corporation survive and fund the VEBA,'' Mr. Fredline said.
 The Obama administration has pushed hard to bring out the U.A.W.'s cooperative side, evidenced by the union's agreeing to a wage freeze and the no-strike clause. 
 But the union is likely to continue fighting future layoffs, plant closings and line speedups -- there are many ways to pressure management without going on strike. 
 ''They'll want to maximize the number of jobs for their members, and they'll use their influence for that,'' said Sean McAlinden, chief economist with the Center for Automotive Research. ''And there are other fears the industry has -- they might want to force G.M. to only use unionized suppliers. And they could use their political influence to make it easier to organize the international automakers in the South.''
 Under the rescue plan, the federal government will own 60 percent of G.M.'s stock. It might be politically difficult for the union to confront the federal government if it were managing the company. But President Obama emphasized on Monday that he wants professional managers, not the government, to run the company. 
 While workers often feel an initial thrill about employee ownership, after several weeks of drudgery back on the assembly line, the thrill sometimes wears off and the us-against-them attitude toward management reasserts itself.
 But Christopher Mackin, president of Ownership Associates, a firm based in Cambridge, Mass., that advises businesses and workers about employee ownership, argued that the U.A.W.'s roles need not conflict. 
 ''When you get workers to understand they are the owners of the enterprise,'' he said, ''they realize there are two significant bites of the apple: one is when you get paid in current compensation, and one is what you get paid for success'' through profit-sharing or an employee stock ownership plan -- although he noted that VEBA stock ownership differed from traditional employee ownership.
 Some employee-owned companies have failed, however, because management, mindful of their employee owners, often gave in to wage demands. That, some analysts say, helped drive United Airlines into bankruptcy when it was employee-owned. 
 For this reason, industry experts say, the Obama administration structured the G.M. and Chrysler plans to lessen the union's voice in management. The retirees' health fund has six public-appointed trustees and five union-appointed trustees. Though the union health trust owns 55 percent of Chrysler, it will hold just one seat on the Chrysler board. And at both automakers, the health fund's shares will be nonvoting.
 All this makes clear, one administration official said, that the union will not dominate and ''this will not be Gettelfinger Motors.''
 The U.A.W. president, Ron Gettelfinger, says he wants to sell the health fund's shares as soon as practical. The union's advisers have warned it would be unwise to tie up so much of the fund's assets long term in a single company's shares.
 This, some say, could cause the U.A.W. to make nice, at least for a while. ''In order to sell their shares at a good price,'' said Maryann Keller, an auto industry analyst who runs her own consulting firm, ''they're going to at least give the appearance of helping maximize profits.''

HEADLINE: A Clearer Clean Water Act

 BODY:
The Obama administration has rightly declared its support for Congressional efforts to restore the broad reach of the Clean Water Act. The law, passed in 1972, was intended to protect all of the waters of the United States, large and small. That mission has since been muddied by two Supreme Court decisions that narrowed the law's scope, weakened its safeguards against pollution and confused federal regulators. 
 The administration has written to Senate and House committees urging them to act on bills that would restore federal jurisdiction over all wetlands and streams. All of the environmental big guns signed: Nancy Sutley, the chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality; Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Ken Salazar, the interior secretary; Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary; and Terrence Salt, the acting chief of Army Corps of Engineers. 
 Their intervention is timely. Powerful commercial interests, including developers and big farming groups, have been pressuring Congress to keep things the way they are. 
 For nearly three decades, the Clean Water Act was broadly interpreted by the courts and federal regulators as shielding all the waters of the United States -- seasonal streams and remote wetlands as well as lakes and large navigable rivers. The basic idea was that even the smallest waters have some connection to larger watersheds, and that they, too, need to be protected from pollution and development. 
 Unfortunately, the actual language of the act was less clear than its intent. For instance, the word ''navigable'' pops up from time to time, suggesting that the law only applied to waters capable of handling boat traffic. Pouncing on these ambiguities, the Supreme Court issued rulings in 2001 and 2006 that said, in effect, that only navigable, permanent water bodies merited federal protection. About 20 million acres of wetlands and more than half the country's small streams were suddenly stripped of protections, and federal investigations into suspected violations were dropped or delayed. 
 The bills in Congress would, among other fixes, replace the troublesome word ''navigable'' wherever it appears in the law with the far more inclusive ''waters of the United States.'' Once Congress provides legal clarity, the administration's letter says, vigorous enforcement will follow. The letter also warns, rightly, that ''all of the environmental and economic benefits that these aquatic ecosystems provide are at risk if some elements are protected and others are not.'' 
 In other words, the biggest beneficiary of a tighter, clearer law will be the environment -- and the economy -- as a whole.

HEADLINE: Tough Challenges Ahead in U.S. Effort to Reshape Failing Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
As chief executive of the Chicago public schools, Arne Duncan closed more than a dozen of the city's worst schools, reopening them with new principals and teachers. People who worked with him, and some who fought him, say those school turnarounds were worth the effort, but all aroused intense opposition.
 ''It's always painful,'' said David Pickens, who was Mr. Duncan's top lieutenant in the school makeover efforts here. ''It's like a root canal every year.''
 Now Mr. Duncan, President Obama's education secretary, wants to take school turnaround efforts nationwide on a scale never tried before. In speeches and interviews, he said he would press local authorities to close thousands of the country's worst schools, the dropout factories where only a tiny fraction of students are reading at grade level, and reopen them with new staff members. 
 Mr. Duncan appears to have the money to drive the effort. Experts estimate the cost of overhauling a failing school at $3 million to $6 million. Mr. Duncan controls $3 billion in the economic stimulus law that could go to school turnarounds, and the administration's 2010 budget requests $1.5 billion more. 
 Still, he faces many obstacles, experts said.
 ''Closing a school is the most difficult task any superintendent or school board can attempt, and not many succeed,'' said Terry Mazany, who watched Mr. Duncan's school makeovers as chief executive at the Chicago Community Trust. ''But it's not impossible, and it's the right thing to do.''
 Mr. Duncan wants to see 250 schools closed and reconstituted next year. That would mean dismissing thousands of teachers next spring, hiring replacements and opening newly reconstituted schools in fall 2010. 
 Formal closure is necessary for chronically failing schools, Mr. Duncan said, to reset the learning environment more dramatically than simply tweaking the curriculum and retraining the old staff.
 Eventually, he said, he hopes to see 1,000 failing schools turned around each year. 
 The federal government lacks the authority to close schools, so Mr. Duncan's first challenge is to persuade scores of local districts to begin school turnarounds that, judging from Chicago's experience, will anger teachers, administrators, parents and local politicians. Another challenge will be recruiting the high-quality educators crucial to helping reconstituted schools succeed.
 Teachers union contracts could be another major hurdle. 
 The Chicago contract gives tenured teachers in schools shut down for low performance 10 months to be rehired by their reconstituted school's new leader or by another Chicago principal, after which they lose their job. (About 8 in 10 find jobs at other Chicago schools, Mr. Pickens said.) Contracts in many other cities give teachers who lose positions more extensive rights, which could make school makeovers harder, experts said.
 Mr. Duncan said he had already discussed his plans with the presidents of the two national teachers unions.
 ''I've told them we all have to play by a different set of rules and figure out how we're going to take this on together,'' Mr. Duncan said.
 Randi Weingarten, president of one of the unions, the American Federation of Teachers, said Mr. Duncan's focus on the worst schools was ''the right strategy,'' but added, ''What I've raised with Arne is, wholesale firing of staffs, pretending that if you just close a school and open a new one it will solve all the problems -- that's the wrong way.''
 Mr. Duncan's initiative would seek to correct a troubling legacy of the No Child Left Behind law. The law has identified 6,000 failing schools, yet state and local authorities have left most of them to languish, neither holding their educators accountable nor helping to improve instruction. 
 ''It's a rare thing for a state or even for districts to go so far as to close down a low-performing school,'' said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy. 
 In Chicago, Mr. Duncan worked on eight turnarounds with the Academy for Urban School Leadership, a nonprofit group whose largest project has been remaking troubled Orr Academy High School on Chicago's West Side. Many of its 1,200 students have been incarcerated or kicked out of other schools, and its in-house day care center minds 35 babies each day while their mothers, some of them students and others teachers, are in class.
 An earlier overhaul at Orr that divided it into three small high schools achieved little; Illinois's 2008 test scores showed that 9 percent of students were proficient in reading and math. So Chicago's announcement last year that the school would be overhauled again set off protests.
 One opponent was the Rev. Charlie Walker, minister of a nearby Baptist church, who said he and the neighborhood had not been properly consulted.
 ''I became an attacker,'' Mr. Walker said. ''I went at them like a lawn mower goes after grass.''
 The turnaround went ahead anyway. 
 Research has shown that teacher quality and a principal's leadership are key factors in raising student achievement, said Don Feinstein, executive director of the Academy for Urban School Leadership. So his group sorted through scores of resumes before picking Jammie Poole, a Memphis educator, as Orr's new principal.
 Mr. Poole recruited a new instructional staff that included some strong teachers at Orr who had reapplied for their jobs.
 After the three small schools at Orr closed last June, it got new science laboratories, and Mr. Poole organized teachers to work in teams and scheduled regular quizzes to help identify concepts that students had not yet mastered. Instructional coaches help teachers use the data.
 Orr's school culture got an overhaul, too. Students wear black and gold uniforms. Parents participate in hallway patrols. Every adult, including cooks, meets regularly with 12 students to track academic progress. 
 Orr's turnaround will cost about $6 million over five years. Nine months after it reopened, there has been a sea change in neighborhood attitudes. After Mr. Poole invited him to tour the school, Mr. Walker became a convert. 
 ''They're the best leadership team that's been in the school in the last 12 to 15 years,'' Mr. Walker said. 
 Still, it remains unclear whether the changes will sharply raise student achievement. Eighteen months ago, Bryan Hassel, a Harvard-trained education consultant, reviewed conditions in half a dozen Chicago schools that had been turned around.
 ''I was favorably impressed with some of the schools, and not with others,'' Mr. Hassel said. ''It was a mixed picture.'' 
 In the corporate world, Mr. Hassel said, turnaround efforts transform failing businesses only about 25 percent to 30 percent of the time.
 ''A lot of these school turnarounds are going to fail because the work is so difficult,'' Mr. Hassel said. ''But as a nation, we'll never have the capacity to do this work successfully until we make the commitment.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Softens Tone In Approach To Beijing

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
In his first visit to China as Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner seems to be taking a new approach to dealing with China.
 With the global financial crisis reverberating, Mr. Geithner is applauding Beijing's efforts to stimulate its economy, trying to lay the foundation for future negotiations and promising that the United States will press for China to have a bigger role in the management of the global economy.
 He is also trying to address the concerns of some Chinese officials and economists about the soaring American budget deficits and their potential impact on the value of Treasury notes. China is now the largest holder of United States government debt. 
 ''We will cut our fiscal deficit; we will eliminate the extraordinary governmental support that we have put in place to overcome the crisis,'' Mr. Geithner said in a speech at Peking University on Monday. Later, when asked by a student whether China's investment in American assets was safe, he said, ''Chinese financial assets are very safe.''
 Analysts say Mr. Geithner's three-day visit, which ends Tuesday, after meetings with President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, signals a shift in relations between the United States and China. The Obama administration appears determined to make China a more equal partner and Mr. Geithner's tone this week has been soft and conciliatory.
 The Bush administration maintained solid relations with China. But Bush administration officials regularly pressed Beijing to crack down on the counterfeiting of American software, movies and pharmaceuticals, and to allow American banks and investment banks greater access to the Chinese market.
 Trying to prevent Congressional Democrats from passing legislation intended to punish China for ''manipulating'' its currency, and thereby exacerbating huge American trade deficits, Bush administration officials pushed China to allow its currency to appreciate against the dollar, hoping that might slow the growth of Chinese exports to the United States.
 Mr. Geithner's trip seems geared more toward winning the confidence of Chinese leaders. He is emphasizing mutual respect and trying to ensure that Beijing does not sour on the dollar or stop buying Treasury notes.
 C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said American relations with China had intensified and strengthened in recent years, growing increasingly important as the two nations recognized the need to try to solve global problems together. The Obama administration's more conciliatory approach may represent a new kind of diplomacy that has emerged in the wake of the financial crisis, he said.
 ''I suspect part of what you're seeing with Geithner is a change in style,'' Mr. Bergsten said in a telephone interview on Monday. ''Maybe he'll raise some of these issues, like piracy and exchange rate reform, more quietly, and that may be more effective.''
 Mr. Geithner also said Monday that he was pressing to make the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions more representative; China, in other words, should play a greater role in helping to manage the global economy.
 In recent months, Mr. Wen and some leading Chinese economists have scolded American policy makers, expressing worries that the Obama administration's plans to run up huge deficits would eventually weaken the dollar and diminish the value of China's holdings in Treasury notes.
 Some issues Mr. Geithner has raised with Chinese leaders this week are familiar. He said that the United States and China must each help to rebalance growth; that Americans should consume less and save more; and that China should save less and consume more.
 Mr. Geithner is also discussing climate change issues in Beijing, pressing for greater cooperation and also encouraging China to use American technology to deal with environmental problems.
 But Mr. Geithner's language and tone appear decidedly gentler. And Bush administration statements about what China needs to learn from Wall Street have been replaced by acknowledgments of China's relative economic well-being. ''China,'' Mr. Geithner said, ''despite your own manifest challenges as a developing country, you are in an enviably strong position.''

HEADLINE: For Chief, Little Time and a Full Plate

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Generations of business leaders around the world were schooled in the principles of management devised in the 1920s by General Motors' president, Alfred P. Sloan Jr.
 Now General Motors has to learn how to manage itself through bankruptcy and into a future as a much smaller company -- something that Mr. Sloan, whose strategy emphasized size, might never have foreseen.
 The outcome will determine whether Fritz Henderson, G.M.'s chief executive, keeps his job, and whether the Obama administration correctly bet $50 billion on the future of G.M. Mr. Henderson invoked Mr. Sloan, author of ''My Years With General Motors,'' on Monday as he stood before reporters and cameras in the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm that is directing G.M. through bankruptcy, and is a tenant in the G.M. building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. 
 As he passed a portrait of Mr. Sloan that morning, Mr. Henderson said, he was reminded that Mr. Sloan led G.M. through a financial crisis in the early 1920s that threatened the company's existence. 
 ''If he were sitting here today, he would say, 'Just do your job,' '' Mr. Henderson said. But Mr. Sloan had years to turn around G.M. and decades to hone the reputation that made his 1963 memoir a best seller. 
 Mr. Henderson, a relative unknown in corporate America, has only a few months, and he will do so under enormous scrutiny, from a new board and from the Treasury, which has become a majority owner of the new G.M. 
 His news conference on Monday was, in a sense, his introduction to the country after being thrust into G.M.'s top job, after the Obama administration fired his predecessor, Rick Wagoner, on March 29. in Detroit, Mr. Henderson, 50, joined the automaker a quarter-century ago, after earning a degree in business administration at the University of Michigan, where he was a pitcher on the varsity baseball team. He also has an M.B.A. from Harvard.
 He toiled in a variety of financial assignments until 1997, when he was put in charge of G.M.'s Brazilian operations, traditionally a proving ground for the company's most promising executives.
 From Brazil, Mr. Henderson moved on to run G.M.'s operations for all of Latin America, then its emerging Asia-Pacific business, and finally one of the company's biggest prizes, G.M. Europe. He was working there in late 2005 when G.M., facing a financial crisis, abruptly announced the departure of its chief financial officer, John M. Devine, and installed Mr. Henderson.
 His salary as chief executive is $1.3 million. In 2008, a regulatory filing showed he had stock grants and deferred compensation worth $6.6 million at the time it was given, plus the option to buy an additional one million shares. 
 But the value of his stock had plummeted by the end of 2008, and it has now been wiped out in bankruptcy court.
 Unlike other G.M. chief executives, he will have to contend with a variety of bosses. The Treasury has hired a search firm to find directors, particularly focusing on those with backgrounds in the auto industry and in corporate restructurings. G.M.'s interim chairman, Kent Kresa, the former chief executive of Northrop Grumman, is expected to receive that job full time.
 Along with a new board and the government, Mr. Henderson will have to work alongside Albert A. Koch, vice chairman of AlixPartners, the turnaround and financial advisory firm that advised the government in drafting the restructuring plan. 
 In Detroit, Mr. Koch is best known for serving as chief financial officer at Kmart during its own bankruptcy case from 2002 to 2003.
 The two men will divide the remaking of the company. While Mr. Henderson focuses on G.M.'s future shape, Mr. Koch's job will be to dispose of the assets that G.M. does not want to keep, which make up what the company is calling Old G.M. 
 They will be working together ''step by step'' to assure an orderly winding down of the old company, Mr. Henderson said. 
 Mr. Henderson said the government's involvement did not faze him. ''We're fine with that. I'm fine with that,'' he said.
 Seated in the front row at the news conference on Monday was Harvey R. Miller, who leads G.M.'s legal team, and Ira M. Millstein, the veteran lawyer at Weil, Gotshal who advised G.M. directors in 1992, when they staged a boardroom coup that led to the ouster of the chief executive, Robert C. Stempel.
 Speaking after the news conference, Mr. Millstein said Mr. Henderson would face an unusual challenge in juggling the demands of so many bosses, including a new board; the governments of the United States and Canada, which together will hold 72.5 percent of the company; and the United Automobile Workers. 
 ''What does a board do when it's a government-owned company?'' Mr. Millstein said. ''That's a new book.'' 
 Mr. Henderson said that he did not believe that the government would second-guess the company on ordinary product and strategy decisions -- like the cars G.M. might develop -- but would limit its involvement to major governance issues. He did not elaborate.
 Most chief executives are given at least a year by their boards, and often much longer, to bring off a restructuring, said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School. 
 Mr. Henderson may have only three months, the government's ideal length for the bankruptcy case. ''He's obviously on a very short leash,'' Professor Useem said.
 Mr. Henderson seemed keenly aware of his limited window on Monday. ''There are no second chances, but we won't need one,'' he said. ''It is our job to deliver.''

HEADLINE: Opening the Border For Commercial Growth

BYLINE: By DAN LUZADDER

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico 

 BODY:
On a recent weekday morning, Mexican soldiers carrying automatic weapons stood in a thin line along a vehicle checkpoint at the busy border crossing from this Baja California city into Otay Mesa, Calif. 
 While the military presence partly reflects the highly publicized drug violence in Tijuana and other Mexican border cities, it is commerce and the development of commercial real estate that has become a chief focus for business interests in the southernmost area of California. 
 In the last year, economic development officials and local elected leaders in San Diego County, Baja cities in Mexico and the sprawling Imperial Valley about 90 miles to the east have used a grant of $220,000 of government and private seed money for an initiative aimed at turning this area into a global powerhouse for commercial growth. 
 The idea is that a concerted effort will produce more manufacturing in Mexico, more research and development in San Diego and more alternative energy in Imperial County. 
 The area is formally known as the Cali Baja Bi-National Mega-Region, covering roughly 27,000 square miles. Late last month, Mayor Jerry Sanders of San Diego, Mayor Jorge Ramos of Tijuana and economic development leaders from both sides of the border announced a marketing effort that, so far, is aiming to attract companies from China and the Pacific Rim. 
 Central to the effort is a planned new border crossing, which may be completed as early as 2012, about two miles from the current Otay Mesa port of entry. To be known as Otay Mesa East, it is expected to become the most technologically advanced crossing in the region, with waits for commercial truck traffic of 20 minutes or less, compared with the current three or four hours.
 Christina Luhn, director of the Cali Baja initiative for the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, was at the border recently to meet representatives of Kyocera Mexicana in Tijuana, a unit of the Japanese company Kyocera, which manufactures solar panels and other clean-tech products that are shipped into the United States through Otay Mesa. 
 Dr. Luhn says she is hopeful that new cooperation between Mexico and the United States under the Obama administration will help to bring the drug cartels to heel and ease the task of convincing global companies that the region is right for them as a gateway to United States markets. ''I tend to be more optimistic about this than I was even six months ago,'' Dr. Luhn said. 
 John V. Bragg, vice president of Kearny Real Estate in the city of Otay Mesa, is also hopeful that development will help address problems that include an aging industrial base, the underuse of strategically located land, and environmental challenges.
 His optimism is more than theoretical, he said. His company recently purchased 311 acres of land in the United States near where the new Otay Mesa East crossing is expected to be built.
 Besides constructing the new crossing, which is now the subject of environmental impact studies, the California transportation department is preparing to build state highways to accommodate increased truck freight, Mr. Bragg noted.
 That will give rise, he said, to the construction of several million square feet of warehousing and distribution facilities to handle goods made with low-cost labor in Mexico. In turn, retail stores and hotels are expected to be built nearby, as happened near the current Otay Mesa crossing.
 ''What we want to see now, as a developer and land owner, is infrastructure so that people can move better,'' Mr. Bragg said. ''We want to see the two countries get together to improve the border crossing and to build then whatever is appropriate.'' He added that Kearny hoped to build two million to three million square feet of logistics-related facilities on its newly acquired property.
 Mr. Bragg conceded that vacancy rates for existing warehouses in Otay Mesa were 17 to 20 percent, but he said that occupancy would increase as the transportation services are improved and more modern technology was introduced. 
 Ninety minutes to the east, just over the border from Calexico, Calif., at Mexicali, the capital of Baja California, infrastructure is already in place for the new 10,000-acre Silicon Border Science Park. Silicon Border announced last year that Q-Cells of Germany, a leading maker of solar panels, would build a new manufacturing facility there. 
 Mike Oliver, executive vice president for business development at Silicon Border, said Phase 1 infrastructure like roads, sewers, water treatment and recycling, lighting and fiber optic cables had been completed, with ''tens of millions in initial financing from ING Clarion,'' a division of ING, the Dutch bank. ''By the time we are finished, we will have had investment of hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ''We have room for about two dozen Q-Cells type facilities.'' 
 Other new commercial developments are also on the drawing board in Calexico, said Danny Fitzgerald, director of the city's enterprise zone. Projects under way include Calexico Mega Park, a 157-acre mixed-use retail, business and residential development by Westmount Properties; Calexico 111 Center, with more than 65 acres of commercial and 58 acres of industrial development; and Los Legos, some 500 acres that will include residential and commercial components.
 Tim Kelley, president of the Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation, said cooperative work between his organization, the San Diego County Economic Development Corporation and the city of Mexicali on the Silicon Border development helped the Cali Baja initiative. 
 Since then, the concept of Imperial Valley as a haven for alternative energy -- solar collection, wind energy farms, geothermal heating and biofuels from algae -- has taken off.
 Despite the economy, Mr. Kelley said, ''we're getting more expressions of interest than we have ever gotten before. The phone is ringing constantly.''

HEADLINE: The Peril of 'Buy American'

 BODY:
It's not surprising that Democrats in Congress could not resist adding a ''Buy American'' provision to the fiscal stimulus bill earlier this year. It might seem sensible (or at least politically useful) to ensure that taxpayer dollars would be used exclusively to support American jobs. 
 But as states and municipalities start spending stimulus money, the idea is starting to look as counterproductive as it should have looked from the beginning. It is sparking conflict with American allies and, rather than supporting employment at home, the ''Buy American'' effort could ultimately cost American jobs. 
 Foreign and domestic companies that employ hundreds of workers in this country cannot bid for government projects because they cannot guarantee the American provenance of all the steel, iron and manufactured goods in their supply chain, as the provision requires. Others are scrambling to figure out whether American-made alternatives exist to replace their foreign inputs.
 The steel company Duferco Farrell, for example, has cut about 600 jobs in Pennsylvania after it lost orders from its biggest customer because some of its goods are partly produced abroad. The Westlake Chemical Corporation of Houston has lost sales to a Canadian vinyl pipe maker that is cutting back production because it can't bid for some American jobs. 
 America's trading partners expected more of President Obama, who signed a declaration against protectionism at the summit of the biggest nations in April. He convinced Congress to add a clause to its ''Buy American'' effort promising Washington would meet its international obligations. But cities and some states are not bound by the rules of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 Some allies, and many American companies, expected the president would seek to persuade local governments to abide by federal rules, but in April the Office of Management and Budget issued interim guidelines that offered no such guidance. 
 In the absence of leadership from the president, the temptation to turn to protectionism is growing. Hundreds of municipalities and some state legislatures have signed on to a ''Buy American'' resolution pushed by the United Steelworkers union. And the House of Representatives stuck provisions requiring the use of American materials into bills about water quality improvement and new school facilities. 
 Meanwhile, representatives of Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Mexico have been consulting about how to respond to the United States' protectionist drive. After Canadian companies were barred from bidding for American business, news reports say that some 12 Canadian cities passed ordinances against buying American. And the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is expected to discuss a possible coordinated response at its meeting this month.
 Industries like water and wastewater treatment are highly integrated with their Canadian counterparts, with exports to Canada in 2008 worth $6.2 billion and imports worth $4 billion. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, retaliation by Canadian municipalities could cost American water equipment companies an estimated $3 billion in lost business.
 An analysis this year by Jeffrey Schott and Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington estimated that ''Buy American'' provisions could ''save'' 9,000 American jobs -- a tiny number compared with the 650,000 jobs supported by foreign government procurement of American exports.
 Indeed, whether it is from the point of view of diplomacy or of job creation, ''Buy American'' is a terrible idea. One that could make the global recession worse.

HEADLINE: Two Bronx Democrats Win Special Elections to Assembly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Two New York Assembly staff members have succeeded their Democratic bosses in special elections in the Bronx held on Tuesday, easily beating their challengers. 
 Vanessa Gibson, a Democrat, beat Joel Rivera, a Conservative, and Barbara Bowland, a Republican, in the 77th Assembly District. The seat had been held by Aurelia Greene, a Democrat, since 1982 in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
In the 85th Assembly District, the Democrat, Marcos Crespo, beat the Republican, Leopold Paul. The seat was held by Ruben Diaz Jr. since 1997.
 Mr. Diaz was elected Bronx borough president in April and he picked Ms. Greene as his deputy. Mr. Diaz replaces Adolfo Carrion Jr., now President Obama's urban policy director.
 The 77th District covers Highbridge and Morrisania. The 85th district is the Soundview area.

HEADLINE: A Tour Guide Tames Lunch In Midtown

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
A COUPLE of Fridays ago, the metal gates of Fashion Soup were pulled down and padlocked tight. A narrow storefront on the dusty edge of the fashion district, it served a peculiar menu of soups like tomato-basil-mozzarella and crawfish bisque, with Colombian empanadas on the side. Its regulars appreciated the $6 soup, bread, cookie and fruit combo, but few in Manhattan would mourn, or even notice, its passing.
 Except for Zach Brooks. 
 ''This is Midtown Lunch history in the making!'' he cried, lifting his camera to get a good shot of the blank wall. With the photo, Mr. Brooks was poised to update Fashion Soup's listing on his Web site, with a plea for information about its closing. 
 Mr. Brooks is the founder, editor, and chief correspondent of Midtown Lunch, midtownlunch.com, a three-year-old Web site that serves those who toil in Midtown and hope to find something decent and reasonably priced to eat on their lunch breaks. 
 The site brings a measure of order to the roiling chaos of the area, which has almost 3,000 food businesses -- delis, pizza joints, trucks, carts and restaurants -- and almost one million daily workers, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation. 
 ''Midtown Lunch rescued me from those awful salad bars,'' said Regina Soto, a 21-year-old receptionist for a jewelry company on West 47th Street, who commutes from Queens. ''It's confusing when you start working here, because your lunch hour is short and there are so many places,'' she added. ''When I started I didn't know what 'glatt kosher' meant, or 'halal.' '' 
 Where other food bloggers might seek out the most authentic Neapolitan pizza, the spiciest Sichuan chicken, the creme of the creme brulees, Mr. Brooks is a lyricist of low expectations. Many of his finds -- and his followers' favorites -- aren't the best that New York has to offer, and aren't especially comfortable or welcoming. ''Almost everything on the site could be prefaced by 'For Midtown,' '' he said. ''As in, 'For Midtown, this is really good Chinese food.' '' 
 What Mr. Brooks's beat lacks in flavor, he makes up for in fervent enthusiasm. He is genuinely excited when a new Baja Fresh outlet opens, though savvy enough to know that it's not the most authentic Mexican food around. He tries to follow everything lunch, from the generic (Pronto Pizza) to the intriguing (the new Cravings truck, serving Taiwanese pork chops and tea-soaked eggs), as long as it's in Midtown and cheap: $10 is the upper limit, with $11 as an exception for anything all-you-can-eat. 
 ''We came to Midtown because of the Web site,'' said Diana Yang, an owner of the Cravings truck. ''And we sold out in two hours on the first day because of it, too.''
 Mr. Brooks's meticulous daily coverage of his beat -- the arrival of a new Chipotle, a one-hour giveaway at a Belgian waffle truck -- sets it apart from other food blogs. Also, the hyperlocal nature of the site -- the boundaries are 59th Street to the north, 32nd Street to the south, Eighth Avenue to the west, and Third Avenue to the east -- makes it more useful day to day than many of the more opinionated, epicurean sites.
 ''When I first came to New York, I started a blog with my own reviews of 'real' restaurants,'' he said. That lasted all of two weeks. ''Even I didn't care what I thought.'' 
 However, his quest for lunch kept leading him farther afield from his job as a music programmer at Sirius Satellite Radio. 
 Mr. Brooks, 33, was raised in Miami, eating what he describes as ''incredibly boring'' food. He dates his interest in the subject from his parents' divorce: weekend outings with his father, who had served in the Army in Korea and Vietnam, involved seeking out authentic Asian restaurants. ''I remember the first time I had sushi, in the late '80s,'' he said. ''And thinking: this is the weirdest Chinese food we've had yet.''
 His knowledge of global culinary traditions has expanded somewhat, although his true area of expertise is still managing pay-by-the-pound Chinese buffets. (He called himself out recently for loading rice onto the plate, ''a shameful rookie mistake.'') 
 The site contains Mr. Brooks's notes and updates on 276 places, searchable by location, type of food and top picks. To call the entries ''reviews'' would imply judgment, which he avoids whenever possible. ''I can't stand negative posts,'' he said. ''Any place that has a line, I'll try it -- and try to figure out why.'' At the end of each entry, he devises an imaginary conversation between someone who likes the place and someone who doesn't, in the form of pluses and minuses. (A plus for Las Poblanitas on 38th Street: ''They have great salsa verde.'' And a minus: ''I don't like pineapple in my tacos!'') 
 ''I feel like Zach is me,'' said Adam Goldberg, a research analyst for a media company who was standing in line last week at the Biryani Cart on 46th Street and Avenue of the Americas, a Midtown Lunch favorite. 
 Mr. Brooks's ability to speak to and for his readers has made the site a success. Last month, Midtown Lunch hit 500,000 page views, with 180,000 visitors, or about 8,000 visits per workday, according to Google Analytics. ''Everyone in my office is trying to spend less money on lunch,'' said Aravind Mallipudi, who works at Societe Generale, a nearby bank. ''No more restaurants, and many more brown bags.''
 About a year ago, income from the site's advertising enabled Mr. Brooks to quit his day job. Now he patrols the area from 12 to 3 daily with an iPhone in one hand and pushing the stroller of his son, Harry, with the other. 
 His sense of responsibility to readers is profound: He finds it agonizing when a cart isn't in its appointed spot, or a deli runs out of a special that he's flagged on the site, or as often happens, a place simply folds up overnight. ''I have been trying to get the vendors to sign up for Twitter, or call me when they change locations,'' he said. ''But they have very complicated lives.'' In addition to cooking in cramped, tiny quarters, Midtown's street-food vendors have to manage traffic, licensing, pollution, long hours and often harassment from other vendors. ''Competition is fierce for prime spots,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''Especially on Sixth Avenue in the 40s -- that's the money street.''
 Mr. Brooks has covered the escalating competition between the street meat carts at the intersection of 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas. (Street meat is what regulars call inexpensive plates of lamb, chicken, rice and flatbread, griddled in carts that scent the air with cumin and cinnamon smoke.) When one acquired yellow plastic bags to differentiate its product, staff members of the other started wearing yellow sweatshirts. The original 53rd and Sixth cart, now known as Halal Guys, was the winner at last year's Street-Meat-Palooza, an outdoor taste-off organized by Mr. Brooks in Bryant Park, with entries collected from 13 carts and judged by 20 ''Lunch'ers.'' 
 By Mr. Brooks's standards, a plate from Express Power Lunch Halal Food on the corner of 48th Street and Park Avenue should have been the winner. The spicing is suave and elegant, the rice toothsome, the yogurt sauce flecked with mint. Instead, it was the runner-up.
 ''Dude, not everyone likes interesting and authentic, or even likes spices,'' Mr. Brooks said with a sigh. ''Especially at lunchtime.'' 
 Ethnic and Affordable
 Some stand-out restaurants, vendors and dishes featured on Zach Brooks's Midtown Lunch:
 BIRYANI CART The Bangladeshi chef Meru Sikder serves wonderful biryanis along with six kinds of kati rolls; try the Chennai chicken with tangy tamarind sauce: Southwest corner of 46th Street and Avenue of the Americas; no phone.
 CAFE ZAIYA A Japanese takeout spot where everything is super cheap, including rice balls, bento boxes, sandwiches and pastries: 18 East 41st Street; (212) 779-0600.
 FOOD COURT AT 1013 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS This converted newsstand is home to some of Midtown's best chaat (Indian snacks), Gujarati Indian food and Latin-American food. Try the papri chaat and bhel puri: 1013 Avenue of the Americas between 37th and 38th Streets; (212) 840-3767.
 HALAL GUYS The most famous halal cart in Midtown offers a compelling combo platter. Order the thick, bright red hot sauce on the side: Southeast corner of 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas; no phone.
 HING WON This restaurant has Chinese-American food on one side and Cantonese roast meats, noodles and stir-fried vegetables on the other. Zach Brooks is partial to the stir-fried udon with roast pork: 48 West 48th Street; (212) 719-1451.
 JAMAICAN DUTCHY There's no better place for jerk chicken with rice and peas than this cart. For something more portable, grab a beef patty sandwiched in sweet coco bread: Northeast corner of 51st Street and Seventh Avenue; no phone.
 KATI ROLL An Indian street food of paratha bread wrapped around fillings, a kati roll is like a simplified burrito. The spicy potato roll and chicken tikka roll with onions are recommended: 49 West 39th Street; (212) 730-4280.
 MARGON This Cuban/Dominican diner off Times Square is Mr. Brooks's pick for tastes of his hometown, Miami, like batidos, Cuban sandwiches, roast pork, octopus salad and chicken chicharrones: 136 West 46th Street; (212) 354-5013.
 WOORIJIP First-time visitors to this takeout spot in Koreatown should try the buffet; regulars come for noodles and kimbap, or Korean-style sushi filled with pickled vegetables: 12 West 32nd Street; (212) 244-1115.
 XPL (EXPRESS POWER LUNCH) Amazing basmati rice and delicious spicing make this the area's standout halal cart: Southwest corner of 48th Street and Park Avenue; no phone.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate In Europe Rises Further

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in the European Union pushed higher in April, indicating that nascent signs of economic recovery had yet to be felt in the labor market. 
 The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the 16 countries that use the euro currency rose to 9.2 percent in April, the highest rate since September 1999, from 8.9 percent in March, the Eurostat agency, the bloc's statistics office, said Tuesday. In April 2008, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent. 
 For all 27 members of the European Union, the unemployment rate was 8.6 percent in April, up from 8.4 percent in March and 6.8 percent in April 2008. 
 Although there has been some evidence in recent weeks that the economic decline that intensified in Europe in the second half of last year is beginning to ease, economists say that the labor market lags behind many economic indicators and that unemployment commonly rises after a downturn. 
 Among European Union members, the highest unemployment rates were seen in Spain, at 18.1 percent, and Latvia, with 17.4 percent. The lowest unemployment rate was 3 percent recorded in the Netherlands, followed by 4.2 percent in Austria.
 The unemployment level in France was 8.9 percent; in Germany it was 7.7 percent. Figures for Britain and Italy were not available. Unemployment stood at 8.9 percent in the United States in April.
 The jobless rate has been creeping up despite the efforts of many countries to use public funds to dissuade companies from permanently laying off workers.
 France, for example, has a program that allows troubled companies to draw on state money to pay their workers 60 percent of minimum hourly wages when they are temporarily laid off.

PERSON: Samuel M. Ehrenhalt 

HEADLINE: Samuel M. Ehrenhalt Is Dead at 83; Added Color to Dry Economic Data

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, a poet of percentages who for 15 years as a regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics transformed colorless wage and employment figures into small, brightly lighted windows onto New Yorkers' daily lives, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 83 and had lived in Brooklyn for many years.
 The cause was myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone-marrow disorder, his son, Steven, said. 
 A career civil servant associated with the bureau for four decades, Mr. Ehrenhalt was the commissioner of its New York regional office from 1980 till his retirement in 1995. (The bureau is an arm of the United States Department of Labor; by the federal government's inscrutable logic, the New York region comprises New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.)
 As the region's official gatherer, interpreter and disseminator of labor figures, Mr. Ehrenhalt was a highly visible, nonpartisan public presence. He lectured widely and was routinely consulted by the news media on an array of subjects, among them the job prospects of women, minorities and young people; the outlook for industries like banking, building, retailing and education; and even the role of the weather in economic forecasts.
 Mr. Ehrenhalt's office -- he oversaw a staff of more than 100 -- answered about 100,000 queries a year, from journalists, of course, but also from politicians, small-business owners, Wall Street tycoons, anxious college graduates and warring couples.
 ''You can't get a divorce these days without checking in at our office,'' he told The New York Times in 1988. ''Unless you have an idea of what the inflation rate is likely to be, you would never know what kind of escalations to ask for in your alimony payments.''
 A lover of theater and opera, Mr. Ehrenhalt by all accounts brought to his work an articulate wit and, when needed, a keen dramatic flair. To him, statistics did not exist in lifeless isolation; instead, they reflected the web of contingencies that forms the narrative of everyday life. For instance:
 If New York is beset by many snowstorms in a single season, as it was in the winter of 1993-94, when there were 15, then its unemployment rate can rise, because snow shuts down construction, Mr. Ehrenhalt told The Times in March 1994.
 If every New York office worker needs 250 square feet of room, then the loss of 23,000 financial-sector jobs, which Mr. Ehrenhalt's office recorded from October 1987 to August 1989, means that the commercial real estate market needs to supply 5,750,000 fewer square feet of office space. That is the equivalent, he told The Times in October 1989, of losing five new office buildings.
 In a 1995 profile of Mr. Ehrenhalt in Newsday, Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, described the interpretation of statistics as being more art than science. He added, ''Sam Ehrenhalt is an artist.''
 Samuel Milton Ehrenhalt was born in Krakow, Poland, on June 30, 1925, and moved with his family to Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1930. In 1936, he and his parents were able to come to the United States, eventually settling in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.
 Mr. Ehrenhalt earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and, in 1949, a master's in economics from Columbia. After teaching at several colleges, he joined the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1955. In 1975, he was chief of a United States economic mission to Sierra Leone, Ghana and Kenya.
 Besides his son, Steven, of Beit Shemesh, Israel, Mr. Ehrenhalt is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Pashkovsky, whom he married in 1953; a daughter, Dina Steinberg, of Queens; and seven grandchildren.
 Though he was often the bearer of bad tidings, Mr. Ehrenhalt was perennially hopeful about the region's prospects. He remained so even after the Wall Street crash of October 1987, a time of frenzied activity for his office. ''Even with one engine out, the economy has not fallen apart,'' he told Newsday.
 Mr. Ehrenhalt was rarely shy about voicing opinions on a range of subjects, his son said. But in retirement, he was uncharacteristically silent about the current economic climate.

HEADLINE: Investing In a Portfolio Of Lawsuits

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Richard W. Fields says he has come up with a win-win financial strategy for the downturn. He is investing in lawsuits.
 Not in trip-and-fall cases, mind you, but in disputes that are far larger, more costly and potentially more lucrative, often pitting major corporations against each other.
 Mr. Fields is chief executive of Juridica Capital Management. which runs a fund that invests in one side of a lawsuit in exchange for a share of any winnings. 
 ''It's always a good time to invest in litigation,'' Mr. Fields said, though he added that the weak economy helped. ''When the recession started to bite, the phones started ringing off the hook. Last year, we looked at 122 cases and we made 17 investments.'' A small but growing number of investors are exploring this idea, helping companies avoid some of the risks and costs of litigation in exchange for part of any money paid out when the case is settled or resolved by a court. After all, it can be costly to hire lawyers, who may charge close to $1,000 an hour at the most elite firms.
 Credit Suisse has a unit devoted to this kind of investing. Juris Capital, a Chicago firm backed by two hedge funds, also does it. Several other hedge funds do, too.
 ''Given the conditions in the economy, you have a set of circumstances that are pushing both clients and law firms'' to look for outside investor help, said David Desser, managing director of Juris. 
 Companies often jump at the chance to have an investor help pay for litigation, and lawyers usually appreciate having money set aside to pay them.
 Firms in this business do not reveal which cases they invest in, but they claim strong returns. Shares of Juridica Investments, the fund, have risen 24 percent since they began trading on the London Stock Exchange in December 2007. The company's average investment is $7.5 million, Mr. Fields said, and it has about $200 million under management.
 Juris typically invests $500,000 to $3 million in a case, Mr. Desser said. He would not identify the company's backers, but said that ''on the portfolio as a whole, our returns are well in excess of 20 percent per year.'' He added, ''We're certainly beating the market.''
 One case that Juris invested in was a dispute between WaKuL Inc., an apparently defunct company that once offered high-speed Internet and other services, against Ericsson Inc. WaKuL charged Ericsson with breach of contract and fraud, and won nearly $3 million in damages in an arbitration. Ericsson challenged the result in federal court and in a federal court of appeals.
 Because of an outside investment from Juris, WaKuL could afford to keep fighting, said Geoffrey R. Unger, a lawyer at DLA Piper in Austin, Tex., which represented WaKuL. 
 ''For any law firm -- and for clients that may not have the financial wherewithal to pursue things -- it makes a big difference,'' Mr. Unger said.
 Mr. Desser declined to disclose how much Juris invested or received. WaKuL ultimately persuaded the court to enforce the result of the arbitration. The lawyers in the case received a total of more than $650,000. 
 Other firms that invest in lawsuits either would not discuss their practices publicly or did not return calls.
 The investing companies say that because they do not take control of the lawsuit from the company and lawyers waging it, their most important task is identifying cases likely to produce a substantial return. That means, for example, rejecting claims that raise novel legal questions or that will probably end up before a jury, Mr. Fields said.
 ''Juries are a coin toss,'' and that is too much uncertainty, he said. The company also avoids cases where the outcomes are difficult to predict because they could draw political attention or could be reversed on appeal, and cases in which the other side lacks deep pockets.
 When considering a case, the investors talk to the company and its lawyers about the facts and about their legal strategy. They also seek analysis from outside specialists, usually experienced lawyers. 
 Mr. Fields said that he initially worried about getting lawyers with enough expertise to review cases for Juridica. ''But we found that they were very intrigued by it because they could look at somebody else's case,'' he said.
 Law firms refer cases to the investors, no doubt because they want to make sure their clients pay the bills, Mr. Fields and Mr. Desser said. Relationships with lawyers at big firms are critical, and each man has many contacts from his own time practicing law. 
 The use of outside money raises potentially tricky legal questions, said Anthony J. Sebok, a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, who has studied the business.
 It would be improper for the outside investor to interfere with the relationship between lawyer and client by trying to influence the case, Mr. Sebok said. 
 The larger question, though, is whether the mere existence of outside investors makes possible lawsuits that might not be pursued otherwise.
 If the claims are valid, then they may benefit from being litigated more effectively because the lawyers have more resources. ''Having funding available for cases that are good cases, cases that from a God's-eye point of view, so to speak, should've been brought, is a good thing,'' Mr. Sebok said.

HEADLINE: Nokia Begins Selling N97 Smartphone

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Nokia on Tuesday began shipping its most Internet-friendly smartphone to date, the first in a series of high-end phones expected this summer. 
 The new phone, the N97, is the first to come with a link to Nokia's new Ovi applications store, a sign that Nokia, the world's top mobile phone maker, is looking to win more revenue from mobile data services.
The N97, which costs about $776 without a subsidy from a service provider, is Nokia's most direct response so far to the iPhone, whose innovative touch screen helped Apple define the current generation of smartphones. The phone is minimalist in design, with a touch screen, a keyboard, GPS satellite navigation, 32 gigabytes of storage and a home screen that can display live links to social networking, news and weather Web sites.
 ''In the current economic environment, introducing high-priced devices is obviously not optimal,'' said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics in Milton Keynes, England. ''But the industry is taking the long-term view by trying to upgrade consumers to more sophisticated devices to derive more revenue from mobile data.''
 Nokia timed the introduction of the N97 to get a jump on Palm, which plans to start selling its touch-screen Palm Pre in the United States on Saturday through Sprint stores and at Radio Shack, Best Buy and Wal-Mart. Apple plans to distribute its new iPhone 3.0 operating system sometime this summer, and may introduce a new iPhone model.
 When Nokia opened its applications store less than a week ago, access was interrupted by technical glitches, which Nokia attributed in part to high demand from 50 million users.

HEADLINE: Collateral Damage

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For nine years, the Strong brothers, Mark and Tim, made tools in their machine shop to maintain the giant presses that stamped steel sheets into fenders and hoods at a nearby General Motors factory in Lansing, Mich. 
 Aircraft parts were a sideline, but when auto work dried up last November, the brothers managed to get more orders from that side of the business to keep them afloat. They have been shaping wing spars for the A10 Thunderbolt, used to provide ground support in combat. 
 ''The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq helped us a lot,'' Mark Strong said. 
 Wing spars, however, are hardly a substitute for the tools that G.M. seemed to always need from the Strongs for its assembly lines. The $632,000 in sales the brothers rang up in 2008 has shrunk to less than $95,000 so far this year. The seven-employee staff in their machine shop in Mason, Mich., is down to just three, and the Strongs hope the wing spars will somehow carry them over until G.M. once again sends business their way. 
 The brothers are among the tens of thousands of suppliers whose fortunes are directly tied, for better or worse, to the automakers. And now, with new-car sales touching low levels not seen in decades, and with G.M. and Chrysler forced to shut plants as they struggle through bankruptcy, their prospects seem grim.
 ''Most of these supplier companies are family-owned,'' said Daniel Luria, research director of the Michigan Manufacturing Research Center in Ann Arbor. ''And in a period when the families can't sell, the decision is to preserve the companies as future streams of revenue for the next generation.''
 Auto suppliers, which employ more workers than the car companies themselves, have cut way back, almost hibernating, as they lay off employees earning $10 to $22 an hour, or cut back their hours. Some, like the Strongs, are trying to diversify, but such efforts have not noticeably offset the lost automotive business. 
 ''We are estimating that 500 suppliers out of 4,000 could go out of business between now and the end of the year,'' said Neil DeKoker, chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. Billings just to the three Detroit automakers from the nation's auto suppliers have fallen to $7 billion a month, on average, from $16 billion in January, he said. 
 The Whitlam Label Company, in Centerline, Mich., has tried to diversify. It makes a wide variety of labels and bar codes that are pasted on car parts and on finished vehicles, including the stickers on radiator covers warning people to keep their hands away from the fan.
 The company has expanded into food and beverage packaging. But its revenue is still down, running at an annual rate of $14 million this year, well below the $20 million of 2008. Its work force dropped to 100 from 130 (10 of them are children and grandchildren of the late George Shaieb Sr., a Syrian immigrant who bought the company in 1973). 
 Whitlam is faring better than others in the downturn because it is still shipping labels to Chrysler and G.M., including price labels taped on the windows of thousands of unsold vehicles.
 ''We are trying to get more automotive by selling more aggressively to Toyota and Honda and the other foreign transplants,'' said Richard Shaieb, Whitlam's president and one of George Shaieb's sons.
 That market represents fewer opportunities for companies like Mr. Shaieb's. After all, the percentage of parts made in the United States for foreign brands assembled here is less than the domestic content of vehicles made by G.M., Chrysler and Ford, according to Mr. Luria.
 But that is not the concern of George Buhaj today. The company Mr. Buhaj heads as president -- Avon Broach, a machining operation in Rochester Hills, Mich. -- designs and makes broach tools, which are used by the three Detroit automakers and also other suppliers to cut and shape transmission gears and other complex parts. 
 After layoffs in March, his payroll is down to 16 from 25. ''Business just fell right off because of the Chrysler bankruptcy and the potential for one at G.M.,'' he said.
 In April, Mr. Buhaj, who is 49 and bought out other Avon owners in 1993, cut back the work day by several hours. He said he was planning another layoff in the next couple of weeks, dropping at least two more people.
 A year ago, struggling for orders, he started searching for customers in other industries. ''I have identified wind energy and medical,'' he said. ''I'm not yet making parts for these but I'm trying.''
 Pioneer Forge, near Toledo, Ohio, would also like to diversify, said Michael Regal. He manages the factory, which forges tie rods and other steering links for trucks, including pickup trucks assembled by Ford and Chrysler. 
 The company has not made a profit for two months, Mr. Regal said, and the work force is down to 51, from 100 a year ago. Revenues have plunged to less than $10 million, at an annual rate, from more than $15 million in 2007, just prior to the start of the recession.
 Mr. Regal says he sees no other choice but to try to sell more steering mechanism forgings to foreign auto companies that assemble vehicles in the United States. He would like to diversify away from auto supply, but the economics work against Pioneer and many others in the industry.
 ''You have to set up your operation to handle the mass volumes that the automotive industry sends at you, and you become a captive of the parts that you make,'' he said. ''If you want to venture out into some other business, you have to have a lot of capital to do that, and when things take a turn for the worse, the capital is not there.''

HEADLINE: New-Vehicle Sales Reach A 2009 High

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
New-vehicle sales in the United States climbed to their highest levels of the year in May, despite rising gas prices and the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler. But demand is still below the levels that most automakers need to be profitable.
 The Ford Motor Company, the only Detroit automaker that has not taken federal aid or entered bankruptcy, said its market share rose to the highest level in three years. Its sales fell 24 percent from last May, the smallest year-over-year decline reported by any of the six largest automakers since October. Ford said it would increase production by 6 percent, or 52,000 vehicles, through September. 
 The seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate for the industry was 9.91 million, the highest so far this year. Until 2008, automakers had been selling about 17 million vehicles a year for much of the last decade. G.M., once it restructures and emerges from bankruptcy, has predicted it can break even if industry sales are at least 10 million a year.
 ''I've been describing this market under 10 million as awful, so it's like less awful,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president for sales and marketing. ''It is still a very fragile industry. This isn't any time to rejoice. It's just a slight uptick.''
 May was the best sales month of 2009 for General Motors, whose sales fell 30 percent from a year ago. Chrysler's sales were down 47 percent from May 2008, largely because it sold very few vehicles to car-rental companies and other businesses. G.M. filed for Chapter 11 protection Monday, a month after Chrysler. 
 Chrysler, which closed all of its United States plants upon entering bankruptcy and this week received court approval to sell its assets to the Italian carmaker Fiat, said Tuesday that the plants would begin reopening in the last week of June.
 Over all, auto sales fell 34 percent from a year ago, according to the industry tracking firm MotorIntelligence.com. May was the eighth consecutive month in which sales fell more than 30 percent, on a year-over-year basis.
 ''Does it mean we'll continue to improve and we're out of the woods? No, but it was a good month,'' Ron Pinelli, the president of MotorIntelligence.com, said. ''It's certainly positive in that it's not getting worse. All things considered you can't expect some crazy miracle overnight.'' 
 Toyota and Honda each said their sales fell 41 percent from last May, when sales of small cars peaked and Honda recorded its highest ever sales. For the second consecutive month, Ford outsold Toyota. Nissan said its sales fell 33 percent.
 Auto sales in the United States are down 37 percent so far this year, as the recession deters many consumers from buying a new car or truck.
 Many analysts expected sales at G.M. and Chrysler dealerships to be worse because of the uncertainty surrounding their future. When executives at both companies were borrowing billions of dollars from the government, they warned that bankruptcy would scare off many potential consumers.
 ''It's become clear to the consumer that we're going to emerge from this, that we're going to be around to keep providing products to the marketplace and take care of their service needs and that G.M.'s going to be a viable enterprise,'' Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for sales, service and marketing, said in a conference call Tuesday. 
 ''I think we see from the May results that we're going to be O.K. during the period, but we absolutely want to get out as quickly as possible,'' he added. ''We're truly in uncharted territory.''
 Chrysler is terminating contracts with 789 dealers, and many of them say they have been heavily discounting vehicles simply to clear their lots before losing their franchise. But Steven J. Landry, Chrysler's executive vice president for North American sales, disputed the idea that a large number of the company's sales last month were unprofitable.
 ''I actually don't believe that the 16,000 sold to customers were sold at dramatically reduced rates,'' Mr. Landry said. ''The perception is that there's going to be some deals out there, and there probably were, but not to the extent of a fire sale.''
 As G.M. and Chrysler try to keep attracting customers during bankruptcy, they must contend with rising gas prices that analysts worry could threaten the market's rebound. Gas prices rose 46 cents a gallon in the last month, according to AAA, the motorist club.
 ''I don't see anything on the horizon that could impact the recovery more than rising fuel prices,'' Mr. Pinelli said.

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Rose 6.7% in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of home buyers who agreed to buy a previously occupied home rose the most in nearly eight years in April as the median sales price dropped by about 15 percent, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. 
 The National Association of Realtors said its seasonally adjusted index of sales contracts signed in April rose 6.7 percent, to 90.3, far exceeding analysts' forecasts. It was the biggest monthly increase since October 2001, when pending sales rose 9.2 percent.
 The increase most likely reflects the impact of a new $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers that was included in the economic stimulus bill signed by President Obama in February.
 Since buyers need to complete their purchases by Nov. 30 to claim the credit, ''we expect greater activity in the months ahead,'' Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement.
 The national median sales price in April fell more than 15 percent from year-ago levels, to $170,200, driven by sales of inexpensive foreclosures and other distressed low-end properties. That was the second-largest yearly price drop on record, according to the association.
 The group's index of pending sales contracts was 3.2 percent above last year's levels and has risen for three consecutive months after hitting a record low in January. A nearly 33 percent sales increase in the Northeast and a 9.8 percent gain in the Midwest led the overall surge. Sales contracts were flat or up slightly in the South and West.

HEADLINE: Dollar Slides, but Shares Edge Higher

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The dollar slid to its weakest point since late September on Tuesday even as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in Beijing, tried to reassure the Chinese government that its investments in $1 trillion of United States debt were secure.
 But in the currency markets, investors who flocked to the safety of the dollar at the height of the financial crisis are beginning to shun the currency on concerns over inflation and the prospect of big buyers of United States debt losing their taste for Treasury notes. 
 The United States dollar index, which measures the dollar against other heavily traded currencies, fell to 78.41. One euro was worth about $1.43 -- its strongest position against the dollar since December. 
 Recent statements by Chinese officials have heightened fears that China will scale back its purchases of Treasury notes, which could make it more expensive for the United States to raise money.
 Despite Mr. Geithner's attempts to soothe China's concerns about rising United States debt, analysts said that investors in currency and bond markets were still leery. The price of gold -- a traditional hedge against inflation -- rose $6.58, to $981.85 an ounce.
 ''We went there, he said 'strong dollar,' and what happened?'' said Keith R. McCullough, chief executive at Research Edge, who expects the dollar to slide even further. ''Nothing. The dollar continued to go down. He couldn't effect any change.''
 But other analysts suggested that the currency's slide was being driven by market sentiment and by investors betting against the dollar. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said worries about the long-term strength of the dollar were overblown.
 The stock market, meanwhile, took another tack on Tuesday. During the day, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly turned positive for the year before pulling back slightly. It ended the day up 19.43 points, or 0.22 percent, at 8,740.87.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is slightly higher since the start of 2009, rose 0.2 percent, or 1.87 points, to 944.74, led by materials producers and consumer companies. The technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.4 percent, or 8.12 points, to 1,836.80.
 Banks were mostly mixed as JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and American Express sold billions in stock to build up their capital buffers.
 For the most part, investors were using the day to catch a breath and review their positions, a day after stock markets surged ahead by 3 percent on some positive economic data out of China and the domestic construction and manufacturing sectors.
 The news that General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Monday barely made a dent in investor confidence. 
 An unexpected increase in the number of pending home sales in April helped shares of construction companies and home builders like KB Home and D. R. Horton. The National Association of Realtors said that the number of home sales under contract but not yet closed rose 6.7 percent from March, and was 3.2 percent higher than a year ago.
 Although home sales are still sluggish and lag behind last year, some housing specialists said life was trickling back into the market, particularly at the lower end.
 ''With an enormous supply of distressed properties on offer, prices have come down considerably, particularly at the bottom end of the market,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note. ''This trend is particularly good for first-time homebuyers, who are providing most of the life that exists in the housing market at the moment.''
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32, to 95 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.67 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four- and 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: The There That's There: Mapping a Modernist's Way With Words

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
''Your sensation as one in the audience in relation to the play played before you your sensation I say your emotion concerning that play is always either behind or ahead of the play at which you are looking and to which you are listening.''
 That is Gertrude Stein, in case the distinctive syntax had not clued you in, musing as only this bemusing modernist could muse, in an essay about the theater titled ''Plays.'' ''So your emotion as a member of the audience is never going on at the same time as the action of the play,'' she continues. 
 That's an astute observation -- at once obvious and insightful -- and it seems natural to apply it to ''A Family of Perhaps Three,'' a rare staging of a Stein play by the Target Margin Theater at the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens. The production is part of ''The Theater of Tomorrow,'' the company's admirable festival of experimental American drama from the first half of the 20th century. 
 It would be interesting to analyze the audience's emotions concerning the play before, during and after this theatrical oddity. Fascination and curiosity might chase around the mind in the opening minutes. Following briskly behind would be deflation and disappointment. Next, a sober commitment to endurance. And then comes a long chaser of boredom. That, at least, was my general reaction. 
 Most of the dozens of works Stein classified as plays do not resemble standard theatrical texts at all, even when they are divided -- willy-nilly it seems -- into acts and scenes. Stein compared plays to landscapes, and many of hers are just assemblages of words, dense or spare expanses of verbal terrain that are as daunting to navigate on the page as they surely are to put onstage. (They rarely are put onstage, with the notable exceptions being the texts used in the operas ''The Mother of Us All'' and ''Four Saints in Three Acts.'')
 ''A Family of Perhaps Three'' consists simply of thick paragraphs of Stein's circling, repetitive, recalcitrant prose. The director, David Herskovits, divides the text among three actresses, Chinasa Ogbuagu, Allison Schubert and Indika Senanayake. Each has a distinctive presence, and all deserve accolades simply for keeping the puzzling piles of words from getting jumbled up in their heads. (Not that you'd notice if they did.)
 On a set featuring a few pieces of furniture and three screens, the performers recite Stein's eddies and rivulets and waves of words, sometimes as if meditating on them, sometimes with no emotion whatsoever, sometimes in a tone of comic melodrama.
 There is a tentative whisper of a story, of an older sister and a younger one, and possibly a mother. The text, all in the third person, circles obsessively around a few ideas: the question of earning a living, of marrying and not marrying, of protecting and being protected. The prose thickens and clots, and then thins out again. 
 A clipped, clear sentence -- ''The younger one was protected'' -- will be followed by a dizzying one: ''She was protected from knowing that they were ones having been living when they were young ones, she was protected from knowing that they were not ever completely earning a living, she was protected from knowing that they were not going to be succeeding in earning a living.'' 
 The performers exchange intense glances, eye one another warily, sometimes testily. They sit and then they stand. They hustle on or offstage during the frequent blackouts. Cinched around their waists are those bulky blankets used to wrap furniture during a move. I couldn't tell you why. Eventually these are discarded. I would not attempt to offer a rationale for that either. 
 Stein was fascinated by words and their colors and weights, and throughout her work mixed up the circuits running between language and sense. But much of her thornier writing is obscure even when it is playful. She uses words as objects in themselves, making strange music of disordered or convoluted syntax. Most of us prefer that they signify things, communicate sense, possess emotional significance.
 Admirers of her experimental writing should check out this show, if only as an opportunity to hear how her language breathes in a theatrical space. Mr. Herskovits has done an honorable job of staging the text without trying to impose any reductive meaning on it. Most others, I expect, will find themselves feeling itchy, irritated, smothered -- simultaneously surfeited with words and starved for meaning.

HEADLINE: India Feels Less Vulnerable As Outsourcing Presses On

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NOIDA, India 

 BODY:
The global downturn has slowed the rapid growth in India's outsourcing business, but only slowed it. In fact -- because of the pressure on companies, and even governments, to reduce costs -- many outsourcing businesses are booming. And a mood that was deeply uncertain just six months ago has turned much more optimistic. 
 Unemployment has risen to 8.9 percent in the United States, a 26-year high, increasing longstanding pressures to ''keep jobs in America.'' But managers of companies big and small, squeezed between political pressures and the necessity of slimming down to survive, are choosing the bottom line. 
 J. Brandon Black, president and chief executive of the Encore Capital Group, a debt collection company based in San Diego, said he planned to significantly increase his work force in India in the next few years, in part because of the tough economic times. 
 ''The thing it boils down to is the supply of well-trained educated labor at reasonable prices is just too great to ignore,'' said Mr. Black. In India, ''we're hiring college-educated people.'' The company is not doing that in the United States, where it would incur greater infrastructure and health care costs. 
 ''Outsourcing is here to stay,'' Mr. Black said.
 Some of America's biggest companies continue to invest in India, even as they trim costs at home. 
 Hewlett-Packard said last month that it would cut an additional 6,400 jobs, on top of the 24,000 it said it was eliminating in September after a merger with Electronic Data Systems. About half of the September cuts are expected to come from the United States. In March, the computer giant said it was opening ''HP Software University'' in eight cities in India to train software testers. 
 Last month, Honeywell International, the manufacturing behemoth based in Morristown, N.J., said it would invest $50 million in a new research and development facility in Bangalore that would employ 3,000. The move comes after Honeywell began a reorganization, closing plants and trimming hundreds of jobs recently in the United States. 
 The company declined to comment for this article, but when it initially announced its India plans, its chairman and chief executive, David M. Cote, said about half of Honeywell's employees and half of its business were outside the United States. 
 ''Anything that creates any kind of protectionism, anything that stops the globalization activity, will be harmful,'' he said.
 Many in India say they believe that demographics are on their side in the long run. 
 ''In most developed economies, the work force is aging,'' said Ranjit Tinaikar, a partner with McKinsey, a consulting firm. The health care costs associated with employing those Western workers will continue to increase, he said, creating a ''big opportunity'' for India.
 A decade ago, McKinsey and India's powerful information technology and outsourcing trade group, Nasscom, predicted that revenue from outsourcing by foreign companies would reach $50 billion in India in 2010. The global economic slowdown has delayed that by three or four quarters -- revenue is predicted to reach $47 billion this year.
 And in April, Nasscom and McKinsey predicted that by 2020, outsourcing would yield $175 billion in revenue here. 
 Growth will slow this year at many of India's biggest outsourcing companies, however, because of the implosion of some of their largest clients: banks, mortgage servicing companies and Wall Street firms. But that does not mean revenue is no longer growing. 
 ''People who have never looked at outsourcing before are saying they have to do it,'' said Amitabh Chaudhry, the chief executive of Infosys BPO, the outsourcing arm of one of the largest Indian information technology companies. He expects his unit to grow 25 to 30 percent this year, compared with 40 to 50 percent in the past.
 But political pressures are making a difference in how business is done. One growing trend, many outsourcing executives say, is placing more Indian employees in offices in the client's home country. That way the job, ostensibly, does not move abroad. But over the long term, many are likely to be moved across the globe. 
 ''Our view is we start work onshore, then move it to Poland or Morocco, and then over time to India,'' said Sachdev Ramakrishna, director of marketing for Steria, an information technology and outsourcing company. Steria is based in Paris, but one-quarter of its employees are in India, and it has offices in Morocco and Poland. ''It's like opening the tap in bits.'' 
 Since Steria's clients include public utilities and governments in Europe, getting them comfortable with the idea of moving jobs abroad can take time. ''Everyone recognizes that this is a changed world order, and the focus is more on preservation of jobs,'' Mr. Ramakrishna said. 
 And yet, new business is coming from all over: insurance companies with a growing number of elderly clients to monitor; pharmaceutical companies looking for more efficient ways to conduct drug trials and handle customer calls (even emergency inquiries, like overdose concerns); corporate legal teams balking at $350-an-hour fees to outside law firms. Even companies based in once union-friendly countries like France and Germany, as well as once-flush Middle Eastern firms, struggling media companies and companies that have been taken over by private equity firms are looking to outsource. 
 Indian companies that relied on Wall Street and big banks for much of their business are aggressively learning new skills. 
 East of New Delhi, on a corporate campus that was once farmland, dozens of Indian doctors, nurses and pharmacists are scheduling checkups for patients in the United States and monitoring clinical trial data for some of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies. 
 Thirty miles to the southwest, in the town of Gurgaon, hundreds of Indian lawyers in a glass high-rise are conducting due diligence on deals, combing through contracts and studying intellectual property rights for Western clients.
 In the legal field, ''there's been a sea change in awareness of what's possible'' in the last 12 months, said Daniel Reed, the chief executive of UnitedLex, which has its headquarters in Atlanta but has the bulk of its employees in Gurgaon. More and more sophisticated work is coming to India, he said.
 Matthew Fawcett, the general counsel of JDS Uniphase, a fiber optics company in California, started looking at outsourcing some legal work to India two years ago and is now a UnitedLex client. 
 ''When you run a legal department of a publicly traded company,'' he said, ''you care about cost and overhead.'' 
 Patni Computer Systems, which employs doctors and nurses in Noida, is working with health insurance companies in the United States whose policies provide home care for elderly patients. Patni's doctors and nurses call the patients regularly for checkups, and if the patient needs a physical examination, they call the insurance company, which dispatches a nurse. 
 ''It's a proactive measure, rather than reactive'' said Sanjiv Kapur, the head of Patni's outsourcing business, intended to prevent the patient from falling ill and winding up in the hospital. ''It's less costly for the insurance company.''

HEADLINE: Australia, Nourishing China's Economic Engine, Questions Ties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Meraiah Foley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
If outlanders tend to associate Australia with kangaroos, broad-brim leather hats and an opera house, many Australians are different. They think of iron ore and bauxite, copper and coal, nickel, gold and uranium, a trove of mineral riches that is their nation's birthright and the bedrock of its prosperity.
 Which explains much of the breast-beating that has ensued since the Chinese announced plans this year to buy a big chunk of it. 
 Since three state owned Chinese companies said they would buy stakes in Australia's storied mining industry totaling $22 billion -- as much as China's entire investment here in the last three years -- some of this nation's 21.3 million people have reacted with aggrieved nationalism. 
 The government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, which generally favors the sales, has been savaged as naively cozy with China, a view some in his own military appear to share. Opposition politicians have flogged the specter of an Australian future more or less as a giant open-pit mine in which the locals toil, but Beijing takes the profits. 
 ''It's the Communist People's Republic of China, 100 percent Communist-owned, buying up sections of the country and minerals in the ground which they will then sell to the Communist People's Republic of China,'' said Barnaby Joyce, who is a leader of the National Party in Parliament. ''And we're going to live off the commission on the way through. They'll try to make sure we get as little as possible.'' 
 But a few months after the first of the deals was announced, a sharp initial backlash has given way to a more subtle queasiness over whether Australia's place in the region, anomalous but secure for so long, is about to be altered by the new Chinese giant looming over its horizon.
 Nor is Australia alone. From the Philippines to Vietnam, China's neighbors are recalculating the benefits -- and potential deficits -- of life in the shadow of a newly dominant nation.
 Australia has always been the West's outpost in the East, the British penal colony with American spunk and European joie de vivre. But seemingly overnight, China has become Australia's biggest trading partner, one of its biggest tourism customers, the largest single buyer of its government debt, a major buyer of farmland and real estate. 
 China's hunger for steel gobbles up half of Australia's iron ore exports, and its textile factories buy more than half of Australia's wool. Over 120,000 Chinese students throng to Australian schools and universities. 
 Although China's purchases remain dwarfed by cumulative investments of the Americans and the British, they are growing much faster. 
 And suddenly, Australians are stepping back, realizing that their new best friend is someone they really do not know very well, much less trust.
 ''The momentum has shifted from being broadly receptive to these deals to having a hard think at this,'' said Alan DuPont, who heads the Center for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney. ''This is not just about China and Australia. It's about how the world sees China playing its role in the future as a great power.''
 Surviving Corporate Invasions
 This is not a new question. More than a century ago, Australians fretted about becoming vassals of the resource-hungry British Empire; then, in the mid-1900s, they feared becoming an American subsidiary. When Japan Inc. began snapping up companies in the 1970s, suspicion of Tokyo ran rampant.
 The British and Americans proved good corporate citizens, however, and Japan's expansion faded amid economic problems. Now, Australians are asking whether China will be different. 
 In one way, it assuredly is. Western companies, if at one time equally ravenous for Australia's resources, are not direct appendages of their national governments. The dominant shareholder in major Chinese resources companies is the Chinese government.
 China has 115,000 state owned companies; the cream are more than 150 giants controlled by the central government. Those corporations -- in mining, steel, finance, communications and other crucial areas -- seek to make profits much as Western companies do. Government boards audit them, appoint their top executives and evaluate their performance, but in general, the companies insist, Communist Party leaders do not meddle in business strategy.
 Even if that is true, China has long insisted on maintaining state control over companies in crucial industries, blurring the line between national and corporate interests. 
 Take steel. China makes more steel than any other nation, but it is highly dependent on iron ore imports to keep its mills humming. That raises suspicions that China may want big stakes in mining companies now to help ensure stable prices in the future. 
 But if China works to keep iron ore prices stable, that might benefit steel producers more than it does Australian mining companies. That concern has only grown in recent months, as China's largest steel producers have rejected as insufficient offers of lower prices from Australian mining companies. 
 There is also the question of whether China's stake in strategic industries -- like its investment in United States Treasury bonds -- could one day morph from a business deal to an instrument of diplomatic influence.
 The Chinese bids for parts of the three Australian mining companies -- Fortescue Metals, Oz Minerals and Rio Tinto Ltd. -- have been raptly watched for Australia's answers. So far, they are mixed.
 The smallest deal, an $840 million bid for part of Fortescue, a struggling iron ore miner, won Australian regulators' quick approval. But Australia's foreign investments review board, the central gatekeeper for overseas purchases, vetoed part of a $1.8 billion bid for Oz, the world's second largest zinc miner. The reason: Australia's military raised the prospect of Chinese espionage at an Oz mine not far from an aerospace test site. A pared-down deal was approved after the suspect mine, the core of Oz Minerals' assets, was excised from the deal.
 But it is the proposed purchase by the Aluminum Company of China, or Chinalco, of $19.5 billion in Rio Tinto stock, bonds and mining rights -- China's biggest investment in a foreign company -- that has caused the most angst. 
 Chinalco, which bought 9.3 percent of Rio Tinto in 2008, proposed taking a larger stake after the global economic collapse drove Rio into financial straits. If approved, the new investment would give China an 18.5 percent share of the world's third largest mining company.
 Chinalco unequivocally asserts its independence. ''Chinalco operates as a commercial entity, at arm's length from Chinese political processes,'' the company's Australian spokesman said in a written response to questions. 
 Many Australian experts agree. Modern Chinese corporations are state-run in name only, Ross Garnaut, an economist, former Australian ambassador to Beijing and himself the head of a gold-mining company, said in an interview. In practice, he said, they are just like their Western counterparts -- fiercely competitive, and focused on profit. 
 ''You don't know anything about the dynamics of relations between major corporations in China if you think a major aluminum company like Chinalco would sacrifice its profits to increase profits for one of its rivals in the steel industry,'' he said. Even Australia's antitrust regulators have concluded that the Chinese would be unable to influence the price of iron ore, a crucial Rio Tinto product, were the Rio deal to go through.
 Intentions Arouse Suspicions
 Yet other experts have a much different view of China's intentions. Paul Glasson, a Shanghai-based Australian who brokers deals between Chinese and Australian businesses, notes that China's domestic reserves can meet demand for fewer than half of 45 strategic minerals. By 2020, it will have sufficient supplies of only six.
 ''In a nation of 1.3 billion people, with the complex issues they face, with such resource deprivation, would it be wise for the government to abdicate that responsibility to S.O.E.'s?'' he asked, using the abbreviation for state owned enterprises. ''Claiming the head doesn't know what the body is doing just makes the situation difficult.'' 
 Mr. Glasson says state ownership actually brings advantages -- among them, deep pockets and a focus beyond the next quarterly statement -- that any merger partner might find attractive. But Beijing's denial of a role in its state owned companies, he said, is creating a credibility problem.
 In fact, Chinalco would be very much a junior partner if the Rio deal were to go through, with just two seats on a 17-seat board of directors. Chinalco would have to recuse itself from any Rio issues that posed a conflict of interest.
 Chinalco would also not be able to guarantee a supply of ore to other Chinese companies, although the companies envision new efforts to market iron and aluminum ore inside China.
 Shareholders at Rio's annual meeting in April were unimpressed. They denounced the proposed deal as a fire sale of assets to a government buyer whose interests were starkly at odds with their own. As if to underscore the point, Rio's share price has risen sharply since the Chinalco agreement was announced, suggesting that Chinalco shrewdly struck a deal at the nadir of the financial crisis. With every gain in Rio's stock price, the Chinalco deal looks less attractive.
 Some institutional investors have suggested that they will oppose the bid, which requires shareholder approval, even if regulators approve it this year. And that seems in some question. 
 Allies of Prime Minister Rudd argue that increased Chinese investment pumps money into Australia's economy and opens new trade opportunities. But Mr. Rudd's opponents say he does Beijing's bidding. Among a drip of well-timed news leaks were claims that Chinese spies sought to hack into Mr. Rudd's laptop during last year's Olympic Games, and that his defense minister had failed to disclose gifts from a Chinese friend with ties to Beijing's military establishment.
 Those allegations have been flying even as the Australian military has become more focused on China as a potential rival. A newly issued defense strategy proposes the biggest Australian military buildup since World War II, driven in part by a forecast of rising Chinese economic and military power, and a slow American fade in the Pacific.
 And recently, a wealthy Australian businessman began a television advertising blitz opposing the Rio-Chinalco deal, featuring Mr. Joyce, an opposition leader. The theme -- that Australia is selling its mineral wealth to a ''foreign government'' that may not have Australians' interest foremost -- is unlikely to affect regulators' deliberations. But it stokes a larger disquiet of which Mr. Rudd's government is acutely aware.
 Mr. Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking ex-diplomat in Beijing, has not helped his cause: after an unannounced meeting with China's propaganda minister in Canberra, Australia's capital, he lobbied for a greater Chinese role in global finance at the Group of 20 economic meeting in London, leading critics to dub him China's ''roving ambassador.''
 Mr. Rudd shrugged off the gibes, but seemed stung: in London, his staff quietly asked that he not be seated next to Beijing's ambassador to Australia during a television broadcast (the request was refused). 
 Australia's foreign investments board has given itself an additional 60 days to consider the Chinalco-Rio deal. But hopes that some of Australians' unease might ebb during that breather took a hit in May, when another state owned Chinese company, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group, proposed a $184 million purchase of 51.6 percent of another miner, Lynas Corporation. 
 Lynas, which mines rare-earth minerals, also has been left short of cash by the global economic crisis. Critics were quick to note that China Nonferrous operates huge nickel and iron ore mines in Myanmar, widely denounced as one of the world's most repressive nations, and has extensive gold-mining operations in North Korea. 
 ''So Lynas would become part of a group which makes hay in Burma. Can the government live with that?'' The Australian, one of the nation's major newspapers, asked. ''What are the rules about ethical investments?''
 The executives at Chinalco, which also has operations in Myanmar, might be expected to rue the bad timing of China Nonferrous. On the other hand, it could be promoted as evidence that the government does not stage-manage corporate strategy.
 But at least one Chinalco executive no longer has those worries. The company's chairman, Xiao Yaqing, the architect of both the 2008 and 2009 purchases of Rio assets, left the company in March after being promoted -- to deputy head of the State Council, the team of cabinet ministers that sets policy for all China.

HEADLINE: Homeowner Lands in Trouble, But Not Enough to Gain Help

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: MESA, Ariz. 

 BODY:
She had seen the advertisements for the new government program offering relief. She had heard President Obama promise that help was on the way for homeowners like her, people who had lost jobs and could no longer make their mortgage payments.
 But when Eileen Ulery called her mortgage company -- Countrywide, now part of Bank of America -- the bank did not offer to alter her mortgage. Rather, the bank tried to sell her a new loan with a slightly lower monthly payment while asking her to pay $13,000 toward the principal and a fresh $5,000 in fees. 
 Her problem was that she did not yet present a big enough problem to merit aid. 
 Yes, she was teetering toward delinquency. She was among millions of homeowners rapidly sliding toward danger for whom the Obama administration had devised an aid program -- some already in foreclosure proceedings, others headed that way as they ran out of means to make their payments. But unlike those in imminent peril of losing their homes, Ms. Ulery had never missed a payment. 
 ''I don't know who this bailout is helping,'' she said. ''We've given these banks all this money and they're not doing what they say they're doing. Something's not working right. They keep saying they're doing all this, but we don't see it down here at this level.''
 More than three months after the Obama administration outlined a new program aimed at rescuing millions of distressed homeowners by compensating banks that modify mortgages, Ms. Ulery's experience illustrates the mixture of confusion, frustration and limited assistance that now reigns.
 Through many months of wrangling over the fate of the financial system, with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars dispensed on bailouts, distressed homeowners have waited for their own rescue amid talk that it was finally on the way. Modifications of so-called subprime and Alt-A mortgages -- those made to people with tarnished credit -- actually fell by 11 percent in May from April, according to research by Alan M. White at Valparaiso University School of Law. 
 A Treasury spokeswoman, Jenni Engebretsen, confirmed that homeowners like Ms. Ulery -- current on their mortgages yet grappling with a hardship like unemployment -- were eligible for loan modifications under the program. She said mortgage servicers had offered to modify more than 100,000 loans since the department announced the program.
 But how many loans have been modified? Ms. Engebretsen declined to say, noting that the Treasury was working with mortgage companies to ''fine-tune reporting systems.'' 
 A spokesman for Bank of America Home Loans, Rick Simon, confirmed that the bank offered Ms. Ulery refinancing and not loan modification. The bank is now focusing on modifications only for those borrowers ''who are already in severe threat of foreclosure,'' he said.
 ''We're still putting the systems in place to handle people who are current on their loans,'' Mr. Simon said, declining to say how many loans Bank of America had modified. ''It's still very, very early in the program.''
 Ms. Ulery, 63, is the face of the latest wave of troubled American homeowners, a surge of people in financial danger not because of reckless gambling on real estate, but because of lost income.
 Far from being one of those who used easy-money loans to speculate on homes proliferating across the desert soil of greater Phoenix, she has lived in the same modest, stucco-sided condo in suburban Mesa for a dozen years. She bought the two-bedroom home in 1997 for $77,500.
 For two decades, she worked as an executive assistant at nearby Arizona State University, bringing home more than $1,000 every other week -- enough to pay the bills.
 Round-faced, wry and given to staccato bursts of laughter, Ms. Ulery regularly visits yard sales, seeking out plates and patchwork quilts for her collections. She takes pleasure in her two grandchildren and her beagle. She enjoys an occasional glass of wine, favoring a $6 merlot that comes in a screw-top bottle.
 ''I'm not an extravagant-type person,'' she said. ''I see these big houses all around, and they're beautiful, but I'm comfortable in my little condo.''
 Like tens of millions of other American homeowners, she added to her mortgage balance as the value of her condo swelled, at one point exceeding $200,000. She refinanced to pay off some credit cards and settle into a 30-year, fixed-rate loan. Later, she took out a home equity line of credit to buy a new Hyundai. She refinanced again in 2007, borrowing $20,000, mostly for a new roof. 
 Over the years, her monthly payment swelled from about $600 to more than $1,000. With planning and self-control -- she tracks her monthly expenses on a color-coded spreadsheet -- she always came up with the money. ''I've never been late,'' she said.
 But the equation broke down last year, when she lost her job in university budget cuts. Ms. Ulery received six months of severance. She arranged a monthly $1,500 Social Security check. But when the severance ran out in October, her mortgage finally exceeded her limited means.
 With so many people out of work, and with her doctor counseling rest for a stress-related illness, she did not pursue another paycheck, negotiating to have her university pension begin earlier. She has been leaning on credit cards.
 Across the country, millions of homeowners in similar straits have been sliding into delinquency. Some owe more than their houses are worth. 
 Ms. Ulery is among that unhappy cohort -- her house is worth about $122,000, and she owes $143,000 -- but walking away is not for her.
 ''In my family, we don't do that,'' she said. ''You pay your bills. And I wanted my home.''
 In March, she heard about the Obama administration program. The Countrywide Web site directed her to a government site, makinghomeaffordable.gov, she said. There, she took a test to determine her eligibility for a loan modification.
 Was her home her primary residence? Check. Was she having trouble paying her mortgage? Check again, and so on until the screen told her that she might qualify.
 In April, she called the bank. The representative said the bank was not doing modifications for people like her, she recalled. He shifted the conversation: if she handed over $18,000, he could lower her payment to $967 from $1,046. Her interest rate would actually increase slightly, with the drop largely because she was putting down more money.
 ''I just laughed,'' Ms. Ulery said. ''It was a really good deal for them.''
 To which she poses her own question: What sort of deal is it for the American taxpayer? As she sees it, the same banks that generated the mortgage crisis are now getting public money to fix it, while doing little more than seeking new fees.
 ''I don't think the government gets it,'' she said. ''These are the same people you couldn't trust before.''

HEADLINE: Queens Factory Owner Becomes Vice President's Exhibit 'A'

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. held an economic-revival meeting in New York City on Tuesday, the most compelling witness was a window manufacturer from Queens who was invited less than 24 hours earlier.
 The witness, Steve Chen, the executive vice president of Crystal Window & Door Systems in Flushing, was the only one of the seven panelists flanking Mr. Biden who employs more than a dozen New Yorkers. Without him, the group that the vice president convened to showcase the benefits of federal stimulus spending and tax credits would have consisted of the vice president, another government official, four business operators from other states and an investor from Manhattan.
 Mr. Chen said he received a call on Monday afternoon asking him to participate in what was the vice president's first official public appearance in the city. ''I guess they wanted someone local,'' he said in an interview after the meeting, which was held at the Lubin School of Business on the Pace University campus in Lower Manhattan. 
 Gladly, Mr. Chen showed up and told an audience of about 60 students and officials how the $787 billion stimulus package had averted the layoff of about 100 of his employees a few months ago. In January, Mr. Chen said, Crystal had to reduce the hours of its staff of about 400 workers, and for the first time in its 20-year history, the company was contemplating eliminating jobs for economic reasons.
 Now, Crystal's sales are about 4 percent ahead of last year's pace and the company is hiring laborers, designers and engineers, Mr. Chen said. The saving grace, he said, was the spending bill that President Obama signed on Feb. 17.
 One component of the bill was a tax credit for homeowners who install energy-saving windows and doors. Last year, Crystal began improving the energy efficiency of its products, a shift that has been more effective than it could have hoped, Mr. Chen said.
 A day after the president signed the bill, Crystal began getting calls for its products that met the standards to qualify for the tax credit, he said. Within a couple of weeks, the company, a family-owned business run by Mr. Chen and his father, Thomas, cranked production back up and began growing again, he said.
 Mr. Chen said after the meeting that he had some criticisms about the details of the energy-saving credits in the bill, which he said had been ''rushed'' through Congress, but his comments at the session played right into Mr. Biden's hands. The vice president defended the pace of the stimulus spending, saying that it takes time for state and local agencies to line up contracts.
 ''You're going to see the next 100 days with some real pace on the ball, no pun intended,'' Mr. Biden said, alluding to the host institution. ''You're going to see this thing begin to move.''
 Gov. David A. Paterson, who introduced Mr. Biden but did not stay for the meeting, said that he expected stimulus spending to create 250,000 jobs in the state. He added that state officials were ''very proud'' that they had already committed $392 million in stimulus money to highway and bridge projects.
 The only other New Yorker on the panel was Neil S. Suslak, a managing director of Braemar Energy Ventures, an investor in about 20 energy-technology companies. At least a few of those companies would not have survived if the federal spending had not helped make credit available to young companies seeking to finance their growth, Mr. Suslak said.
 Two other panelists, a paving company president from New Hampshire and a shoe retailer from Providence, R.I. also described how stimulus spending had helped reverse the courses of their businesses. Christian Zimmerman, the president of Pike Industries, said that his paving company had been hired for 10 roadway projects and was already working on 8 of them. Francis Jamiel said his company, Jamiel's Shoe World, had been rejected for loans by eight banks but obtained a government-guaranteed loan and expects to add a few workers to its staff of 10.
 His advice to Mr. Biden: ''Keep the little guy going, Mr. Vice President, and the country will go in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Says China Has Faith in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ended his first visit to China on Tuesday by saying that his meetings here had begun to lay the foundation for greater cooperation between Washington and Beijing on a wide range of issues, including the global finance and climate change.
 Mr. Geithner held high-level talks on Tuesday with some of China's top leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and said in an interview that Beijing had not lost faith in the United States economy. 
''What I sense is a fair amount of confidence in the underlying strength of the American economy,'' Mr. Geithner told reporters in a Tuesday morning briefing.
 The visit came amid growing worries in China over the state of the American economy and the prospect that heavy government spending and ballooning deficits in the United States could eventually weaken the dollar and destroy the value of China's extensive United States Treasury holdings.
 China is the largest holder of American debt and experts say that any move by Beijing to slow its purchases of United States Treasury bills could deepen and prolong the global recession. Some Chinese economists have called on Beijing to significantly reduce purchases of American debt. The head of China's central bank has even proposed that there be an alternative to the dollar for international currency reserves.
 In pushing for greater cooperation with Beijing this week, Mr. Geithner seemed to take a softer tone than some of his predecessors in the Bush administration. He failed to raise any contentious issues in public this week, and continuously praised Beijing's efforts to manage and stimulate its economy. He also largely avoided any discussion of intellectual property piracy or revaluing the Chinese currency, and said he would press for a greater role for China in the International Monetary Fund.
 Asked why, he said, ''I just see it as the necessary evolution.'' Then, he added, ''It's more catch-up.''
 Trying to assuage fears about the United States deficit, Mr. Geithner also promised that once the American economy recovers, the Obama administration is determined to reign in spending and tackle the deficit.
 ''As we recover from this unprecedented crisis, we will cut our fiscal deficit,'' he said.
 At a Peking University speech on Monday, Mr. Geithner outlined a broad set of initiatives aimed at rebalancing the global economy. Following the analysis of some leading global economists, he said the United States needs to save more and consume less, and he called on China to strengthen its economy by moving away from an export driven model to one that relied more on domestic consumption.
 ''How successful we are in Washington and Beijing will be critically important to the economic fortunes of the rest of the world,'' he said.
 Analysts say the new treasury secretary is clearly interested in pressing American interests in China, on copyright issues, greater access to China's financial markets and the sale of American clean energy technologies. He used a visit to the Beijing Capital Museum Tuesday afternoon to highlight climate change as an important part of the upcoming dialogues with Beijing and to show off American-produced solar panels.
 But some experts say Mr. Geithner is also trying to earn the confidence of the leadership so that Washington can find more ways to cooperate on major global issues.
 Late Tuesday, Treasury officials announced that in the last week of July Washington plans to host the first meeting of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a broad set of high level talks with Beijing. Mr. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton are expected to host their Chinese counterparts for a series of meetings quite similar to those former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. established a few years ago.
 Yu Yongding, a former adviser to China's central bank and a member of the China Academy of Social Sciences, said Washington needs to win Beijing's confidence by protecting China's investments in American debt and helping reform the global financial system.
 ''If the U.S. can find a way to protect China's assets, America's standing here will increase,'' Mr. Yu said in an interview Monday. ''We are not going to return to the good old days of 2006. We are going to promote the creation of a new world order.''

HEADLINE: What the Muslim World Wants to Hear From Obama: A Poverty Plan

BYLINE: By ABDULKAREEM al-ERYANI

DATELINE: Sana, Yemen 

 BODY:
 FOR President Obama's speech to be effective, it has to be realistic. He has to talk about how the United States has failed to hold up its end of the bargain with my country, and others in the Islamic world. We have helped Washington combat extremism but the United States has not done enough to help us fight poverty, the twin brother of terrorism. 
 With our oil revenues declining, Yemen has a poverty rate of 40 percent and an unemployment rate of 35 percent. This creates the danger that our young will see joining Al Qaeda as a good job opportunity. Mr. Obama must address the question of poverty. It could one day help him, to paraphrase George W. Bush, avoid firing a $100,000 missile at a $700 tent.

HEADLINE: Bill Proposes Immigration Rights for Gay Couples

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Democrat from Vermont who is the powerful chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is adding another controversial ingredient to the volatile mix of an immigration debate that President Obama has said he hopes to spur in Congress before the end of the year. 
 Mr. Leahy has offered a bill that would allow American citizens and legal immigrants to seek residency in the United States for their same-sex partners, just as spouses now petition for foreign-born husbands and wives. 
The senator has said the bill should be part of any broad immigration legislation that Congress considers. To highlight his initiative, known as the Uniting American Families Act, Mr. Leahy is holding a hearing on Wednesday to discuss it in the full Judiciary Committee, bypassing the usual subcommittee hearings.
 Also this week, immigrant advocacy groups and labor organizations are opening a nationwide campaign to hold President Obama to his recent pledge to initiate a Congressional debate on immigration legislation later this year. 
 Small-scale rallies took place on Monday in Los Angeles and some 40 other locations, and immigration groups are converging on Washington on Wednesday for three days of strategy meetings. 
 The Obama administration, juggling an array of huge and pressing issues on the economy and health care reform, has encouraged the mobilization of immigration advocates, especially Latino groups, while avoiding any legislative battles for now on the prickly topic of immigration. President Obama has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White House next Monday to ''launch a policy conversation'' about immigration, an administration official said.
 The president wants to ''identify areas of agreement, and areas where we still have work to do,'' said the official, who would only speak on background because the final plans for the meeting were not settled.
 The most contentious part of the immigration legislation that the administration supports, which is known as comprehensive immigration reform, is a program to give legal status to more than 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country. But current proposals also include a variety of measures intended, like Senator Leahy's, to expand or streamline the legal immigration system.
 Mr. Leahy's proposal for same-sex immigration benefits was not included in the immigration legislation that the Bush administration brought forward in 2007, which failed after a firestorm of opposition, mainly from Republican voters. 
 Groups backing the overhaul this year have cobbled together a wide-ranging but fragile coalition that includes Latino and black groups, Roman Catholic and evangelical Christian churches, farm workers and commercial farmers, and some employer groups. In contrast to 2007, organized labor is united this time around in supporting the overhaul.
 The political fault lines opened by Senator Leahy's same-sex bill quickly became apparent this week. In a letter sent Tuesday, Bishop John C. Wester of Salt Lake City, the chairman of the Catholic bishops' Committee on Migration, wrote that the Uniting American Families Act would ''erode the institution of marriage and family,'' by taking a position ''that is contrary to the very nature of marriage which pre-dates the Church and the State.'' 
 Bishop Wester addressed his letter to Representative Michael M. Honda, a California Democrat who has said he will introduce an immigration bill containing similar same-sex provisions in the House this week. 
 J. Kevin Appleby, the immigration policy director for the bishops' conference, said, ''The last thing the national immigration debate needs is another politically divisive issue added to the mix.''
 But Senator Leahy said the bill would eliminate discrimination in immigration law against gay and lesbian couples. 
 Under family unification provisions in immigration law, American citizens and legal residents can petition for residency for their spouses. There is no numerical limit on permanent residence visas, known as green cards, for spouses of American citizens, and this is one of the main channels for legal immigration to the United States. Same-sex couples, though, cannot petition for partners, and many face the prospect of an immigrant partner's deportation. 
 Senator Leahy's bill would add the term ''permanent partner'' to sections of current immigration law that refer to married couples, and would provide a legal definition of those terms.
 ''I just think it's a matter of fairness,'' he said Tuesday in an interview, noting that a number of American allies, including Canada, France and Germany, recognize same-sex couples in immigration law. 
 The Judiciary Committee is to hear testimony on Wednesday from Shirley Tan, 43, the mother of twin 12-year-old boys who are United States citizens because they were born here. Ms. Tan has raised them with her partner of 20 years, Jay Mercado, who like Ms. Tan is from the Philippines. Although Ms. Mercado became a naturalized American citizen in 1998, she has not been able to gain legal immigration status for Ms. Tan.
 Ms. Tan said she came to this country fleeing a cousin who was released from prison in the Philippines after he served 10 years for the murders of her mother and her sister. Ms. Tan said she had been severely injured in the 1979 attack by the cousin. 
 She applied for political asylum in the United States, she said, but did not receive notice when it was denied years later. She remained here with a provisional legal status until last Jan. 28, when federal immigration agents carrying a deportation order came to the home she shares with Ms. Mercado, 48, in Pacifica, Calif. 
 Since her arrest, Ms. Tan has been able to remain legally in the country because of a private bill introduced on her behalf by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.
 Ms. Tan said she feared returning to live in the Philippines, in part because of concern that she and Ms. Mercado would face anti-gay discrimination there. 
 ''People are cruel,'' she said. ''I don't know if I can expose my boys to narrow-minded people.'' 
 Opponents of the Leahy bill argue that it would foster immigration fraud because it would be difficult for immigration officers to determine whether same-sex couples had an established relationship.
 Supporters said the bill would assist about 36,000 same-sex couples nationwide. Rachel B. Tiven, the executive director of Immigration Equality, a group that advocates for gay rights legislation, said the bill had improved chances this year because of recent same-sex marriage victories in Iowa, Maine and Vermont.

HEADLINE: Ex-Prosecutor Picked to Face Corzine in Fall

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Kenny Porpora, Nate Schweber and Erik White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Christopher J. Christie, a former prosecutor who sent a parade of corrupt New Jersey politicians to prison, handily won the Republican nomination for governor on Tuesday, earning the right to try to dislodge the state's embattled Democratic incumbent, Jon S. Corzine.
 His romp past Steven M. Lonegan, a feisty former mayor, sets the stage for what could be a fierce and expensive confrontation with the wealthy Mr. Corzine, who came to office vowing to rescue the state from financial crisis but has watched his popularity sink to record lows as the recession made matters worse. 
 ''I think he's a good man, and I think he's well-intentioned,'' Mr. Christie said of Mr. Corzine. ''But he is simply wrong for this job.''
 The fall campaign, one of only two for governor this year (the other is in Virginia), promises to be treated to varying degrees as a referendum on President Obama's momentous first year or on Republicans' continued viability -- in New Jersey, if not nationally. The last Republican to win statewide was Christie Whitman in 1997.
 The White House left no doubt about its intention to support Mr. Corzine's bid for a second term. In a rousing speech on Tuesday night at Mr. Corzine's kickoff rally in West Orange, after his victory in a lopsided four-candidate Democratic primary, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the governor was ''on the right side of the issues'' and declared: ''Barack Obama and Joe Biden are committed to Jon Corzine's reelection. Period. End of sentence. It's simple.''
 At bottom, the general election will confront New Jersey voters with a stark choice. Mr. Christie, a self-styled conservative, brings little economic experience but bold promises to rein in spending and cut taxes.
 Mr. Corzine, an unapologetic liberal who has been hemmed in by budget deficits, assures New Jerseyans that his unpleasant medicine of tax increases and service cuts will prepare the state for a quicker, stronger rebound when recovery arrives.
 But if re-election contests are verdicts on the incumbent, the burden on Mr. Corzine, even if he cannot regain the voters' confidence, will be to paint Mr. Christie, who starts the campaign with a small lead in the polls, as an unacceptable alternative. And right out of the blocks Tuesday night, Mr. Corzine blasted Mr. Christie, without naming him, for his close ties to President George W. Bush. 
 ''Our opponents promise the moon,'' Mr. Corzine said in a stemwinder delivered to about 1,500 supporters before Mr. Christie's final victory margin had become clear. ''They want to cut government, increase spending, slash taxes and balance the budget. They've got this so-called secret plan. They won't tell you whose taxes they're going to cut -- they're going to check with George Bush about that. They say they'll lay off at least 10,000 employees, maybe more -- but they won't say who, or when, or at what consequence.''
 Mr. Corzine said Republicans ''just say we should trust them. But I don't know about you, but I'm not about to put my trust in the same people who gave us George Bush, Dick Cheney or John Ashcroft, skyrocketing unemployment, a housing crisis, bank bailouts, and a war in Iraq!''
 Mr. Christie, meanwhile, set out to introduce himself to New Jersey's broad political middle, where there are nearly as many unaffiliated voters as Democrats and Republicans combined, as a forceful leader equal to the task of taming a state government that has grown too big for taxpayers to afford.
 In a colorful speech to several hundred rowdy supporters in Parsippany, Mr. Christie said he had ''lived a Jersey life'' and wanted to make the state affordable again to working families, retirees and businesses, who he said had been driven ''across our borders to Delaware, Pennsylvania -- and even New York.''
 ''That is unacceptable,'' he said.
 He said Mr. Corzine was animated by a desire to ''create the government of his dreams,'' but had ''overpromised and underdelivered,'' adding: ''I know you don't want government to hold your hand; you just want them to get out of your wallet.''
 And he vowed to ''listen more and lecture less'' as governor and to restore people's ''hope, faith and trust'' in government. ''It's what I did as United States attorney,'' Mr. Christie said, ''and you can bet it's what I'll do as governor.''
 With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Christie led Mr. Lonegan 55 percent to 42 percent. Assemblyman Rick Merkt drew 3 percent, according to The Associated Press. 
 Mr. Lonegan, who served 12 years as mayor of tiny Bogota, in Bergen County, before making the first of five failed bids for higher office, conceded just after 10 p.m., apologizing to about 150 supporters in East Brunswick for falling short but vowing to help defeat Mr. Corzine. He said conservatives had made their presence in the party felt. ''We are here to stay,'' he said. ''You are here to stay.''
 Mr. Christie mainly avoided being pinned down in the primary, resisting calls to issue an economic plan, or to detail what agencies or programs he would cut. But he did take plainly conservative positions on school vouchers, restrictions on abortion rights, and rolling back regulation, particularly on the environment.
 At his rally, Mr. Corzine made clear he would go after Mr. Christie on social issues as well as pocketbook ones, saying Republicans indeed wanted smaller government -- ''small enough to slip under your bedroom door'' or to ''dictate their own religious beliefs to the rest of us.''

HEADLINE: Undercurrents Run Through Nations' Debate on Cuba

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras 

 BODY:
Thirty-four members of the Organization of American States gathered here Tuesday to argue over whether to readmit Cuba. By evening, an isolated United States was still struggling to fend off a vote to lift the ban on Havana.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged from talks with the foreign ministers of nine North and South American countries having failed to hash out a compromise that would give Cuba a path to membership, provided its government accepted democratic principles. 
 ''At this moment, there is no consensus, and there is no agreement to take any action,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters just before leaving Honduras to fly to Cairo for President Obama's speech to the Islamic world on Thursday.
 On one level, it seems a sterile debate: Cuba has said often and loudly that it does not want to rejoin the organization. But on a deeper level, the meeting has showcased Latin America's resurgent political left, which has seized on Cuba as an issue with which to press the United States.
 It has also dramatized the challenges that Mr. Obama will face as he seeks to engage old American foes, on his own timetable. While a few Latin American leaders praised Mr. Obama's overtures to Cuba, his cautious steps seemed only to redouble their calls to go further and faster.
 One after another, the leaders stepped forward to demand that the 47-year-old suspension of Cuba's membership be lifted immediately. Several condemned it as a relic of the cold war.
 ''We cannot leave San Pedro Sula without correcting that other day that will live in infamy,'' said President Jose Manuel Zelaya of Honduras, referring to the organization's meeting in 1962 at which Cuba was banned.
 ''Our brothers and sisters in Cuba,'' Mr. Zelaya said, ''have been suffering for so long as a result of the blockade that has been imposed by one of the most powerful economies in the world.''
 Mrs. Clinton said the Obama administration wanted to turn the page with Cuba, too. But the United States has insisted that the Cuban government demonstrate it is ready to uphold the democratic principles enshrined in a 2001 charter adopted by the Organization of American States.
 The United States first proposed a resolution that would keep the ban on Cuba in place but lay out a path for it to be reinstated. Nicaragua argued for lifting the suspension without conditions, while two resolutions by Honduras and other countries sought to find a middle ground.
 American negotiators have since agreed to lift the suspension, but to make Cuba's participation contingent on its adherence to democratic principles. They would also require Cuba to petition for membership.
 ''We think we've succeeded in raising a lot of questions in the minds of O.A.S. members,'' Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, ''Since we don't agree with the bare-bones proposal, if there's no action, that's fine with us, because we think action has to be better thought out.''
 American officials did not rule out that Nicaragua and Venezuela might force a vote on readmitting Cuba without any conditions. And they might be able to round up a majority of members.
 That would be a stinging repudiation of the United States, which supplies 60 percent of the financing for the O.A.S., and of the Obama administration, which has made reaching out to Cuba one of its diplomatic hallmarks.
 Mrs. Clinton seemed tired but satisfied, she said, that the United States had moved the debate ''very dramatically.''
 Whatever the outcome, the debate over Cuba has provided a pretext for left-wing leaders -- both fresh faces and old stalwarts -- to take aim at the United States. Sometimes it was difficult to tell whether they were complaining about Cuba's exclusion or other old grievances against the United States.
 President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, a former guerrilla leader, described the Cuban ban as an act of American imperialism. And indeed Cuba today derides the organization as a tool of Washington.
 While Mr. Ortega said Mr. Obama had ''shown good will,'' he said the president was trapped by the policies of his predecessors. ''The O.A.S. continues to be an instrument of domination of the United States,'' he said. ''That's why this meeting took on a very deep meaning.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton made this trip to reach out to Latin America's new leaders. On Monday, she attended the presidential inauguration of a leftist leader in El Salvador, Mauricio Funes. Some analysts question why this debate had to play out at the Organization of American States, especially since it could have kept busy with issues like the economic crisis battering the region.

HEADLINE: From Under a Cloud, G.M. Predicts Sunshine

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
General Motors has been hemorrhaging customers for decades. For the last 30 years, it has been losing almost one percentage point of market share every year. It sold 45 percent of the new vehicles in this country in 1980, 35 percent in 1990, 28 percent in 2000 and 19 percent so far this year.
 Imagine, then, that someone asked you to make a conservative forecast of G.M.'s market share five years from now. What would you say? G.M. executives were asked to do precisely this, while putting together a restructuring plan to persuade the White House to save the company from collapse.
 Their answer was 19 percent. 
 That's right: with their company headed toward bankruptcy court, their work force being cut by 21,000 jobs and their decisions now subject to Washington's approval, G.M. executives predicted that the company would suddenly become better at holding on to its customers. 
 This small triumph of hope over experience -- and the fact that the Obama administration still approved the restructuring plan -- gets right to the biggest reason to worry about the G.M. bailout. The White House had no good option other than to rescue G.M. But if the bailout is going to succeed at creating a smaller, healthy G.M., its executives and their new government overseers need to be realistic about the company's problems. 
 They can't just insist that it has turned a corner -- the Cadillac CTS was the 2008 Motor Trend Car of the Year! -- and that the American public will eventually be smart enough to realize this.
 The bailout will, in fact, solve several of G.M.'s biggest problems. Workers have accepted painful cuts to their retirement benefits. Bondholders have forgiven debts. Orwellian work rules that sapped productivity and creativity have been removed. The Obama administration is preparing to remake the board.
 All these steps should help the company focus on building cars that enough people want to buy. But G.M. still hasn't explained how, at long last, it will manage to do so. And optimism doesn't qualify as a strategy.
 It would be easier to believe that G.M. had reached a turning point if we hadn't heard the same claim so many times before.
 ''Detroit Fights Back,'' Forbes reported in 1977. ''G.M. Moves Into a New Era,'' Business Week announced in 1984. ''G.M.'s $11 Billion Turnaround,'' Fortune said in 1994. Just last year, the magazine printed a photograph of Rick Wagoner, then G.M.'s chief executive, next to the headline ''Gentlemen, Start Your Turnaround.'' 
 The business press has at least injected notes of skepticism at times, but G.M. executives generally have not. They've been an irony-free version of those old Brooklyn Dodger fans, constantly saying, ''wait till next year.'' 
 But next year has never arrived, because G.M. cars haven't been as good as their rivals. If you've ever experienced the joy of being told that your rental car is a Toyota Corolla rather than a Chevrolet Impala, you know this. The data bears this out, too. Surveys show that G.M. cars break down more often than Japanese cars. 
 The ultimate judgment, of course, comes from the market. As Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, points out, Detroit's cars are consistently priced $2,000 to $3,000 below their Japanese equivalents, yet have continued to lose market share. 
 Most worrisome, many car buyers in their 20s and 30s don't even consider buying an American car. These younger buyers are effectively replacing loyal Chevrolet, Ford and Chrysler customers in their 60s and 70s, the auto analyst John Wolkonowicz notes. Which is why Detroit's market share just keeps falling.
 Mr. Wolkonowicz and his colleagues at IHS Global Insight, a research firm, dug into the bankruptcy filing this week and came up with their own projections. They forecast G.M.'s market share would drop to 17 percent in 2014. (Going out one decimal place, G.M. did forecast a small drop, to 18.5 percent in 2014, from more than 19 percent now.) Global Insight also thinks that total industry sales will recover more slowly than G.M. does.
 The resulting difference is significant. Global Insight expects G.M. to sell 20 percent fewer cars than the company expects, both this year and next year. 
 Yet here, surprisingly enough, is where we get to some real reasons for optimism. Even under this less rosy forecast, G.M. may still make a small profit next year. By 2014, it is likely to be quite profitable, according to Global Insight. The Obama administration's internal forecast is even more conservative, and the company would still start making money within a couple of years.
 Why? The cuts that the administration forced on the company are big enough to give it some wiggle room. One in three workers will be gone. So will the Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn brands.
 And these cuts have the potential to do more than just reduce costs. They will make it easier for the company to focus on its remaining brands. It will become a little more like Honda and little less like its old self. 
 Its executives refer to this as the ''fewer, better'' approach, and the shining example is the Chevrolet Malibu. Back in 1980, the Malibu was the king of sedans. By 2007, though, G.M. sold only 33 Malibus for every 100 Accords that Honda sold, according to Autodata. Then came a redesign that made the Malibu sleeker and more comfortable. This year, for every 100 Accords sold, 59 Malibus have sold. 
 Some skeptics doubt that these green shoots will amount to much. They say that G.M. is a fundamentally broken company, one that will continue its drift toward irrelevance. And they may be right.
 But now that the government owns most of the company, it may as well try to make it viable. 
 Clearly, that does not mean micromanagement -- like, to take one relevant example, directing G.M. to make fuel-efficient cars even if customers don't want to buy them. It also doesn't mean letting G.M.'s executives operate with a free hand.
 To judge from their latest rose-colored predictions, those executives still don't quite get it. Most of their cars are not yet reliable nor appealing enough. That -- not car buyers who are too slow to know a good thing when they see one -- remains the biggest problem. 
 On Monday, after G.M. filed for bankruptcy, Fritz Henderson, its chief executive, held a news conference in New York. ''Today,'' he said, ''marks the beginning of what will be a new company, a new G.M., dedicated to building the very best cars and trucks.''
 It sounded like the kind of thing you might have read in one of those upbeat magazine articles from 1979 or 1989 or 1999. Yet those of us who make up G.M.'s brand new group of majority owners -- taxpayers -- have to hope that Mr. Henderson is right.
 We also have to hope the Obama administration will force him and his colleagues to be realistic.

HEADLINE: In Novelty Of Touching, PC Makers See a Future

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 

 BODY:
The computer industry has a lot riding on your fingers. 
 For years, companies have dabbled with the touch-screen technology that lets people poke icons on a display to accomplish tasks like picking a seat at an airport check-in kiosk. Apple elevated such technology from a novelty to a must-have feature on mobile devices with its iPhone. People can flip through pictures with a flick of a finger or make a document larger by pressing two fingers against the screen and stretching them out.
 Now both personal computer manufacturers and software makers hope to do more with touch on larger devices by giving people a 10-fingered go at their screens. 
 ''You don't even operate your TV with two fingers,'' said Amichai Ben-David, the chief executive officer of N-trig, which produces touch-screen technology for PC makers. ''In order for this to feel really natural, you need more than two fingers for sure.''
 The PC industry hopes the feature spurs sales. PC makers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell have been clobbered during the recession as struggling businesses drop computer upgrades to the bottom of their to-do lists. Consumers have shown more interest in new machines, but they are buying cheap, tiny laptops rather than decked-out goliaths. 
 H.P., Dell, Intel and Microsoft expect that when companies and consumers increase their spending, touch technology will be one of the things that nudge them to upgrade. Computers with the special screens will probably cost consumers about $100 more than standard machines.
 H.P. has been selling a PC with an early version of touch technology. The $1,150 TouchSmart PC has been popular, H.P. says, particularly in kitchens as a family computer. But outside of science-fiction films, touch computers have been met with lukewarm reactions. Tabletlike computers that ship with plastic pens for marking on screens remain a niche in the overall PC market, as do pure touch machines. Mr. Ben-David said that about two million of about 300 million PCs sold last year were touch computers. 
 H.P. has already been pushing touch technology to large businesses. It sells a custom touch interface for both desktops and laptops. Customers can turn these machines into bespoke kiosks for, say, ordering merchandise at a sporting event or flipping through a menu while waiting at a restaurant.
 The PC industry wants to make touch functions more sophisticated and widespread. On-screen objects could be twisted and turned with several fingers, mimicking the action used in real life. The next version of Windows from Microsoft, Windows 7, will usher in a new era of touch technology when it appears on PCs later this year, according to Mr. Ben-David. Backed by Microsoft, Israel-based N-trig uses a combination of software and sensors to create a special type of computer screen that can interact with pens and fingers. N-trig's technology works by pumping an electrical signal through the screen. When a finger hits the screen, the electricity is discharged. Software interprets that to move graphics on the screen. The company claims that its technology works better on the larger displays of laptops and PCs since it handles many inputs at once. 
 Working together, Microsoft and N-trig have created a type of software interface that lets other companies add touch functions to their programs. Such touch software can handle lots of fingers hitting a screen at once rather than just relying on one or two digits, as most of today's touch screens do. 
 N-trig hopes to build more momentum later this year, when three more PC makers are set to join H.P. and Dell as backers of the touch technology. It did not disclose the names of those companies.
 The big question is whether companies can create software that makes touch useful rather than a mere curiosity. 
 Corel, which makes document and photo editing software, also plans touch products that rely on N-trig's technology for Windows 7. 
 SpaceClaim, which makes software for designing objects in 3-D, has taken a business-oriented approach to touch. Its software, which will work with Windows 7, creates 3-D models that can be turned, pinched and altered via two-handed touches. Frank DeSimone, the head of development urges other software makers to try something new and stick with the technology rather than just replicating the functions of a mouse. 
 ''A lot of people say they will support touch, but they do a disservice to everyone by not doing anything interesting,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shining a Light on Executive Pay

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and FIONA MAHARG-BRAVO

 BODY:
Banker pay is about to receive some sunlight. Regulators in Switzerland and the United States are pushing for greater disclosure of salaries and bonuses. Encouragingly, rather than kowtowing to the populist gawking at the millions awarded to high-ranking individuals, the authorities are rightly focusing on how pay is determined. 
 In Switzerland, the call for greater transparency is part of a set of rules on remuneration that will require greater symmetry between risk and reward. Under a proposal disclosed Wednesday, the country's financial institutions would be required to spell out compensation structure details. This would allow shareholders to assess how bonuses stack up against a bank's performance. 
 More than the top brass will be opened to scrutiny, however. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission are calling for plans for determining the pay of lower-level employees to be disclosed too. This makes sense: traders buzzing in the banking hives can take big risks, and how they are compensated should also be subject to inspection. 
 Bankers won't be singled out -- at least not in the United States. The S.E.C. plan is to extend its wider-reaching demands to nonfinancial companies. Like banks, film studios and pharmaceutical companies often have employees who earn far more than those in the boardroom. Shareholders should understand how the performance of these rainmakers is measured, even if their actual take-home spoils are not disclosed. 
 The proposed transparency is welcome but may have its limits. In one instance, Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, disclosed terms of its long-term bonus plans, and then paid executives even after they fell narrowly short of targets. A majority of shareholders rejected the payouts, but in a nonbinding vote. 
 So while it's all well and good for regulators to supply the disinfectant, it will be up to shareholders to get into the act of cleansing.
 Paid Time Off
 Oh, to ''work'' at BBVA. The Spanish bank's offer to let staff take up to five years off at 30 percent pay looks very generous. The bank is also offering more conventional part-time work to reduce payroll costs. That these moves could make financial sense for BBVA says much about Spain's onerous labor laws and its overstaffed banking sector. 
 BBVA, led by Francisco Gonzalez Rodriguez, the chief executive, is among Europe's most efficient lenders. Its cost-to-income ratio of 41 percent is below the continent's average of 58 percent. Trying to cut costs further looks essential in a market where business may be slow for at least a couple of years. 
 BBVA stopped branch expansion in overbanked Spain in 2006. Its investment in technology will probably lead to more office closures. With nonperforming loans rising and the economy in Mexico, one of BBVA's major markets, slowing, every bit helps. 
 But firing workers in Spain is expensive. The novelty of BBVA's latest approach is that it can help employees as much as it does the employer. The paid time off -- at a minimum of 12,000 euros (about $17,000) a year, with health care valued at 3,600 euros to boot -- will afford many the time to do as they wish, including postgraduate work.
 That could help employees collect new qualifications or recycle talent into other industries. Employees may go back to BBVA, but some will not. That should not bother BBVA much. It will be spared the paperwork tied to letting longtime employees go and the expense of paying six weeks of severance for every year worked. 
 Government and union grumbling looks off-base; the plan is voluntary. But it is not risk-free. Technology changes fast, and returning employees could struggle to readjust. Women are also probably more likely to take up the offer, which could lead to sex imbalances. BBVA has reserved the right to refuse applications. 
 Some United States law firms have done something similar, but only with yet-to-join recruits and only for a year or so. BBVA's plan looks smart enough that other companies -- even those beyond banking and outside Spain -- might keep a close eye on it.

 BODY:
BUILDUP OF DEBT Governments worldwide are increasing their debt as they cope with the recession and thus are paying higher interest rates. This is creating a potentially difficult situation in the long term, in which added interest costs will worsen deficits. 
 ANSWERING FOR G.M. The chief executive of General Motors, Fritz Henderson, told Congress that the carmaker would strive for transparency in telling American taxpayers, its largest investor, about its progress. [B1.] 
 Before a Senate panel, the vice chairman of Chrysler, James E. Press, left, and G.M.'s leader, Fritz Henderson, defended their plans to reduce the number of dealerships. [B4.] 
 G.M.'s operations in emerging markets have performed better than the carmaker has in the United States, growing even in the downturn. [B4.] 
 DERIVATIVES TRADING The new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gary G. Gensler, is expected to ask Congress to impose new restrictions and higher costs on trading in derivatives. [B1.] 
 BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE WORLD Stock markets in developing countries like China have posted sharp increases in the last three months, and some analysts say their prospects for growth are better than those for the United States or Europe. [B1.] 
 RISE OF TAIWANESE TECHNOLOGY After years of building electronics for Western companies, Taiwanese companies are trying to build their own global brands. The popularity of netbooks, or Web-oriented mini-laptops, has bolstered their efforts. [B1.] 
 HIRING INVESTIGATION The Justice Department is said to be investigating the hiring practices of major technology companies and whether they had agreements not to poach one another's workers. Such a practice could lock up the job market and suppress salary levels. [B11.] 
 LAYOFFS FOR STEEL MAKER The world's largest steel maker, ArcelorMittal, was granted permission by the Spanish government to temporarily lay off as many as 12,000 employees in the country, which has the highest jobless rate in Europe. [B6.] 
 RUSSIA'S OIL AND HISTORY Major oil price slumps in the last 25 years led to economic and political changes in Moscow, and as prices fell in the winter, more shifts were expected. But with oil prices now above $60 a barrel, the pressure on the government has eased. [B1.] 
 MARKETS FALL Remarks from the chairman of the Federal Reserve about employment levels and the speed of a recovery generated pessimism on Wall Street and sent stocks and oil prices tumbling. [B11.]

HEADLINE: Slump Pushing Cost of Drugs Out of Reach

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. 

 BODY:
A year or so ago, when customers buttonholed the pharmacists at Almand's Drug Store here the questions were invariably about dosing or side effects. These days, they are almost always about cost.
 Can I get this as a generic? Is the co-pay really that high? Will you match Wal-Mart's $4 price? ''I'm out of Lexapro,'' a woman pleaded one recent Tuesday, speaking of her antidepressant. ''Can I just have four pills until payday on Friday?''
 Some customers request prices for a fistful of prescriptions, and then say they can fill only the cheapest two. Others ask which are most important.
 ''It can be a hard question to answer,'' said Traci W. Suber, the head pharmacist. ''The only thing I can do is let them know what they're for, get them the cheapest available and encourage them to come back for the others when they can.'' 
 Even with the Medicare drug benefit, even with the prevalence of low-cost generics, even with loss-leader discounting by big chains, many Americans still find themselves unable to afford the prescription medications that manage their life-threatening conditions. 
 In downtrodden communities like Rocky Mount, where unemployment has doubled to 14 percent in a year, the recession has heightened the struggle. National surveys consistently find that as many as a third of respondents say they are not complying with prescriptions because of cost, up from about a fourth three years ago. 
 Many customers at Almand's Oakwood neighborhood store, particularly those too well off for Medicaid but unable to afford insurance, simply pick and choose among risks. They weigh not taking maintenance medications against more immediate needs like shelter and food.
 The pharmacists see it every day. About eight months ago, they stopped automatically preparing refills for regular customers because they found that more than half were not being collected and had to be restocked.
 One recent Wednesday, James S. Crawford, newly discharged from the hospital after his third heart attack, fanned six green slips across the counter as if showing a hand of cards. There were a pair for high blood pressure, one each for angina, cholesterol, and acid reflux, and a renal vitamin for his kidney disease. ''I need to know the prices,'' he said.
 Ms. Suber, the pharmacist, explained what each drug was for and listed the co-payments under Mr. Crawford's Medicare plan, ranging from $8.25 to $18.49 for a one-month supply. The renal vitamin, at $21.89, was not covered.
 Mr. Crawford, 61, who makes do on $1,800 a month in Social Security and veterans' benefits, decided he could afford only the heart, blood pressure and acid reflux pills. ''If I can rob a bank,'' he said, chuckling, ''I'll be back for the others.''
 Before leaving, he handed over yet another prescription, just for safekeeping. It was for Plavix, an anticlotting drug that helps coronary patients avoid new blockages, and it had been written in early February after Mr. Crawford's second heart attack. At $160, the co-payment was so high he had never considered filling it.
 Some customers get by through a patchwork of assistance programs offered by governments, charities and drug makers. The only hospital in Rocky Mount, Nash General, donated about $60,000 in medications last year, and a newly established free clinic is spending up to $600 a month on discounted prescriptions at Almand's. 
 But the need is much greater, and the impact is already felt downstream in clinics and emergency rooms where the ailing seek treatment when their diabetes or blood pressure spikes out of control. 
 Dr. John T. Avent, a physician at a low-income clinic near Almand's, estimated that at least 80 percent of his patients were not taking prescribed medicines. 
 ''They'll say, 'Well, Doc, I just couldn't afford it; I've been out of it for a month now,' '' Dr. Avent said. ''By that time, of course, their blood pressure is highly elevated and their hemoglobin A1C is two to three times what it should be.''
 Dr. Daniel C. Minior, who directs the emergency department at Nash General, said he was increasingly hearing from patients that they had lost jobs and could not afford medications. ''The worrisome aspect is that it's even occurring among younger and working-age people,'' Dr. Minior said. ''That's not something we saw before.''
 Rocky Mount, planted amid tobacco fields in eastern North Carolina, has seen the closings of mills and an exodus of jobs, compounding the devastation caused by flooding from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The Almand family once owned a dozen pharmacies in the area, but only two survive.
 The Oakwood store, in the heart of the African-American community, faces growing competition from mail orders. But business remains steady thanks to discount programs, partnerships with neighborhood clinics, while-you-wait service, $1 delivery and a friendly, familiar staff. Each morning, the pharmacy fills with the aroma of popcorn from the machine on the counter and Gloria Mabry, who runs the cash register, greets customers by calling them Baby or Sugar, whether she knows them or not.
 More than 70 percent of the store's patrons are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, and the pharmacy offers $4 generics to the uninsured. But customers taking a dozen or more medications may still struggle to afford even the modest co-payments under government plans (as low as $3 in the case of Medicaid). 
 Lisa A. Hylton, 29, from nearby Sharpsburg, said she had skipped twice-monthly refills three times this year on an albuterol inhaler for her asthmatic son, Hunter. Her husband, a pipefitter, had been working only intermittently and could not afford insurance during the idle stretches, Ms. Hylton said. ''It makes me feel like I can't supply for my young-uns.'' 
 Jimmie L. Bryant, 56, had been laid off for a month when he walked into Almand's with swollen glands and a one-time voucher from the Edgecombe County Department of Social Services. For the first time since he lost his job, the voucher enabled him to fill prescriptions for Synthroid, to control his hypothyroidism, and Xanax, for depression.
 Mr. Bryant said he had tried to get refills from his physician, but was told he would have to schedule an office visit for $120, which he could not afford. Even when he was working and had insurance, Mr. Bryant said, he would alternate between the two prescriptions, week to week.
 ''At the end of the month, I'd have a little bit of what I need in my system,'' he explained.
 Similarly, Robert E. Brown, 60, who has heart disease and emphysema, said he regularly told the pharmacists at Almand's to reshelve his prescriptions after being quoted prices of $100 or more. ''I just hand them back,'' he said. ''I take the ones I can afford, and then trust in the Lord.''

HEADLINE: A Play Date With My Imagination

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA. 
E-mail: slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CHILDREN should come with yellow warning stickers taped to their foreheads: Caution, ideas inside!
 Yesterday was a typical day for my 11-year-old daughter. She formed a band with her friend Emily. Then they thought of a name for the band (CleminEm). Then they learned guitar chords for three songs from watching YouTube videos. Then they wrote new lyrics for the songs because ''the old ones weren't funny enough.'' Then they designed an album cover, and then they edited it with Photoshop (''Doesn't it look cooler in neon?'') before posting it on Facebook.
 All that happened in the first hour. 
 ''What are you going to do after dinner?'' I asked. 
 ''I have to write a script for my volcano movie,'' Clementine said happily.
 Just watching so much creativity percolate can be exhausting to an older generation.
 But I remember a time -- let's call it the first half of my life -- when I woke up every morning feeling just like Clem. Opportunities were coming to me, I just knew it, and ideas were bursting out, and the rest of the world felt like support staff, standing by to help me achieve my grandest ambitions. In those days, I trusted, instinctively, that at any moment I was on the verge of learning something that would further expand my empire of knowledge, context and imagination.
 Some lucky people feel that same exhilaration all their lives. They become more creative as they age. Consider Elliott Carter, the patriarch of American composers, who celebrated his 100th birthday in December at a Carnegie Hall concert that included a piece he wrote at age 98. Others manage to surprise everyone around them by transforming themselves entirely; Grandma Moses, who didn't become an artist until she was in her 70s, painted more than 1,000 pictures before she died at age 101.
 But for others, the equation shifts as they age, and they start to feel energy and creativity slip away. As Anna Quindlen wrote recently to explain why she decided to give up her regular column in Newsweek magazine, ''Experience often brings wisdom, but also sometimes torpor and fatigue.'' 
 And she's only 56.
 At 47, I'm starting to wonder which direction I'm headed. And with good reason because, according to my accountant, there is no way I'm going to be able to give in to torpor, fatigue or anything else that might take me out of the work force anytime soon.
 Most of us who've reached midlife are in the same boat. Whether we're journalists or jewelry designers, entrepreneurs or engineers, the bad economy's effect on our retirement savings has made it clear that we can't afford to move aside, even if new ideas don't flow as freely as they once did.
 These days I wake up most mornings considering a question: Where does creativity come from? 
 And can I please have some more of it?
 ''It depends,'' said Prof. Dean Keith Simonton, a researcher at the University of California, Davis who studies the relationship between age and creativity.
 Generally speaking, late bloomers like Grandma Moses are among the lucky ones. People who get an early start may also burn out early, particularly if all they ever had in the first place was one great idea.
 ''They might just either exhaust the idea or, one day, realize the rest of the world passed by,'' Professor Simonton said. ''Jean Sibelius, the Finnish composer, had that problem. He started with the idea of taking the Tchaikovskian idea of a symphony and making it shorter and more concise, and that's what he did when he composed each of his symphonies until finally he got down to one that put everything in a nutshell.''
 ''Then what happened?'' I asked.
 ''Then he reached a dead end,'' Professor Simonton said. ''He ceased composing for the latter part of his life because he didn't have another good idea.''
 ''My accountant would say that's a terrible story,'' I said.
 But not an unusual one. A typical problem for people as they get older is that when they consider their lives, they start to see more past tense than future. Instead of looking forward to limitless possibility, at a certain age people begin to believe the best -- the best times, their best work -- happened a long time ago.
 ''On average, pay increases max out in your 40s,'' Professor Simonton said. ''You reach a point where you realize all your kids aren't going to go to Harvard and be famous, either. At some point, you don't even get excited about your birthday anymore.''
 In fact, men ages 72 and older are more likely to die right before or on their birthdays than younger men are, according to an analysis of birth and death dates published a few years ago in the journal Omega.
 But not everybody stops looking forward to birthdays. And not everybody burns out. There are people like, say, the painter Paul Cezanne, whose later work is considered some of his best.
 ''It depends partly on how you were creative to start with,'' Professor Simonton said. ''Cezanne had a particular vision of the world that was so complex and rich that it would take more than one lifetime to explore, and so he kept on going.'' 
 The trick for most of us is to figure out how to be more like Cezanne and less like Sibelius.
 ''Usually the people who keep going are the ones who are open to new experiences,'' Professor Simonton said. ''Do something different. Take a risk. Try to believe in the future tense.''
 So, if I feel as if I'm running out of ideas, instead of quitting my job cold turkey I could take up a hobby and see whether an interest in, say, wine tasting eventually develops naturally over the course of a few years into a new life as a winemaker.
 THERE are some constraints, because we're limited by our skill sets. Few of us suddenly can say, ''I'm going into nuclear physics because I'm tired of being a Spanish teacher.'' 
 But we can change direction within a field where we already have expertise -- an essayist might try writing poetry, for example -- to stretch ourselves. 
 This strategy worked for me earlier this year when I decided to write a story for a children's picture book, something I'd never tried before.
 As if by magic, an entire plot, fully formed, occurred to me faster than I could type, and I felt that old rush of pure elation that comes from having a good idea. 
 Next I might start a band. 
 Would it be cheating if I asked Clem to name it?

HEADLINE: In Overhaul, G.M. May Find Solace in Its Far-Flung Units

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: GURGAON, India 

 BODY:
What will New G.M. look like?
 Part of the answer may be found at the India headquarters of General Motors, a new sandstone and tinted-glass building surrounded by dirt roads and corrugated tin shacks. On the walls are reminders of the company's past, including photos of the 1953 Corvette. But sports cars are the last thing that G.M. India is planning.
 This week in Delhi, G.M. India will unveil its first clean-burning liquefied natural gas car. Later this year, it will introduce a minicar built for the Indian market, with the help of 1,500 frugal-minded engineers. 
 As G.M. painfully reorganizes in the United States and Canada, and spins off its European business, the company's operations in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil have survived virtually unscathed, so far.
 Unlike G.M.'s United States business, these operations have been growing. Sales increased 10 percent last year in Brazil, 9 percent in India and 6 percent in China. Recent numbers in some areas are even better -- G.M.'s sales in the Asia Pacific region were up 44 percent in May compared with the year before.
 In these markets, G.M. has often acted like an entirely different company from the one that is collapsing in Detroit. In China, G.M. has spent years emphasizing fuel economy and affordability. In Brazil, it created flexible-fuel engines that run on ethanol or gasoline, and compact pickup trucks. In India, the new tiny car may be priced to compete with Tata's $2,500 Nano.
 Cheap labor in these markets helps to bolster profit margins, while millions of people who do not yet own a car make sales growth easy.
 The so-called New G.M. may rely on these emerging markets for a chunk of its business (emerging markets made up roughly 40 percent of G.M.'s sales in 2008 when Europe is not counted in the total). And these international businesses, which are barred from receiving funds from the government investment, will need to be self-sustaining until the company turns around.
 The managers in G.M.'s emerging markets say they are ready to get back to work. G.M. in India is telling customers and dealers ''that's done, and everyone knows what it looks like, so we can get on with it,'' Karl Slym, president and managing director of G.M. India, said Tuesday. 
 Mr. Slym, a Briton who worked for the company in Poland, Germany, South Korea and the United States before coming to India, said he expected to add 50 dealers in India this year, stretching into the rural market.
 G.M. Brazil's chief executive, Jaime Ardila, told reporters that the company had a great 2008 and expects a lucrative 2009. Government tax breaks have helped to keep auto sales steady in Brazil, despite the global slowdown, and G.M.'s overall vehicle sales in May were up 2 percent from April. The company is on track to invest $2.5 billion in operations in Latin America by 2012, which will be financed entirely from its local operations.
 And it is eager to talk about new plans. ''G.M. is working pretty aggressively on hybrids, battery technology and fuel cells,'' Nick Reilly, president of G.M. Asia Pacific, said Tuesday.
 Emerging markets have been the only bright spots at G.M. for some time.
 The North American and European businesses have racked up enormous losses -- $14.1 billion from North America's continuing operations before taxes in 2008 and $3.3 billion in 2007. In Europe, G.M. lost $2.8 billion before taxes in 2008 and $524 million in 2007.
 But G.M.'s Latin American, African and Middle Eastern operations earned $1.3 billion before taxes in 2008, down slightly from the year before. Asia Pacific operations, which include developed markets like Japan, where the company sells very few cars, Australia, and South Korea, which is an export hub, lost $800 million last year, down from a profit of $681 million in 2007. 
 G.M.'s Chinese operations, conducted through a series of joint ventures with Chinese automakers, have reaped a bonanza as the Chinese government has adjusted tax policies and fuel economy regulations to favor small cars.
 G.M.'s main rivals in China, Toyota and Volkswagen, have struggled to keep up.
 In India, G.M. has been late to join a veritable car-selling frenzy, after introducing the Opel to lackluster reception years ago. The company sold just 66,000 cars in India last year, well behind the market leader, Maruti-Suzuki, with nearly 800,000.
 But G.M. has the capacity to produce four times as many, and has just opened a plant that will help reduce its reliance on imported parts. 
 The company is adding hundreds of engineers to its research and development operations in Bangalore, and plans to build a transmission plant if it can raise the cash in India.
 Analysts say the company's emerging market businesses may help to keep G.M. going while it tackles the company's most important task: sorting out the North American business.
 ''Latin America is probably one of the more attractive markets globally for the next 10 years,'' said Stuart Pearson, an analyst with Credit Suisse in London. ''The economy is not in as much difficulty as in previous crisis.'' 
 There is less confidence about Asia. ''China is still very strong,'' but most other Asian car markets have weakened because of the global economic crisis, said John Bonnell, director of forecasting at the consulting group J. D. Power & Associates in Asia. 
 Over all, analysts say, G.M. must avoid the same mistakes in emerging markets that it made at home. 
 ''Measured development,'' Mr. Bonnell said. ''Don't be so exposed with big capacity and big ambition to take on great things.''

HEADLINE: Charities Loosening Strings on Arts Grants

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The board of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation has loosened the strings on some grants to arts organizations to help them weather a severe downturn in fund-raising and income from ticket sales and the like.
 ''We asked ourselves whether, in this time of urgency, restricting the use of capital was the best use of our money,'' said Ben Cameron, the foundation's program director for the arts, ''and our board decided it was not.''
 Foundations are facing a sharp increase in demand for aid, even as their assets have declined, which is forcing them to rethink the way they do business. 
 Some foundations have decided to increase the amount they dispense each year, even though that may trigger a higher excise tax. Others are allocating their grants to support nonprofit groups' operating costs, when they have traditionally supported only program expenses.
 In ordinary times, renegotiating grant agreements, as Duke is doing, would be unusual. But of the 79 foundations responding to a recent survey by the Center for Effective Philanthropy, 16 said they had invited organizations to do just that.
 ''It's a minority of foundations, still,'' said Phil Buchanan, the center's president. ''But it's encouraging to see that some are seeking to be as flexible as they can.''
 Last November, James E. Canales, chief executive of the James Irvine Foundation, sent a letter to the nonprofits its supports offering flexibility on grant terms. ''We are open, on a case-by-case basis, to revisiting grant objectives, grant budgets and related timelines based on new economic realities facing your organization,'' Mr. Canales wrote. 
 Daniel Silverman, a spokesman for the Irvine foundation, said the foundation had adjusted the terms of its grants with about 10 percent of the roughly 300 organizations it supports, agreeing to extend when payments are due, say, or reduce matching grant requirements. 
 The Irvine foundation is also preparing to make grants as large as $150,000 for organizations to spend on things that will help them manage during the downturn. 
 Arts groups, in particular, suffer during periods of economic decline. Their donors often redistribute their charitable giving to organizations that address basic needs, and ticket sales and other sources of revenue suffer.
 Small and midsized arts organizations tend to struggle the most, and in the past, Duke made grants to help those groups establish endowments. For instance, it gave the Goodman Theater in Chicago $1.5 million in 2001 to establish a $3 million endowment to support artistic development, said Roche Schulfer, the theater's executive director.
 Last fall, the theater was facing increased payments on bonds used to support construction. The elimination of the requirement that Duke's money be held only for endowment purposes allowed it to avoid the higher payments to bondholders, Mr. Schulfer said. 
 The Dance Theater Workshop in New York City was struggling because of shortfalls in fund-raising. It had a $700,000 budget deficit and had borrowed all that it could against a $1.3 million endowment created with a Duke grant that was matched by grants from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Fan Fox & Leslie R. Samuels Foundation.
 Duke and the other foundations agreed to release the restrictions on the use of their money after hearing about the workshop's restructuring plan, which included layoffs, a shorter performance season and increased rental income.
 ''That was much more helpful to us than having an endowment at this time,'' said Andrea Sholler, executive director of the workshop.

HEADLINE: A Bounce in Russia Is Easing Pressure For Economic Change

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia's stock market is up about 80 percent this spring, a bounce that is astonishing even by the standards of recent recoveries in other emerging markets. 
 The problem is that rising oil prices have turned around Russia's prospects so quickly that economists are now warning of a different risk: the crisis may be too short.
 The two previous major oil price slumps in the last quarter-century were followed by significant economic and political changes in Moscow that paved the way for future growth. For a time, it seemed the current oil shock would follow the same path. 
 Indeed, the mood was so glum last winter, when oil dipped below $40 a barrel, that some advisers close to the government suggested that the country might be compelled to open up politically to spur development. At the least, policies encouraging Russia to diversify beyond oil were seen as imminent.
 What is needed to diversify the economy and stabilize the financial system, critics of the Russian government say, is an overhaul of the courts and a crackdown on corruption to improve property rights and separate the bureaucracy from the economy. 
 But with oil prices now above $60 a barrel, the pressure on the government of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin to change has eased, even though the stock market remains 44 percent off its high in December 2007. Instead, an economic strategy that amounts to essentially waiting out the downturn is beginning to take shape.
 The interplay of change and oil prices is likely to be a major theme at an economic forum opening in St. Petersburg on Thursday, which will be attended by at least 200 emerging market investors.
 ''The oil price is going up, everything seems to be in order, so why change?'' Sergei M. Guriev, dean of the New Economic School in Moscow and a board member of the state-owned Sberbank, said by telephone. ''If oil prices go back to where there is no budget deficit, then it will be business as usual.''
 State banks, for example, are rolling over loans to failing companies rather than requiring them to restructure in bankruptcy, as is the case with General Motors in the United States, on the premise that the Russian economy will quickly turn around, along with the value of oil.
 ''The big problem with this crisis is it may be too short for Russia,'' Roland Nash, the chief strategist at Renaissance Capital, a securities firm in Moscow, said in an interview. 
 At first blush, oil's rapid price rise is fabulous for Russia. For each $1 increase in the price of oil, for example, Russia's government budget earns about $1.7 billion a year, according to Yulia Tseplayeva, the chief economist for Merrill Lynch in Moscow.
 Yet in recent Russian history, the two periods of most intensive economic change -- both of which were a condition for the boom of the past decade -- were preceded by deep and prolonged slumps in oil prices.
 In a study of the ties between oil price and policy changes in the late Soviet period, Russia's former prime minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, says a balance-of-payment shock during the period of low oil prices in the mid-1980s was a major factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 In his book ''Collapse of an Empire,'' Mr. Gaidar argues that the Soviet government turned to West European bank lending as the value of its principal export commodity, crude oil, plunged. That set in play the dynamic that unwound the country even before the uprisings began in the former satellite states.
 The Soviets' lack of a hard currency reserve, and thus dependence on Western lending, limited the Kremlin's options when nationalist movements broke out. Any forceful response would surely have prompted Western banks and governments to call in their credit lines, which were propping up the Soviet government by allowing food imports.
 This balance-of-payments shock also prompted the sweeping privatizations, liberalization of consumer prices and introduction of a convertible currency in the early 1990s -- reforms that ultimately put the Russian economy on a modern footing.
 A second sustained collapse in oil prices in the late 1990s, in the wake of the Asian economic crisis, led the government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to default on domestic debt and devalue the currency.
 That shock also impelled the government to overhaul its tax regime, introducing a 13 percent flat income tax that is easier to collect and helped wean the government from domestic borrowing. In addition, that crash became the impetus for a ''never again'' policy that led the government to accumulate a huge currency reserve -- the third largest in the world going into the current downturn, behind China and Japan.
 These reforms stood Russia in good stead for the oil price collapse last autumn, cushioning the impact on the balance of payments and propping up the budget, as intended.
 But the vulnerabilities of an economy that is still inadequately diversified showed themselves.
 From tumultuous growth, Russia fell quite quickly into a deep recession. Its swing from 8 percent growth in 2008 to a 6.5 percent contraction this year is the most extreme of any major economy in the global slowdown.
 Unemployment numbers came in higher than expected in April, at a nine-year high of 10.2 percent. As factories closed in one-industry towns, no alternative sources of employment from small and midsize business could soak up the jobless. 
 Also, Russian companies had borrowed excessively from Western banks, which pulled back their credit when problems arose in their home markets.
 Still, the crisis did usher in some change. Until this year, government ministers or other bureaucrats dominated the boards of state-owned companies, creating a conflict of interest and risk for minority shareholders. Under a policy initiated by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, independent directors are now being appointed to these boards.
 In another change that amounts to a de facto tax break for small business, Mr. Medvedev signed a law prohibiting surprise inspections from fire and health authorities of the type often used to collect bribes. Mr. Medvedev required bureaucrats to disclose not only their own income and assets, but those of their spouses as well, plugging a loophole in anticorruption legislation. A draft law prohibiting insider trading, a bane on the Russian market, is before Parliament.
 Even more far-reaching measures were envisioned. The Institute for Contemporary Development, a research organization where Mr. Medvedev serves as chairman, published a report in February, back when oil prices were languishing, suggesting political liberalism would be needed to revive the economy.
 Now, it is unclear how long a liberal wing will have the upper hand in the economic policy debate in the Kremlin.

HEADLINE: Developing Markets in Bloom Again

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and KEITH BRADSHER; Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai and Keith Bradsher from Dongguan, China. Andrew Downie contributed reporting from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
If investors in New York and London are seeing the first delicate signs of a recovery, their counterparts in developing countries say they are witnessing a full-on spring. 
 After a crushing fall in the last year and a half, stock markets in developing countries are riding a wave of optimism that the recovery of the global economy is at hand and being led by the developing world, especially China. Though emerging markets remain far below the lofty highs they attained more than a year ago, investors are again viewing their chances of growth as better than those of the United States or Europe. 
 As a result, the Indian Nifty stock index has jumped by 64 percent in the last three months. China's CSI 300 index of shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen has risen 37 percent and Brazil's Bovespa increased 41 percent over the same period. By comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500's gain of 28 percent looks modest.
 ''There was a stampede for the exits in the fourth quarter,'' said Gonzalo S. Pangaro, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock Fund. ''The market is starting to realize that although these markets face issues, they are manageable issues.'' 
 So much so that analysts have attributed some of the recent gains in the S.& P. to investors' belief that the Chinese economy is improving. It is not just China that is generating optimism. A lot of improving economic data is bolstering developing countries. While industrial production has rebounded in China, so have car sales in India and retail sales in Brazil.
 Could all this be irrational exuberance? Current valuations are extremely rich: the price of stocks on the Indian Nifty is more than 20 times earnings. Prices are nearly 21 times earnings on the Bovespa and 29 times earnings on the CSI 300. 
 The optimistic view is that these price-to-earnings ratios reflect the return of an appetite for risk in the markets, which normally accompanies a more positive outlook, and a belief that these countries are ready to resume strong economic growth.
 The skeptical outlook is that the economies would have to leap to double-digit growth rates to justify these valuations and that that could only mean a bubble was forming. 
 Emerging markets generally swing more wildly, in both directions, than developed countries do. And each of the big developing economies, the so-called BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, face weaknesses that could stunt any recovery.
 Exports and foreign investment flows, for instance, which are critical for many developing countries, remain anemic. Government spending has taken up some of the slack, but rising fiscal deficits in places like India could limit how much more policy makers can do to stimulate their economies.
 For now, there is little talk of caution. In India, the rising stock market surged even more when the government garnered a bigger majority in national elections last month. Many analysts say they expect the government to expedite economic changes and infrastructure overhauls.
 Madhabi Puri-Buch, the chief executive of Icici Securities, in Mumbai, said India would weather the crisis better than other countries because domestic consumption, the primary engine for the economy, was still growing. Sales for the biggest Indian automaker, Maruti Suzuki, for instance, climbed more than 10 percent in May.
 Investments also are showing signs of revival. Foreign flows into the stock market have turned positive in recent months. Ms. Buch said companies were raising billions of dollars from institutional investors.
 ''Most companies in their boardrooms would be saying we need to plan for future growth,'' she said, ''rather than saying we need to batten down the hatches for a long winter.''
 Other analysts say the fundamentals of the Indian economy have not improved enough to justify the big rally. 
 ''There is the potential for this new government to make a significant difference in terms of economic reforms,'' said Ajay Shah, a senior fellow at the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy. ''I would underline the word potential. There are very big gaps between theory and execution, between promise and reality.''
 The Reserve Bank of India expects the economy to grow 6 percent this fiscal year, down from an estimated 6.7 percent last year. Optimists like Ms. Buch said economic growth in India could be as high as 7.5 percent, while the World Bank has forecast 4 percent.
 In China, industrial production has started to recover, and imports of commodities have risen. But the rebound is heavily concentrated in domestic sectors that benefit from the government's stimulus program. Exports are still struggling.
 An increase in bank lending has prompted a revival of the real estate market and the car market. The government has also offered $1.02 billion worth of subsidies to people in rural areas for car and home appliance purchases, contributing to a 14 percent increase in overall car sales in the first four months of this year, compared with the period last year.
 The situation on the ground tells the tale.
 For Wu Guo Fei and Wu Guo Cai, brothers who alter clothes at a sidewalk shop in Dongguan, China, near Hong Kong, the shock of the global financial crisis is slowly starting to fade.
 From last summer until December, their monthly revenue shrank by 40 percent as some migrant workers at the nearby furniture and handbag companies, a large part of their customer base, lost jobs. 
 Laboring over foot-powered sewing machines made in the 1960s, the brothers fretted in the winter as workers left for unpaid vacations. But after Chinese New Year in January, the workers started trickling back. ''Maybe 80 percent of the workers came back,'' said Wu Guo Cai, 46.
 Business is still off nearly 20 percent because of workers who did not return, but those who have come back are spending money.
 ''We expect manufacturing activity will continue to expand in the coming months, supported by the roll-out of the government's stimulus,'' said Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairman of China equities at JPMorgan Chase.
 Outside of China, emerging markets in East Asia are also showing signs of recovering from a steep slowdown in manufactured exports. The Taiwanese economy, for instance, shrank 10.2 percent in the first quarter compared with the period a year ago, but closer relations with mainland China have improved investors' confidence. 
 Central banks across the region are maintaining low interest rates, and some, like in the Philippines, are still cutting rates to offset weak exports.
 Indonesia has been insulated from the global downturn by its large domestic market and limited reliance on exports, and is benefiting from improving overseas demand for its natural resources. 
 In Brazil, which has been hurt by the steep drop in commodity prices, industrial production has risen every month since January, though it remains much lower than the corresponding periods last year. The government is predicting that the economy will grow 1 percent this year, down from a previous projection of 3.5 percent. Many independent analysts say Brazil will be lucky to avoid a contraction.
 Nonetheless, the Brazilian stock market has risen smartly as investors regain confidence.
 ''We never thought it would get back to this level so quickly,'' said Alessandra Ribeiro, an economist at Tendencias, a consulting group. ''When there was panic, investors fled to the U.S. to buy Treasury bonds and now they are diversifying again. Brazil is clearly one of those that have been chosen.''

PERSON: Jackie Burke 

HEADLINE: Still Giving Lessons at Age 86

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Ohio 

 BODY:
Between the lines on Jackie Burke's weathered face were 86 years of golf lessons, given and taken. And while he was at Muirfield Village Golf Club this week to become a Memorial Tournament honoree alongside the 50 already in the pantheon of greats at Jack Nicklaus's tournament, he gave another lesson.
 Cleareyed and cogent, Burke spoke in his gravelly voice on the eve of the tournament about the future of golf, the failure of businesses and other topics ranging from the price of a round (too high), prize money (too much) to the number of children playing (too few). 
 Showing no ill effects from a stroke he sustained last fall, Burke, a Texan, fired his opening shot at the overbuilding of golf, which he believes has led to a glut of courses, many of them failing.
 ''Well, the game of golf is carrying a big load right now,'' he said. ''It's carrying fitness centers and dining rooms and tennis courts and swimming pools. I think the game has a problem just supporting itself.''
 Burke, who won 17 professional events, including the 1956 Masters and the P.G.A Championship, before retiring at the age of 33 to return to teaching, learned the game in the caddie yards at River Oaks in Houston, where his father, Jack Burke Sr., was the first golf pro in Texas. Fifty years ago, he and Jimmy Demaret founded Champions Golf Club in Houston, where Burke still teaches.
 Never shy about expressing himself, Burke once hollered at Nicklaus at a United States Open putting green when he noticed Nicklaus was not gripping his putter the way Burke had taught him.
 When he recalled the incident on Wednesday, Nicklaus broke up laughing and said: ''I hadn't seen the guy for two or three years and he walks up yelling, 'Nicklaus, what the heck are you doing putting like that? What do you mean putting with your left hand like that? Get your right hand on the putter facing the line and roll it!' And I've only won 10 majors by then and he's giving me this.
 ''But that's Jack Burke. Never without an opinion and one of my all-time favorite guys.''
 For current context, think of a good PGA Tour player shouting at Tiger Woods to change his grip while Woods is practicing on the putting green at Bethpage State Park preparing for the United States Open there in two weeks.
 By shining the spotlight on golf treasures like Burke and JoAnne Carner, also inducted as a Memorial Tournament honoree this year, Nicklaus is helping expose younger players and fans to the golfers who made the game what it is and to help ensure the continued relevance of traditions that are often overlooked. Hal Sutton, who picked Burke to be his co-captain of the 2004 United States Ryder Cup team, said in an interview published in the Memorial Tournament program: ''Jackie has put the principles of the game of golf to the rules of the game of life better than anyone. He's lived it and you're living it, but when he says it in his parables, you understand it.''
 Burke said he understood the first time his father told him, ''If you can't sit down at the dinner table and talk about what you did last night, you probably shouldn't ought to have done what you did last night.''
 On Tuesday, he applied a similar aphorism to the financial meltdown, saying: ''If the Rules of Golf were put on all the boardroom tables in the United States, including on Wall Street, there'd be fewer people go to jail. They've got white stakes out here on the golf course, and you're supposed to play between them, not outside of them. 
 ''Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Ben Hogan never went to jail.''
 Burke learned to play the game at 7, using only a 4-iron for every shot, including putts. Starting golf young, he said, is imperative, adding that clubs needed to start ''having the patter of little feet around the greens.''
 ''I'd like to see the clubs start getting in young players and not putting the price up so high that the young people cannot afford to play,'' Burke said. ''If you don't see kids at a country club, they're running a bad club.''
 As for PGA Tour purses, which this year will total almost $280 million, he said: ''Players today are interested in the economics of the game. They like what the game does for them more than they like the game. I just don't see a lot of them working at teaching it. I'd like to see more of them helping other people, rather than just themselves.''
 In Burke's view, if golf goes through the process of natural downsizing both at the public and private golf course level, bringing membership costs and green fees down, it will be a boon for participation and a positive for the game.
 ''I like to see kids out there and I like to see the pros out there teaching them,'' he said. ''But these clubs have the prices up there so high it has to change. Fitness centers and French chefs are just not the way to go.''

HEADLINE: An Open-Mike Event for Small-Business Ideas

BYLINE: By DON STEINBERG

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Monday is the slow night that comedy clubs traditionally reserve for amateur open-mike night, and that's not too far from what was happening on a recent Monday at the Helium Comedy Club here. 
 About 40 small-business owners, self-employed professionals, and individuals arrived by 7 p.m., mingled over chicken fingers, checked one another's name-card stickers and talked shop. Then Ami Kassar stepped to the microphone in a T-shirt and jeans and thanked everyone for coming.
''Being an entrepreneur, a small-business owner, it's kind of lonely sometimes,'' Mr. Kassar said. ''What bloblive is trying to do is to create a community. Tonight when you come up and share an idea, something just might trigger for you. Someone will give you feedback or offer you a connection that could help you take your idea to the whole next level.''
 Then he solicited a warm welcome for Steve from Philadelphia, passed the microphone, and the blobbing had begun. 
 Mr. Kassar is president of Ideablob Corporation, which has been holding weekly bloblive blob events in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., since March. The concept, as Mr. Kassar explained it, is a new kind of social network for entrepreneurs, helping to promote sharing and development of small-business ideas. In addition to the live events, the company runs ideablob.com, where visitors post business ideas in monthly contests.
 The posted idea that gets the most public votes wins $10,000. On stage and on the Web site, the ideas are called blobs -- a prospective buzzword intended to suggest that the ideas are like lumps of clay, potent but unstructured, ready to change into whatever shape will help them thrive. 
 It is a service to the small-business community with some growth potential. And right now the whole enterprise exists like a circus tent in a tornado. 
 Ideablob is owned by the Advanta Corporation, which spun off the unit in 2007 as a project of Mr. Kassar's innovation department. Yes, that Advanta: the big issuer of credit cards to small businesses, based outside Philadelphia in Spring House, Pa., that recently entered lockdown mode. 
 Last month, in the wake of a $76 million first-quarter loss, Advanta said it would suspend further lending to its cardholders, meaning that as many as a million account holders would need to find credit elsewhere. Last week, the planned credit freeze date of June 10 was moved to May 30.
 Although Advanta is still in business, collecting payments from existing customers, the company's future is in question. But for now, the blobs will carry on.
 ''We're plugging away,'' said Mr. Kassar, who landed at Advanta eight and a half years ago as a refugee from a failed start-up during the Internet bubble. Even Advanta's chief executive, Dennis J. Alter, is standing behind the blobs, for now.
 ''A logical question would be, 'With earnings and losses and delinquencies being what they are, how come you're doing this?' '' Mr. Alter said. ''Well, as I'm sure as you can tell, putting on one of these events is not very expensive. For about $1,000 an event, we're in a way branding Advanta as being valuable to the small-business owner or start-up. Six months from now, maybe we have bloblives in 30 cities around the country. Or maybe we don't.''
 Exactly why Advanta needs to brand itself for small businesses -- now that its future in serving them is in doubt -- is not entirely clear. Mr. Kassar said the company was keeping its options open. ''We may well be active in that market again. Anything is possible.'' The first live blob event is free, after that it costs $10 for a single event or $20 for all the events in a month. 
 Some of those who have shared their blobs on the Web site and on stage have come away feeling warmly about Advanta. Naomi Bar-Yam, executive director of the Mothers' Milk Bank of New England, said the $10,000 ideablob prize that her nonprofit group won in January 2008 went toward equipment and education. ''People don't even know what a milk bank is,'' she said. The group stores and distributes human milk, but just as important, ''it put our name out there,'' she said. ''We got some attention in places we might not have.''
 Matt Allison, then a student at Pennsylvania State University, won the $10,000 prize in May 2008 for a concept called BrioBody, a portable touch-screen device with personal training software that would link to a Web site and track an individual's fitness. His prize ''went straight into development of the Web site,'' he said, and he was able to raise an additional $25,000 in part because of the ''market validation of ideablob.'' (BrioBody, like a true blob, has changed; when it begins, it is will be just a Web site, a sort of Facebook for fitness.)
 The bloblive events are free-form and social and occasionally silly. There are no cash prizes, just feedback. Viable business ideas share the night with individuals grasping for what they might do next and how to start. 
 ''You hear a lot of 'How do I...?' '' said Jeffrey Donnon, a finance manager at a Philadelphia venture capital firm, First Round Capital, who has attended several of the events. 
 Like stand-up comedy shows, some people taking the stage are natural performers and some have terrific material -- but one does not guarantee the other. When Mike Klusek described PhillyGoesSolar.com at the Helium club, he was holding the microphone too low, looking down to read a prepared statement. His idea was a Web site where consumers can share experiences installing solar power products: Web 2.0 meets Energy 2.0.
 But it was merely a concept. Mr. Klusek was offering equity in exchange for help from a Web designer. Live video of the event was captured and streamed on the Web, and online viewers commented through a Twitter feed that was projected on a wall. Someone on Twitter suggested that Mr. Klusek look into the Web site elance.com to hire a freelancer.
 Part of the dynamic of the live event -- how it transcends a simple business-card swap -- is that each blob presentation becomes something of a puzzle for audience members to solve, challenging them to add expertise. When Jeff Greene presented a plan to help cities generate revenue by leasing library space to businesses after hours, the room went silent as the audience digested the idea. 
 ''People are thinking. Their brains are ticking,'' Mr. Kassar said. Someone suggested creating a database to match available spaces with groups that might need them.
 Next up was Jason Wisdom, whose idea was to print reference books on toilet paper. The crowd groaned. Someone suggested a gag name for the product. Mr. Kassar said, ''Are we at a comedy club or an ideas night?''
 The bloblive events continue this week in Santa Monica, and next week in Philadelphia. The company is about to announce the $10,000 winner for May's online contest. It was suggested to Mr. Kassar that, during its next live event at a comedy club, the company could take suggestions for how ideablob might continue to thrive despite Advanta's struggles.
 Appropriately, he laughed.

PERSON: Thomas Berry 

HEADLINE: Thomas Berry, Writer and Lecturer With a Mission for Mankind, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Thomas Berry, a Roman Catholic priest who called himself a ''geologian'' and whose influential writings were an early call to humanity to save nature in order to save itself, died in his birthplace, Greensboro, N.C., on Monday. He was 94. 
 His death was announced by his foundation on its Web site, www.thomasberry.org. 
 Dr. Berry's books and lectures inspired a devoted lineage of academicians and environmentalists to explore the interface of religion, human nature and ecology. Although he had a wide-ranging love of religious traditions, he preferred not to be referred to as a priest, said Mary Evelyn Tucker, the co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology and Dr. Berry's longtime editor.
 Dr. Berry left the monastic life for decades of study of global cultural and religious history and then, beginning in the 1980s, wrote a string of books relating cultural and spiritual evolution to the natural history of the planet and the universe.
 ''Thomas Berry was the earliest and most important voice to describe the profound importance of the disconnection between humans and the natural world, and what that could mean for the future of our species,'' Richard Louv, an educator and author of ''Last Child in the Woods,'' said Wednesday in an e-mail message. 
 Dr. Berry believed that humanity, after generations spent glorying in itself and despoiling the world, was poised to embrace its role as a vital part of the larger, interdependent ''communion of subjects'' in the cosmos. The result, he wrote, would be a new era, which he called the Ecozoic, following 65 million years of the Cenozoic era.
 In this new era, he hoped for concrete changes like population control (he criticized the Catholic Church for not doing more in this regard) and respecting and preserving the habitats of all living things as a fundamental right. 
 As Dr. Berry explained in a 2006 interview with the filmmaker Caroline Webb, ''From here on, the primary judgment of all human institutions, professions, programs and activities will be determined by the extent to which they inhibit, ignore or foster a mutually enhancing human-Earth relationship.'' 
 He said the transformation of humanity's priorities would not come easily. It would require what he called ''the great work'' -- the title of one of his most popular books -- in four realms of endeavor: the political and legal order; the economic and industrial world; education; and religion. 
 Colleagues and admirers say he left an imprint on fields ranging from childhood education to green architecture, not only through his writing but also through his persona.
 ''To spend time with him was like getting a soul transfusion,'' said Mr. Louv, chairman of the Children and Nature Network, a nonprofit group whose goal is reconnecting children with nature.
 William Nathan Berry, named for his father, was born on Nov. 9, 1914, in Greensboro, the third of 13 children. He often alluded to how his focus on the spiritual power of nature grew out of ''numinous'' experiences exploring woods and fields as a child, particularly his stumbling upon a lily-dotted meadow when he was about 11. 
 He later recalled the insight that shaped a lifetime of thinking: ''Whatever preserves and enhances this meadow in the natural cycles of its transformation is good; what is opposed to this meadow or negates it is not good.''
 When he was 20, he sought to remove himself from a world he recalled as ''crassly commercial'' in a 2001 profile in The National Catholic Reporter, and entered a monastery of the Passionist Order of the Catholic Church, taking the name Thomas. He was ordained in 1942, but pursued the life of a scholar, receiving a doctorate from the Catholic University of America with a dissertation on the philosophy of history.
 He traveled to China in 1948 to teach at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing but, with the rise of Mao Zedong, returned to the United States a year later. He studied Chinese language and culture at Seton Hall University and Sanskrit and South Asian culture at Columbia, then served as a United States Army chaplain in Germany from 1951 to 1954. 
 Dr. Berry returned to teaching, first at Seton Hall and St. John's University. From 1966 to 1979, he taught at Fordham University, where he started the doctoral program in the history of religions and where some of his students formed a devoted coterie, focused increasingly on religion and ecology. They remained involved with him for the rest of his life.
 He is revered by many academicians who spent time at the Riverdale Center for Religious Research in the Bronx, which he founded in 1970 and used as an intellectual base into the 1990s. He organized a series of popular international conferences on provocative themes like ''Energy: Its Cosmic-Human Dimensions.''
 He wrote two books on Asian religion, ''Buddhism'' in 1966 and ''Religions of India'' in 1971. But he is best known for his later writing on the human place in the cosmos, beginning with ''The Dream of the Earth'' in 1988. 
 Other notable books are ''The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Em,'' which he wrote in 1992 with Brian Swimme, a mathematical cosmologist, and ''The Great Work: Our Way Into the Future,'' published in 1999.
 Dr. Berry is survived by a sister, Margaret, of Greensboro, and four brothers: Francis, Stephen and Thomas, all of Greensboro, and Benedict, of Charlotte, N.C.
 Two books of Dr. Berry's essays are scheduled for publication in August: ''The Sacred Universe'' and ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth,'' said Ms. Tucker, who edited both.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Are Taking Tentative Steps Toward Online Networking

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
BY choice or necessity, successful small-business owners are earnest networkers, gladly shaking hands, handing out cards and attending local meetings to find and keep customers, solve problems, seek feedback or support and bolster their bottom lines. 
 Now, the Internet is starting to upend those long-established methods; online networking on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and newer niche sites can be instantaneous and far-reaching. 
 The sites are efficient and free, which is especially important in an economic downturn, as owners scramble for new customers, said Rob King, vice president for strategic marketing at Sage North America, a unit of Sage P.L.C., a global supplier of business management software and services.
 Fast, free and efficient -- those attributes appealed to Brighter Planet, a socially responsible start-up based in Vermont, which built social networking into its DNA. 
 ''There's almost a grass-roots quality to it,'' said Patti Prairie, its chief executive. ''As a start-up, we can't afford to be buying ads anywhere. We have to use our outreach.''
 For more than a year, the Brighter Planet team has been blogging, Tweeting, friending on Facebook and initiating viral marketing campaigns intended to help consumers reduce their carbon footprints. 
 While most small businesses have not yet embraced social networks as Brighter Planet has, their numbers are growing. According to the April index of Discover Small Business Watch, compiled by Discover Financial Services, 38 percent of owners were a member of an online social networking community, up from 22 percent in October 2007.
 Charles H. Matthews, president of the International Council for Small Business, said the key was to view the sites as tools, not toys. ''It can certainly help enhance the process of identifying customers, especially in niche markets.''
 For Brighter Planet, the niche is the environment. Before Earth Day, for example, it sponsored Earthtweet, an Earth Day Tweet-a-Thon, which has generated 4,200 conservation Tweets and 2,500 followers. 
 Soon, BrighterPlanet.com will feature a portable social Web application that will allow visitors to calculate the status of their carbon footprints and share what they are doing on conservation on other social platforms like Facebook.
 Friends, family and colleagues can immediately see how saving the environment is important to BrighterPlanet members, Ms. Prairie said. ''That's what we find is the beauty of social networking, particularly for environmental-type causes.''
 A recent study for Sage North America found that 65 percent of small businesses that used social networking sites said that they felt more comfortable doing so this year than they did last year, and 51 percent said that they had acquired and retained customers because of it.
 More than 260,000 North American businesses currently use social networking to promote their businesses, Mr. King said. 
 In April, Sage, which has 2.9 million small and midsize business customers, introduced its own networking site, SageSpark .com. ''We know we're not the first to the game,'' Mr. King said. ''Our twist really is the community, tools and services.''
 Other niche sites have sprouted recently, like Shustir.com.
 Last week, Shustir.com introduced its virtual marketplace, which was started by two former Lehman Brothers colleagues, Shu Kim and Khanh Pham. ''It matters where you spend,'' Ms. Kim said, echoing the site's catchphrase. The goal, they said, is to keep Main Street U.S.A. alive.
 ''We want you to spend with small businesses,'' Ms. Pham said. ''By doing so, 80 percent of the money goes directly back to the community.''
 The site is arranged so owners can create virtual storefronts with photos, video, blogs and store information, and communicate with customers.
 ''Shustir gives consumers a one-stop destination,'' Ms. Kim said, where they can buy from trusted businesses, post about their favorite shops and make recommendations.
 Businesses can exchange advice, ideas and information, and network on a site that provides them search optimization.
 In its second phase, Shustir will add Facebook and Twitter badges so owners can use other social media to build business. There will also be a shared community calendar. ''The call to localism is existing across the country,'' Ms. Pham said, ''because small business is suffering.''
 PartnerUp has been around longer. It is a social networking site that helps entrepreneurs and small-businesses owners find partners or co-founders, network, ask for and offer up advice, find resources and create or join groups based on their interests. It was founded in 2005 and acquired by the Deluxe Corporation in 2008. 
 PartnerUp has more than 100,000 active members, and more than 300,000 unique business owners and entrepreneurs come to the site every month, according to Steve Nielsen, its president.
 ''We're at an inflection point now,'' Mr. Nielsen said, ''where social media sites that are specific to a purpose for a market are going mainstream, and they're not just for early adopters any more.''
 In late 2007, David Reinke joined PartnerUp for a specific purpose. He had quit corporate America to start a fashion rating Web site, StyleHop.com, but needed a partner well versed in technology. He posted a profile on PartnerUp, and a job description for a chief technology officer and said, ''Let's see what happens.''
 About a month later, Froilan Mendoza, who had 12 years experience building technology start-ups, contacted him and after a series of discussions, Mr. Mendoza quit his job to become chief technology officer of StyleHop.com. 
 Turning to PartnerUp, Mr. Reinke said, was consistent with how he uses online sites. ''I was looking for something specific. I go to the source where the experts are,'' Mr. Reinke said. PartnerUp also allowed for a quiet search and limited exposure, he added, so thousands of people would not know about his start-up.
 To be sure, the majority of smaller concerns have not caught the online wave. In its monthly index, Discover noted that 62 percent of businesses still do not have Web sites. 
 What's more, when asked which networking opportunities they used most, 46 percent of small-business owners identified traditional methods like conferences, trade shows, local in-person groups or chambers of commerce. Of the remaining respondents, 16 percent cited ''other'' networking opportunities, 8 percent cited online sites, 7 percent said e-mail messages and 22 percent said they were not sure.
 Mr. King of Sage North America estimates that small businesses have a 12-month window to figure out online social networking. ''I hate to say it, but if they don't, they'll get left in the dust,'' he said. ''It's here to stay.''

HEADLINE: City Contractor Is Charged With Wage Theft

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
The $19 million restoration of the Lion House at the Bronx Zoo; more than $4 million in foundation work for an addition to a Rikers Island jail; the newly renovated $63.5 million Nassau County courthouse.
 Adding in hundreds of millions of dollars in work on the city's subways, schools and hospitals, not to mention a downtown firehouse, provides a sense of the reach of M.A. Angeliades Inc., a construction contractor that has quietly thrived doing large public works projects in the New York City area over about 20 years. 
 But the company's run as a low-profile public works giant was in jeopardy on Wednesday as Manhattan prosecutors announced an indictment charging that the owner and two top officials stole $600,000 in unpaid wages and benefits from their workers. 
 The indictment, which also charges the company and three union officials, accuses M. A. Angeliades of failing to pay prevailing wages and benefits to employees who were working on rehabilitating 11 subway stations from January 2005 through December 2007, officials said.
 Although the charges were limited to the company's work on the 11 stations, covered by four contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who announced the indictments, suggested widespread crime. ''I think it's clear they stole a lot more,'' Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference to announce the charges. 
 A law enforcement official said later that the investigation was continuing, focusing on a broad range of the company's projects.
 The indictment charges the owner of the company, Merkourios Angeliades, 67; its executive vice president, Dimitri Malakidis, 56; and its vice president, Irena Angeliades, 35, with crimes including grand larceny, bribing a labor official, offering a false instrument for filing and falsifying business records.
 After an arraignment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the company and Mr. Angeliades, who is known as Michael, released a statement saying they intended to fight the charges. 
 The statement by the lawyers, Josh Dratel and Barry Bohrer, cited Mr. Angeliades's accomplishments, his role in the community and ''extensive and generous civic and religious philanthropic activities.'' It said that Mr. Angeliades and his company had provided work for hundreds of people. The case, it said, ''unnecessarily jeopardizes the future of a well-respected construction firm'' and threatens to put hundreds of people out of work.
 But the thrust of the charges is that Mr. Angeliades and the others went to great lengths to avoid paying union wages and benefits for overtime and weekend work to the company's employees, instead paying them $20 an hour, and keeping the additional $40 to $55 an hour that the company was required to pay into union benefit funds, prosecutors said.
 By failing to pay prevailing wages and benefits, as the law requires on public contracts, companies reap significant savings that allow them to underbid their competition and make substantially larger profits.
 Over the past decade, the company has done $432 million worth of work for the M.T.A., $236 million for the School Construction Authority and tens of millions of dollars' worth of work for the city and other public agencies.
 After the company came under scrutiny, the city and several other agencies warned their contracting officers away from M. A. Angeliades, but it is still doing millions of dollars' worth of work for the transportation authority, the School Construction Authority and the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation.
 The three labor officials charged in the case, shop stewards for Laborers Local 731, were accused of failing to file their shop steward reports. The men, Anthony Graham, 47, Harold Johnson, 46, and Eduardo Visone, 32, were indicted on several counts of falsifying business records. Mr. Graham was also charged with taking bribes.

HEADLINE: Reading Minds, Healing Millionaires

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
As soon as the glamour-puss fiancee announces, post-coitus, that it has been her lifelong ambition to marry a doctor (''Everything seems to be falling into place for me''), you know that the kindly emergency-room physician lying next to her won't be ensconced under the sheets for very long. Within a few minutes Dr. Hank Lawson -- Mark Feuerstein, on the health-care escapade ''Royal Pains,'' beginning Thursday on USA -- is fired from his New York City hospital, has sequestered himself in his Brooklyn loft with pizza boxes and a Netflix copy of ''Mask'' and finds himself totally alone. The girlfriend, who can't seem to locate the sex appeal in unemployment, has moved on, presumably to a salary man in radiology. 
 The suggestion that gold diggers aspire to trauma-care professionals earning in the low six figures is the first indication that ''Royal Pains'' exists in a bizarre never-never land that might flatter the American Medical Association's sense of itself but doesn't honor economic realities. Had the series stopped with Hank's descent into solitude and Eric Stoltz movies, it would have been an apt tale of distress for the downturn. Instead it uses his dismissal to immerse us in a world that feels a whole lot like 2005. ''Royal Pains'' isn't an adventure in time travel, yet it might as well be, given how little its interpretation of current circumstance bears any resemblance to the one we are experiencing. 
 The show is set in some fantastical version of the here and now, in which, say, Hamptons real estate is still a seller's market, catering remains a thriving business, and people continue to read ''Bergdorf Blondes.'' What ultimately shocks Hank out of his inertia is his brother's insistence that they spend Memorial Day weekend on the eastern end of Long Island, where a party is being given by a German aristocrat living in a house that could be mistaken for a Magic Kingdom hotel, armed with security guards hired from the Mossad. 
 At first Hank is reluctant to make the trip, but his brother, Evan (Paulo Costanzo), an accountant who is all pushiness and schmaltz, persuades him. ''The guy's flying in ice from Antarctica just for the cocktails,'' Evan explains. ''The sushi rolls are going to be filled with southern bluefin tuna and, like, diamond chunks.'' 
 As Hank quickly confirms, the sort of woman who goes to a party like this is the sort of woman who says things like: ''What kind of plane do you have? And please tell me it's yours, I'm so over fractional ownership.'' The sound you hear is the sound of brokers still making buy calls on A.I.G. 
 The guys shack up at an oceanfront motel appointed in midcentury nautical style. Though it would surely cost a trendy fortune even today, here it is passed off as a low-rent joint populated by nobodies, the telling sign of which is the quality of female flesh poolside: everyone's got legs the width of fire hydrants. Elsewhere the limbs are lean and the dresses are skimpy.
 Hank's turnaround begins when he saves the life of one particular beauty and finds he has been pegged as a potential concierge doctor, the kind of M.D. who holes up in your guesthouse, on call for emergencies involving the consumption of bad shellfish and the post-traumatic stress of plastic surgery.
 ''Royal Pains'' is a whole new kind of reversal-of-fortune drama, one in which a life of good works and estimable intentions is replaced by a life of Champagne wishes and caviar dreams. Hank loses his job because a wealthy hospital patron has died unexpectedly, through no fault of Hank's, while he is busy saving the life of a teenager in greater need and of lesser means. 
 The series may want to say something about the inequities of the medical care system or it may just want an excuse to produce panning shots of the velvet lawns and iron gates of Gin Lane. It seems safer to bet on the second and to remain grateful for the ''House'' reruns that are shown more or less continually on USA. 
 Unfortunately the unconventional medical drama is also under assault on network television. Exhibit B is ''The Listener,'' which begins Thursday on NBC, a co-production with the Canadian network CTV that is a ponderous exercise in the paranormal. Yes, here the science fiction is intentional, but ''The Listener'' is plagued by the same gloomy lack of urgency that afflicts ''Flashpoint,'' the S.W.A.T.-team series also with a CTV lineage, on CBS. What's happening to Canadian television?
 At the center of the new series is a wide-eyed paramedic named Toby Logan (Craig Olejnik), who can hear what other people are thinking. You would think that this would come in handy working for the E.M.S., but Toby uses his gift-curse more readily to play detective and trespass all over the territory of the local police department than to learn what sort of an ailment a patient might be suffering from but unable to verbalize. 
 Toby has a sidekick who only wants to talk about dating and an ex-girlfriend in a lab coat who doesn't want to date him, which is all too plausible given that Toby doesn't seem like a hey-let's-take-off-in-my-convertible kind of guy. 
 At the very least ''Royal Pains'' announces itself as a summer series. Alternatively, ''The Listener'' feels like late-night cable for an insomniac in January. The chill just isn't worth it.

HEADLINE: In Greenwich, Big Discounts On Big Homes

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
 Even in tough times, some things never change. So workmen were busy on Wednesday unloading a Gatsbyesque armada of vintage cars for this weekend's Greenwich Concours d'Elegance, a show of classic yachts and automobiles from makers like Rolls-Royce, Pierce-Arrow, Lagonda and Cord.
 But, alas, in tough times some things do change. So just as harried home sellers elsewhere are deciding to drop prices in the face of the real estate meltdown, some in Greenwich are, too. 
 The difference is that given stratospheric starting prices for houses the size of mega-malls the adjustments tend to be a little more drastic than that of your neighbor who dropped his asking price from $599,000 to $559,000. Instead, in Greenwich, we're no doubt seeing some of the biggest price drops in the history of residential real estate. 
 Take for instance the modest spread on Old Mill Road, billed as ''an Elizabethan-inspired Tudor manse of museum-quality details'' with pool, tennis court, greenhouse, stable and grazing sheep on 75-plus pastoral acres. 
 The owner, Mel Gibson -- that Mel Gibson -- might have preferred to sell in a better market, but with a messy divorce pending, this is the only one he's got. So the house, originally listed for $39.5 million, after two nearly $5 million whacks is now down to $29.75 million.
 Even in Greenwich a $10 million drop in the asking price of a house counts as real money. But the Gibson house is hardly alone. The champ here -- and maybe anywhere -- is the 40-acre, high-plateau estate on Round Hill Road that had been owned by Leona Helmsley. The 21,897-square-foot house went on the market a year ago for $125 million. The price got knocked down by $30 million in October and by another $20 million in March, which is a $50 million price cut in a year.
 Or take the silent colossus on Langhorne Lane, 26,386 square feet with 35-foot indoor lap pool, squash/basketball court, 20,000-bottle wine cellar, tasting room and the rest. It was offered at $28 million and sold for $13.75 million but has never been completed or occupied.
 According to Christopher Fountain, a local real estate agent whose skeptical industry blog, For What It's Worth (christopherfountain.wordpress.com), has made him seriously unpopular locally, there are now 174 houses with asking prices of $4.9 million or higher on the Greenwich market. Of those, 55 are new houses built on speculation. In all, 16 went to contract this year, 9 of them new.
 Over the same period in 2007, 50 went to contract, including 21 spec houses.
 BY contrast, the busiest part of the market is one that barely existed two years ago: houses for under a million dollars.
 The optimistic case is that most sellers are hanging in there, plenty of houses are selling near the asking price and things will bounce back as they always have. 
 ''We've become extremely busy lately, wildly busy,'' said David Ogilvy, whose firm lists many of the top-dollar houses, like the Helmsley estate. ''We're not as productive as we'd like to be, but you can look and see the same thing has happened before. I think we're at the bottom now. We may bump around for a while, but I think we'll be up between now and the end of the year.''
 The pessimistic case is that it's hard to figure out who can afford the empty castles of Greenwich.
 ''We used to know who would buy those houses -- it's hedge fund kings or someone from Lehman Brothers or old money,'' said Frank Farricker, a real estate agent and the secretary of the Planning and Zoning Commission. ''Nobody knows who that guy is now.''
 Greenwich isn't your typical town, and there are sadder stories than people stuck with too-big houses in Greenwich, though many builders and others will be wrecked if those big houses sit empty for too long. But the situation is a reminder that this recession, unlike other recent ones, is pummeling the rich as well as the poor and that all of us, in Greenwich or more modest burgs, are in the same boat, with a much better sense of how the world looked a year ago than how it will look next year.
 Still, whether a recovery takes 2 years or 10, whether some of those hulking McMansions with the cavernous wine cellars get knocked down before they get sold, Mr. Farricker figures in the end one thing will endure.
 ''People have been building houses of ridiculous size in Greenwich since the turn of the century,'' he said. ''I don't expect that's going to change.''

HEADLINE: Regulator to Detail Plan for Derivatives

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will ask Congress on Thursday to impose substantial new costs and restrictions on large banks and other financial institutions that deal in the complex and largely unregulated financial instruments known as derivatives.
 Gary G. Gensler, the top regulator for futures trading, will provide significant new details of a plan announced three weeks ago by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. Mr. Gensler will disclose his proposal before the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the commission. 
 Lawmakers said they had been told that Mr. Gensler would propose two sets of regulations -- one set for the individual dealers of derivatives and a second set for the marketplaces where the instruments are traded. 
 Mr. Gensler has said that taken together, the two sets of rules would largely eliminate the loopholes that critics said would have weakened the Treasury secretary's plan, although some expressed concern that the proposals still might not go far enough to fully address problems that contributed to the market collapse. 
 If adopted, Mr. Gensler's proposal would fundamentally alter the way that derivatives dealers do business by imposing requirements, for example, for capital reserves and collateral -- assets that would be forfeited in a default. The rules would impose significant new expenses on derivatives dealers, and could reduce their profitability.
 Mr. Geithner said his proposal recognized the significant role that unregulated derivatives, particularly credit-default swaps, played in the financial crisis. Such swaps, a form of insurance against the default of a bond, played a central role in the near collapse of the American International Group last year. Rather than limiting risk as they are supposed to do, the swaps wound up spreading the crisis globally. 
 The plan is expected to run into sharp resistance from the industry, which this week proposed its own set of voluntary rules as part of an effort to head off more aggressive legislation. Some lawmakers who applauded Mr. Geithner's plan said they intended to press Mr. Gensler to be more aggressive in policing the marketplace even before Congress completes work on the derivatives legislation.
 ''Gensler has to show that the C.F.T.C. will have teeth and we can implement some things right now,'' said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington. She said she had asked Mr. Gensler in recent days to revoke exemptions given to some oil futures traders through what are called no-action letters that she said could permit the manipulation of prices to consumers. 
 ''He laments that Wall Street will be pushing back on the plan proposed by the administration and him. I told him they could get a quick gold star by revoking the no-action letters,'' she said.
 Some longtime critics of the absence of regulation of the derivatives markets applauded Mr. Gensler's approach.
 ''I'm very enthusiastic about it,'' said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School who has been critical of the lack of regulation of the market and is a former director of trading and markets at the commodities futures commission. ''There has never been a proposal before to regulate the swaps dealers.'' 
 But Frank Partnoy, another longtime critic of the lack of derivatives regulation, said the administration's plan did not go far enough. ''Disclosure to regulators will not be particularly useful,'' said Mr. Partnoy, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who has written extensively about derivatives regulation. ''We've been through decades of watching regulators chase innovation and fall progressively further behind.''
 The proposal on swaps dealers would include antifraud and antimanipulation provisions as well as potential limits on market positions and holdings. It would apply regardless of whether a dealer issued standard derivatives or specially tailored ones to meet the needs of specific companies.
 One major criticism of the Geithner plan was that it would permit less regulation of some of the more complicated derivatives that are custom-written, rather than plain-vanilla instruments, and would open a loophole that would keep much of the market unsupervised and opaque.
 But Congressional officials said Mr. Gensler, in his testimony, would describe mechanisms to both supervise the marketplace of customized derivatives and impose standards that presume most derivatives are standard and subject to more rigorous oversight. For instance, any derivative accepted by a clearinghouse for settlement would be presumed to be a uniform derivative, not a customized one.

HEADLINE: RISING INTEREST ON NATIONS' DEBT MAY SAP GROWTH

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
As governments worldwide try to spend their way out of recession, many countries are finding themselves in the same situation as embattled consumers: paying higher interest rates on their rapidly expanding debt.
 Increased rates could translate into hundreds of billions of dollars more in government spending for countries like the United States, Britain and Germany.
 Even a single percentage point increase could cost the Treasury an additional $50 billion annually over a few years -- and, eventually, an additional $170 billion annually. 
 This could put unprecedented pressure on other government spending, including social programs and military spending, while also sapping economic growth by forcing up rates on debt held by companies, homeowners and consumers. 
 ''It will be more expensive for everybody,'' said Olivier J. Blanchard, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. ''As government borrowing in the world increases, interest rates will go up. We're already starting to see it.''
 Since the end of 2008, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has increased by one and a half percentage points, rising to 3.54 percent from 2 percent, the sharpest upward move in 15 years. Over the same period, the yield on German 10-year bonds has risen to 3.57 percent, from 2.93 percent. And British bond yields have increased to 3.78 percent, from 3.41 percent. 
 Concern over the long-term effect of greater debt prompted Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to say in testimony before Congress on Wednesday, ''Even as we take steps to address the recession and threats to financial stability, maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance.'' 
 For now, the cost of more debt is the price government is willing to pay to spend its way out of recession, hoping that a return to fiscal health will increase tax revenue and repay the debt. 
 But in the last three weeks, the pace of the increase in the 10-year Treasury note's yield has quickened, spurred by a Congressional Budget Office estimate that net government debt will rise to 65 percent of the gross domestic product at the end of fiscal 2010, from 41 percent at the end of fiscal 2008.
 In 2009 and 2010, Washington will sell more than $5 trillion in new debt, according to Citigroup. A decade from now, according to the Congressional Budget office, Washington's outstanding debt could equal 82 percent of G.D.P., or just over $17 trillion.
 Governments borrow money in part by getting investors to buy their bonds, which are essentially i.o.u.'s. To attract investors for all the new debt, governments will have to compete with stock and corporate bond markets for investors' money, hence the rising yields.
 Although interest rates remain low by historical standards, the recent spike in rates comes at a critical juncture, threatening to damp the positive effects of new stimulus spending by governments around the world. 
 Under President Obama's 2010 budget, total interest payments by the federal government could rise to $806 billion in 2019, from $170 billion this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Much of that projected increase is a result of higher government borrowing, but the forecast also assumes that the average 10-year note yield will increase to 4.7 percent. 
 Some of the increase in rates earlier this year actually stems from rising confidence in an economic recovery and growing tolerance for risk, as investors abandon government bonds for higher-yielding but riskier corporate bonds and stocks. 
 Now the threat posed by the rise in government debt is getting increasing attention from investors and traders. 
 ''It's a gigantic issue,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and the co-author of a forthcoming book, ''This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.'' ''It leaves us very vulnerable to a global rise in interest rates that might be substantially beyond our control.''
 Mr. Rogoff estimates that if the budget office's debt estimate proves correct, every one percentage point increase in rates could eventually cost Washington an added $170 billion a year. 
 The long-term situation is particularly perilous, because the added interest costs will worsen what have become record deficits as Washington has rushed to bail out industries and stimulate the economy. 
 A year ago, under old budget and policy assumptions and before the financial crisis escalated, the Congressional Budget Office projected that outstanding federal debt would hit $5.3 trillion in 10 years. 
 ''It's an exaggeration of course, but it's a little like what happened to the subprime borrowers,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''People are just assuming the funding will always be there.''
 These assumptions may not hold over time. Spending could be reduced, economic growth could be greater than predicted or interest rates could be affected by other factors. 
 In the meantime, Europe is also turning to the markets to replenish overstretched coffers. In 2009 and 2010, according to Citigroup, the 16-nation euro zone will sell nearly 1.6 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in new debt, while Britain plans to offer $:490 billion ($799 billion) in new debt. 
 Britain's debt sales might seem less alarming than the multitrillion-dollar offerings from the euro zone and the United States. But Mark D. Schofield, global head of interest rate strategy at Citigroup in London, said, ''It's a huge increase in percentage terms, and it dwarfs anything else.'' 
 Standard & Poor's caught some traders and investors off-guard last month when it warned that Britain's sovereign debt was in danger of losing its AAA rating, lowering the outlook to negative from stable. It was the first time since Standard & Poor's initiated coverage of British debt in 1978 that the country received a negative outlook.
 Britain's government debt now equals 55 percent of G.D.P., but Standard and Poor's estimates it could approach 100 percent by 2013. 
 ''It wasn't just a message for the U.K., but they were the easiest of the G-7 to target,'' said Mark Wall, chief euro-area economist at Deutsche Bank in London, referring to the seven largest industrial nations. ''The global financial markets took this as a message as much for the U.S. as the U.K.''
 While still worrisome, the short-term debt picture within the euro zone is better than that in either Britain or the United States, Mr. Schofield said. 
 Over the long term, however, he said that higher rates could compound Europe's larger problem of prolonged economic weakness and slow its recovery from the current recession.
 Even regions that are unlikely to issue substantial amounts of new debt -- like South America and Eastern Europe -- will be affected by rising rates as they refinance their existing debt. 
 Asian economies have the least to fear from the prospect of increased rates. ''Asia is in much better shape with lower levels of debt and they can afford larger deficits without the market penalizing them,'' Mr. Blanchard of the I.M.F. said. ''China, for example, is in a very strong position to pay for its stimulus.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: DIGGING DEEPER: Governments around the world are projected to take on much more debt than usual in 2009 and 2010. Britain is issuing more than four times as much debt in 2009 as it did in 2005. (Source: Citigroup) (pg.A4)

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rose in April but Less Than Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The government reported on Wednesday that factory orders rebounded a bit in April, while an index on the service sector shrank again in May.
 The Commerce Department said that new orders received by factories rose 0.7 percent, but it also sharply revised downward the figure from the previous month. The March decline was revised to 1.9 percent, from 0.9 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected factory orders to rise 0.9 percent in April. 
Excluding transportation items, factory orders inched up 0.1 percent in April from March's 2.1 percent plunge. This was the second increase in the last nine months, the department said.
 Orders for costly durable goods -- items like cars and refrigerators intended to last three years or more -- were slightly revised downward to show an increase of 1.7 percent in April instead of the 1.9 percent rise previously reported. That followed a 2.2 percent decline in March.
 Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a measure of business confidence, fell 2.4 percent in April.
 In the report on services, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index edged up to 44.0 in May from 43.7 in April. 
 Economists' median forecast in a Reuters poll called for a reading of 45.0, below the 50 mark which divides expansion from contraction. The services sector represents about 80 percent of economic activity, including businesses like banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. 
 Earlier, a report by a private employment service said that private employers in the United States shed 532,000 jobs in May, fewer than the 545,000 jobs lost in April.
 The April figure was revised higher from the decline of 491,000 that was originally reported.
 The median forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers, was for 520,000 private-sector jobs lost.
 The ADP job reading is seen as a predictor of the government's monthly payroll figure. The Labor Department will release its May employment report on Friday. According to last month's Labor Department report, the economy lost 539,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Plan to Help Banks Clear Their Books Is Halted

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation indefinitely postponed a central element of the Obama administration's bank rescue plan on Wednesday, acknowledging that it could not persuade enough banks to sell off their bad assets.
 In a move that confirmed the suspicions of many analysts, the agency called off plans to start a $1 billion pilot program this month that was intended to help banks clean up their balance sheets and eventually sell off hundreds of billions of dollars worth of troubled mortgages and other loans.
 Many banks have refused to sell their loans, in part because doing so would force them to mark down the value of those loans and book big losses. Even though the government was prepared to prop up prices by offering cheap financing to investors, the prices that banks were demanding have remained far higher than the prices that investors were willing to pay. 
 In a statement, the F.D.I.C. acknowledged that it had not been able to get banks interested in its so-called Legacy Loans Program. Scheduled to start later this month, the pilot program was aimed at selling off $1 billion in troubled home mortgages. 
 F.D.I.C. officials portrayed the change as a sign that banks were returning to health on their own.
 ''Banks have been able to raise capital without having to sell bad assets through the L.L.P., which reflects renewed investor confidence in our banking system,'' said Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. 
 But some analysts said the banks' reluctance to clean up their balance sheets meant they were merely postponing their day of reckoning. Indeed, some analysts said government policies had made it easier for banks to gloss over their bad loans.
 ''What's happened is that the government's programs have addressed the symptoms of the financial crisis, but not the cause,'' said Frederick Cannon, chief equity strategist at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which analyzes the industry. ''The patient feels better, but the underlying cause of the problem is still unaddressed.''
 The program was one part of the Treasury Department's broader Public Private Investment Program to get bad assets off the books of major banks.
 The other big component, which Treasury officials say is still being prepared, is aimed at having the government team up with private investors to buy mortgage-backed securities.
 No one knows exactly how many losses are buried in the troubled mortgages on banks' books, but some analysts estimate that the unrecognized losses total more than $1 trillion. Under accounting rules, banks do not have to write down the value of most mortgages unless they sell them or they fall delinquent. 
 Recent government policies have further reduced the pressure on banks to sell. The Federal Reserve's ''stress tests'' on the 19 biggest bank holding companies concluded that only one -- GMAC, the former financing arm of General Motors -- needed so much additional capital that it would have to turn to the government for a new cash bailout.
 In addition, financial regulators relaxed the so-called mark-to-market rules, making it easier for bank holding companies to refrain from writing down the value of assets for which there is no market. That change allowed many big banks to report higher profits, and thus higher capital, for the first quarter of this year.
 The Federal Reserve also is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into mortgage-backed securities, and into other kinds of consumer and business lending. Starting next month, the Fed plans to offer cheap financing for investors who want to buy ''legacy'' securities backed by mortgages on commercial real estate.
 Diane Casey-Landry, chief operating officer for the American Bankers Association, said the lack of interest in selling the assets stemmed from fears that Congress would impose restrictions on executive pay and other issues for banks and investors in the program. ''There's a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the program would operate,'' she said. ''What we would rather see is the market working.''

HEADLINE: As Deficits Mount, Fed Chief Calls for a Path to Fiscal Balance

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that the United States needed to develop a plan to restore fiscal balance, even as the government builds huge budget deficits as it tries to spend its way out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
 In remarks to the House Budget Committee, Mr. Bernanke said that the government must address the immediate problems of a crippling recession that has erased trillions of dollars in household wealth, hobbled investment portfolios and raised unemployment to its highest levels in a generation. Still, he said, the government needs to think about putting its fiscal house back in order. 
 ''Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth,'' he said.
 The deficit is expected to reach $1.8 trillion this year as the country spends feverishly on financial bailouts, a sweeping stimulus package, lending programs, rescues for the automobile industry and more. Those are the highest budget deficit projections as a share of gross domestic product since World War II.
 President Obama has vowed to reduce the budget gap by half by the end of 2012, a promise made even as tax revenue is falling and the administration is trying to cobble together an overhaul of the health care system. In addition, the country faces trillions more in Social Security and Medicare obligations as baby boomers retire.
 ''Even as we take steps to address the recession and threats to financial stability, maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 Lately, financial markets have started to quaver on worries about the government's spending plans and how they are piling more obligations onto the country's $11 trillion national debt. 
 Investors in the bond markets, where the Treasury Department goes to raise money to keep the government running, are getting skeptical about the scale of Washington's spending. The yields on Treasury notes have risen to their highest points in five months as investors who once thronged to the safety of government debt begin to invest elsewhere.
 ''These increases appear to reflect concerns about large federal deficits but also other causes, including greater optimism about the economic outlook, a reversal of flight-to-quality flows and technical factors related to the hedging of mortgage holdings,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 But Mr. Bernanke made no mention of whether the Fed would increase its purchases of $300 billion worth of government securities. Such a move could help to push down interest rates on longer-term Treasury notes, but it could raise the prospects for inflation down the road.
 The movement away from Treasuries, which rose to record prices at the height of the credit crisis, is a good thing on some levels. It suggests that investors are becoming more confident in riskier investments like stocks and corporate bonds. 
 But rising interest rates on Treasury notes make it costlier for the government to raise money. And higher yields on government debt can also push up interest rates on mortgages and other loans, making borrowing more expensive for consumers and homeowners.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note sank to a record low of 2.06 percent in late December before bouncing back to as high as 3.74 percent recently. While that is still low by historical standards, the swift rise in yields has stirred fears they may continue to head higher as investors seek other perches.
 In his testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that some corners of the once-frozen financial markets were edging toward normal. Major banks deemed in need of additional capital are raising money by issuing billions in common stock and notes, and markets for short-term loans among banks are functioning more smoothly, Mr. Bernanke said.
 He noted that some financial institutions were weaning themselves off government-backed loan programs as they sought to pay back the money they took under the $700 billion financial bailout.
 ''It is encouraging that the private sector's reliance on the Fed's programs has declined as market stresses have eased, an outcome that was one of our key objectives when we designed our interventions,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke again cited numerous flickers of stability and growth in the economy, and said that the economy's swift declines were slowing. He predicted growth would resume later this year, but he discouraged any hopes of a swift recovery and said that the economy would probably heal slowly.
 ''We expect that the recovery will only gradually gain momentum and that economic slack will diminish slowly,'' he said. ''In particular, businesses are likely to be cautious about hiring, and the unemployment rate is likely to rise for a time, even after economic growth resumes.''

HEADLINE: Summit Fails to Reach Accord on Cuba

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras 

 BODY:
Thirty-four members of the Organization of American States gathered here Tuesday to argue over whether to readmit Cuba. By the end of the day, the United States had failed in an attempt to broker a deal that would have lifted the ban on Havana.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged from talks with the foreign ministers of nine North and South American countries after an unsuccessful struggle to hash out a compromise that would have granted Cuba membership, provided its regime accepted democratic principles. 
 ''There is no consensus, and there is no agreement to take any action,'' Mrs. Clinton said to reporters just before leaving Honduras to fly to Cairo for President Obama's speech to the Islamic world on Thursday.
 A few hours later, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., an assistant secretary of state, confirmed that the talks had broken off -- all but guaranteeing that the organization would not agree on how to treat Cuba.
 On one level, it seems a sterile debate: Cuba has said often and loudly that it does not want to rejoin the organization. But on a deeper level, the meeting has showcased Latin America's resurgent political left, which has seized on Cuba as an issue with which to press the United States.
 It has also dramatized the challenges that Mr. Obama will face as he seeks to engage old American foes, on his own timetable. While a few Latin American leaders praised Mr. Obama's overtures to Cuba, his cautious steps seemed only to redouble their calls to go farther and faster.
 One after another, the leaders stepped forward to demand that the 47-year-old suspension of Cuba's membership be lifted immediately. Several condemned it as a relic of the cold war.
 ''We cannot leave San Pedro Sula without correcting that other day that will live in infamy,'' said President Jose Manuel Zelaya of Honduras, referring to the organization's meeting in 1962 at which Cuba was banned.
 ''Our brothers and sisters in Cuba,'' Mr. Zelaya said, ''have been suffering for so long as a result of the blockade that has been imposed by one of the most powerful economies in the world.''
 Mrs. Clinton said the Obama administration wanted to turn the page with Cuba, too. But the United States has insisted that the Cuban government demonstrate it is ready to uphold the democratic principles enshrined in a 2001 charter adopted by the Organization of American States.
 The United States first proposed a resolution that would maintain the ban on Cuba, but would lay out a path for Havana to be reinstated. Nicaragua argued for lifting the suspension without conditions, while two other resolutions by Honduras and other countries sought to find a middle ground.
 American negotiators have since agreed to lift the suspension, but to make Cuba's participation contingent on its adherence to democratic principles. They would also require Cuba to petition for membership.
 ''We think we've succeeded in raising a lot of questions in the minds of O.A.S. members,'' Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, ''Since we don't agree with the bare-bones proposal, if there's no action, that's fine with us, because we think action has to be better thought out.''
 American officials did not rule out that Nicaragua and Venezuela might force a vote on readmitting Cuba without any conditions. And they might be able to round up a majority of members.
 That would be a stinging repudiation of the United States, which supplies 60 percent of the financing for the O.A.S., and of the Obama administration, which has made reaching out to Cuba one of its diplomatic hallmarks.
 Mrs. Clinton seemed tired but satisfied, she said, that the United States had moved the debate ''very dramatically.''
 Whatever the outcome, the debate over Cuba has provided a pretext for left-wing leaders -- both fresh faces and old stalwarts -- to take aim at the United States. Sometimes it was difficult to tell whether they were complaining about Cuba's exclusion or other old grievances against the United States.
 President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, a former guerrilla leader, described the Cuban ban as an act of American imperialism. And indeed Cuba today derides the organization as a tool of Washington.
 While Mr. Ortega said Mr. Obama had ''shown good will,'' he said the president was trapped by the policies of his predecessors. ''The O.A.S. continues to be an instrument of domination of the United States,'' he said. ''That's why this meeting took on a very deep meaning.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton made this trip to reach out to Latin America's new leaders. On Monday, she attended the presidential inauguration of a leftist leader in El Salvador, Mauricio Funes. Some analysts question why this debate had to play out at the Organization of American States, especially since it could have kept busy with issues like the economic crisis battering the region.

HEADLINE: Israelis Say Obama Is Ignoring Old Understandings on Settlement 'Freeze'

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Senior Israeli officials accused President Obama on Wednesday of failing to acknowledge what they called clear understandings with the Bush administration that allowed Israel to build West Bank settlement housing within certain guidelines while still publicly claiming to honor a settlement ''freeze.''
 The complaint was the latest in a growing rift between the Obama administration and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to move forward to achieve peace in the Middle East. Mr. Obama was in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and is scheduled to address the Muslim world from Cairo on Thursday. 
 The Israeli officials said that repeated discussions with Bush officials starting in late 2002 resulted in agreement that housing could be built within the boundaries of certain settlement blocks as long as no new land was expropriated, no special economic incentives were offered to move to settlements and no new settlements were built. 
 The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could discuss an issue of such controversy between the two governments. 
 When Israel signed on to the so-called road map for a two-state solution in 2003, with a provision that says its government ''freezes all settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements),'' the officials said, it did so after a detailed discussion with Bush administration officials that laid out those explicit exceptions.
 ''Not everything is written down,'' one of the officials said. 
 He and others said that Israel agreed to the road map and to move ahead with the removal of settlements and soldiers from Gaza in 2005 on the understanding that settlement growth could continue.
 But a former senior official in the Bush administration disagreed, calling the Israeli characterization ''an overstatement.''
 ''There was never an agreement to accept natural growth,'' the official said Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ''There was an effort to explore what natural growth would mean, but we weren't able to reach agreement on that.''
 The former official said that Bush administration officials had been working with their Israeli counterparts to clarify several issues, including natural growth, government subsidies to settlers, and the cessation of appropriation of Palestinian land. 
 The United States and Israel never reached an agreement, though, either public or private, the official said.
 A second senior Bush administration official, also speaking anonymously, said Wednesday: ''We talked about a settlement freeze with four elements. One was no new settlements, a second was no new confiscation of Palestinian land, one was no new subsidies and finally, no construction outside the settlements.''
 He described that fourth condition, which applied to natural growth, as similar to taking a string and tying it around a settlement, and prohibiting any construction outside that string.
 But, he added, ''We had a tentative agreement, but that was contingent on drawing up lines, and this is a process that never got done, therefore the settlement freeze was never formalized and never done.''
 A third former Bush administration official, Elliott Abrams, who was on the National Security Council staff, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post in April that seemed to endorse the Israeli argument. 
 The Israeli officials acknowledged that the new American administration had different ideas about the meaning of the term ''settlement freeze.'' Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said in the past week that the term means an end to all building, including natural growth.
 But the Israeli officials complained that Mr. Obama had not accepted that the previous understandings existed. Instead, they lamented, Israel now stood accused of having cheated and dissembled in its settlement activity whereas, in fact, it had largely lived within the guidelines to which both governments had agreed.
 On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel ''cannot freeze life in the settlements,'' calling the American demand ''unreasonable.''
 Dov Weissglas, who was a senior aide to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, wrote an opinion article that appeared Tuesday in Yediot Aharonot, a mass-selling newspaper, laying out the agreements that he said had been reached with officials in the Bush administration.
 He said that in May 2003 he and Mr. Sharon met with Mr. Abrams and Stephen J. Hadley of the National Security Council and came up with the definition of settlement freeze: ''no new communities were to be built; no Palestinian lands were to be appropriated for settlement purposes; building will not take place beyond the existing community outline; and no 'settlement encouraging' budgets were to be allocated.''
 He said that Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser at the time, signed off on that definition later that month and that the two governments also agreed to set up a joint committee to define more fully the meaning of ''existing community outline'' for established settlements. 
 In April 2004, President Bush presented Mr. Sharon with a letter stating, ''In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.''
 That letter, Mr. Weissglas said, was a result of his earlier negotiations with Bush administration officials acknowledging that certain settlement blocks would remain Israeli and open to continued growth.
 The Israeli officials said that no Bush administration official had ever publicly insisted that Israel was obliged to stop all building in the areas it captured in 1967. They said it was important to know that major oral understandings reached between an Israeli prime minister and an American president would not simply be tossed aside when a new administration came into the White House.
 Of course, Mr. Netanyahu has yet to endorse the two-state solution or even the road map agreed to by previous Israeli governments, which were not oral commitments, but actual signed and public agreements. 
 In his opinion article in The Washington Post, Mr. Abrams, the former Bush official who was part of negotiations with Israel, wrote: ''For the past five years, Israel's government has largely adhered to guidelines that were discussed with the United States but never formally adopted: that there would be no new settlements, no financial incentives for Israelis to move to settlements and no new construction except in already built-up areas. The clear purpose of the guidelines? To allow for settlement growth in ways that minimized the impact on Palestinians.''
 Mr. Abrams acknowledged that even within those guidelines, Israel had not fully complied. He wrote: ''There has been physical expansion in some places, and the Palestinian Authority is right to object to it. Israeli settlement expansion beyond the security fence, in areas Israel will ultimately evacuate, is a mistake.''

HEADLINE: Iran President and Challenger Clash in Heated Debate

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
A moderate politician who is considered the strongest challenger to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran accused him on live television on Wednesday of undermining the nation's interest by constantly questioning the Holocaust and by engaging in an adventurist foreign policy.
 The sharp attacks by the candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, came during a fierce 90-minute debate with Mr. Ahmadinejad that was broadcast throughout Iran. The two candidates clashed repeatedly during the one-on-one debate, with each accusing the other of radicalism and undercutting the country's interest. 
 Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister whose moderate views have won him support from other reformers in Iran, including former President Mohammad Khatami, has positioned himself as the strongest challenger to Mr. Ahmadinejad. Support from the Islamic authorities for the president, who is a religious conservative, appears to have weakened, and he is now widely criticized for Iran's economic malaise. 
 With the presidential election to be held June 12, Mr. Moussavi was on the offensive during the debate, which was broadcast by state-run television. At one point he accused Mr. Ahmadinejad of moving Iran toward ''dictatorship.'' At another, he said that the president's foreign policy suffered from ''adventurism, illusionism, exhibitionism, extremism and superficiality.''
 He also took issue with Mr. Ahmadinejad's constant questioning of the Holocaust, saying that it harmed the country's standing with the rest of the world and undermined its dignity. ''For the past four years you kept saying that the United States is collapsing,'' Mr. Moussavi said. ''You have said Israel is collapsing. France is collapsing.''
 He added, ''Your foreign policies have been based on such illusional perceptions.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, who opened the debate, presented himself as a lonely incumbent who was being challenged by a powerful circle of leaders eager to bring him down. He said that two former presidents, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, were supporting Mr. Moussavi to end his tenure.
 He accused Mr. Rafsanjani, an influential cleric, and Mr. Rafsanjani's sons of corruption and said they were financing Mr. Moussavi's campaign. Mr. Ahmadinejad also cited a long list of officials whom he accused of unspecified corrupt acts, including plundering billions of dollars of the country's wealth. 
 ''These three were together from the beginning, Moussavi, Khatami and Hashemi,'' the president said. ''They cooperated together against me.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad contended that the early founders of the Iranian revolution, including Mr. Moussavi, had gradually moved away from the values of the revolution's early days and had become ''a force that considered itself as the owner of the country.''
 He suggested that some leaders had indulged in an inappropriately lavish lifestyle, naming, among others, a former speaker of Parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, who has opposed some of Mr. Ahmadinejad's policies. Mr. Nouri, a conservative, ran unsuccessfully for president in 1997. Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks seemed to suggest a deepening divide between the president and a number of influential leaders, including some conservatives who belong to a faction that has supported Mr. Ahmadinejad. When Mr. Moussavi called Mr. Ahmadinejad's foreign policy radical and accused him of trying to stifle political dissent, Mr. Ahmadinejad smiled scornfully and brushed off the accusations. He argued, in response, that Mr. Moussavi's own government in the early days of the revolution had initiated much more radical policies. 
 The debate had been expected to concentrate on the economy, but it devolved into a series of personal attacks. At one point, Mr. Ahmadinejad pulled out a photo of Mr. Moussavi's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, and accused her of having entered a graduate program without taking the highly competitive entrance exam. 
 Near the end of the debate, Mr. Moussavi raised his hand and, in an angry tone of voice, tried to stop Mr. Ahmadinejad from interrupting him. It was at this point that he said the president was driving the country toward a dictatorship. 
 Because the state-run television has given presidential candidates limited time to broadcast campaign videos, the debates could prove crucial. Analysts believe that in the 2004 election, Mr. Ahmadinejad won the support of many voters with a video in which he showed his modest home. The video was broadcast a few nights before the election.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad will debate other candidates in the next few days. He will appear Friday with Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of Parliament, and he will debate Mohsen Rezai, a former head of the Revolutionary Guards, on Monday. 
 Mr. Rezai and Mr. Karroubi, who have lagged in public opinion polls, engaged in the first of the presidential debates on Tuesday. They, too, criticized many of Mr. Ahmadinejad's policies, but they offered differing views on what they would do to mend the country's troubled economy. 
 There are no private television stations, and candidates have accused Mr. Ahmadinejad of using state-run television for his own political advantage. The head of the state television is appointed by the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on state matters.

HEADLINE: Politics and the Financial Crisis Slow the Drive to Privatize

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
It was hailed as a win-win for Main Street and Wall Street -- a way for states and cities, along with financiers, to make some money. 
 But now privatization, the selling of public airports, bridges, roads and the like to private investors, looks like a boom that wasn't. Deals are collapsing. Airy hopes of quick profits are vanishing. And what was celebrated as a new wave in finance is, for the moment, barely making a ripple. 
 What happened? The financial crisis, for starters. The easy money that Wall Street was counting on to finance its purchases has largely disappeared. Then the Obama administration unintentionally damped interest with its $787 billion economic stimulus package, a windfall that local governments are now racing to spend. 
 Bankers concede they got a bit ahead of themselves. When times were good, investment banks and private investment funds raised billions of dollars in hopes of buying infrastructure. But many state and local governments resisted selling because of money, politics or both. 
 Some deals turned out to be less lucrative than these would-be sellers had hoped. Government officials also began questioning whether taxpayers would be better off if infrastructure were in private hands. After Chicago sold its parking system to a private operator, for instance, drivers had to feed meters with as many as 28 quarters to park for two hours. 
 ''We will see a few transactions,'' said Fred Pollock, a vice president at Morgan Stanley Infrastructure, a private equity fund. ''But we know what we won't see -- a tidal wave of projects.'' 
 Some big names still want to enter this business, among them Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Such investors have raised about $180 billion for global infrastructure projects. Large funds have also been established in Australia, Britain and Bahrain, where such public-private partnerships are more common. More than 20 states enacted legislation in recent years to allow some form of private-sector investment that would help fill budget gaps and repair crumbling roads, bridges and even airports. 
 But now the deals are falling apart. In April, a much-anticipated $2.5 billion plan to privatize Midway Airport in Chicago collapsed after a group of investors was unable to obtain debt financing. The deal, which had been in the works for four years, was to have been the first in a Federal Aviation Administration project that would have allowed up to five major airports to move into private hands. 
 Midway was just the latest setback. The biggest was the failure last fall of the largest deal proposed to date -- a $12.8 billion lease of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to an investor group headed by Citigroup and a Spanish investment firm. Postmortems into that failed effort show that privatization advocates vastly underestimated the political opposition the deal would stir up in the Pennsylvania legislature. 
 Late last month plans to privatize ''Alligator Alley,'' a 78-mile stretch of Florida highway that connects Fort Lauderdale with Naples, collapsed when no bidders showed up. The failure has had a ripple effect -- in Mississippi, state officials have pushed back the bidding schedule for a new 12-mile toll road. 
 Then there is the $1.2 billion privatization of 36,000 parking meters in Chicago. In the five months since the deal took effect, widespread complaints about poor service and rising parking rates have created a political firestorm for the Chicago City Council. Public opposition was so strong that on Wednesday the council approved a delay in voting on any future asset sales.
 Chicago public officials have called the work of the private operator, Chicago Parking Meters L.L.C., ''simply unacceptable.'' For its part, the operator has apologized and announced it would delay price increases at the meters.
 Proponents of public-to-private asset sales point to the $1.8 billion lease of the 7.8-mile Chicago Skyway in 2004 and the $3.8 billion raised by Indiana through a 75-year lease of its toll road in 2006 as successful pioneering efforts. 
 In Indiana, the money went to pay for a 10-year highway infrastructure program, and Gov. Mitch Daniels was re-elected last year promoting the lease, despite bumper stickers that read ''Keep the Toll Road, Lease Mitch.'' 
 The stimulus money, as well as other infrastructure money promised by Congress, has provided temporary relief for cash-poor municipalities. But this situation will not last forever. 
 ''They still have expenses, and revenues will not keep up,'' Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said of state and local governments. ''Some states will have to look at asset sales and decide. Once we step back from this crisis mode, I think they will be looked at again.'' 
 If the market revives, the problems that scuttled recent deals may provide some lessons. In the case of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, politics clearly played a role in the deal's collapse. A study by the Pew Center on the States found that proponents of the deal had overpromised what the turnpike could fetch and had failed to make it clear where the money would go. 
 After indicating that the turnpike might be valued at as much as $26 billion, when the winning $12.8 billion bid came in lawmakers felt it looked too small. Even more, there was concern that the money would be squandered and that the state was putting a valuable asset into foreign hands, since the top bidder included a Spanish company. 
 ''It simply wasn't a sufficient bid by a long shot,'' said Joseph F. Markosek, a state legislator and head of the Pennsylvania House Transportation Committee. 
 Similar sentiments are coming into play in Florida, where few had expected Alligator Alley to be leased. ''I believe the private partnership is like fool's gold,'' said David Aronberg, a state senator in south Florida who has led the fight against privatization. ''It only looks good from afar.''

HEADLINE: Across Low and High Ends, Retail Sales Fell in May

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Most retailers, from high-end chains to discounters, posted disappointing May sales as shoppers cut their spending.
 While there have been early signs of stabilization, including improving consumer confidence, concerns over unemployment and the troubled housing market have led many Americans to adopt thriftier behavior, spending on food and other everyday essentials and not much else.
 Sales were weaker than expected at 19 of the 30 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters. Upscale chains posted some of the worst May sales at stores open at least a year. 
 ''The high end continues to struggle. Those in the discretionary spend segment are really continuing to get clocked,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
 Wal-Mart Stores, the biggest retailer and one of the best performers in the recession, no longer issues monthly sales figures. The spotlight now shines on smaller competitors like Costco and Target, which both missed expectations.
 ''We felt that the May results would signal that we're not yet out of this consumer doldrum that we've been in, and it's going to take some wind out of the sails'' of retail stocks, said Thomas Filandro, a senior consumer analyst at Susquehanna Financial.
 Shares of most retailers fell. The S.& P. Retail Index was down 2.5 percent after rising in recent days.
 According to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index, same-store sales fell 6.3 percent in May compared with May 2008. 
 For June, the International Council of Shopping Centers forecasts a decline of 3 to 4 percent in same-store sales, less than the 4.6 percent decline in May. Sales in June face a tougher comparison to last year as consumers then were spending much of the government stimulus checks, analysts said.
 The Costco Wholesale Corporation's same-store sales fell 7 percent, hurt by the stronger dollar and lower gasoline prices, which reduced its fuel sales. 
 Target and BJ's Wholesale also reported steeper-than-expected declines in sales, and their shares fell.
 Food was one of the best sellers at the wholesale clubs, while Target's strongest performance came from health care, household, personal and baby care items. Target's sales of clothing, especially women's apparel, were weak, and it expects same-store sales to decline about 5 percent in June.
 The TJX Companies, which has attracted new customers in the recession with its discounted merchandise, beat sales expectations and said it remained ''very comfortable'' with its second-quarter earnings forecast. Purchases of necessities increased sales at Walgreen and Rite Aid n drugstores, though the gains were smaller than anticipated. 
 The steepest declines came from Abercrombie & Fitch, whose same-store sales fell 28 percent, and Saks, which posted a 26.6 percent decline. Abercrombie's shares fell as much as 11.9 percent.
 Sales at Saks, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus fell, showing that luxury department stores continue to suffer. Declines at Macy's, the Kohl's Corporation and J. C. Penney were not as steep as expected.
 In the teenage category, increases of more than 10 percent at Aeropostale and Buckle surpassed forecasts. Still, their shares fell. American Eagle Outfitters posted slightly weaker-than-expected sales and stood by its second-quarter forecast.
 Gap reported a larger-than-expected 6 percent decline, as decreases at Gap and Banana Republic offset a gain at Old Navy that was driven by a one-day $1 sale on flip-flops.

HEADLINE: The Civic Value of a Bold Statement

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
We'll have to wait to find out exactly what the end of the Age of Excess means for architecture in New York. Yes, the glut of high-concept luxury towers was wearisome. But some great civic works were also commissioned in that era. And given the hard economic times, they may be the last we see for quite some time.
 The new academic building at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art is yet more proof that some great art was produced in those self-indulgent times. Designed by Thom Mayne of the Los Angeles firm Morphosis, it is not a perfect building, but it is the kind of serious work that we don't see enough of in New York: a bold architectural statement of genuine civic value. Its lively public spaces reaffirm that enlightenment comes from the free exchange of ideas, not just inward contemplation.
 Perhaps more important, the building seems to strike just the right tone for this time in New York's history. A wholly contemporary work, it has a bold, aggressive profile that says as much about the city we've lost as it does about the future we are building. It proves that a brash, rebellious attitude can be a legitimate form of civic pride. 
 The building occupies a contentious site at Cooper Square, between Sixth and Seventh Streets, in the East Village. The area has experienced a particularly painful process of gentrification in the past decade. First, generic glass boxes began popping up along the Bowery. Then CBGB closed. For me the final straw was the opening in 2005 of Gwathmey Siegel's undulating glass luxury apartment tower at Astor Place, a vulgar knockoff of Mies van der Rohe's unbuilt Glass Skyscraper project and a symbol of the era's me-first mentality.
 Mr. Mayne's building does not shy away from this debate by trying to fade into the background. Seen from the old Cooper Union Foundation building across the street, its big concave facade is enveloped in a glittering perforated metal screen, like armor, so that it's hard at first to get a grip on the building's scale. A big vertical slot is cut out of the facade's center, as if it had been ripped open.
 Yet the more you look at the building, the more it looks right at home in its surroundings. From certain angles the facade's concave form seems to exert a magnetic pull, as if it were trying to embrace the neighborhood in front of it. The curve of the corner, which lifts up to invite people inside the lobby, has an unexpected softness. Even the bulky exterior mirrors the proportions of the Foundation building -- a friendly nod to its older neighbor.
 The effect is tough and sexy at the same time. One of the most overlooked strengths of Mr. Mayne's designs is his feel for material. He is not a finicky designer; you don't look to his work for refined details. He tends instead to extract beauty from the crudest industrial materials: raw concrete, steel I-beams, metal screens. The connections between materials are always clearly expressed, never smoothed over, so that you can feel the memory of the workers' hands. It is what makes his buildings -- like the Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona, Calif. -- so approachable.
 This strategy is social as well as aesthetic. Here the big V-shaped columns that line the sidewalk not only support the building, but they also create small pockets of space where students can hang out along the street. Behind them the lobby is clad entirely in glass. Just inside, a narrow staircase runs along the base of the window down to a basement gallery and theater. Other views open down to the gallery from Seventh Street.
 The idea is to create a series of interlocking social spaces, many undefined, and to allow for the kind of casual encounter that is a central part of urban life. And it reflects Mr. Mayne's ambivalence over the Modernist obsession with transparency. To the Modernists transparency equaled truth. To Mr. Mayne's generation, which formed its ideas in the 1960s, it could also mean uniformity. Like other radical architects of his age, he is more interested in the dark, hidden corners where people can loiter, get into mischief, escape from authority.
 The social heart of the building is a vast internal staircase, which sweeps from the lobby all the way to the fourth floor. The staircase, 20 feet wide at its base, has a classical grandeur, as if the Met's front stairs had been pulled inside the building. The stair narrows as it rises, creating a forced perspective that exaggerates its length. A big window frames the top, allowing light to spill down into the lobby and drawing you up into the space.
 From the top people will filter around to each side and climb a smaller, asymmetrical spiral stair to the upper floors. When I first looked up through this space I immediately thought of the Baroque domes of Guarino Guarini, except that the complex order of Guarini's domes represents divine order. In Mayne's version that world has been set off balance, as if to allow for imperfections, and it is inhabited by students.
 The building's flaws, though, lie not in a failure of vision but in questions about its execution. The most serious of these have to do with circulation. I expect there will be complaints, for example, about the main elevators, which only go up to the fifth and eighth floors. The system is based on a design by Le Corbusier, who used it in his 1952 Unite d'Habitation housing block in Marseilles. Since it eliminated the need for corridors on every other floor, he could create big, floor-through duplex apartments with windows on both sides. But here it doesn't make much sense, because the building is made up of standard, single-story offices and classrooms. Most students will have to walk an extra flight up or down to get to their classes.
 Another subtle but important problem is the depth of the treads on the grand staircase. The stairs in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art are 14 inches deep, which is what makes them such a nice place to sit, rest, chat with a stranger. Mr. Mayne's stairs are a standard 11 inches, like a conventional fire stairwell. They are hard to sit on, and they gave me vertigo when I began my descent from the third floor. Does this sound picky? Not in a design that is all about the informal use of public space. It is the difference between a very good building and a great one.
 Still, Mr. Mayne has created a serious work of architecture. And when we look back on this era, the new academic building will stand out with a handful of other designs -- the New Museum, perhaps, and the renovation of Alice Tully Hall -- as projects that we, as a city, can feel proud of. They leave you with the comforting thought that even in egotistical times, a spirit of generosity can assert itself.

HEADLINE: Downsized W.N.B.A. Will Make Do With Less

BYLINE: By CHRIS HINE

 BODY:
The W.N.B.A., which has undergone radical changes in the past six months, can only hope that entering its 13th season with 13 teams will not bring bad luck.
 The Houston Comets, who won the first four league titles, were disbanded in December. The W.N.B.A. dispersed the roster after taking over the franchise from Hilton Koch because he could not sell it. The league also reduced the number of active roster spots on the remaining teams to 11 from 13. 
 ''I think as we'd keep talking about the economy and trying to figure out how, from a budget standpoint, to move forward, it was just something the union and the W.N.B.A. agreed on,'' Indiana Fever forward Tamika Catchings said of the roster reduction in a conference call last week. ''That's not to say it is what it is, but we want to stay around for a while. 
 ''We don't want to, from a money standpoint and from a budget standpoint, stay at 13 and then down the road look and say we wished we would have went down. So now we have that opportunity and it's going to make the league stronger and each team is going to get better and better.''
 In all, 39 active roster spots were eliminated, a decrease of about 21 percent from last year.
 ''Every sports league now is about survival,'' Detroit Shock Coach Bill Laimbeer said. ''Every sports league is working a little extra harder to put revenue into their teams and sports, and we're no exception. We're going to have to continue to be diligent and work extremely hard.''
 Not only are the Comets gone from the league, but so is a key component to their title run, guard Sheryl Swoopes. She spent her career with the Comets before signing with the Seattle Storm in 2008. The Storm waived her in January, citing the need to clear salary-cap space. She did not sign with another team. 
 Swoopes was a league cornerstone, along with Los Angeles Sparks center Lisa Leslie, who announced that this season would be her last. If the league's general managers are right in voting for the Sparks as the preseason favorites, she will finish with her third championship. Leslie has been with the Sparks her entire career.
 ''It's a great thing for her,'' Sparks Coach Michael Cooper said. ''Not every player wants to retire, but to go out like she's going out is magnificent.''
 Leslie is surrounded by some of the W.N.B.A.'s most talented players, including Tina Thompson and Candace Parker. Thompson, who has played in the league since Day 1, averaged 18.1 points last season. She found a home with the Sparks after 12 seasons with Houston. Parker was named most valuable player as a rookie last season, but she will probably not join the team until late June after giving birth to her first child, a girl, on May 13. 
 The Sparks open the season on Saturday against the defending champion Shock. Last year they played a memorable game in which they engaged in a brawl. 
 Detroit is the general managers' pick to take the Eastern Conference, ahead of Indiana and the Liberty. After the Liberty finished 11-23 in 2006, its worst season, Coach Pat Coyle devised a four-year plan to win a title. 
 But going into Year 3, the Liberty may be ahead of schedule. Most of the talent returns from last season, when the Liberty lost in the Eastern Conference finals to the Shock. Shameka Christon, a forward in her sixth year, led the team with a 15.7-point scoring average last season. The fifth-year center Janel McCarville set career highs in points, rebounds, steals and assists last season.
 The Liberty, like every team, will make do with less. But players and coaches say they do not expect the league's quality of play to suffer.
 ''I've been here a long time, and every year the league gets bigger, faster and stronger,'' Laimbeer said. ''The depth right now is bursting at the team level. It's very, very difficult for a player to make a roster right now.
 ''With the last dispersal and the great players that come into the league every year, it's tough. Every team can win now on any given night, and every team thinks they have a chance to get in the playoffs. It hasn't always been that way.''

HEADLINE: Tour Operators See a Rival In the City's Free Podcasts

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
If Cathy Epstein had been drinking a beverage when she saw a report about City Hall's latest tourism promotion, the double-take she did probably would have been a spit-take.
 Ms. Epstein is the director of marketing for On Location Tours, a company that has been selling tours of movie and television show locations in and around New York City for 10 years. On Monday, the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting started giving away audio tours of some of the same locations on its Web site.
 The agency's initiative upset some tour operators, who complained that it could cut into their already shrinking business. Rather than offer an alternative to their services, they said, city officials should be supporting them, especially during a severe recession. 
 ''We just don't understand what the reason is for it when we're already doing this sort of thing,'' said Ms. Epstein, whose company is best known for its ''Sex and the City'' tours. ''It's exactly what we do; we take people to locations of movies and TV shows and we use local actors and actresses as tour guides.''
 One of the stops on On Location's $36 bus tour is a firehouse in TriBeCa that was featured in the movie ''Ghostbusters.'' That firehouse is also a highlight of one of the podcasts that tourists can download from the film office's Web site.
 The film office said that the audio tours it made available this week, which are narrated by the actors Julianna Margulies and Matthew Modine, were the first of a series. They guide visitors around Lower Manhattan, past City Hall and through the financial district to Battery Park.
 After listening to the podcasts, Ms. Epstein said she did not think that her company's scripts had been appropriated. ''It's not a word-for-word thing,'' she said. ''But it's very, very similar.''
 She said nobody from the city government had contacted her company, which is a dues-paying member of the city's tourism marketing agency, NYC & Company, about the podcasts. She said she and her colleagues wondered how much farther the film office planned to go with the audio tours, especially because On Location offers a walking tour of locations in Central Park.
 Katherine Oliver, the commissioner of the film office, which helps arrange filming at city locations, declined to be interviewed about the podcasts. A spokeswoman said the office spent $23,000 on the podcasts, all of which came through private donations to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City.
 In a prepared statement, Ms. Oliver said: ''The city's locations are a prime attraction for film and television, and our agency's mission is to boost this business by showcasing these famous locations and educating New Yorkers about the importance of the production industry. These walking tours are not meant to compete with the small businesses that make up the city's tourism industry.''
 Joyce Gold, who leads walking tours of historic sites in neighborhoods around the city, did not agree. Before she even listened to the podcasts, she was irate that the city would intrude on the turf of entrepreneurs like her. 
 ''I don't know why they would do this,'' Ms. Gold said. ''It just seems so unfair. I feel like I'm being nipped at the heels.''
 Ms. Gold said that her company, Joyce Gold History Tours of New York, pays about $1,000 a year in dues to NYC & Company, which receives its funds from City Hall and from hotels, restaurants and other companies in the hospitality industry. She said she planned to protest to the tourism agency about the podcasts, which she fears will draw some potential customers away from her tours.
 Seth Kamil, who runs Big Onion Walking Tours, was less concerned. ''My feeling is that as long they're well done, I don't have a problem with it,'' Mr. Kamil said. ''I just find that it can't hurt.''

HEADLINE: Return Appearance by the Gilded Era's A-Listers

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
James Abbott McNeill Whistler has a special place at the Frick. He's not the main draw -- that would be the old master paintings -- but his portraits of young socialites are frivolous fun. And as one of only two Americans in the collection, and a near-contemporary of Henry Clay Frick, he shares some of that Gilded Age aura.
 Whistler's famous appetite for confrontation -- notably a legal showdown with the critic John Ruskin, who accused him of ''flinging a pot of paint in the public's face'' -- also makes him one of the Frick's more intriguing characters.
 Those exceptional qualities were on full display in the Frick's 2003 exhibition ''Whistler, Women and Fashion,'' which marked his centenary. This summer's refurbishment of the museum's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a more modest celebration: ''Portraits, Pastels, Prints: Whistler in the Frick Collection.'' 
 Organized by the curatorial assistants Joanna Sheers and Caitlin Henningsen, in conjunction with the senior curator Susan Grace Galassi, the exhibition links two galleries at opposite ends of the Frick's courtyard: the Oval Room and the Cabinet Room.
 The first part of the show is a reunion of sorts, bringing portraits that had been trapped in the corners of the East Gallery into more conversational proximity in the Oval Room. These four paintings are joined by a seascape, ''Symphony in Gray and Green,'' that had been languishing in a hallway.
 The second part, in the closet-size Cabinet Room off the lobby, features three pastels and a suite of etchings from Whistler's yearlong sojourn in Venice. The 12 etchings, known as the ''First Venice Set,'' were commissioned by the Fine Arts Society in 1879 just after Whistler, having spent all his money on the libel suit against Ruskin, had declared bankruptcy.
 Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. You can see it in his portraits, which flatter their subjects without playing down their individuality, and in his Venice etchings, which eschew San Marco and the Grand Canal in favor of quieter piazzas and shadowy passages.
 In the Oval Room old favorites are energized by a risque seating chart. The demure subject of ''Symphony in Flesh Color and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leland'' peers over her left shoulder, as always, but this time she seems to be snubbing Whistler's ''Harmony in Pink and Gray: Portrait of Lady Meux.'' Lady Meux, a butcher's daughter who married well, meets the viewer's gaze frankly and defiantly with her intense brown eyes.
 It's clear that Whistler identified with both women, for different reasons, and knew how best to flatter each one. The paintings share a predominantly pink palette, but the folds of Mrs. Leland's gossamer gown (designed by Whistler with this portrait in mind) are much softer than the crunchy-looking ruffles on Lady Meux's satin train. Whistler even played up the texture by choosing a coarser grade of canvas for the Meux portrait. 
 In the two other full-length portraits, of the artist Rosa Corder and the Symbolist poet Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac, Whistler experiments with the deep browns and blacks of 17th-century Dutch and Spanish paintings. The tonalities are so subtle that they don't register up close; these works are best seen from the center of the room.
 The Montesquiou portrait, pre-titled ''Arrangement in Black and Gold,'' is unctuously luxurious. The count was not only a poet but also an aristocratic flaneur, the model for Proust's Baron de Charlus. Whistler lavishes attention on his fur cloak, walking stick and pointy, perfectly shined shoes. It's fascinating to see this imperious, Old World figure installed in the company of arrivistes. 
 Between the pastel portraits (Mrs. Leyland and Lady Meux) and the darker ones (Rosa Corder and Comte de Montesquiou), Whistler made the prints on view in the Cabinet Room. He had intended to stay in Venice for only three months, but he remained for more than a year.
 Upon his return Whistler worked on the commission of 100 editions for more than a decade. He treated each print impression as a unique artwork, adding or subtracting ink or otherwise tweaking the plate. In ''The Beggars,'' for instance, he tried to reverse the tones of light figures on a dark ground, leaving a foggy area that adds to the scene's mystique.
 Some of the richest images show open doorways, evidently glimpsed from a passing gondola. In one of these prints you can make out chairs hanging from the ceiling of a caner's workshop. Here Whistler goes beyond the tourist's-eye view of Venice's crumbling facades to hint at the real lives of working Venetians. ''I have learned to know a Venice in Venice that others never seem to have perceived,'' he wrote to his patrons at the Fine Arts Society.
 Whistler does show the Basilica of San Marco in a couple of the etchings, but he obscures it with a column (in ''The Piazzetta'') and a row of rooftops (in ''The Riva, No. 1''). And in ''Little Venice'' and ''Little Lagoon,'' distant views of the city that echo his famous ''Nocturne'' paintings of London, Whistler favors atmosphere over architecture.
 In other scenes he fuses Venetian architecture with the steep compositions and diagonal recessions of Japanese woodblock prints. The result is subtly disorienting, a watery Shangri-La.
 Whistler's unconventional perspectives and varied, ''artistic'' impressions of the First Venice Set raised eyebrows at first, but public opinion caught up to him. By the time Frick purchased the set, in 1915, Whistler's etchings were compared to Rembrandt's.
 The prints will go back into storage come late August. But the Whistler portraits will return to their original spots (currently occupied by two Gainsboroughs and two van Dycks) in a refreshed East Gallery. Lady Meux and Mrs. Leyland should look even better against the new rose-colored velvet mohair wall covering. 
 ''Portraits, Pastels, Prints: Whistler in the Frick Collection'' is on view through Aug. 23 at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue; (212) 288-0700, frick.org.

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.comart. 
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. 20090604
 (Karen Rosenberg) 
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST,' through Sept. 13. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic, five-part, black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)20090604
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090604
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090604
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090604
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 6. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090604
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20090604
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090604
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600,' through June 21. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So it's no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,' through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semi-human fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically self-ward. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,' through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,' through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old-master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090604
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090604
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090604
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'AERNOUT MIK,' through July 27. Something is happening in this Dutch artist's videos, but you don't know what it is. Displayed on single flat screens or as multiple projections on custom-built walls in various locations at the museum, they seem to document chaotic, emotionally charged, newsworthy situations involving scores of people. As you watch, you keep hoping to discover what exactly is the cause of the commotion, but no clarification arrives. They are by turns mesmerizing, tantalizing and frustrating. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090604
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TANGLED ALPHABETS: LEON FERRARI AND MIRA SCHENDEL,' through June 15. This overly full show mixes together partial accounts of the work of two important South American artists instead of focusing on one. Leon Ferrari (Argentine, born 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, born in Switzerland, 1919-1988) shared an interest in abstraction contaminated by language, line and modest materials, especially paper and wire. But Ferrari is, at heart, a sardonic, sometimes grandiose Conceptualist, whose best works elaborate a maniacal, nonsense calligraphy. Schendel was a purist with a Zen slant, adept at transferring random marks and letters to rice paper, from which she also made ephemeral sculptures. While the show opens a window on a complex history that ran parallel to, not behind, postwar art in the United States, the double survey suggests a failure to commit. Our loss. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090604
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090604
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; and Guthrie Lonergan. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090604
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'HARLEM, 1970-2009: PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAMILO JOSE VERGARA,' through July 12. From the time he arrived in the United States from Chile as a college student in 1965, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has been haunting, and haunted by, American cities. Some of them -- Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York -- he has revisited and rephotographed repeatedly in the past 40 years to record changes over time. The people and places of Harlem are the subject of this small show about alteration and continuation. A similar exhibition, ''Storefront Churches: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara,'' runs June 20 to Nov. 29 at the National Building Museum in Washington. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street , (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)20090604
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090604
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090604
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes focus on the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist. Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street , (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090604
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090604
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,' through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions lean heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/ Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090604
 Galleries: Uptown
 JOHN CHAMBERLAIN: 'EARLY YEARS,' through June 27. This show of works dating from 1960 to 1987 prompts a question: is there any sculpture from the 1960s that still looks as good as Mr. Chamberlain's? His assemblages of distressed autobody parts are almost classical. Hovering between the raw and the cooked, they are simultaneously compressed junk and elegant compositions of organic abstraction and orgasmic expression. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street , (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Johnson)20090604
 ERNESTO NETO: 'ANTHROPODINO,' through June 14. A spectacular dream of an installation of gauzy fabric, dangling pods, dinosaurish wooden bones and cavernous interiors occupies much of the Park Avenue Armory's 55,000-square-foot, 80-foot-high Wade Thompson Drill Hall. With its domed central structure and ethereal canopy, Mr. Neto's construction glows like a magical destination in a children's movie. Park Avenue Armory, at 67th Street , (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Johnson)20090604
 SIGMAR POLKE: 'LENS PAINTINGS,' through June 19. The artist's first show here in 11 years introduces the fruits of an improvised, if machine-executed, technique, by which Mr. Polke covers each of his canvases or fabrics with a thin sheet of combed plastic that hardens into a crude, lenticular surface. He applies images, daubs and pours of paint before and after. The visual confusion is initially intriguing, and the usual caustic beauty is achieved. The only problem is that so far the experiments mostly rehash familiar Polke motifs. These too need to broach new territory. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Smith)20090604
 Galleries: 57th Street
 YANG FUDONG: 'EAST OF QUE VILLAGE,' through June 20. Running concurrently on six flat screens, each of six 20-minute videos shows shifting views of a remote village in a region surrounding Beijing. In the desolate landscape outside the village, scrawny dogs forage for food and get into snarling fights. In town, we see people doing routine activities. It might be an allegory of life on the fine line between civilization and savagery. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com. (Johnson)20090604
 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS,' through June 26. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street , (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com. (Johnson)20090604
 Galleries: Chelsea
 PHIL COLLINS: 'WHEN SLAVES LOVE EACH OTHER, IT'S NOT LOVE,' through June 20. The main attraction in this video-making conceptualist's show is a sophisticated parody of a Spanish television soap opera, made in Mexico City, using professional television actors. The 28-minute film tells a tangled tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder involving two maids, a gardener and the wealthy couple they work for. Though not as funny or imaginative as it should be, it is entertaining. Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street , (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. 20090604
 (Johnson)
 MARK FLOOD: 'CHELSEA WHORES,' through July 10. Works by this Houston-based artist mock American culture and the contemporary art world. A found Exxon sign has the words ''Take Drugs'' crudely stenciled across the bottom. Paintings on cardboard bear messages like ''Another Painting'' or ''2 More Paintings.'' Having it both ways, Mr. Flood also produces almost beautiful, traditional canvases by applying paint over old lace and then pulling away the fabric, leaving intricate, multi-hued, all-over patterns. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street , (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Johnson)20090604
 CHARLES RAY, through June 27. More than 20 years ago Mr. Ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous, even though hardly anyone saw it: ''Ink Line'' (1987), a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor. It is here publicly exhibited for the first time, along with two other pieces from the '80s: ''Moving Wire,'' in which the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall, and ''Spinning Spot,'' a circular section of the floor, 24 inches in diameter, spinning at 33 1/3 r.p.m. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)20090604
 LISA ROSS: 'UNREVEALED,' through June 13. The photographs in this beautiful show are of graves and shrines that Ms. Ross found in the wind-pummeled deserts of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Northwest China. Each memorial, made of dried branches ornamented with bits of fabric and religious talismans, and enclosed by rickety fencing, seems to be in the process of blowing away as we watch. Their fragility seems particularly evident in two video pieces, but so does their resilience. Daneyal Mahmood Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, third floor , (212) 675-2966, daneyalmahmood.com. (Cotter)20090604
 DIRK SKREBER, through June 27. The startling centerpiece of this exhibition is a pair of real cars, each wrapped around a vertical steel pole. The ''sculptures'' were produced at an automobile-safety testing operation, where big machines hurled the cars against the poles at speeds over 40 miles per hour. Also on display is a series of large, oddly blurry pictures of beautiful women. They suggest a fading connection to the eternal feminine, while the smashed cars evoke a faustian industrialism. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street , (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Johnson)20090604
 'WELCOME TO GULU,' through June 13. Recently appointed a goodwill ambassador by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the painter Ross Bleckner traveled to Africa, where he organized a therapeutic art workshop for former child soldiers and abducted girls in the Gulu region of northern Uganda. Paintings from the workshop make up the bulk of this benefit show. They are accompanied by photographic portraits of the young artists by Mr. Bleckner -- who has plans to return to Uganda -- and by their calmly harrowing personal statements.

 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY,' through June 21. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats, like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences, like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals, like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia , (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090604
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, M.A. , (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Ken Johnson)20090604
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090604
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington , (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090604
 Last Chance
 'NOBLE TOMBS AT MAWANGDUI: ART AND LIFE IN THE CHANGSHA KINGDOM, THIRD CENTURY B.C.E. TO FIRST CENTURY C.E.'; closes on Sunday. In the early 1970s three tombs were discovered in southeastern China. Because they had never been plundered and because of the unusually well-preserved state of their contents, the discovery caused a worldwide sensation in archaeological circles. This show presents about 70 of more than 3,000 objects that were excavated, including fabric samples, lacquer ware, lamps, grooming tools and wooden figurines. China Institute, 125 East 65th Street , (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Johnson)20090604
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'INTO THE SUNSET: PHOTOGRAPHY'S IMAGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST'; closes on Monday. Almost every one of this resonant exhibition's approximately 150 pictures dating from 1850 to 2008 evokes tension between the myth and the reality of the great American West. Its overall perspective is predictably bleak, but it is loaded with arresting images, from the 19th-century group portrait of the outlaw gang the Wild Bunch in suits and bowler hats, to Irving Penn's glamorizing studio shot of five Hells Angels and their two girlfriends. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090604
 'PICASSO: MOSQUETEROS'; closes on Saturday. The takeaway from this staggering exhibition of around 100 late paintings and prints: in the main, Picasso only got better. Canvases depicting musketeers, entangled lovers and thick-limbed nudes abound. All look fabulous in the naturally lighted, unencumbered spaces -- free of lobbies, text panels and admission charges -- which contribute to the once-in-a-lifetime intensity. The combined effect contradicts generations of received opinion, proving that in his last decade in particular (1962-72) Picasso often achieved an emotional rawness, physical immediacy and joyful pictorial wickedness that was new to his art. His involvement with ceramics and the shorthand speed of glaze paintings undoubtedly contributed, as suggested by two paintings on tiles in the show. Like the 1908 masterpiece ''Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' these works turn painting inside out. If they have not similarly changed the course of art history, give them time. First they deserve their due.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Decline Slightly, the First Time in 20 Weeks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of people on the unemployment insurance rolls fell slightly last week for the first time in 20 weeks, and the tally of new jobless claims also dipped, the government said Thursday. 
 The report provides a glimmer of good news for job seekers, though both declines were small and the figures remain significantly above the levels associated with a healthy economy.
 The Labor Department said the tally of first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 621,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 625,000, nearly matching analysts' expectations.
 The total jobless benefit rolls fell by 15,000 to 6.7 million, the first decline since early January. Continuing claims had set record highs every week since the week ending Jan. 24. The continuing claims data lags behind initial claims by one week.
 Still, the number of initial claims remains stubbornly high, above the 605,000 level reached five weeks ago. That was the lowest level in 14 weeks.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, rose by 4,000 to 631,250.
 The report comes a day before the department is scheduled to release its unemployment report for May. Economists expect that report will show employers cut a net total of 520,000 jobs last month.
 The unemployment rate, meanwhile, will rise to 9.2 percent from 8.9 percent in April, analysts forecast.
 Initial claims are still below the peak for the current recession of 674,000 in late March. Among the states, Illinois had the largest increase in claims, with 3,881, which it attributed to layoffs in the manufacturing and service industries. The next largest increases were in Iowa, South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin. The state data lags behind initial claims by a week.
 North Carolina had the largest drop in claims, 3,952, which it attributed to fewer layoffs in construction, furniture and transportation. The next largest decreases were in Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Connecticut.
 The department also said workers were more productive in the first quarter than previously estimated, as companies made do with fewer employees because of rapid layoffs.
 Productivity, the amount of output per hour worked, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6 percent in the January to March period, the department said, double the government's estimate last month.
 Labor costs rose 3 percent, down from the government's previous measure of 3.3 percent. A rapid increase in labor costs could feed inflation, but most economists are not worried about rising prices, as the recession is keeping a lid on wage demands.

HEADLINE: Tax Break For Profits Went Awry

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
It was called the ''Homeland Investment Act,'' and was sold to Congress as a way to spur investment in America, building plants, increasing research and development and creating jobs. It gave international companies a large one-time tax break on overseas profits, but only if the money was used for specified investments in the United States.
 The law specifically said the money could not be used to raise dividends or to repurchase shares.
 Now the most detailed analysis of what actually happened -- using confidential government data as well as corporate reports -- has estimated what happened to the $299 billion companies brought back from foreign subsidiaries. About 92 percent of it went to shareholders, mostly in the form of increased share buybacks and the rest through increased dividends. 
 There is no evidence that companies that took advantage of the tax break -- which enabled them to bring home, or repatriate, overseas profits while paying a tax rate far below the normal rate -- used the money as Congress expected.
 ''Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R.& D., even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions,'' concluded the study by three economists, including a former official of the Bush administration who took part in the discussions leading to enactment of the plan in 2004.
 The study, titled ''Watch What I Do, Not What I Say: The Unintended Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act,'' was released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was written by Dhammika Dharmapala, a law professor at the University of Illinois; C. Fritz Foley, an associate professor of finance at Harvard Business School; and Kristin J. Forbes, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a member of the president's council of economic advisers from 2003 to 2005. 
 ''The restrictions on how the money will be spent seem to have been completely ineffective,'' Ms. Forbes said in an interview this week.
 ''Dell was a great example,'' she added, referring to Dell Computer. ''They lobbied very hard for the tax holiday. They said part of the money would be brought back to build a new plant in Winston-Salem, N.C. They did bring back $4 billion, and spent $100 million on the plant, which they admitted would have been built anyway. About two months after that, they used $2 billion for a share buyback.''
 The research is the first on the act that was able to use confidential information gathered from companies by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a part of the Commerce Department. The researchers learned from that exactly how much in overseas profits each company repatriated, and also learned how much it had invested and repatriated in earlier years. They had to promise not to disclose company-specific data and Ms. Forbes emphasized that the numbers she cited on Dell came from the company's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 From the B.E.A. data, the researchers were able to calculate that $300 billion in overseas profit was repatriated by American companies in 2005, when they had to pay a tax rate of just 5.25 percent, rather than the normal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. The amount was five times the normal amount of repatriations.
 United States tax law allows American companies to defer paying taxes on foreign profits so long as the profits are invested outside the United States. That is a big reason most major companies pay taxes that amount to far less than the 35 percent corporate tax rate would indicate. 
 Last month President Obamacomplained that ''our tax code actually provides a competitive advantage to companies that invest and create jobs overseas compared to those that invest and create those same jobs in the U.S.,'' and called for changes in the law. He stopped short of calling for repeal of the deferral provision, but business still reacted angrily.
 ''This plan will reduce the ability of U.S. companies to compete in foreign markets, which will not only reduce jobs, but will also cripple economic growth here in the United States. It couldn't come at a worse time,'' said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, a trade group of large companies. This week Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, said his company would move jobs overseas if the Obama proposals were enacted.
 In lobbying for the new act in 2003, a group of companies and trade associations formed the Homeland Investment Coalition and forecast that passage would help the American economy by ''increasing domestic investment in plant, equipment, R.& D. and job creation.'' The title of the new study reflects its findings that none of that happened.
 One fact found by the study indicates that some of the repatriated money was not even really returned to the United States, contrary to the intent of the law. Companies knew of the tax holiday in 2004, and many of them chose to ''invest'' money that year in foreign subsidiaries that had profits subject to American taxes if they were brought back to the United States. They then brought the profits back in 2005, getting the tax break while not reducing the continuing foreign investment.
 Ms. Forbes said about $100 billion left the United States and came right back, in a process the paper calls ''round-tripping.''
 Other studies, using only publicly available information from S.E.C. filings, have previously estimated that the amount of money going to shareholders was much lower. In a paper to be published in The Journal of Accounting Research, two accounting professors, Jennifer Blouin of the University of Pennsylvania and Linda Krull of the University of Oregon, estimated that about 20 percent of the money went to share repurchases. They did that by comparing the spending of companies that repatriated money to similar companies that did not.
 Ms. Forbes and her colleagues were careful to say their findings did not indicate that any companies violated the law barring use of the money for share repurchases and dividends. ''Rather,'' they said, the results ''reflect the fact that cash is fungible and that a tax policy which reduces the cost of accessing a particular type of capital will have difficulty affecting how that capital is used.''
 Indeed, the study praises the companies for not spending the money in other ways, such as raising executive pay or investing in noneconomic projects. And it concludes that the American economy may have been helped by the act.
 ''Although the H.I.A. does not appear to have spurred the domestic investment and employment of firms that used the tax holiday to repatriate earnings from abroad, it may still have benefited the U.S. economy in other ways. The tax holiday encouraged U.S. multinationals to repatriate roughly $300 billion of foreign earnings and pay most of these earnings to shareholders. Presumably these shareholders either reinvested these funds or used them for consumption. Either of these activities could have an effect on U.S. growth, investment and employment.''
 In the current credit squeeze, however, some companies may wish they had not spent so much money on share repurchases. In total, Dell spent $7.2 billion buying back 204 million shares in 2005, spending around $35 a share. But it stopped making sizable purchases of stock a year ago.
 Today, Dell's shares trade for about $12, and $7.2 billion would be enough to buy back almost a third of the nearly two billion shares outstanding. Dell officials declined to comment.

HEADLINE: State Revenues Buffeted by Downturn

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
The carnage in state budgets is getting worse, a report said Thursday, with places like Arizona being hurt by falling revenue on multiple fronts, like personal income and sales taxes. Other states are having mixed experiences, with some tax categories stable, or even rising, even as others fall off the map.
 The report, by the National Conference of State Legislatures, also provided a scorecard for how well drafters of state budgets read the recession's economic tea-leaves -- and the short answer is, not very well. 
 Thirty-one states said estimates about personal income taxes had been overly optimistic, and 25 said that all three major tax categories -- sales taxes, personal income taxes and corporate taxes -- were not keeping up with projections.
 Even gloomy-Gus states that saw the recession coming and low-balled their tax estimates had little room for celebration, the report said. ''The handful of states that have weathered the economic decline reasonably well are starting to report adverse revenue developments,'' it said. ''The news is alarming.''
 Three states, for example -- Alabama, Colorado and North Dakota -- said personal income taxes were coming in higher than expected. But they said they had seen declines in other tax categories, like corporate taxes (down 33 percent in North Dakota), severance taxes from oil and gas (down 51.8 percent in Colorado) or sales tax (down 8.5 percent in Alabama.) 
 Hardest hit on the income tax collection front was New York, where revenues were off 48.9 percent compared with the last fiscal year. Corporate income taxes plummeted most in Oregon, down 44 percent, while sales taxes fell most in Washington, down 14.1 percent.
 There were some winners, at least by comparison. Sales taxes were running ahead of last year in nine states, led by North Dakota, where they were up 18 percent. North Dakota was also the strongest among the three states -- Alabama and Kansas are the others -- that saw year-over-year increases in personal income tax collections.
 Arizona was among 29 states that suffered revenue losses in every major tax category.
 ''What this report really underscores is that the states are facing revenue-based problems,'' said Todd Haggerty, a research analyst at the conference, a nonpartisan group based in Denver. ''If there's been an increased demand for state services -- as there has in many states -- it's putting them into a really tough situation.''
 A report issued by the group in April said that spending increases related to the recession, from more people seeking state services, were compounding the impact of a decline in tax revenue. Sixteen states were facing higher-than-anticipated costs for health care, seven were spending more on public safety and four were seeing cost overruns on programs for the poor like food stamps. 
 Worse is yet to come. The total collective budget gap that the states will have to resolve in the fiscal year that starts, in most states, next month, is $121 billion, compared with 102.4 billion for the year approaching its end, the report said. Measures on the table to fill those holes, or already in place, range from the macro (a cut of 25 percent in grants to local governments in Minnesota) to the micro (elimination of staffing at metal detectors in local courthouses in Maine). 
 Two of the gloomiest state capitals next year, the group said, might be found in Alaska and Nevada, with each state anticipating a gap of more 30 percent between what it hopes to collect and what will need to spend.

HEADLINE: Western Mining Giant Ends Plan to Sell $19.5 Billion Stake to Chinese Company

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and MICHAEL WINES; David Barboza reported from Shanghai, and Michael Wines from Beijing.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
The Chinese government's largest investment ever in a Western company, a proposed $19.5 billion stake in the Australian-British mining giant Rio Tinto Group, collapsed early Friday, dealing a blow both to China's global corporate ambitions and to its efforts to gain clout in the natural resources market.
 The board of Rio Tinto announced the decision after meeting in London on Thursday, saying the company had ended the deal it struck in February to sell the stake to China's state-owned Aluminum Corporation of China, also known as Chinalco. 
 The board said in a statement early Friday that it had ended the deal with Chinalco and would raise about $20 billion by issuing new stock and forming a joint venture with its longtime rival, the Australian mining giant BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company.
 The China deal, which would have effectively expanded Chinalco's existing 9.3 percent stake in Rio to 18.5 percent, had drawn stiff political opposition in Australia, where mineral riches have fueled the country's prosperity and where some have begun to fear China's power in the region. Institutional investors have also expressed skepticism about the agreement, with some calling it a sweetheart deal for the Beijing government. 
 In a statement posted on its web site Friday, Chinalco's chairman, Xiong Weiping, said: ''We're very disappointed the agreement failed.''
 Rio Tinto said in a statement that it had agreed to raise $5.8 billion by forming a joint venture with BHP Billiton and that it planned to raise $15.2 billion more through a stock offering.
 In Australia and elsewhere, the Rio-Chinalco deal has been viewed as a corporate landmark, a crucial test of whether the West's shareholder-driven capitalism could mesh with a Chinese model that is ultimately under state control.
 By collapsing, the deal will rank alongside the failed attempt by a Chinese company to take over Unocal, the American oil company, in 2005 and will provide new evidence that China's attempts to extend its global corporate reach are often limited by nationalistic backlashes abroad. 
 The Unocal deal collapsed amid furious debate in the United States about the wisdom of selling strategic assets to China and over China's human rights record. 
 Until recently, officers of both Rio and Chinalco had strongly defended the investment, which would have made the Chinese government Rio's single biggest shareholder by far and given it an advisory role in the company's operations. Chinalco would also have gained substantial stakes in individual mines in several countries. 
 In return, Rio would have received a sorely needed injection of cash to retire a portion of its $39 billion in debt, amassed mostly in an ill-timed 2007 purchase of the Canadian aluminum maker Alcan. Rio would have formed a strategic partnership with Chinalco that company officials say would have given it greater access to Chinese customers and opportunities to search for ores in Chinese territory. 
 The deal was struck at the depths of the collapse in the global commodities and stock markets last year. The share price for Rio, the world's third largest mining conglomerate, had been severely depressed not only by falling commodity prices, but also by a costly defense against a proposed and potentially lucrative takeover by its major rival, BHP Billiton. 
 But the tentative agreement had come under increasing fire as the global economy bounced back, pushing metals prices and Rio's own stock price up considerably from their earlier lows. Last February, shares in Rio Tinto were selling for $26.31 in London. On Thursday, they were trading at $44.56.
 Institutional shareholders have complained bitterly that Rio should raise money through a new stock issue instead of selling a dominant stake to the Chinese government, which they argue has a vested interest in keeping the price of ores as low as possible.
 Chinalco had insisted that it was independent of its owners in the Chinese government, and Australian regulators ruled that the Chinese would not be able to affect the price of iron ore, one of Rio's main products, even with the proposed stake in the company. 
 But those declarations failed to sway some critics, who argued that Chinalco's proposed investment followed the government's declared strategy of diversifying its global investments in resources as a way of hedging against price increases. The Chinese are such voracious consumers of some metals, like iron ore, that they already have some sway over its price.
 Australia's political opposition savaged the proposed deal, calling it evidence that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former envoy to Beijing, was too cozy with the Chinese government. A nationally broadcast television commercial this week showed scenes of the Chinese army's 1989 assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and charged that Mr. Rudd ''bears gifts to the Chinese military regime by allowing control of strategic mineral resources in Australia.'' 
 In its statement early friday, Rio said that market conditions had recently changed and that it had found alternatives to raising a large amount of capital. ''The boards have concluded that the formation of an iron-ore production joint venture in western Australia with BHP Billiton together with the rights issues deliver the best solution.''
 In ending the deal, Rio said it would continue to work with Chinalco and had agreed to pay Chinalco a $195 million break up fee.
 Such moves are possible now, experts say, because the global financial markets have strengthened in recent weeks and commodity prices have rebounded.
 As the debate over the Rio investment grew louder, Chinese officials complained about what they called protectionism and nationalism. The Australian Foreign Investment Review board, which scrutinizes deals that involve big stakes in Australian companies, was expected to rule on the China investment this month or early next month.
 The proposed investment was seen as another sign of China's growing global clout and its voracious appetite for the ingredients that help produce the steel needed for the country's fast-paced building boom. Chinese companies have been on the prowl around the world over the past few years, striking supply contracts and buying corporate stakes that secure long-term access to oil, iron ore, rare earth metals and other natural resources.
 The Chinese have also made major investments in recent years in real estate, agriculture and international finance. Just this week, China's sovereign wealth fund agreed to spend more than $1 billion to increase its already significant stake in Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank.
 Under the Rio deal, Chinalco had offered $7.2 billion to purchase convertible bonds in Rio Tinto and $12.3 billion in cash for stakes in Rio's aluminum, iron ore and copper assets in the United States, Australia and Chile.
 The bonds would eventually have converted to stock.

HEADLINE: Stern Wants to Preserve An Age Limit for Players

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
With the N.B.A.'s age limit under assault by a congressman and a variety of critics, Commissioner David Stern reiterated Thursday that he was happy with the policy and had no interest in abolishing it.
 Speaking during a news conference before Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Orlando Magic, Stern also announced that he had fined LeBron James $25,000 for failing to meet with the news media after the Cleveland Cavaliers' loss to Orlando in the Eastern Conference finals last Saturday. 
 Stern defended the motives and underpinnings of the age policy, which generally requires players to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school before becoming eligible to play in the N.B.A. The age limit was instituted in 2005 through negotiations with the players union. 
 ''This is not about the N.C.A.A., this is not an enforcement of some social program,'' Stern said. ''This is a business decision by the N.B.A., which is: We like to see our players in competition after high school.'' 
 In fact, Stern has expressed a desire to raise the age limit to 20 in the next round of collective bargaining. The union wants to repeal the rule.
 The issue drew renewed focus this week when Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, issued a news release assailing the age limit. In an interview Wednesday, Cohen called the policy ''a vestige of slavery,'' because most of the players affected are African-American.
 ''Not like the slavery of 150 years ago,'' Cohen said, ''but it's a restraint on a person's freedoms and liberties.''
 In defending the policy, Stern noted that Congress itself has a minimum age of 25.
 ''I don't know why our founders decided that age 25 was good for Congress, but I guess they thought that was about maturity,'' Stern said. ''For us, it's a kind of basketball maturity.''
 Critics of the rule say it prevents players from making a living and forces them to go to college for a year. Stern disagreed, saying that players can choose to attend college or junior college, or play in the N.B.A.'s Development League or in Europe.
 ''So this is not a mandatory direction by anyone that players should go to college,'' he said.
 As for James, who left the arena without congratulating the Magic players and initially defended his actions when he met with the news media on Sunday, he expressed regret when he spoke with Stern on Wednesday, the commissioner said.
 ''He expressed to me that when he left the building and did not meet the media or did not congratulate the Magic, he was wrong,'' Stern said. ''He asked that I express to the media, the Magic and the fans his apology, and particularly the young fans, because he knows he has a responsibility to all of our fans and that sportsmanship is appropriate, whether you win or whether you lose.''
 Stern also spoke on other topics.
 The N.B.A. has no plans to allow corporate sponsorships on player jerseys, as the W.N.B.A. has done, although Stern said, ''We'll study it.''
 In light of the recession, Stern said that N.B.A. revenue could be down ''maybe as much as 10 percent.'' The league is discussing whether to change its revenue-sharing model, which is extremely limited compared with the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball.

HEADLINE: The Wait Is Over

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Our long national nightmare is over. No, the economy has not come out of the tank and no, we were not holding our breath waiting to find out whether the ''American Idol'' voting was rigged. We have not been holding out hope that the N.B.A. would lift its talent restriction instead of its age restriction, giving short, clumsy people a chance to miss free throws for a lot of money.
 No, we are talking about the impossibly long N.B.A. playoffs finally reaching their climax. Or, Game 1 of their climax tonight. At this point, we will take anything resembling an actual Finals game because the pre-series analysis is one step shy of discussing Kobe Bryant's choice of shoelaces. 
 No surprise the pundits are almost all picking the Lakers, including nine out of 10 assembled by ESPN.com, and today's storylines swirl around Bryant's quest for a post-Shaq championship. You can read permutations on this theme by ESPN's J.A. Adande, Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski, The Los Angeles Times' Bill Plaschke.
 Or, you can ponder Kobe's biological clock, get a rundown of the Kobe vs. Dwight Howard clash of stars or wonder why The Orlando Sentinel decided to insult its readers with a ''new fans guide'' when the franchise has been there since 1989 and has even been to the N.B.A. Finals (1995). But hey, everyone needs to be reminded why there is a 24-second clock over the basket.
 A few writers are reminding us there are other players in the Finals besides Bryant and Howard (thank you, SI.com's Chris Ballard), and his SI.com compatriot Chris Mannix explores the question of just which one of those Laker people is going to guard Howard. 
 While Shaquille O'Neal is busy making clear on his Twitter page that he's rooting for Kobe (''thats right i am saying it today and today only, i want kobe bryant to get number 4, spread da word.''), CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman is busy making the bold prediction that the Magic is the N.B.A. version of the 2007 Giants.
 The N.H.L., meanwhile, has been playing actual games while the N.B.A. over-analyzes itself, but it has also sparked suspicions that it is merely replaying tapes of last year's Stanley Cup finals. ESPN.com's Scott Burnside and Pierre LeBrun insist this is not true, that Detroit's 2-1 lead over Pittsburgh is not exactly like last year's 2-1 lead over Pittsburgh. This year's final features plenty of comedy courtesy of the participating Russian players and could soon also feature the return of the Red Wings' Pavel Datsyuk, which The Detroit Free Press's Mitch Albom writes can not come soon enough for the exhausted Henrik Zetterberg.
 The Detroit-Pittsburgh matchup has also apparently captured the imagination of the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who reveals on his Twitter page that he will be in Pittsburgh for Game 4 tonight, as opposed to watching the finals in his own sport.
 Baseball is trying to keep us interested by delaying the Big Unit's big day (Randy Johnson's quest for a 300th win) until a doubleheader today in Washington, and the Braves grabbed for all the headlines by releasing Tom Glavine, calling up the much-hyped Tommy Hanson and trading for the Pirates' Nate McLouth all in one day. Glavine's release drew nostalgia from some quarters, but The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Mark Bradley writes that it was time for Glavine to go and Yahoo's Jeff Passan writes that the Braves are trying to build their immediate future.
 Baseball's future might belong to Bryce Harper, featured on Sports Illustrated's cover, but if you are a bit queasy about over-hyping a 16-year-old, USA Today offers the cautionary tale of Ben McDonald. 
 The French Open's immediate future seems to be all about Roger Federer, who has watched the tournament turn into something resembling a red carpet, one no longer laid out for Serena Williams, who made her exit in typical Serena fashion. As SI.com's S.L. Price writes, that is not a pretty thing.
 At least she didn't cheat, which means she stays off this list of sports' biggest cheaters. And she was not snubbed by a landlord who thought she would bring too much drama to a neighborhood in Buffalo, as Terrell Owens reportedly was.
 At least we're done waiting for the N.B.A. drama to start.

HEADLINE: Developer Scraps Gehry's Design for Nets Arena

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Citing financial concerns, the developer of the long-delayed Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn has scrapped plans for a Frank Gehry-designed $1 billion glass-walled basketball arena for the Nets in favor of a less expensive arena. 
 The new design, which will cost about $200 million less, comes from Ellerbe Becket, an architectural firm based in Kansas City, Mo., that specializes in convention centers, stadiums and arenas and designed Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, where the Indiana Pacers play. Officials who have seen the design say that while it resembles Conseco Fieldhouse it also bears a likeness to an ''airplane hangar.'' 
 The developer of Atlantic Yards, Bruce C. Ratner, the chief executive of Forest City Ratner, scrapped Mr. Gehry's plans primarily for economic reasons. The arena is the centerpiece of a $4 billion development that has been hobbled by lawsuits, a recession and its own ambitious goal to build 6,400 apartments, 40 percent of which would be reserved for low- to middle-income families. 
 Mr. Ratner, whose project won a major court victory over opponents to Atlantic Yards last month, is racing to pare costs and start construction of the 20,000-seat arena by the end of the year, when his right to use tax-exempt financing expires. Officially, the developer says the Nets will move to Brooklyn from the New Jersey Meadowlands for the 2011 season.
 ''The current economic climate is not right for this design,'' Mr. Ratner said of the Gehry design in a statement released Thursday afternoon, ''and with Frank's understanding, the arena is undergoing a redesign that will make it more limited in scope.'' 
 Mr. Ratner has said he is eager to get started with what he says will be a world-class project.
 Mr. Gehry, the award-winning architect behind the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, added that while he regretted the demise of his arena design, he remained ''extremely proud of our work on the Atlantic Yards master plan and on the original arena.''
 The switch met with the approval of David Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association, who said that Ellerbe Becket had designed ''some of the finest sports and entertainment venues in the world.''
 If the arena is built, however, it will most likely take more than two years to complete. Unlike the Gehry design, the new arena would not accommodate a professional hockey team.
 Mr. Gehry remains the master planner for the 22-acre development, at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. But in a concession to the collapsing real estate markets, the developer has delayed most of the housing and a proposed office tower. In an interview last month, Mr. Ratner said that he planned to start the first residential tower, which would contain a large percentage of units for low-, moderate- and middle-income families, about six months after work begins on the arena.
 With projects across the city slowed or scuttled by the recession, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. David A. Paterson are eager to push Atlantic Yards forward. But Mr. Ratner has also opened himself up to criticism by scuttling Mr. Gehry's design in favor of a less glamorous arena and delaying the office tower and much of the housing, while modifying other elements of the development.
 ''The current Atlantic Yards plan bears increasingly less resemblance to the project that was approved in 2006,'' said Vin Cipolla, the president of the Municipal Art Society. ''The replacement of Gehry further reduces the public benefits of the project, which urgently needs re-evaluation and oversight.''
 Atlantic Yards emerged late in 2003 when Mr. Ratner bought the Nets for $300 million and announced plans to move the team to Brooklyn. Although he was not a basketball fan, Mr. Ratner saw the arena as a lever for a much larger development of housing, parks and office space directly across from a major transit center.
 Forest City Ratner, which was the development partner for the Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company, has had to contend with vigorous opposition led by a group called Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, which has challenged what it said was the oversized nature of the development and the state's plan to condemn private property on behalf of Mr. Ratner.
 The city's building boom has fallen silent during two years of litigation, and financing for real estate projects is hard to come by. Last year, Mr. Ratner said that the development of the area would be slower than once promised, because of the recession.
 The developer is under pressure to get government approval for changes to the development's master plan and to start the arena by December, before he loses the ability to use tax-exempt bonds. Mr. Ratner must also hold together a group of corporate advertisers at a time when companies are trying to shed those kind of financial obligations.
 His 20-year, $400 million deal for the arena's naming rights with Barclays Bank also expires at the end of the year. He has secured an additional $100 million in sponsorship and advertising deals with eight companies, including Anheuser-Busch and Foxwoods, and is expected to announce another major deal next week.
 On June 24, Mr. Ratner plans to go before the boards of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Empire State Development Corporation for changes to the approved plan for the development. Instead of making an upfront payment of $100 million to the transit authority for a nine-acre railyard that is part of Atlantic Yards, Mr. Ratner is asking the authority to accept a $20 million down payment, while he delays construction of a permanent replacement railyard for at least several years.

HEADLINE: Ailing, Banks Still Field Strong Lobby at Capitol

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Carl Hulse contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As he often does, President Obama took the opportunity in a bill-signing ceremony last month to remind Congress ''to do what we were actually sent here to do -- and that is to stand up to the special interests, and stand up for the American people.'' 
 But Mr. Obama did not mention that the measure he was signing, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, was missing its centerpiece: a change in bankruptcy law he once championed that would have given judges the power to lower the amount owed on a home loan.
It had been stripped out three weeks earlier in a showdown between Senate Democrats and the nation's banks, including many that are getting big government bailouts. 
 As Congressional Democrats and the White House crow about multiple victories over the financial industry, including new rules for credit card issuers, banks are quietly savoring an even bigger victory of their own.
 The defeat of the bankruptcy proposal is a testament to the enduring influence of banks, even as the industry struggles financially and suffers from its role in the economic crisis. 
 It also shows that in the coming legislative battles that will shape the future of the economy, the financial industry -- through a powerful and well-financed lobbying force -- may have a far stronger hand to play than might seem evident.
 Documents and interviews with lawmakers, lobbyists and administration officials show that the banks defeated the bankruptcy change -- the industry picturesquely calls it the ''cramdown'' provision -- by claiming that it would push up interest rates and slow the housing market's recovery, even though academic studies have countered such claims. 
 The industry also steadfastly refused offers to negotiate over a weaker version. And it poured millions of dollars into lobbying: four of the industry's top trade groups spent nearly as much on lobbying in the first three months of this year as they did in all of 2001. 
 But an industry strategy of dividing the Democrats had the most success. 
 One target was Senator Mary Landrieu, the moderate Democrat from Louisiana. On April 1, about 30 bankers from Louisiana crowded into a room off the Senate floor to press their view that the bankruptcy measure would force them to raise mortgage rates and hurt the very homeowners Congress was seeking to help.
 Donnie Landry, a senior executive vice president at MidSouth Bank of Lafayette, La., recalled that last year Ms. Landrieu had ''not been very receptive to some of our concerns. But this time she could not have been more cordial,'' even helping them get to see Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate banking committee, while they were at the Capitol.
 Ms. Landrieu was among 12 Democrats joining 39 Republicans to vote against the measure, while Mr. Dodd was one of the 45 Democrats and independents who supported it -- still 15 votes shy of the 60 needed to shut off a filibuster.
 Aaron Saunders, a spokesman for Ms. Landrieu, told reporters at the time that the senator had voted against the measure because of the concerns raised by Louisiana bankers that the provision could cause mortgage rates to rise.
 Throughout it all, the banks took advantage of the Obama administration's seeming ambivalence. Despite its occasional populist rhetoric, the White House was conspicuously absent from weeks of pivotal negotiations this spring. 
 ''This would have been a much different deal if Obama had pressed it,'' said Camden R. Fine, head of the Independent Community Bankers of America and one of the chief lobbyists opposing the bankruptcy change. ''The fact that Obama effectively sat it out helped us a great deal.''
 Surprising Ease
 In the end, the banks' startling success in defeating the provision, which was pushed hardest by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, caught even their lobbyists by surprise. Not only did they defeat the cramdown provision, but the banks walked away with billions in new bailout money. 
 The housing bill Mr. Obama signed on May 20 saves banks and credit unions at least $13 billion in special fees that they would have had to pay to replenish dwindling deposit insurance funds.
 The outcome left some Democrats frustrated and fuming. ''This is one of the most extreme examples I have seen,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, shortly before the vote, ''of a special interest wielding its power for the special interest of a few against the general benefit of millions of homeowners and thousands of communities now being devastated by foreclosure.''
 The lament was a far cry from the outlook in January, when banking lobbyists believed their situation was hopeless. Some 10,000 homes were being foreclosed on every day. A new president who had campaigned in favor of the proposal -- and who co-sponsored similar legislation as a senator -- was about to take office. 
 While Republicans had defeated the measure in 2008, Congress was now more solidly in Democratic hands.
 The industry's worst fears began to come true in early January when Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he had persuaded Citigroup to endorse the idea. Mr. Schumer had held discussions with Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, and Lewis B. Kaden, a vice chairman. Mr. Schumer then spoke to other top executives, including Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, hoping to peel more big banks away from the opposition. 
 Housing advocacy groups argued that it was unfair that bankruptcy judges have had the authority since 1978 to modify mortgages on vacation homes, farms and even luxury yachts, but not on primary residences. They also argued that a string of federal programs to help reduce foreclosures had been ineffective because of resistance by lenders and investors who own pools of loans, all of whom stand to lose money when a mortgage is modified. 
 Those arguments won the day in the House, which adopted the legislation on March 5 by a 234-191 vote. 
 In the Senate, where Republicans were looking for a chance to recoup after narrowly failing to block Mr. Obama's huge stimulus package, the banks argued that the proposal interfered with their contractual rights. 
 But the real threat was to their profits. The proposal would have shifted negotiating power to the millions of troubled homeowners who could use the threat of bankruptcy to wrest lower monthly payments from lenders. The banks claimed that that would force them to raise rates. 
 That claim is in dispute. For one thing, the legislation would not have applied to new mortgages. 
 Moreover, until a Supreme Court decision in 1993, some bankruptcy judges had modified mortgages on primary residences, and recent studies by Adam J. Levitin, an associate law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, concluded that those modified mortgages did not result in increases in lending rates. 
 Still, Mr. Durbin knew he had a fight on his hands. Within his own party, moderates were badly split. Some, like Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, represent states that are the corporate home to major banks. The industry has showered both lawmakers with campaign cash.
 Senator Carper's three largest contributors this election cycle have been executives and political action committees at Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money and politics. Out of the $4.6 million he has raised, some $375,000, or 8 percent, has been from banks, credit unions and related trade groups. 
 Senator Johnson has raised about $6.2 million, of which at least $280,000, or 4.5 percent, has come from groups opposed to the legislation. 
 Compromise Falls Flat
 To win industry support in enlisting more of his colleagues, Mr. Durbin approached the trade associations. 
 Shortly after negotiations began, the American Bankers Association abandoned the talks, saying there was no compromise they could ever support. Soon after, Mr. Fine's community bankers also left the talks, having refused a demand by Mr. Durbin to publicly announce support for the principle of allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce mortgage payments.
 Mr. Durbin next sought a compromise with credit unions and three large banks -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. In April, at a delicate stage in the talks, Mr. Durbin gave the banks a proposed compromise that was marked not to be circulated, a senior Congressional aide involved in the talks recalled. 
 Within six minutes, the memo was distributed to the entire Republican caucus -- along with a warning from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, to stay away from it. The compromise went nowhere. 
 While Mr. Obama reaffirmed his support for the proposal shortly after becoming president, administration officials barely participated in the negotiations, a factor that lobbyists said significantly strengthened their hand. Lawmakers who have discussed the issue with the administration said that the president's senior aides had concluded that a searing fight with the industry was simply not worth the cost. 
 Moreover, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, did not seem to share Mr. Obama's enthusiasm for the bankruptcy change.
 Mr. Geithner was lobbied by the industry early. Two days after he was sworn in, he invited Mr. Fine from the community bankers to his office for a private meeting. The association, with influential members in every Congressional district, is one of Washington's most powerful trade groups.
 A senior adviser to Mr. Geithner said the administration supported the cramdown proposal, but it preferred that distressed homeowners seek to modify their loans through the Treasury's new $75 billion program, which rewarded banks if they modified home loans, rather than through bankruptcy court. 
 Mr. Durbin acknowledges that it was a mistake not to call on the administration for help.
 ''If I would have known how it would unfold, I would have called on the White House earlier to get involved,'' he said.
 Deal Now, Pay Later
 While Mr. Durbin had trouble rounding up Democratic votes, Republican leaders kept their members -- and potential renegade banks -- in line. 
 Senator Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican leading the charge against the bankruptcy change, told bankers there would be consequences if they dealt with the Democrats. According to an April 20 e-mail message between industry officials in touch with Mr. Kyl, he told them ''not to make a deal with Durbin and then come looking to Republicans when they need help on something like regulatory restructuring.''
 In an interview, Mr. Kyl, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, did not recall whether he had made the statement, although he remembered telling bankers that he could not defend them if they did not first defend themselves. ''I very pointedly said, 'Don't make a deal with Durbin on this. You don't need to. If he has the votes he wouldn't be dealing,' '' Mr. Kyl recalled.
 There was no counterweight to that legislative muscle. Bankrupt homeowners do not have a political action committee or lobbyists.
 Mr. Fine reports that the political action committees run by his association alone have built a war chest of nearly $2 million, a 40 percent jump over the last year, even though members have had to cut other expenses in the recession. 
 ''The banks get it,'' Mr. Fine said. ''They understand you need a strong political action committee to get access to the fund-raisers. That's where the lawmakers are.''

HEADLINE: Rift With Germany Is Next On Diplomatic Agenda

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Germany 

 BODY:
After mending fences with the Muslim world in Cairo on Thursday, President Obama might want to keep his diplomatic tools handy for his stopover here, to repair his increasingly strained relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 A rift has quietly opened up between Germany and the United States, marked by official statements of harmony and private grumbling. It is not an outright crisis in relations, but there are underlying tensions and disagreements on matters ranging from the global economic crisis to the future of inmates held at Guantanamo Bay. 
 On a more basic level, there is a sense that the Obama administration is ignoring the needs and counsel of longtime allies. Divided Germany was once at the center not only of the cold war, but of American foreign policy as well, which is no longer the case. Yet the United States can ill afford to alienate Europe's largest economy and its most important intermediary in the strained relationship with Russia. ''They're not angry, they're not anti-Obama or anti-American,'' said John C. Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany and now a business adviser in Berlin. ''But they're confused by the wave of criticism which has been sent at them by the administration and people close to the administration. 
 ''It's not that they don't like him,'' he said. ''They just feel like things aren't working, like the levers of government are not being engaged to make issues run smoothly.'' 
 Mr. Obama arrived in Dresden, in the former East Germany, on Thursday night for a visit that will also take him to Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp, and the American military hospital in Landstuhl. The German news media have questioned why Mr. Obama was not going to Berlin, suggesting the omission might have been intended as a snub to Mrs. Merkel. Her advisers say it is no such thing and instead praise Mr. Obama's interest in the former East Germany, where Mrs. Merkel grew up.
 While Mr. Obama enjoys tremendous personal popularity among the German people, relations with Mrs. Merkel have been bumpy from the beginning. In Germany much symbolic weight is attached to Mrs. Merkel's decision not to travel to Washington to meet with Mr. Obama in March, but to talk by video conference instead. 
 But signs of discord were evident even last summer, when Mrs. Merkel rejected Mr. Obama's request during the presidential campaign to speak in front of the Brandenburg Gate, saying it was not an appropriate location for a candidate's address. Mr. Obama drew more than 200,000 people to hear his speech at a nearby monument.
 The president's high standing with the German public adds to the strain in his relationship with Mrs. Merkel, local analysts say. ''Obama is so popular with the German people that you have a lot of comments like, 'Why don't we have a German Obama?' '' said Dietmar Herz, director of the Erfurt School of Public Policy. ''Angela Merkel is seen as the exact opposite of a charismatic leader like Obama, and that is difficult to accept.'' 
 There is a sense in Germany, that the smooth Mr. Obama and the flashy President Nicolas Sarkozy of France have a better connection with each other than either does with the serious-minded Mrs. Merkel. And Mr. Sarkozy's decision to reintegrate France into the command structure of NATO, though it had little direct impact on the war in Afghanistan, stood in stark contrast to Germany's steadfast refusal to send troops to fight in the more violent south of the country.
 At the same time, Mr. Obama's popularity with the left-wing Social Democrats, rivals to Mrs. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union in parliamentary elections in September, also helps amplify his and Mrs. Merkel's differences. The Social Democrats, who are the junior party in an unhappy coalition under Mrs. Merkel, have embraced Mr. Obama as a natural ally. 
 ''The Christian Democrats were closer to the Bush administration than they admitted,'' Mr. Herz said. ''It was very difficult for conservatives like the chancellor to admit that she was close to a lot of his policies.'' 
 Relations were already frosty as the economic crisis deepened and the German government and Obama administration took sharply differing views on how far to push stimulus spending. Mrs. Merkel believed that the Americans were underestimating the threat of inflation. But American policy makers said she did not understand the depth and the significance of the crisis.
 In the early stages of the Obama presidency, officials in the Merkel government were dismayed by the scarcity of staff in midlevel positions at the Treasury Department. And Germans remain surprised that an ambassador to their country has not been named more than four months after Mr. Obama's inauguration. There is a sense that, with his focus split between domestic concerns and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the new president is taking his staunchest European allies for granted.
 ''There is definitely this disappointment in Europe, complaining that there's nobody home,'' said Stephen Flanagan, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 German government officials were outraged that a low-ranking American official was sent for the negotiations to find a way to keep the traditional automaker Opel going despite the bankruptcy of its parent company, General Motors, in the United States. The potential failure of an important industrial employer before parliamentary elections is no laughing matter for German politicians, including Mrs. Merkel. Still, Karsten D. Voigt, who coordinates German-American relations in the German Foreign Ministry, disputed the contention that relations between the allies were under any strain, as did Merkel advisers, who rightly point out that this is Mr. Obama's third visit to Germany in less than a year.
 ''This takes time in the U.S.,'' Mr. Voigt said. ''Transition is a long process. It's always a frustrating experience.''

HEADLINE: Europe Sets Deal to Share Information On Detainees

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
European Union interior ministers agreed Thursday to share information on former inmates from the Guantanamo Bay detention center before they were accepted by any of the bloc's member nations. 
 Ministers meeting in Luxembourg said the decision was aimed at allaying the security concerns of union members, most of whom have been reluctant to accept any former detainees even though dozens have been cleared for release by United States authorities. 
 President Obama arrived in Germany on Thursday night with the issue of finding homes for former detainees high on his agenda. Germany has been reluctant to take any unless the United States provides more detailed information about them and also accepts some on its own soil. 
 Under the terms of the accord, any European Union country that agrees to take former detainees must inform other member states and then share the information it receives from the United States before it makes a final decision. Countries would not be able to veto another member's decision, but they could press it to reverse course. 
 European countries are wary because once detainees are accepted by a union nation within the Schengen area -- in which there are no internal border controls -- most detainees will have the freedom to travel unhindered among those countries. Ireland, Britain, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania do not belong to the Schengen area; the other 22 members do. 
 ''The receiving member state shall take into account the public order and security concerns of other member states, since it is the member states which are responsible for ensuring security within the E.U. and the Schengen area,'' the agreement states. Some of the detainees, even if accepted by European countries, still may not be able to travel freely through Europe. 
 Some European Union officials hailed the accord, saying it would help Mr. Obama close Guantanamo. ''It is very important,'' said Gilles de Kerchove, the union's counterterrorism coordinator, who attended the meeting. 
 In reality, only a handful of member states are prepared to accept any detainees even though the European Union has consistently urged the United States to close the prison. 
 Wolfgang Schauble, the German interior minister, referred to Mr. Obama's struggle on detainees domestically in explaining European caution. ''If the U.S. states are not ready to accept detainees,'' he said, ''then we have to explain to the public here in Europe why there is a different system compared to the U.S.''

HEADLINE: Spending Drops, and Savings Rate Marches Up

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
FOR the first time since World War II, Americans are spending fewer dollars than they spent a year earlier.
 That reluctance -- or inability -- to spend has led to the sharpest rise in the savings rate in this country since the government began calculating the statistic in the 1950s.
 ''People's attitudes toward credit and home ownership are undergoing a fundamental shift,'' said David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist and strategist of Gluskin Sheff, a money management firm based in Toronto. 
 Mr. Rosenberg said he expected that the savings rate, which rose to a 14-year high of 5.7 percent of disposable income in April, would continue to grow until it surpassed the record high of 14.6 percent, set in May 1975, when the country had just emerged from a severe recession and Americans were pessimistic about the country's economic outlook.
 The accompanying charts show the trends in both personal consumption spending and savings rates using three-month moving averages, to smooth out gyrations. Over the three-month period, the savings rate averaged 4.8 percent.
 Until this cycle, the smallest year-over-year rise in consumption spending was a 1.8 percent increase in the 12 months through April 1961, a period that also ended shortly after a recession concluded. But the year-over-year figures have been down in every month of 2009.
 A collapse of income has not caused this decline in spending. While government figures show that wages are down because of rising levels of unemployment, that has been more than offset by lower tax collections and by a sharp increase in government transfer payments as the economic stimulus measures take effect.
 The figures on spending are in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. Real consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, fell for brief periods during recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. But in neither case did the decline last as long, or go as deep, as the current one.
 The sharpest falloff in consumer spending in the current cycle was in the purchase of durable goods like vehicles and furniture. That decline seems to have stabilized. Spending on nondurable goods like food and clothing is also down for the first time since the 1940s, and is continuing to fall.
 Consumer spending on services is still rising, albeit at the lowest level in memory. A large part of that increase reflects rising payments for medical services, which have continued to take more money even as the recession deepens.
 At its worst, late last year, spending on durable goods was down 12.6 percent, year-over-year. That decline, while the largest in more than 50 years, was not nearly as great as the decline in production that took place as the financial crisis cut off credit for trade financing.
 ''The demand numbers never fell like the production, inventory and trade numbers,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a research firm. ''You can have a rebound for all these numbers,'' he added, even if demand does not recover.
 Exports from countries like China do appear to be picking up, a fact that has encouraged speculation that the global recession may almost be over, if it has not already ended. But it remains to be seen whether demand will rise. If American consumers remain cautious, as Mr. Rosenberg forecasts, a real recovery may depend on an increase in demand from places other than the United States.

HEADLINE: Poking Holes In a Theory On Markets

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
For some months now, Jeremy Grantham, a respected market strategist with GMO, an institutional asset management company, has been railing about -- of all things -- the efficient market hypothesis.
 You know what the efficient market hypothesis is, don't you? It's a theory that grew out of the University of Chicago's finance department, and long held sway in academic circles, that the stock market can't be beaten on any consistent basis because all available information is already built into stock prices. The stock market, in other words, is rational.
 In the last decade, the efficient market hypothesis, which had been near dogma since the early 1970s, has taken some serious body blows. First came the rise of the behavioral economists, like Richard H. Thaler at the University of Chicago and Robert J. Shiller at Yale, who convincingly showed that mass psychology, herd behavior and the like can have an enormous effect on stock prices -- meaning that perhaps the market isn't quite so efficient after all. Then came a bit more tangible proof: the dot-com bubble, quickly followed by the housing bubble. Quod erat demonstrandum. 
 These days, you would be hard-pressed to find anybody, even on the University of Chicago campus, who would claim that the market is perfectly efficient. Yet Mr. Grantham, who was a critic of the efficient market hypothesis long before such criticism was in vogue, has hardly been mollified by its decline. In his view, it did a lot of damage in its heyday -- damage that we're still dealing with. How much damage? In Mr. Grantham's view, the efficient market hypothesis is more or less directly responsible for the financial crisis.
 ''In their desire for mathematical order and elegant models,'' he wrote in his firm's quarterly letter to clients earlier this year, ''the economic establishment played down the role of bad behavior'' -- not to mention ''flat-out bursts of irrationality.''
 He continued: ''The incredibly inaccurate efficient market theory was believed in totality by many of our financial leaders, and believed in part by almost all. It left our economic and government establishment sitting by confidently, even as a lethally dangerous combination of asset bubbles, lax controls, pernicious incentives and wickedly complicated instruments led to our current plight. 'Surely, none of this could be happening in a rational, efficient world,' they seemed to be thinking. And the absolutely worst part of this belief set was that it led to a chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking.''
 (Mr. Grantham concluded: ''Well, it's nice to get that off my chest again!'')
 I couldn't help thinking about Mr. Grantham's screed as I was reading Justin Fox's new book, ''The Myth of The Rational Market,'' an engaging history of what might be called the rise and fall of the efficient market hypothesis. 
 Mr. Fox is a business columnist for Time magazine (and a former colleague of mine) who has long been interested in academic finance. His thesis, essentially, is that the efficient marketeers were originally on to a good idea. But sealed off in their academic cocoons -- and writing papers in their mathematical jargon -- they developed an internal logic quite divorced from market realities. It took a new group of young economists, the behavioralists, to nudge the profession back toward reality.
 Mr. Fox argues, echoing Mr. Grantham, that the efficient market hypothesis played an outsize role in shaping how the country thought and acted in the last 30-plus years. But Mr. Fox parts company with him by also arguing that the effect wasn't necessarily all bad. As for the question of whether an academic theory hatched in Chicago led to the financial crisis, suffice it to say that some questions can never be answered definitively. Which isn't to say they shouldn't be asked.
 ''There are no easy ways to beat the market,'' Mr. Fox said when I spoke to him a few days ago. If you want to point to the single best thing the efficient market hypothesis taught us, that is the lesson: we can't beat the market. Indeed, the vast majority of professional money managers can't beat the market either, at least not on a regular basis. 
 As Mr. Fox describes it, much of the early academic work that led to the efficient market theory was aimed at simply showing that most predictive stock charts were glorified voodoo -- just because a pattern had developed didn't mean it would continue, or even that it had any real meaning. Dissertations were written showing how 20 randomly chosen stocks outperformed actively managed mutual funds. (Hence the phrase ''random walk,'' to connote the near impossibility of beating the market regularly.) Mr. Thaler, the Chicago behavioralist, says that evidence on this point -- ''the no free lunch principle,'' he calls it -- is clear and convincing.
 In time, this insight led to the rise of passive index funds that simply matched the market instead of trying to beat it. Unless you're Warren Buffett, an index fund is where you should put your money. Even people who don't follow that advice know they should.
 As it turns out, Mr. Grantham was an early advocate of index funds, mainly for unsophisticated investors who have no hope of beating the market. But he also believes that professionals should do better precisely because, as he puts it, ''the market is full of major league inefficiencies.'' 
 ''There are incredible aberrations,'' he told me over lunch not long ago. ''The U.S. housing market in 2007. Japan in the 1980s. Nasdaq. In 2000, growth stocks were three times their fair value. We were quoted in The Economist in 2000 saying that the Nasdaq would drop by 75 percent. In an efficient world, you wouldn't have that in a lifetime. If the market were truly efficient, it would mean that growth stocks had become permanently more valuable.''
 As Mr. Grantham sees it, if professional investors had been willing to acknowledge these aberrations -- and trade on the fact that the market was out of whack -- they should have been able to beat the market. But thanks to the efficient market hypothesis, no one was willing to call a bubble a bubble -- because, after all, stock prices were rational. 
 ''It helped mold the 'this time it's different' mentality,'' he said. Indeed, professional money managers who tried to buck the tide wound up losing their jobs -- because everybody else was making money by riding the bubble for all it was worth. Meanwhile, government officials, starting with Alan Greenspan, were unwilling to burst the bubble precisely because they were unwilling to even judge that it was a bubble. ''Our default reflex is that the world knows what it is doing, and that is extravagant nonsense,'' Mr. Grantham said. 
 But as much as I've admired Mr. Grantham's writings over the years, I think the truth, in this case, is a little more subtle. Given the long history of bubbles, I suspect this crisis would have taken place with or without the aid of the efficient market hypothesis. People thought ''it's different this time'' in the 1920s, long before anyone was writing about efficient markets. And over the course of history, professional money managers have been just as fearful of bucking the trend as they were during the Internet bubble. 
 Mr. Fox sees it somewhat differently. On the one hand, he says, the efficient market theoreticians always assumed that smart market participants would force stock prices to become rational. How? By doing exactly what they don't do in real life: take the other side of trades ifprices get out of whack. Their ivory tower view reflected an idealized market that simply doesn't exist.
 On the other hand, Mr. Fox says, what was truly pernicious about the efficient market hypothesis is the way it allowed us to put asset prices on a pedestal that they never deserved. Stock options -- supposedly based on a rational price -- became prevalent in part because higher stock prices were supposed to be the rational reward for good performance. 
 Or take the modern emphasis on market capitalization. ''At some point in the early 1990s (or maybe it was in the late 1980s), market capitalization became accepted as the best measure of a company's importance,'' Mr. Fox wrote me in an e-mail message. ''Before then it was usually profits or revenue. I think that's a classic example of the way efficient market theory seeped into popular discourse and shaped how we perceived the world. It wasn't entirely stupid -- profits and revenue are flawed, limited measures, and market value does tell you something useful about a company. But it was another one of the ways in which asset prices came to rule the world, which eventually turned out to be a bad thing.''
 A few days ago, I called Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economist, to ask him what he thought of Mr. Grantham's theories. Mr. Malkiel is the author of ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' surely one of the greatest popularizers of any academic theory that's ever been written.
 ''It's ridiculous'' to blame the financial crisis on the efficient market hypothesis, Mr. Malkiel said. ''If you are leveraged 33-1, and you're holding long-term securities and using short-term indebtedness, and then there's a run on the bank -- which is what happened to Bear Stearns -- how can you blame that on efficient market theory?''
 But then we started talking about bubbles. ''I do think bubbles exist,'' he said. ''The problem with bubbles is that you cannot recognize them in advance. We now know that stock prices were crazy in March of 2000. We know that condo prices were nuts.''
 I thought to myself: if a smart guy like Burton Malkiel had to wait for the Internet bubble to end to realize we had been in one, then maybe Mr. Grantham has a point after all.

HEADLINE: Expansive Road Bill Raises Issue Of Payment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
It could wind up spending nearly 10 times as much money on transportation projects as the federal stimulus bill, but outside of Washington, where it has prompted a frenzy of politicking, it has attracted less than a 10th of the attention. 
 That measure, the federal transportation bill, could spend as much as $450 billion on road and transit projects over the next six years, after the current law expires in September. 
 The most contentious question -- how to pay for it all -- took on a new urgency this week when officials announced that the source of most transportation money would run dry this summer for the second year in a row.
 The bulk of the money in the federal Highway Trust Fund comes from the federal gasoline tax, as well as from a tax on truck sales. Lawmakers said they might be forced to bail out the fund in August with $5 billion to $7 billion from general tax revenues, just a year after they provided it with an $8 billion bailout.
 The trust fund is insolvent in large part because, for the second year in a row, Americans are driving less, and when they buy less gas, gasoline tax revenue declines. Last year the decline in purchases was attributed to record gas prices, and this year people are driving less because of the recession. At the same time, taxes collected from truck sales have fallen sharply, eroding another source of revenue.
 While several business groups, transportation experts and lawmakers in both parties have called for raising the gasoline tax to meet transportation needs, the Obama administration has made it clear that it opposes raising the tax in a recession.
 ''The administration has inherited a system that can no longer pay for itself,'' Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Thursday at a hearing in the House, where he pledged to act this summer to address the expected shortfall. ''We must think creatively as we search for sustainable funding mechanisms.''
 The federal gas tax is not a percentage of the amount of money spent, like a sales tax, but rather a flat 18.4-cent tax levied on each gallon of gasoline sold. It has not been raised since 1993, even as the price of gas has doubled. Officials also say inflation has eroded about a third of the tax's purchasing power since 1993. 
 Hopes that the tax issue will be resolved before the transportation law expires Sept. 30 dimmed this week when the House put off action on the bill until after its Fourth of July recess. That means Congress could be forced to bail out the trust fund this summer and then temporarily extend the transportation law, instead of passing a new measure that would put the program on firmer footing for the long haul. 
 But an aide to Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said this week that Mr. Oberstar wanted a new transportation bill and would not support a temporary extension. As a pressure tactic, Mr. Oberstar is threatening to bring federally financed road work to a halt if a new bill is not passed.
 Others in Congress have suggested that it is unlikely that a transportation bill can be adopted this summer. Both houses are focused on other priorities, including sweeping health care legislation. That would leave only a few weeks in September to get the transportation bill done, a narrow window for such a complex and expensive measure. 
 ''They've got so many fish to fry that we're getting out in the back of the barbecue line,'' said Pete Ruane, president of the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, a major industry group, who nonetheless pronounced himself optimistic that a bill could be passed in time.
 Mr. Ruane said it was vital for Congress to shore up the trust fund before it ran out of money this summer, to preserve construction jobs.
 ''If they delay on the short-term fix,'' he said, ''they will have negated a large part of the stimulus package. These jobs could go away. When people don't see a long-term, consistent flow of revenue, they're not going to buy equipment, they're not going to hire people.''
 Even as business groups and lawmakers in both parties have called for raising the gas tax, some fear that the move toward more fuel-efficient cars could make that only a temporary fix. A federal commission recently recommended raising the tax by 10 cents a gallon, but said that the nation should ultimately devise a way to tax people based on how many miles they drive, not on how much gasoline they use. 
 As the question of how to pay for transportation has taken on new urgency, the question of what kind of transportation to pay for has not gone away. Transportation for America, a broad coalition of groups including environmentalists but also the National Association of Realtors and AARP, is calling for more spending on mass transit and rail, to reduce dependence on foreign oil, cut pollution and ease traffic. 
 Traditionally, spending on highways has outstripped spending on mass transit by roughly four to one. Some people were given hope that the ratio could be lowered when the Obama administration made sure that the stimulus bill included more money for faster rail service.

HEADLINE: Millions Face Blank Screens In TV Switch

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Millions of households will lose television reception next week when about 1,000 broadcasters around the nation shut off their analog signals and complete their conversion to digital programming, federal officials say. 
 The government has spent more than $2 billion to ease the transition to digital television, and in the last few months has cut in half the number of households that are unprepared for the final conversion on June 12. But the latest survey by the Nielsen Company indicates that as of the end of May, more than 10 percent of the 114 million households that have television sets are either completely or partly unprepared.
Michael J. Copps, the acting head of the Federal Communications Commission, said that the people most likely to lose reception are society's most vulnerable -- lower-income families, the elderly, the handicapped and homes where little or no English is spoken. The transition will also hit inner-city and rural areas hardest, he said. 
 ''We are much better prepared than we were in February, when the original transition was to have occurred, but there will nonetheless be significant disruptions,'' Mr. Copps said in an interview. ''In the past five months we've tried to accomplish what should have been done over the last four years.'' 
 More than three million homes that do not subscribe to cable or satellite services are totally unprepared for the transition and will lose their reception, according to Nielsen. Another nine million homes that subscribe to cable or satellite services but that have spare television sets -- typically in bedrooms and kitchens -- that are not connected to any service are also expected to lose reception. The conversion does not affect cable or satellite distribution.
 And officials say that millions more who thought they were prepared are likely to experience technical problems like poor reception or improperly connected antennas. Their problems arise because the way the digital signal travels is different from analog and can be more affected by topography, weather or even heavy auto traffic. 
 A list of 49 particularly vulnerable markets includes New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Boston and Dallas-Fort Worth. Officials said Puerto Rico is also among the most susceptible to problems, as it has the highest rate of households that receive their television signals over the air.
 In the New York broadcasting market, 92,000 homes are completely unready for the transition and another 348,000 are partly unready, according to Nielsen. That represents almost 6 percent of households in the region.
 Early this year, the administration persuaded Congress to postpone completion of the transition to June, from February, and to provide another $650 million, mostly for coupons for converter boxes, on top of the $1.5 billion that had already been spent by the Bush administration. 
 The Obama administration has enlisted dozens of groups, including AmeriCorps, the national volunteer organization, civil rights groups and even firefighters to help people install the converter boxes and antennas. The program is the most ambitious technology transition effort since the Clinton administration's enormous Y2K program, which was set up to avert major software problems caused by the inability of computers to process data beginning on Jan. 1, 2000. 
 Concerned about a possible political reaction, President Obama issued a statement on Thursday urging consumers to take steps so they do not lose television reception. ''We have worked hand in hand with state and local officials, broadcasters and community groups to educate and assist millions of Americans with the transition,'' Mr. Obama said.
 ''I want to be clear: there will not be another delay,'' the statement added.
 Other officials said that the high number of households reflected the inclination of Americans to put things off.
 ''There are so many people who are always waiting until the last minute, whether it is college students doing term papers, or people filing taxes, or people like me who wait until Christmas Eve to do their shopping,'' said the commerce secretary, Gary F. Locke, in an interview on Friday. 
 While applauding the government efforts, he said he was frustrated that the early public service announcements did not provide specific enough information about the problem.
 ''Earlier on we could have more crisply and clearly indicated who was affected by the switch,'' he said. ''I've been critical of the public service announcements that just say, 'The switch is coming' or 'Are you ready?' ''
 He added: ''Too many people don't know the difference between digital and analog. I didn't even know myself until a few months ago when my brother-in-law explained it to me.''
 Analog technology transmits a video signal through an electronic impulse. Digital technology breaks the signal into 1's and 0's, allowing far more data to be transmitted through a far smaller amount of broadcast spectrum.
 The transition has already been a huge windfall to television and equipment makers and retailers, as millions of consumers have had to buy digital television sets or converter boxes and special antennas for their old sets.
 Shawn G. DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Electronics Association, said that sales of digital television sets were up 32 percent this year over the comparable period in 2008, even in the midst of a deep recession. Other officials at the association said the spike in sales was attributable to many factors, including declining prices and availability of more programs in digital, as well as the mandatory transition.
 But consumer experts said that many households were buying more expensive television sets and equipment than they needed to continue to receive television signals. Polls by Consumer Reports found that many people were aware of the transition but were confused about how to navigate it, said Joel Kelsey, a policy analyst at Consumers Union.
 Bracing for a wave of complaints, the Federal Communications Commission is preparing to fully staff a $40 million call center on Friday and through the weekend. The government will also continue to supply $40 coupons to households toward the purchase of converter boxes.
 Officials advised consumers to rescan the channels of their television sets after the conversion was completed on Friday to make sure they were pulling in all the correct signals. 
 The conversion is the final step in a long-running plan for more efficient use of the broadcast spectrum. The plan took spectrum licenses from broadcasters, replacing them with other frequencies. It will reallocate some of the broadcasters' former spectrum to public safety providers. Other frequencies were sold for billions of dollars, primarily to the large wireless telephone companies, whose demand for spectrum has risen with the proliferation of hand-held devices that can surf the Internet and send and receive e-mail. 
 Consumers seeking assistance on how to upgrade their television sets or on the availability of digital stations in their communities can go to www.dtv.gov or call the government hot line on the transition at 1-888-CALLFCC (1-888-225-5322).

HEADLINE: After Bit Part in Legal Drama, A Blagojevich Tries Reality TV

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Around here, Patricia Blagojevich is best known for her foul-mouthed tirades captured on federal wiretaps last year when her husband, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, was under investigation.
 And with his removal from office in January, many said good riddance. 
 Yet there she was this week in a pink shirt and sweaty hair, part of the cast on the new NBC reality series ''I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!'' Hoping to be named ''queen of the jungle,'' she swallowed a tarantula one night and crawled through a muddy pit the next. 
 Participation in the series, taped in Costa Rica, is a move toward family redemption, both Blagojeviches have said, about picking up, moving on and making some money. But back home a lot of Chicago is wincing through the former first lady's rain forest antics. 
 ''I think she should be put in prison,'' said Brian Sperry, 41, a sculptor who lives on the South Side. ''How about exporting some dignity to America?''
 Mr. Sperry's friend Don Williams, a painter, said he caught Ms. Blagojevich's performance on the series premiere Monday night. ''I had to turn the channel,'' he said.
 In between building alliances with other contestants and trying to keep from being voted out of the jungle, Ms. Blagojevich has managed to bash old enemies, speak up for her husband and portray both of them as victims. 
 In various episodes -- four were televised this week -- she has cried, prayed, survived a near drowning and shown a side so tough that a rival player called her ''a beast.''
 Through all that, she has proved perhaps the most stable-minded of the celebrity roster, which includes the former model Janice Dickinson, the reality stars Heidi and Spencer Pratt of the MTV series ''The Hills'' and John Salley, a former pro basketball player. 
 Whatever her strategy, it seems to be working: her fellow celebrities voted to grant her immunity from rejection by viewers (who vote by phone) in the first round of eliminations. 
 Too bad it's not real life. Back in Illinois, the children's charity that she had chosen as one beneficiary of her appearance on the show said thanks, but no thanks. Why? The charity has an alliance with a hospital that prosecutors accused Mr. Blagojevich of shaking down for a campaign donation. 
 ''We felt that the partnership was not the best thing for us,'' said Kathleen A. Casey, the founder and president of the organization, the Bear Necessities Pediatric Cancer Foundation.
 Ms. Blagojevich's appearance is also rekindling old political heat, and serving as an unwelcome reminder that Mr. Blagojevich has not yet left the stage, even if he is now working through a proxy. He had wanted to be on the show himself, but a judge barred him from traveling to Costa Rica, as his federal corruption trial looms.
 Ms. Blagojevich took his place.
 Her television performance ''plays a lot better the farther you get from Illinois,'' said Kent Redfield, a political scientist at the University of Illinois at Springfield. 
 Although Ms. Blagojevich was not charged with any crimes in the indictment brought against her husband, it cited her repeatedly in connection with his alleged efforts to solicit money for himself. And in February she was served with a federal subpoena seeking documents related to his campaign fund-raisers and her dealings as a real estate agent. 
 But that does not stop her from rather blithely volunteering personal and political information on the show and casting herself, against the odds, as the moral center.
 She counseled Mr. Salley, the former basketball player, about Ms. Dickinson, the former model, when Mr. Salley accused Ms. Dickinson of taking his personal belongings. 
 ''My husband had a campaign where he was running against this woman who was a little bit like her,'' she told Mr. Salley. ''He thought of her, like, as a crazy old aunt. That he had to kind of like suffer. And just kind of, like, roll your eyes at.''
 Mr. Salley seemed appreciative, nodding at the wisdom of it all. 
 But the veteran Illinois politician likened to the ''crazy old aunt'' on national television was not amused.
 ''I have not seen it,'' Judy Baar Topinka, a Republican whom Mr. Blagojevich defeated in the 2006 race for governor, said of the show. ''I'm waiting to catch her on Court TV instead.''
 Kim Banks, a social worker from the West Side of Chicago, said that she had not known much about the former governor's wife until now and that she was watching the show out of a sense of morbid curiosity.
 ''I feel sorry for her,'' she said. ''But I also don't blame her. She's got kids to feed. I understand that.''
 Ms. Blagojevich is the daughter of a powerful alderman and has a degree in economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She and her husband have two daughters, whom Mr. Blagojevich is said to be caring for alone during the taping of the series. She is receiving payment for her appearance, but her agent would not comment on the amount. NBC did not return a call or reply to an e-mail message seeking comment. 
 In one episode this week, Ms. Blagojevich said that she had lost her job because of her husband's troubles,, and in an appearance on Larry King's show on CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Blagojevich said she had agreed to the reality show appearance because the family needed the money.
 ''She's making a sacrifice because she loves her kids,'' Mr. Blagojevich said.
 A friend and former college roommate of hers, Beth McCollum, watches the show and cringes at what Ms. Blagojevich is forced to endure but says she has the right attitude about it.
 ''She knows when not to take herself too seriously and has a good sense of humor,'' said Ms. McCollum, who spoke with Ms. Blagojevich as she was leaving for Costa Rica. ''That's the real Patti.''

HEADLINE: A Shop That Serves Comfort, Cold

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Along the stretch of Main Street that wends its way through this largely Orthodox Jewish community in Queens, Bruce Becker's candy-colored shop stands out among many of the other businesses. 
 Like many of his neighbors, he sells a kosher product and draws in regular crowds after Sabbath. But while many fellow shopkeepers are feeling the pain of slower sales in the recession, Mr. Becker's business, Max & Mina's Ice Cream, recently added eight workers, and he is working the longest hours he has in 12 years. 
 Mr. Becker, who owns the shop with his brother, Mark, is struggling to keep pace with a growing appetite for ice cream. 
 Since last August -- a month when New Yorkers typically feel sated from a summer of scoops -- customers have continued to pour in for comforting flavors like cinnamon babka and strawberry shortcake: Sales are up by 40 percent. Demand jumped by 70 percent for the Beckers' wholesale business, which supplies Manhattan shops and restaurants that sell ice cream as a main dessert or in the supportive, a la mode role.
 ''There's no question people are eating more,'' Mr. Becker said as he darted around his shop in a blue pinstripe suit, a navy baseball cap and flip-flops. ''This is an affordable comfort food. What kind of a life is it if you're not eating something good?''
 It is a sentiment shared by Melissa Lowinger, 20, a senior at Yeshiva University who visits the shop weekly with her grandparents and her younger brothers. While her family tries to be more cost-conscious during the recession, she has chosen not to sacrifice the mint Oreos that she likes mixed in with her ice cream.
 ''It's been a tradition,'' she said. ''We try to be careful as we can. But ice cream is important, too.''
 Max & Mina's success, however, has not necessarily helped draw shoppers to neighboring businesses. While Kew Gardens Hills may not have been hurt as much as other neighborhoods by the recession, a sandwich shop and two clothing stores have disappeared from Main Street, said Patricia Dolan, president of the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association. 
 She could not recall seeing empty storefronts in the neighborhood for ''many years,'' she said. 
 Mr. Becker, who has watched businesses -- including a Thai restaurant and a bakery -- close in the past year, said he had tried to help his neighbors. He suggested that the owners of one store, Ramat Gan Fruits and Vegetables and Israeli Imports, a market that has served the neighborhood since 1975, draw more customers by playing classical music and offering free samples. 
 Menashe Israeli, one of the owners, said that while business might have dropped about 20 percent, he did not need Mr. Becker's advice. 
 ''We help them,'' he said, referring to the ice cream shop.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Becker said he was receiving more orders from midpriced Manhattan restaurants. Mara Levi, who runs Mara's Homemade in the East Village with her husband, David, stopped by the shop on a recent Monday morning to pick up two tubs of French vanilla to serve with her homemade peach cobbler and chocolate pecan cake. Ms. Levi said that while customers typically order fewer desserts in the warmer months, she had seen no slowdown this year.
 ''That's a lot of a la mode,'' she said incredulously, as she added up how much ice cream customers have been eating. 
 Compared with a year ago, she said, ''we're selling probably double the ice cream.''
 Mr. Becker, a consummate food entrepreneur who chats about the investment capital backing cupcake shops and the financial limitations of gelato, has spent the past decade serving locals and promoting his flavors to the rarefied food elite of Manhattan. He found fame and a spot in People magazine's most eligible bachelor issue along the way.
 The shop walls are lined with photographs of celebrity ice cream fans, like the professional wrestler Mick Foley, who enjoyed cupcake ice cream at an event with so much ''gusto,'' Mr. Becker said, that he was cut off. 
 Dylan Lauren, who sells the Becker brothers' ice cream at her Dylan's Candy Bar shops in Midtown and at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, describes it as a ''hippie, Orthodox, New York version of Ben & Jerry.''
 These customer relationships, built in better times, seem not to be suffering in the downturn. Unemployed bankers in suits are still taking two buses and a subway for cones. And when the Barbie doll celebrated its 50th anniversary this spring, Ms. Lauren worked with Mr. Becker to blend pink ice cream with black and white cookies, in honor of the doll's signature swimsuit.
 Next door to Max & Mina's, Suren Kay, manager of the Mr. Computer Doctor shop, said his business had fallen by 30 percent in recent months as more customers enlisted relatives and computer ''geeks'' to fix their computers. He recently closed a second shop, in Kew Gardens. And, an unrelated Web site that he runs, TorahAnytime.com, has suffered from declining donations, he said.
 Still, he said, he would not trade his financial pressures to run an ice cream shop, even as he sees the line spilling from his neighbor's store on Sundays.
 ''Everyone has their thing that they do in this world,'' Mr. Kay said. ''Ice cream is ice cream.''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Outlines Plans to Keep Its Momentum

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

DATELINE: FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. 

 BODY:
The bad times have been good for Wal-Mart Stores, and on Friday, the retailer's new chief executive said he expected sales to continue to be strong, even after the economy rebounds.
 ''Our customers will stay with us when this economy turns around and they have more discretionary money to spend,'' Michael T. Duke, the president and chief executive of Wal-Mart, told attendees at his first shareholder meeting since taking the helm this year. ''We are building long-term loyalty to Wal-Mart.''
 Like some other retailing executives, Mr. Duke says he thinks the recession has prompted a fundamental change in consumer behavior -- a ''new normal'' in which people are concerned about saving money. 
 If true, that bodes well for Wal-Mart, which has built its reputation on low prices. 
 Wal-Mart's profit was flat for the three months that ended April 30 -- $3.02 billion, or 77 cents a share, compared with the same $3.02 billion, or 76 cents a share, a year ago. Still, its sales at stores open at least a year have outperformed competitors, including its primary rival, Target. During the shareholder meeting, which began promptly at 7 a.m., the actor Ben Stiller, the meeting's host, quipped, ''I hear they're still sleeping at Target.''
 Separately, Wal-Mart announced that it would start a new $15 billion program to repurchase shares. The news sent shares of Wal-Mart up 20 cents, to $51.07.
 Media tours of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores on Thursday offered some details about how the retailer planned to hold onto its new customers.
 Executives said a new store design and remodeling plan would make Wal-Mart stores more pleasant. They also plan to expand thriving departments, like food and electronics. 
 The most popular items that families buy -- groceries, health and beauty goods, pet products and baby products -- will be located on the same side of the store, so customers do not have to trek from one end to another. Shelves will no longer be stacked so high, so stores will feel airier and easier to navigate. 
 There will be more signs pointing out the low prices of items, wider aisles without freestanding product displays, and, in general, fewer brands so consumers are not overwhelmed by 25 different kinds of toothpaste. 
 The electronics department -- a hit with consumers who want brand names at low prices -- will be expanded and will offer more hands-on products so consumers can test technology like portable electronics and Blu-ray players. Also, electronics departments will be located on the back wall of stores so consumers see a wall of sleek TVs when they enter.
 The food and produce area, which has helped increase sales in this economy, will also be expanded. Signs that say ''fresh'' will be near store entrances, along with the take-out food, deli and bakery areas so consumers can dash in and out if they want to. That could cut down on browsing and impulse purchases. But executives said the changes were a response to consumer research. 
 In a question and answer session after Friday's shareholder meeting, Eduardo Castro-Wright, Wal-Mart's vice chairman, said the retailer would retain its new customers by doing what it had been doing the last few years: making its stores friendlier and cleaner, and speeding up the check-out process. 
 Wal-Mart's annual shareholder gatherings are spectacles: part vaudeville show, part revival meeting. Smokey Robinson, Miley Cyrus, and this year's American Idol winner, Kris Allen, performed. The basketball player Michael Jordan spoke. On Wednesday night, Wal-Mart invited store employees from all over the world to concerts by the rock group Foreigner and by Chris Daughtry, a former American Idol contestant.
 Amid the hubbub, the retailer said it was beginning an initiative to help promote women at Wal-Mart. Mr. Duke said he was ''still not satisfied with our progress to date.'' 
 Wal-Mart also used the meeting to highlight its entry into Chile with D&S, a major grocery chain. Additionally, executives said the retailer would continue using its size to achieve supply-chain efficiencies, recruit top talent and continue down the path toward environmental sustainability, a legacy of its former chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr.
 ''Yes, sustainability was personal for Lee,'' Mr. Duke said during the question-and-answer session, ''but it's personal for me.'' 
 Wal-Mart surpassed $400 billion in sales for the first time during its last fiscal year. But Mr. Duke's overriding message on Friday was typical of Wal-Mart's approach to its business.
 ''This is not a time to take comfort in our success,'' he said. ''This is Wal-Mart's time to look to the future and seize the opportunity to truly lead around the world.''

HEADLINE: Union Accord With Paterson On Pensions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson and the state's public employee unions announced an agreement on Friday that would reduce pension benefits for future public employees and save the state billions of dollars in an attempt to control ballooning costs for retirees. 
 To win their support for the deal, the governor provided the unions with significant incentives and backed off earlier demands for concessions from current employees. 
 Mr. Paterson will shelve his plan to lay off 8,700 workers and will drop a proposal to require existing workers to give up their 3 percent annual pay raise this year and to defer a week's pay. In addition, 4,500 workers will be offered $20,000 buyouts. 
 Paterson administration officials said the agreement would save the state $30 billion over 30 years, but much of the savings will not be realized for another decade.
 ''This agreement is a huge win for New York's taxpayers and will lead to the most significant reform of our public pension system in decades,'' the governor said in a statement. ''This is real reform to the pension system, which will substantially reduce costs to the taxpayers of New York State.''
 The agreement will raise the retirement age for future employees from 55 to 62, and require them to contribute 3 percent of their salaries to their pensions for their entire careers, instead of for their first decade of service, which is the current requirement.
 New workers will not become vested in the pension plan until they reach 10 years of service, rather than the current five. The deal will also limit the amount of overtime that employees can use in their last years of work to increase their pension benefits. 
 The agreement requires legislative approval, though endorsements by the governor and the labor unions virtually assure its success. 
 The deal covers state workers and local governments outside New York City; the Paterson administration hopes to negotiate a similar agreement for New York City employees, but city unions are adamantly opposed to doing so. New York City has its own retirement system. The deal also does not affect police officers, correction officers, teachers and firefighters.
 The urgency of the need for changes in retirement benefits was underscored last week when the state comptroller's office reported that the pension fund, hobbled by losses amid the market's collapse, had shrunk to $109.9 billion at the end of March from $153.9 billion a year earlier. 
 The deal comes days after Mr. Paterson shocked and angered police and fire union leaders by refusing to allow new officers and firefighters across the state to continue to enroll in enviable pension benefits that were phased out in the 1970s for other public employees. The governor vetoed routine legislation that would have extended the benefits -- similar bills have been signed by a series of governors going back to 1981.
 While his veto was praised by budget watchdogs as a sign of rare resolve from the governor, his latest labor deal received mixed reviews. 
 Though the administration is hoping that the buyouts and an offer to allow employees to choose a reduced workweek will still generate immediate savings, the cash-poor state will be providing raises to the 129,000 employees covered under the deal announced Friday. Those raises will cost $180 million, at a time when some other states are freezing salaries and furloughing workers. There is also a cost of up to $90 million for the buyouts. 
 Further, New York has a history of reversing its pension cutbacks. The state has previously required that employees contribute to their retirement beyond 10 years of service, only to roll back the requirement in an election year. Union leaders, who had criticized the governor during months of negotiations, succeeded in their insistence that existing labor contracts not be reopened. 
 ''The governor moved significantly from his original demands for major contract concessions from the state's work force,'' said Kenneth Brynien, president of the Public Employees Federation. ''Considering the deteriorating condition of the state's finances, this represents a reasonable accommodation.''
 Danny Donohue, the president of the Civil Service Employees Association, said his union ''recognizes these are extraordinary times with unprecedented challenges, and we have tried to find ways to help without reopening contracts.''
 The agreement creates the first new pension category for state employees since 1983 -- it is called Tier V because it is one of five such classifications, and provides the least generous benefits. 
 But it is not likely to encompass the city. A key labor leader in New York City called it a nonstarter, given that only this week city unions concluded negotiations that led them to amend health benefits for more than 550,000 current and retired employees, guaranteeing $400 million in savings over two years. 
 ''The city unions just completed long, tough negotiations with Mayor Bloomberg,'' said Harry Nespoli, the head of the Municipal Labor Committee. ''As far as Tier V is concerned, it's not negotiable,'' he said, adding, ''We've done our share.'' 
 Financial analysts had varying views on the agreement. 
 ''Obviously the benefits to the state, or its taxpayers, are not immediate,'' said Jeremy Gold, a New York actuary and economist who has contended that governments often understate the ultimate costs of pension benefits. But he added that restraining the benefits of future hires ''may be the beginning of the way out.''
 Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative-leaning research group, said the governor had not gone nearly far enough. Referring to the 4,500 buyouts, he said the deal ''allows you to pay more money to union members who are already ready to retire.''
 Mr. McMahon said he believed New York and other states needed to follow the shift embraced by the private sector away from the traditional defined-benefit pension plan to a 401(k)-style retirement program to prepare for a potentially calamitous future increase in pension costs. 
 Speaking of the governor's deal, Mr. McMahon said, ''If you contrast this to what is happening in other major states, where you have union agreements of givebacks or furloughs, it's remarkable.''
 Elizabeth Lynam, the deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit policy group, called the move ''a really good start.''
 ''It's going to be tough to find the money to do the buyouts, but the pension tier is significant,'' she said. ''If you think about the $45 billion the pension fund lost this year, a new pension tier is desperately needed.''

HEADLINE: Economic Downturn Didn't Spare Justices' Bottom Lines Either

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Justice Stephen G. Breyer was active in the stock market in 2008, selling his stock in a dozen companies, according to financial disclosures released Friday.
 Justice Breyer's stock holdings have forced him to sit out cases before the court in the past. A spokeswoman for the court told Bloomberg in October that Justice Breyer had sold his stock to ''minimize the number of instances in which financial conflicts require recusal.''
 Justice Breyer sold much of the stock, including his holdings in Pepsi and Bank of America, in September, the month before the most recent court term opened and also when the downturn in the stock market began. 
 After the sales, Justice Breyer still had common stock in around 20 companies and, with assets between roughly $3.75 million and $11.75 million, was one of the court's six millionaires.
 While the financial disclosures, required annually, show that the justices are in general financially secure, they also suggest that members of the court were not immune to the nation's economic downturn. 
 It is impossible to establish exactly how much each justice is worth, as they report their holdings in wide ranges. Estimates of the justices' worth do not include the value of their personal homes. 
 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., both of whom had previously sold off parts of their portfolios, left their stock holdings intact in 2008.
 Chief Justice Roberts is currently worth between roughly $1.4 million and $3.7 million, including stock holdings in around 15 companies. Justice Alito, who holds common stock in three companies, has net assets between $330,000 and $930,000.
 The justices' stock portfolios have led to a fair number of recusals. Justice Breyer withdrew from a case, decided in 2008, concerning securities fraud. Partly because of justices' stock holdings, the court could not even hear a case that term involving a lawsuit filed against companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa.
 As in past years, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter appear to be the wealthiest members of the court.
 Though Justice Ginsburg reported a net worth of around $7.2 million to just under $30 million, her assets could very well have decreased in the past year. Her estimated worth for 2007 was between at least $11 million and as much as $50 million.
 Justice Souter's net worth remained roughly the same, between about $6 million and $27.6 million.
 For the third straight year, Justice Clarence Thomas reported collecting either a book advance or royalties from HarperCollins. He received more than $300,000 from the publishing company in 2008 and has now collected more than a $1 million in the last three years. Still, his reported assets were between $150,000 and $410,000, the same as the previous year.
 The net assets of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who supplemented his salary with teaching positions at the University of the Pacific and the University of Michigan, are roughly the same -- between $165,000 and $430,000.
 Justice Antonin Scalia continued to log the most expense-paid trips on the court, traveling to such destinations as Wyoming and Montana (twice) as well as Iceland and Ireland. Mr. Scalia reported taking 30 trips in 2008, down from 33 the previous year. His reported assets were between roughly $1.2 million and $2.8 million.
 Justice John Paul Stevens, who has been on the court since 1975, is worth between some $1.8 million and $6.9 million.
 The chief justice's annual salary is $217,400, and the associate justices earn $208,100 a year.

HEADLINE: Russia Says Dollar Makes A Poor Reserve Currency

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 

 BODY:
President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who rarely misses a chance to accuse the United States of causing the global financial crisis, told an economic forum on Friday that wobbly American financial policy had made the dollar an undesirable currency for reserves held by central banks.
 Russia, along with China and other nations, has floated the idea of forming a supernational currency to supplant the dollar, perhaps using the so-called special drawing rights units of the International Monetary Fund as a basis. 
 Given the weaknesses in the American economy, Mr. Medvedev said, relying on the dollar as extensively as is the case today could mean building a postcrisis financial system on legs of clay. Banks should look also at regional currencies, like the ruble, he said.
 Wresting some control of the world's financial architecture from the United States is a theme often raised by Russia, and even more so during the global recession. Russian authorities' comments on the issue have at times helped depress dollar exchange rates with other currencies because of concerns that central banks would dump the currency. But independent economists generally dismiss Moscow's position -- and the offering of the ruble as a reserve currency -- as highly unrealistic, particularly given the wobbly recent history of the ruble.
 ''The artificial and monopolar support of a monopoly on key segments of the world economy became the fundamental cause of the crisis,'' Mr. Medvedev said in a keynote address to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, an annual opportunity for Russian authorities to lay out their economic policy thinking and court foreign investors.
 With the recent upswing in oil prices and Russian stock markets, investor interest has returned to the country, and dozens of chief executives and more than 200 portfolio investors attended the gathering here this week.
 As Russian officials have before, Mr. Medvedev laid blame for the global recession on what he characterized as ''one center of consumption, which is financed by deficit, and correspondingly, an accumulation of debt, one reserve currency that is powerful as never before, and one predominating system of evaluating risks and assets.''
 In other words, the United States.
 Still, in a nod to Russia's role as one of the world's 20 largest economies, whose leaders have met to coordinate a response to the downturn, Mr. Medvedev also struck a constructive note, saying that all governments had reacted well to the crisis.
 He praised the ability of governments to ''work in concert'' to put the brakes on downward trends. Policy makers, he said, are torn between an approach that would largely conserve the current global regulatory regime, and an overhaul that could interfere with recovery but reduce the likelihood of future crises.
 Mr. Medvedev suggested that Russia would like to see more substantive change -- including an end to such an oversize role for the dollar.
 Russia's economic critique of the dollar, continuing for several years, comes alongside increased political tensions with the United States.
 Yet Russia's central bank, too, keeps about 50 percent of its reserves in dollars.
 To stabilize exchange rates, Mr. Medvedev said, governments should create a new reserve currency. Russia has backed an expanded role for special drawing rights units of the International Monetary Fund.
 Authorities in Moscow also took steps to push countries to hold rubles as a reserve by encouraging trade in Russian oil and natural gas to be denominated in rubles, rather than dollars, as is the case now. But trading partners have preferred contracts in dollars.

HEADLINE: At Ceremony Looking Back, Call by Obama to End Stalemate in Middle East

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and NICHOLAS KULISH; Jeff Zeleny reported from Dresden, and Nicholas Kulish from Weimar, Germany. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Germany 

 BODY:
President Obama on Friday intensified his pledge to unlock the Middle East stalemate, sending an envoy next week to pursue his call for a two-state solution, as he toured a former concentration camp that he said served as a lesson to ''be ever-vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time.''
 The president met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on the contentious issues of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the nuclear program in Iran and the global financial crisis. But he quickly moved to the next stop of a trip built on his biography, visiting the site of Buchenwald, not far from where his great-uncle helped liberate prisoners in World War II. 
 ''To this day, there are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful,'' Mr. Obama said. ''This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts, a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history.'' 
 The poignant imagery, which was broadcast on television here, was intended to underscore what Mr. Obama had described the day before in Cairo as America's ''unbreakable'' bond with Israel. His speech there, which also called for two states, angered some in Israel because of his forceful opposition to expanding existing settlements on the West Bank.
 The president said Friday that ''the moment is now'' to begin aggressively seeking a Middle East peace settlement. In addition to sending his envoy, George J. Mitchell, to the region, Mr. Obama also put Israelis and Palestinians on notice that it was up to them to make ''difficult compromises.''
 ''The Palestinians have to get serious about creating a security environment that is required for Israel to feel confident,'' he said. ''Israelis are going to have to take some difficult steps.'' 
 He added: ''Ultimately, the United States can't force peace upon the parties, but what we've tried to do is to clear away some of the misunderstandings so we can at least begin to have frank dialogue.'' 
 At a joint news conference at Dresden Castle, the German and American leaders dismissed suggestions that their relationship was chilly. 
 An early issue of contention between them was diverging approaches for solving the financial crisis. The two leaders talked about an economic stimulus, aides to Mr. Obama said, with Mrs. Merkel specifically calling for ''an exit strategy.'' In principle, Mr. Obama agreed, his aides said, but no closure was reached. They pledged to work together on climate change, on Middle East peace and on trying to persuade Iran to abandon what the West fears is a nuclear program to build an atomic bomb, but which Tehran says is for civilian purposes. 
 ''With President Barack Obama,'' Mrs. Merkel said, ''there is actually a unique opportunity now to see to it that this peace process -- or let's perhaps be more careful -- this negotiation process is to be revived again.''
 There was no sign of progress on Washington's desire for Europeans to accept prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, as Mr. Obama moves to redeem a pledge to close the detention center in Cuba. Mrs. Merkel said that she was pleased by the administration's effort to close the prison, but that a decision had not been made about accepting detainees. 
 ''I don't anticipate it's going to be resolved in the next two or three months,'' Mr. Obama said.
 The overnight stop in Dresden, in addition to the bilateral meeting with the chancellor, served as a bookend for the president's address in Cairo. In many ways, Germany is an ideal location for the themes of reconciliation and fresh starts that Mr. Obama struck in calling for a new alliance to the Islamic world.
 As Mr. Obama noted in Dresden, Germany went from a fascist dictatorship to a successful democracy, one prepared to publicly admit past mistakes and learn from them in perhaps a more comprehensive way than any other nation. The message was embodied by Mrs. Merkel's appearance at Buchenwald. 
 Indeed, it was Buchenwald, perhaps more than anywhere else, that embodied the contradiction of a civilized society's descent into organized barbarism. The camp sits just a few miles outside Weimar, one of the country's leading cultural centers.
 As he walked by the crematory ovens, barbed-wire fences and guard towers at Buchenwald, Mr. Obama called the site the ''ultimate rebuke'' to those who deny or seek to minimize the Holocaust. He paid tribute to those who died at the camp and others, saying, ''They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own.''
 With his hands behind his back, Mr. Obama walked through the former concentration camp, flanked by Mrs. Merkel and Elie Wiesel, a Nobel peace prize winner, writer and Holocaust survivor, who lived through a death march from Auschwitz to Buchenwald and was at the camp when it was liberated in April 1945.
 Mr. Wiesel spoke movingly about the death of his father a few months before the liberation of the camp, calling his journey there ''a way of coming and visiting my father's grave.'' He added, ''But he had no grave. His grave is somewhere in the sky, which has become in those years the largest cemetery of the Jewish people.''
 Mr. Obama also seized upon a personal connection to the camp. His great-uncle, Charles Payne, helped liberate a sub-camp of Buchenwald called Ohrdruf. Mrs. Merkel, who like Mr. Wiesel and Mr. Obama laid a long-stemmed white rose in memory of the dead, spoke of the German responsibility ''to do everything possible that something like that never happens again.'' 
 She added, ''I bow before all the victims.''
 Volkhard Knigge, who directs the Buchenwald foundation and led Mr. Obama and Mrs. Merkel on their tour, said he believed the president's visit to the site and his speech in Cairo were linked.
 ''He wanted to underline that he will take a real dialogue very seriously, but on the other hand a real dialogue does not mean appeasement, toward dictatorship or anti-Semitism,'' Mr. Knigge said in an interview after the tour.
 The fierce, and still contentious, aerial bombing in Dresden at the end of World War II destroyed the baroque Frauenkirche, or Church of Our Lady, which the president and Mrs. Merkel visited on Friday, stopping for a brief prayer. Although they spent several hours together, their appearances renewed speculation here about how friendly they really were beyond the diplomatic smiles and handshakes.
 Mr. Obama dismissed the suggestion that his relationship with Mrs. Merkel was strained. Asked by a German television reporter about it, he playfully admonished the press.
 ''Stop it, all of you,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We have more than enough problems out there without manufacturing problems.''

HEADLINE: Hints of Hope in Jobless Data Even as Rate Jumps to 9.4%

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The American economy shed 345,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate spiked to 9.4 percent, but the losses were far smaller than anticipated, amplifying hopes of recovery.
 Economists described the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, released Friday, as an unambiguous sign of improvement, yet also clear evidence of broadening national distress, as millions of households grapple with joblessness and lost working hours. 
 The fact that a report showing the highest unemployment rate in more than a quarter-century was embraced optimistically testified to the stark fears over the economy in recent months.
 ''The free fall that the job market was in does finally appear to be tapering off,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ''It's the prelude to an economic and job recovery later this year.'' 
 Although stock markets shrugged off the report, interest rates on government debt surged, hitting their highest levels in six months, as investors bet that inflationary pressure would accompany any recovery. 
 The Obama administration pointed to the slowdown in job losses as proof that its $787 million package of spending measures was stimulating the economy. 
 ''Today is a sign that we are making progress,'' said Christina Romer, a White House economic adviser. 
 But experts emphasized that the slowing pace of deterioration did not alter the reality that the economy remained very weak.
 ''These are still terrible numbers,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''We're a million miles away from a recovery.''
 Rather than a sign of renewed vigor, the May jobs report suggests merely the end of panic unleashed last fall, when the investment house Lehman Brothers crumbled, freezing credit through much of the economy.
 ''That wild disgorging of inventories and workers that we saw in the aftermath of Lehman, what you're seeing is the reversal of that dynamic,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG. ''You had companies throughout the world that suddenly had serious concerns about access to capital, and they slashed spending and cut workers well beyond any connection to demand. There's now a better tone to the data.''
 But if primal fear has ended, comfort is nowhere to be found. Home prices appear to have hit bottom in some areas of the country, but construction remains weak. The auto industry and retailing remain in distress. The job market is likely to remain in the doldrums for many months, Mr. Barbera said.
 A home foreclosure crisis is growing, thus far unchecked by an Obama administration program aimed at stemming the problem. As more foreclosed properties land on markets, real estate prices are falling further, adding to the losses and uncertainties confronting banks.
 ''That's now the most significant threat to the economic recovery,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 For more than a decade, economic growth and attendant American job opportunities were fueled by swelling wealth and liberal access to credit. As home prices soared, homeowners availed themselves of myriad forms of credit that turned increased real estate values into cash. They sprinkled those funds on an array of industries, generating jobs from auto factories and lumber mills to construction companies and restaurants.
 Now, as paychecks disappear and home prices fall, people are increasingly inclined to save -- a rough transition in a country in which consumer spending makes up roughly 70 percent of economic activity.
 ''People are not going to be moving forward based on housing wealth, and they're not going to be taking on debt,'' said Lawrence Mishel, president of the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''They've got to get wage growth.''
 Yet wage growth has been stagnating even as gasoline and medical costs rise, putting pressure on household finances. Average hourly wages were 3.1 percent higher last month than they were in May 2008, but the month-to-month increases in April and May were just 0.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $18.54, from $18.52, according to the Labor Department. Wages for manufacturing workers fell 0.1 percent.
 The jobs report presented a statistical puzzle. After shedding an average of more than 700,000 jobs each month during the first quarter, the economy lost 504,000 jobs in April, according to revised data, and the number was smaller still in May. Yet the unemployment rate leapt from an already high 8.9 percent, reinforcing fears it would reach double digits.
 This disconnect owes to the way in which the government collects data. The number of jobs comes from a survey of employers, while the unemployment data is derived from a survey of households. In April and May, the number of people who told surveyors they were actively looking for work increased by more than one million. These people would have previously been considered outside the work force and thus excluded from the unemployment calculation. Now, they are officially back in the hunt, yet struggling to secure work.
 Manufacturers cut 156,000 jobs in May, with worse on the way: General Motors announced plans this week to close or idle 14 American plants, imperiling as many as 20,000 workers. 
 Construction jobs fell by 59,000, though that was a marked improvement from just a month ago, when employment in that industry sank by 108,000 jobs.
 Professional and business services shed 51,000 jobs, though that represented a slower pace of losses than in recent months. Health care remained a rare bright spot, adding 23,500 jobs. Restaurants and bars added nearly 9,000 jobs. 
 The economy has lost six million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and some economists anticipate two million more to come. Even after the economy resumes growth -- perhaps later this year -- businesses will probably be conservative, cognizant that credit is relatively tight, and consumers will be inclined to save. Instead of hiring full-time workers, many may rely on temporary employees or add hours for existing employees.
 ''The jobless rate is going to continue to rise,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group. ''It's a dismal job market. It's going to remain awful easily for the balance of this year. Even when the economy begins to recover, we might be witnessing the mother of all jobless recoveries.''
 That would keep the pressure on the seven million Americans who have been out of work for 15 weeks or longer.
 Since losing his job as a legal courier in February, Dante Whitfield, 35, has been riding the bus around San Jose, Calif., in a futile quest for work, subsisting on unemployment checks and the Value Menu at McDonald's.
 ''There's days I come home in tears,'' Mr. Whitfield said. ''You just feel lost. You don't know what to do.''

HEADLINE: An Idea for Improving Health Care in America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Keeping Them Honest,'' by Paul Krugman (column, June 5): 
 The goal of health care reform is to bring about lower costs -- or at least reduced inflation -- and improved quality. I am not opposed to a public plan; in fact, I think it would add some healthy competition to private insurers. But it will have very little to do with advancing health reform.
 What our system needs are more Kaiser, Geisinger, Mayo and Intermountain health systems. These are the integrated delivery systems that are already delivering higher quality and lower costs. But the Medicare and Medicaid programs have been no more successful than private insurers in supporting the growth of these organizations.
 If you want to see real health reform, we need to have incentives to encourage more of these entities to emerge. The accountable care organization proposals being considered for Medicare are a good start. Much more, however, can be done, like insurance regulations that would make it easier for these organizations to directly contract with employers and individuals. That would provide cost advantages and quality improvements that private insurer plans would not be able to match.
 Private insurers have much more to fear from a health system with integrated provider systems than they do from a public plan option.
 Timothy Ford West Orange, N.J., June 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 If the Republican mantra that ''private business will always do a better job than government'' is true, America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry lobby, need not worry about public option insurance. The government will lose the competition.
 On the other hand ...

HEADLINE: What Would Mao Drive? A Little Red ... Hummer

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Even in a world mostly done being amazed by the ironies of globalization, last week managed to produce something fresh and previously unfathomable: General Motors, newly bankrupt and struggling to raise cash, agreed to sell its Hummer division to a company from China.
 Yes, that Hummer, maker of the famously gas-guzzling behemoths whose menacing width and armor trace their provenance to the American military, is now set to become the property of Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, in a land officially still called the People's Republic of China. 
 It might seem incongruous, this plaything for the unabashed American road warrior shifting to a country where the bicycle once ruled and collectivism was an organizing principle. (What next? Harley-Davidson snapped up by the Vietnamese?) But that's just until you contemplate the realities of modern China, and the nouveau riche in the growing suburbs, setting down lawn furniture inside gated complexes of villas, shopping at big-box stores and driving luxury cars. China seems intent on nurturing the very sorts of landscapes and consumer attitudes that produced the Hummer.
 More than a merely economic event -- the latest sign of China's rise and American struggles -- the deal is a cultural moment. It seems no accident that a Chinese company is taking possession of Hummer. China has come to embrace many of the attributes and modes of consumption that Americans may reflexively consider their own, complete with the sprawl and tangle of highways familiar to any resident of Los Angeles or Atlanta.
 As China has cast off its ideological past and aggressively modernized its cities, it might reasonably have been expected to look to Europe or Japan for models of urban planning. Like Japan -- home to one of the most sophisticated rail networks on earth -- China is densely populated and dependent on imported oil. As is true in Europe, China's major cities are surrounded by productive agricultural lands, making tightly clustered growth seem prudent.
 Instead, in a choice familiar to Americans, China has put the automobile at the center of contemporary life. China has torn down older buildings in every major city to make way for more vehicles. It has erected an impressive network of highways crisscrossing the vast country. Air quality and energy efficiency have been outweighed by reverence for the car.
 This has not happened randomly. In recent times, China's leaders have unleashed enormous quantities of state finance to seed auto ventures in every province, spurring industries that have grown along with the ubiquity of the car. Petrochemicals, steel, glass-making and rubber have all expanded to feed auto-making. Tourism and retail shopping have increased as more Chinese take possession of steering wheels.
 Along the way, many Chinese aspirations have come to focus on car ownership. In a country where so many people look back with bitterness on the regimented days of Maoism, and where public transportation still involves packing into belching buses and gruesomely crowded trains, the car has become a vessel for Chinese dreams. 
 ''Why do you want a car?'' I asked a young professional couple shopping at a car lot outside Beijing in 2002. The question elicited an irritated glare from the woman, as if I were condescending. ''Same reason you want a car,'' she said. ''We want what you want.'' 
 She did not mean merely the ability to go where she pleased, but also the geography the car enables -- the villas with their backyards and modern conveniences; the superstores selling microwave-ready food; the new golf courses. 
 Asked about the atrocious smog blanketing Beijing and the traffic jams that made driving there a threat to mental health, she shrugged. Anyway, the car takes a growing slice of wealthy urbanites into the countryside for the pure pleasure of it -- this, too, once unthinkable in a nation that remembers how city dwellers were forcibly dispatched to the hinterlands to slop pigs during the Cultural Revolution.
 As driving has evolved from a mere way to get around to a mode of life, sales of passenger cars in China have grown by 20 percent to 30 percent per year since 2005. In January, for the first time ever, China's monthly vehicle sales exceeded those in the United States.
 Still, it would be wrong, if tempting, to view China as some sort of time capsule of 1950s American suburbia, that age before the vernacular came to include ''climate change'' and ''non-renewable resource.'' China is moving to impose fuel efficiency standards tougher than those in the United States while developing hybrid cars. Most car owners favor cheaper, smaller models.
 But much as everywhere else, the auto has become a status symbol in China, and in ways that collide with the country's history as a paragon of anti-imperialism: Cadillacs, that icon of American capitalist success, are now made on Chinese soil along with Audis and Buicks. In the new Chinese social divide, the middle class hews to economical vehicles with tiny engines, while the wealthy fuss with automatic climate control in their luxury sedans.
 So it actually seems fitting that Hummer will be a Chinese brand. A vehicle that makes sense only as a pastime, with its miserable gas mileage, the Hummer has become an object increasingly shunned in the United States as a sign of wasteful decadence (not to mention something that most Americans can no longer afford). China, primed to consume and long since shorn of its collectively imposed thrift, will take a crack at extracting profit by selling the hulking beasts.

HEADLINE: Deals Where Summer Is Winter

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WITH the travel industry reeling, it's not hard to find a vacation bargain. But for American travelers, some of the deepest discounts are Down Under. 
 A number of factors are making Australia look like a steal this summer. Just as the winter season in Australia is starting, the United States dollar has gained close to 25 percent over the last year against the Australian dollar, to 1.27 Australian dollars, bolstering Americans' buying power. On top of that, resorts from Uluru to Melbourne are offering discounts of as much 30 percent to lure guests amid the travel slump. 
 And airfare -- one of the biggest expenses of any trip to Australia -- has been slashed thanks to new entrants in the trans-Pacific air travel market. 
 ''There will probably never be a better time to visit Australia in your lifetime,'' said Robbert J. van Bloemendaal, the Australian-born president of the Travel Leaders office in Rowlett, Tex. ''Last year, the best you could do, depending on the season, was about $900 with a normal discount economy fare, to about $1,500'' for a round-trip fare. This year, he said, he has seen one-way fares ''as low as $299.'' 
 While fares have been running slightly higher in recent weeks, he added, prices are still ''nowhere near last year.'' 
 Qantas and United Airlines, which have long dominated the market with nonstop routes between the United States and Australia, are facing fresh competition from V Australia, a new airline from Richard Branson's Virgin Blue Group. It began flying daily between Los Angeles and Sydney in February with nonstop round-trip flights from $729. 
 In April, V Australia added three flights a week between Los Angeles and Brisbane, with rates from $738. It plans to add another route, to Melbourne, in September. And come July 1, Delta will add its first daily nonstop between Los Angeles and Sydney. 
 All of this new competition has forced Qantas and United to answer with fare cuts. A recent online search turned up nonstop round-trip fares from the West Coast to Australia in July as low as $690 on United and $790 on Qantas, including taxes and fees, and $864 from Newark on United, with a stop in San Francisco. 
 Once on land, the savings continue. Rooms at Quest Potts Point, formerly the Storrier, in Sydney, start at 165 Australian dollars, or about $130, down from about $175 last June, when rates began at 185 local dollars a night. 
 One- and two-bedroom timber cabins at the Jemby Rinjah Eco Lodge in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales start at 170 dollars a night for two adults and two children under 12, or about $133. And the Majestic Roof Garden Hotel in Adelaide is offering a special rate of 165 dollars, with breakfast, down from about 180 normally.
 Jetting around the country has also gotten cheaper. Qantas has been offering its Aussie AirPass, which includes an international round-trip ticket and three domestic Australian flights for as low as $999. Virgin Blue is offering its own air-pass deal from 69 Australian dollars a flight. 
 Package deals that combine airfare, hotel and sightseeing are yielding some of the best bargains. Qantas, for example, has been advertising $999 summer package deals that include six nights in Sydney, admission to the city's aquarium and a flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco.
 V Australia has been offering four-night Brisbane Getaways in conjunction with Sunspots International, a South Pacific wholesale company, for $986 a person. The package includes a night at the budget Hotel George Williams in Brisbane and three nights at the Islander Resort Hotel on the Gold Coast. 
 Many individual tour operators are also passing savings on to travelers. 
 Swain Tours, a major seller of South Pacific travel on the East Coast, has slashed its 15-day Australian Experience by $600, to $1,635 a person based on double occupancy. The trip includes round-trip airfare from Los Angeles or San Francisco, internal flights and four nights each in Melbourne, Cairns and Sydney. 
 And AAT Kings has slashed rates on 13-day tours by $642 a couple, to $3,959 for ''last minute'' Tropical Discovery tours in July, which visit Fraser Island, Brampton Island and the Great Barrier Reef. 
 International visitor arrivals were expected to fall by 4.1 percent this year, according to the latest forecast from Tourism Australia, made in December. This would be the worst drop since 1989, when a pilots' strike constricted travel. 
 The country, which relies heavily on tourism, is aggressively marketing its vacation value with a campaign linked to the movie ''Australia.'' The film's director, Baz Luhrmann, also produced a weighty tourism video, in which a stressed-out Manhattanite on the verge of a breakup is visited by an Aboriginal youth who magically transports her to Australia. There, in a ''walkabout,'' she presumably reconnects with herself and her partner. 
 Melodrama aside, the campaign cuts straight to the wallet, with a range of vacation offers aimed at Americans, like a six-night Wine and Wilderness Retreat from $1,885 a person, including flights, hotels and a rental car. 
 The tourism agency has also created an interactive price comparison widget that travel sellers have been using to demonstrate how far the United States dollar goes in Australia compared with Europe. A pint of beer: $3 in Australia versus $7 in Britain, it notes; a city tour: $27 in Sydney versus $38 in London. (And those prices reflect the higher exchange rates of last fall.) 
 New Zealand, where the United States dollar has been buying about 1.60 local dollars, is also trying to bank on its increasing affordability with comparisons to Europe. ''Compared to a holiday in the U.K. or Europe, it's like getting a champagne vacation on a beer budget,'' states its tourism Web site,. 
 Australian Pacific Touring is offering savings of up to $1,540 a couple for trips booked by June 30 for travel in October and November. And Qantas has been offering fares from New York to Auckland from $960 a round trip, and $1,010 to Wellington, Christchurch or Queensland. 
 While it's technically winter in the Southern Hemisphere when its summer in the United States, temperatures are mild all year in much of Australia. And its northern destinations, including the Great Barrier Reef and the Northern Territory, rich in Aboriginal culture, are especially popular in June, July and August. 
 But if you want to visit the Outback at these low rates, don't wait too long. Tourism Australia says that its global campaign has already helped drive bookings, and that traffic at its site, Australia.com, has jumped significantly in recent months. 
 Mr. van Bloemendaal of Travel Leaders warns, ''Prices will go up as the economy improves, and these specials will be a memory.''

HEADLINE: The Offset Question

The Offset Question
 To the Editor:
 In ''Carbon Offsets: A Small Price to Pay for Efficiency'' (Economic View, May 31), Robert H. Frank wrote that ''there is no reason that fraud should be harder to curb in carbon-offset markets than in other domains.'' 
 Unfortunately, the very nature of offset markets provides a fundamental challenge that is not present in most markets. This is because offset markets, essentially, pay some companies for carbon they haven't produced. 
 To measure the true level of carbon that is offset by a payment, we must know what the recipient would have done in the payment's absence -- whether, for example it would have reduced its pollution regardless of the payment.
 Rather than measure what someone actually does, this requires, somehow, a measurement of a what-if scenario. This goes beyond the domain of measurement and into the realm of mind-reading, something that regulators haven't been very successful at to date. James Bushnell
 Berkeley, Calif., June 1
 The writer is research director of the University of California Energy Institute.
 To the Editor:
 The column used the hypothetical example of a New Yorker who worries about the fuel used to ship winter tomatoes from California -- and the effect that this would have on global warming. To assuage his guilt, he could pay $10 for carbon offsets and have his fresh tomatoes.
 But would the $10 also cover the carbon emissions related to the energy a data center uses to track the carbon offsets? 
 Perhaps we'd all be better off if people just started growing (and canning) their own tomatoes. Tom Short

HEADLINE: After a Life Selling Toys, He's Selling His Own

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

DATELINE: Pittsfield, Mass. 

 BODY:
 WHEN Donald Kaufman decided that he wanted to sell his personal toy collection, an unparalleled trove of some 7,000 antiques from around the world, the news spread quickly among collectors. And it provoked the sort of market upheaval one might expect if the Getty Trust announced it was getting out of the art business.
 ''Nobody knew just how many toys he had,'' said Jeanne Bertoia, the owner of Bertoia Auctions of Vineland, N.J., which is handling the sale. ''People saw what he was buying, but no one had seen his collection.''
 Part of the allure comes from Mr. Kaufman's role as a co-founder of the defunct KB Toys store chain, from which he retired in 1981. He has given no reason for selling the collection he spent 59 years amassing, except for a nod toward destiny. ''It's time for me to sell,'' he said. 
 In mid-March, Bertoia Auctions sold a portion of the collection, more than 1,400 toys, bringing in $4.2 million, well above the $3 million that Bertoia had estimated. (Mr. Kaufman's estimate was $2 million.) Another auction is scheduled for September, after which Mr. Kaufman will still own more toys than he'll have sold. Four to five more auctions are planned.
 At 78, Mr. Kaufman is a tall man with a gentle grandfatherly manner that does little to reveal his ruthlessness in pursuit of pre-World War II toys. His approach to collecting combines erudition and gamesmanship. He enjoys telling the story of a particularly important sale. He rented a U-Haul trailer, hitched it to his capacious Ford Econoline van and parked the rig in front of the auction house as an act of intimidation against other potential buyers. 
 Transportation toys are Mr. Kaufman's primary interest, and most pieces in the collection are cars and trucks. Airplanes are a distant third. The toys' domain is a four-level windowless annex to the average-size country house here in western Massachusetts where Mr. Kaufman and his wife, Sally, live.
 The Kaufmans call it ''the museum,'' though that makes it sound extravagant or grandiose, which undresses some of its charm. Mr. Kaufman assembled the displays himself. He bought plain white shelves at Home Depot and installed them himself. Entering the Kaufman museum, a visitor found antique toy cars parked bumper to bumper on shelves that ran wall to wall and floor to ceiling. There were taxicabs in small, medium and large. Old trucks bore signs for brands long gone: Richfield Gasoline, Filene's Sons and Sheffield Farms Sealect. There were ice trucks, water trucks, dump trucks and fire engines. The floor -- covered with carpet the color of blue topaz -- was occupied by a small fleet of pedal cars.
 ''There are no duplicates,'' Mr. Kaufman said proudly in a voice graveled by age. ''Only variations.''
 Some of the variations were so slight that it was difficult to see the differences. Along one stretch of wall, two red tow trucks were berthed nose-to-tail, one with round windows and the other with square ones. A line of four cast-iron taxicabs from the early 1920s provided an excellent exercise in observation -- the only variations were in the color of the tires (silver and white) and hoods (orange and black). The March auction did little to decrease the jam in the museum, so there was not much room to move around. 
 Ms. Bertoia said the collection was divided into five categories: pedal cars; American cast-iron toys; tin toys, which are more delicate and mostly from Europe; pressed-steel toys; and light pressed-steel toys, including those from an American toymaker, Kingsbury.
 ''Usually you'd see between 25 and 30 toys in a good collection,'' said Mike Bertoia, Ms. Bertoia's son, of the Kingsburys. Mr. Kaufman, he said, has more than 150.
 It takes a moment to see anything other than the sheer magnitude of the collection. Tighten the focus and intricate details emerge: the mechanical meter in a taxi, a hand-painted mustache on a driver, the brass fixtures of a fire engine's water pump. The auction catalog showed that most were in very good, excellent, near-mint or pristine condition.
 Sitting on a shelf along the staircase between the first and second floors, a white wind-up ''Gordon Bennett'' racecar made around 1910 by Guntherman of Germany hardly looked a century old. On the underside of the car was a small bellows connected to the rear axle, which Mr. Bertoia said still provided the car with engine noise. Another German toy, the Marklin Fidelitas, a whimsical three-foot-long train of delicate hand-painted clown cars, brought $103,500, the highest sale price at the first auction.
 Mr. Kaufman likes to say that he wonders what the toys would say if they could talk. He explained that when he looked at an Arcade Mack high dump truck, he saw more than a toy vehicle. ''I see the rubber factory that made the tires,'' he said. ''I see the metal factory, the press -- the original cars.'' 
 Born and raised in Pittsfield, Mr. Kaufman was always interested in antique cars and trucks. The first toy in his collection was an International Harvester Red Baby truck that he bought for $4 in 1950, the year he began working for the family business. 
 KB stands for Kaufman Brothers. Mr. Kaufman's father and uncle founded the company in 1922 as a wholesaler. They carried goods as diverse as confections and sundries, sodas, razors, stuffed animals and watches, Mr. Kaufman said. Toys did not come along until after World War II.
 In 1958, Kaufman Brothers expanded into retail, became KB Toys in the 1960s, and stopped wholesaling altogether in 1972. Mr. Kaufman does not boast about his role in the business, but he was the first vice president and had a hand in turning KB Toys into one of the biggest toy chains in the world.
 Mr. Kaufman attended his first major auction shortly after he retired and found a community that welcomed his growing curiosity about antique toys. ''I started talking to other collectors,'' he said. ''You learn everything from them.''
 Mrs. Kaufman told a story about one of her first experiences, when the collection of the closed Perelman Toy Museum in Philadelphia was being sold. The sale was held in the museum, and the buyers -- each guaranteeing to spend at least $50,000 -- had to race for the pieces they wanted. 
 In many ways, the Kaufman collection is a diary of their lives together. The annex is a very private place. Mr. Kaufman said fewer than 25 people had been inside. 
 He said he was not keeping a single toy, not even that first International Harvester Red Baby truck. ''These aren't my toys,'' he said a couple of times during the day. ''I am just taking care of them for now.''

HEADLINE: Honk If You Think It's Over

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE panic in the Manhattan real estate market of the winter of 2009 lifted in the last few weeks, brokers say, as more and more buyers and sellers have found the courage and the comfort level to sign on the dotted line. A bidding war has even occasionally broken out, though at prices far below those of a year ago, and often considerably below asking price. 
 ''When we were in free fall, nobody was willing to pull the trigger,'' said John B. Gomes, a broker at Core Group Marketing. ''Sellers are more realistic and buyers are optimistic, and we have the lowest interest rates in a generation.''
 There is considerable room for skepticism, since the number of closed sales filed with the city remains near the lowest level in many years. Prices are still down as much as 30 percent and show no signs of rising, low-ball offers remain common and some of these latest deals may never come to fruition. But brokers say the climate has definitely changed, producing sales at all price points, as some buyers, tired of looking and waiting, are seizing the moment. Suddenly, brokers say, it is exciting to be in real estate again. 
 Deals picked up first among studios and one-bedrooms, which benefited from a combination of lower prices, reduced interest rates and incentives for first-time buyers. Then apartments selling under $3 million began to stir. Finally, in the last few weeks, a number of significant deals have been done in the somnolent market for trophy apartments listed above $10 million, brokers say. Sales of many expensive new Manhattan condominiums remain sluggish, however.
 At Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate brokerage firm, contracts were off 60 percent last fall, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and a steep plunge in the stock market brought deal making to a near halt. But Hall F. Willkie, the company's president, said that as spring -- the peak selling season in New York -- got under way, contracts picked up sharply. Sales, off 30 percent in April from a year earlier, were off less than 10 percent in May compared with the same month in 2008.
 ''We are busy, very busy and the tempo is intense, and that is all great,'' Mr. Willkie said. 
 At Halstead Property, Diane Ramirez, the company's president, said that contract signings in May had surpassed the number of deals reached the year before. She said many of the sales were to first-timers, and to buyers who had long been priced out of the Manhattan market but were now seeing an opportunity to get in. Some buyers who have lost out on previous deals are showing up at open houses and making offers on the spot, she said.
 Bill Kowalczuk, a broker with the Corcoran Group, says that what has changed is that buyers are ''willing to step up to the plate'' and when they do, ''sellers are listening.''
 Mr. Kowalczuk has been trying for 17 months to sell a four-story town house, in need of considerable work, on West 21st Street in Chelsea near Ninth Avenue. By January he had cut the asking price by more than 25 percent to just under $4.8 million. A few weeks ago, he said, three buyers made serious offers.
 A deal was almost immediately struck with one couple. But after a bank reneged on a previously approved mortgage, they backed out. Mr. Kowalczuk quickly went to contract with a second buyer, who was planning to finance the purchase by taking out a home equity loan on property in London. The final price was below $4 million. 
 The rise in activity does not mean that the local real estate recession is over. Prices remain sharply lower than they were a year ago, by about 30 percent, and are likely to continue to drift downward over many months, or even years, until the local economy, heavily dependent on Wall Street profits, picks up. 
 There is also some debate about whether the bump up in activity, which many brokers say has kept them busy showing apartments seven days a week, represents a predictable seasonal uptick, or a shift in market psychology. 
 Actual closings filed with the city's Department of Finance are sparse, but these often lag behind the market, because closings can occur months after a deal is struck, especially when co-op or condominium boards have a right to review contracts.
 As of the end of May, the overall number of apartments closing in the second quarter was off 55 percent from the same period a year earlier, though up slightly from the first quarter. Co-op closings rose significantly from the first quarter, while condo closings fell as the backlog of contracts signed in new buildings many months ago began to shrink.
 Both average and median apartment prices are off roughly 15 percent so far in the second quarter, compared with same period a year ago, with the median at $812,000, the lowest level in more than two years, according to a tabulation of city property filings. 
 Jonathan Miller, an appraiser at Miller Samuel who prepares market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, confirmed that inventory levels began to fall this spring as sales picked up. But he questioned how significant the trend would turn out to be.
 ''You did see an upturn in activity this time of year,'' he said, but ''it was not a robust spring.'' Mr. Miller said that the spring did not ''undo the damage that occurred last fall'' during the banking crisis, and that prices still appeared to be slipping, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year. 
 Mr. Miller says he is particularly worried about new developments that have not cut prices as much as many individual sellers have. Mortgages can be difficult to come by in these buildings, making it harder for buyers to complete deals. 
 Kirk Henckels, a Stribling broker who prepares a report on the luxury market, doesn't foresee a rise in prices anytime soon. He said he thought they might fall a bit further; he also feels that prices are in the process of stabilizing amid a burst of deal making.
 Last July, Mr. Henckels listed an 18-foot-wide town house at 136 East 80th Street near Lexington Avenue for nearly $12 million. By February the price of the town house, owned by Thomas Flexner, a former vice chairman of Bear Stearns, had been cut by 25 percent, to $8.95 million. After languishing over a slow winter, it went into contract at the end of May.
 Mr. Henckels said that over the winter, buyers felt they were in a ''deflationary market'' and had no reason to buy, since prices would most likely keep falling. With prices now off 30 percent, buyers feel the damage has been done and are tired of looking, he said. 
 ''It's rather remarkable,'' he said. ''I did five to six deals in the last two weeks at all price ranges.''
 John Burger, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens who just sold a $12 million apartment at One Beacon Court on 58th Street near Third Avenue, attributes the market uptick to the rebound in the stock market since March. 
 ''The stock market has always been a barometer for the health of the Manhattan real estate market,'' he said. ''Buyers are encouraged by the rebound on Wall Street. It has given people a sense of security to stop and make deals.''
 Many of these trends can be seen in the battle over a one-bedroom apartment on the second floor of the Grand Madison at 225 Fifth Avenue and 27th Street. A former showroom building for the gift industry, it was converted to condominiums a few years ago. 
 The apartment has 11-foot ceilings, a stylish kitchen and a home office, and at 1,200 square feet, is unusually large for a one-bedroom. But it has limited views, facing the Museum of Sex rather than Madison Square Park. Two years ago, in a rising market, an investor paid $1.35 million for it, $1.2 million of which was borrowed money. 
 When the rental market soured, the seller came under pressure to pay the mortgage, and Jaylin Ramer, a broker at Bond New York, listed the unit in March for $1.15 million, 15 percent below the original purchase price.
 Along came Luke Sager, a recent Harvard graduate and co-captain of the college soccer team, looking for his first apartment in New York. Working with Emily Beare of Core Group Marketing, he methodically studied the market, visiting 50 apartments over three months, she said. Love struck when he saw the apartment at the Grand Madison.
 But Ms. Ramer was listing the apartment as a ''short-sale opportunity,'' and other buyers were interested. An offer of $1 million in March was turned down cold, but as time went by the seller decided to be more flexible. Then, during a single week in May, three separate offers came in: one for $825,000; a second, Mr. Sager's, for $850,000, half in cash; and a third for $900,000. 
 Mr. Sager countered with a $925,000 bid, all in cash, and to circumvent any more bargaining, insisted that the contract be signed the same day.
 And so it was, but now Mr. Sager is waiting for the seller to complete his negotiations with the bank.
 Ms. Ramer said that she and her colleagues had been involved in three bidding wars in the last week and that their negotiated deals were running ahead of those a year ago. She said she was working with several buyers who had been waiting, sometimes for years, for prices to come down. 
 ''A lot of people I know couldn't afford to live in Manhattan a year ago, not even close,'' she said. ''The people who were waiting on the sidelines are now out, and they are having great values and they are now buying.''
 Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she had several first-time apartment buyers about to sign contracts. These buyers had not been priced out -- they currently live in luxury buildings on the Upper East Side, paying rents of around $8,000 a month. But drawn by the prospect of deals, they are willing to spend up to $8 million or more. 
 ''You don't think of these people as first-time buyers, when they have an oceanfront house in Quogue,'' she said. ''But this guy has always rented in New York.''

HEADLINE: Playing Games With Students' Money

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 ''Latest Threat for College Sports: Students Balk at Paying the Fees,'' June 1: I played football and tennis in high school, and coached youth baseball and soccer. I cannot imagine life without University of Southern California football every fall. 
 Nevertheless, I oppose semiprofessional college athletics financed by students. Sports is extracurricular recreation, a high-level combination of gym for the players and entertainment for the fans.
 If it is to be run as the business it now is, it should pay its costs without compulsory student subsidies. David Eggenschwiler
 Los Angeles
 To the Sports Editor:
 College applicants should check on athletic fees -- if they can. Such fees are often high but almost always hidden. At Virginia's public universities, for example, they can range well above $1,000 per year -- and they are rarely disclosed by the institutions, which generally label them in a catch-all ''tuition and fees.''
 The industry standard is to prey on people's trust and naivete. Folks assume honesty and think fees are nickel-and-dime stuff. They aren't.
 Terry L. Meyers
 Williamsburg, Va. 
 To the Sports Editor:
 Perhaps students would be more amenable to increases if the cost of tuition did not rise more than the rate of inflation every year. Administrators enjoy ever-increasing salaries while the few full-time professors left see their salaries remain flat and their colleagues being replaced by adjuncts who do not receive benefits. Academic scholarships and grants are either nonexistent or nominal, while sports scholarships are handed out liberally to students who would not be accepted were it not for their athletic prowess.Robert Renzulli

 Better Than Nothing
 To the Sports Editor:
 ''Congressman Asks N.B.A. and Union to Rescind Age Minimum for Players,'' June 4: If nothing else, the N.B.A. age rule keeps young men in school and engaged enough in the educational process to try to make it to college even if that time is limited to one year. Putting young men to work in the N.B.A. without an education is far more like slavery than the rule prohibiting such action.

 ''A Handshake Is Hardly Too Much to Ask, Even From a King,'' June 2: LeBron James may think he is not being a bad sport by not congratulating the winning players after his team's defeat, though he might check the Webster's Dictionary definition of sportsman: ''a person who can take a loss or defeat without complaint, or victory without gloating, and who treats his opponents with fairness, generosity, courtesy, etc.'' Abbot Friedland

PERSON: Gerald W. Scully 

HEADLINE: Gerald W. Scully, 67, Wrote Landmark Baseball Analysis

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Gerald W. Scully, a sports economist who offered an early statistical argument that major league baseball players were being exploited by their teams, died on May 4 in San Diego. He was 67 and lived in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. 
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, his daughter Audra said. 
 Mr. Scully wrote on many economic issues, including the relationship between government spending and economic growth; he argued that the optimum size of government is about one-fifth the size of the economy as a whole. But he is best known for an article, ''Pay and Performance in Major League Baseball,'' which was published in The American Economic Review in December 1974, long before the economics of sport became a common field of scholarly inquiry.
 The article described a method of determining the contribution of individual players to the performance of their teams, not only in the won-lost column but in the balance sheets. He used statistical measures like slugging percentage for hitters and the strikeout-to-walk ratio for pitchers and devised a complex formula for determining team revenue that involved a team's won-lost percentage and the market characteristics of its home stadium, among other factors.
 By his calculations, Mr. Scully wrote, Hank Aaron was worth $520,800 to the Atlanta Braves in 1968, and Sandy Koufax $725,000 to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1966, his final season. Aaron never earned more than $250,000 a season in his career, which ended in 1976, and Koufax was paid $130,000 in 1966.
 ''Even mediocre players contribute in excess of $200,000 to team revenues,'' Mr. Scully wrote.
 The article was significant in its use of sport to attack the economist's conundrum of determining the value to a company of an individual's work product. The standard major league player contract at the time included the reserve clause, which essentially restricted the market for a player's services to a single team. In arguing that the clause amounted to economic exploitation of the players, Mr. Scully anticipated an arbitration decision the next year that considerably modified the reserve clause and opened baseball's era of free agency.
 Gerald William Scully was born in Manhattan on June 13, 1941. His father was a bank vice president and branch manager. After graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, Mr. Scully abandoned graduate studies in Chinese to pursue economics. He received a master's degree from the New School for Social Research and a doctorate from Rutgers. 
 Over the years, he taught at Ohio University, Southern Illinois University, Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Dallas. 
 Among his several books are ''The Business of Major League Baseball'' (University of Chicago Press, 1989) and ''Constitutional Environments and Economic Growth'' (Princeton University Press, 1995).
 Mr. Scully's marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Audra, of San Diego, he is survived by a brother, Thomas, of Cary, N.C., and a daughter, Deirdre Grant, of Allen, Tex.

HEADLINE: In Boston, A Threat To 2 Holidays Hits Nerves

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Quick, why is June 17 a government holiday here and only here? 
 If you answer, ''Because the Battle of Bunker Hill took place on that day in 1775,'' you must be the scholarly sort. If you answer, ''Because Boston deserves an extra holiday,'' you must be a public employee here or exceptionally proud of the city's history. 
 And if you say, ''Because lawmakers from Boston refuse to give up a pointless day off,'' you agree with many in the state legislature, who are building a case for axing the holiday amid the financial crisis. 
 State Senator Richard R. Tisei, a Republican from Wakefield, in Middlesex County north of Boston, filed legislation on Friday to eliminate Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day, another Revolutionary War milestone that is celebrated on March 17, as holidays. 
 They have been paid days off for state and local government employees and schoolchildren in Boston and the rest of Suffolk County since 1935 and 1941. (Schools in Somerville also close on both holidays, as do schools in Cambridge on Evacuation Day.)
 Both houses of the legislature recently rejected proposals to end the two holidays, with a 22-to-17 vote in the Senate and a 78-to-78 vote in the House. 
 Those proposals came as amendments to budget bills, and Mr. Tisei, the Senate minority leader, is hoping that a stand-alone bill will draw more support. Gov. Deval Patrick has said he would sign a bill if it passed.
 ''At a time when we are making some real difficult cuts to vital human services,'' said Kyle Sullivan, Mr. Patrick's spokesman, ''it is tough to make the argument to continue pay for these holidays.''
 The savings would be small, about $6 million a year, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group, which estimates that 35,000 public employees get the days off. But Mr. Tisei said the gesture would soothe taxpayers, who have seen ethics scandals on Beacon Hill over the last year and may soon see a 25 percent increase in the sales tax. 
 ''It may sound symbolic to some people,'' Mr. Tisei said, ''but the symbolism is important given the times we are in right now. When people are being laid off by the thousands and taking pay cuts in order to keep their jobs, they look at this as just an extravagance.'' 
 Many Suffolk County lawmakers, who represent Chelsea, Revere, Winthrop and Boston, disagree. Senator Jack Hart, a Democrat from South Boston, warned last month of setting a precedent. 
 ''If we eliminate these holidays today in Suffolk County, then what's next?'' Mr. Hart asked. ''Do we eliminate maybe Presidents' Day? Do we eliminate July 4th? Why don't we get rid of Thanksgiving?''
 Mr. Hart, who did not respond to an interview request, also hinted that the proposal was sour grapes on the part of lawmakers from outside Suffolk County. 
 ''I would not go out to Hampden or Hampshire necessarily and tell your constituents to disregard what your history is,'' he said, referring to counties in western Massachusetts.
 Peter Drummey, librarian of the Massachusetts Historical Society, said the Battle of Bunker Hill and Evacuation Day were indeed seminal events in the nation's history. The British won the Battle of Bunker Hill, he said, but they suffered significant casualties and realized that they had underestimated their opponent. 
 Evacuation Day -- which, conveniently for this heavily Irish city, coincides with St. Patrick's Day -- commemorates the withdrawal of British forces from Boston, another turning point. 
 ''I'd just hate for there to be confusion about the importance of these events -- to have that lost in an argument about whether the holidays are good public policy,'' Mr. Drummey said. 
 Mr. Tisei said that Massachusetts was too aware of its history to let that happen and that parades for Bunker Hill Day usually take place on Sundays anyway. 
 All of Massachusetts celebrates a third Revolutionary War-inspired holiday, Patriots' Day, on the third Monday in April. Its elimination has not been proposed. 
 ''It's different,'' Mr. Tisei said.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Tunes Out the Bad News

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
It was the week that G.M. went into bankruptcy, but for the buoyant stock market the event barely appeared to register. 
 General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Monday in New York, but the shares of other companies were scarcely affected. 
 On Friday, the monthly Labor Department report on employment suggested that the recession was easing. While the unemployment rate rose to 9.4 percent, the number of jobs lost in May, 345,000, was much lower than had been expected and much lower than in previous months. The stock market held on to most of its gains for the week, while Treasury prices fell, and yields, which move in the opposite direction, rose. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 3.83 percent from 3.46 the previous week.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 262.8 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 8,763.13. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 20.95 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 940.09. The Nasdaq composite index gained 75.09 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 1,849.42.

PERSON: George MacPherson 

HEADLINE: George MacPherson, Theater Producer, Is Dead at 78

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
George MacPherson, a theater producer who helped bring down the curtain on bus-and-truck road shows and usher in the big-box-office age of polished national touring companies, died on Wednesday in Orangeburg, S.C., where he lived. He was 78. 
 The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Morag.
 Mr. MacPherson, who got his first taste of show business glamour as a veterinarian with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, helped theater producers maximize returns on their shows by sending out touring companies with high production values and first-rate performers to markets beyond the big cities. 
 This approach, restructured in the early 1980s at American Theater Productions, where he was executive director, led to increased subscription sales and a boom for the tour business, which nearly doubled its gross revenues from 1988 to 1991. 
 ''In those days, touring was pretty rudimentary,'' said Miles Wilkin, the chief executive of the tour producer Broadway Across America. ''George was adept at working with New York producers, acquiring shows and then realizing their full potential on the road.''
 With Tom Mallow, the founder of American Theater Productions, Mr. MacPherson produced the national and international tours of shows like ''The Secret Garden,'' ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Big River,'' ''The Who's Tommy'' and ''Angels in America.'' 
 ''He and Tom Mallow were real pioneers in getting contemporary Broadway titles out on the road in a way that made economic sense, and logistical and technical sense,'' said Scott Zeiger, a chief executive of the production company Base Entertainment. Mr. Mallow died in 2002. 
 Mr. MacPherson was born in Elrama, Pa., and studied large-animal veterinary medicine at Bethany College in Bethany, W.Va. He enlisted in the Army during the Korean War and, as part of his training as an intelligence specialist, learned to speak Japanese at Sophia University in Tokyo before being assigned to intelligence work in Korea.
 After managing movie theaters in West Virginia and caring for lions and tigers with Ringling Brothers, for which he did public relations work as well, he moved to Los Angeles. Unable to find work in show business, he joined the Los Angeles Police Department and walked a beat for a year before becoming a partner in a theatrical press agency.
 Mr. MacPherson had a busy and varied career as a press agent and manager in the 1960s and 1970s, representing Victor Borge, Harry Belafonte and the National Ballet of Canada. In the 1970s he was the founding general manager of Hamilton Place, the performing arts center in Hamilton, Ontario, and in 1980 he helped get Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto up and running before Mr. Mallow hired him. The company merged with Dodger Productions in 1990 and dissolved in 1996.
 Endemol Entertainment, the Dutch theatrical and television production company, later hired Mr. MacPherson to start and run the theatrical management division of its New York offices.
 In 1997 Mr. MacPherson became the president of Masque Sound, a company started by three stagehands in 1936, which provides sound systems for Broadway musicals and concerts.
 Besides his daughter, Morag, of Brookdale, N.J., Mr. MacPherson is survived by his wife, the former Judith Winter; his sons Duncan, of Hartford, and Malcolm, of Toronto; a sister, Dee Deibel of San Rafael, Calif.; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Treasuries and Stocks, In a Role Reversal

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE Treasury market has been wobbly, but the stock market has rallied -- along with commodities, junk bonds and a wide range of other relatively risky asset classes in the United States and abroad.
 ''In many ways, what we're seeing is a mirror image of 2008,'' said Mary J. Miller, the director of the fixed-income division at T. Rowe Price. Treasuries soared in value last year when investors went on a wild ''flight to quality,'' driving down the prices of nearly everything else. That ''fear trade'' has abated as the financial system has stabilized, she said, and riskier assets have been rebounding. 
 ''It feels very different from last year,'' she said. 
 Many investors who moved to the sidelines in the debacle of 2008 have begun to return to the stock market. ''Investors don't like to be left behind in any rally,'' said Henry Kaufman, the veteran Wall Street economist. ''The juices are beginning to work, and that's a good thing.'' 
 Even in a week when General Motors, a former icon of American industry, went into bankruptcy, the stock market took the bad news in stride. 
 Still, recent reversals in the Treasury market appear to underscore the continuing fragility of the stock market and of the global economy. Rising government bond rates could choke off an incipient recovery, particularly in the housing market, where mortgage rates are linked to Treasury yields. 
 With the government forced to sell enormous quantities of bonds to finance its fiscal stimulus and financial rescue operations, Treasury yields have risen sharply since the beginning of the year, and prices, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. 
 On Friday, the Labor Department's monthly unemployment report, which showed that the nation's job losses in May were much lower than anticipated, exacerbated this trend. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which started the year at 2.21 percent, closed on Friday at 3.83 percent, their highest level in many months.
 The Barclays Capital U.S. 20+ Year Treasury Bond index dropped 22.94 percent this year through Thursday, compared with a gain of 33.72 percent in 2008. By contrast, the Barclays Capital high-yield corporate bond index, which dropped 26.16 percent in 2008, climbed 29.5 percent this year. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which lost 38.5 percent, is up 4.1 percent through Friday, and the Nasdaq composite, which fell 40.5 percent, is up 17.3 percent.
 Amid gains like this, the turmoil in the Treasury market is glaring. Individual investors who bought Treasury securities and government bond funds last year to buffer their portfolios have seen the price of their holdings decline sharply (though the government guarantees the full value of Treasury bonds that are held to maturity).
 Those losses shouldn't have been entirely surprising, though. After gaining so much in value, Treasuries were bound to fall, many analysts warned, and fall they did.
 The decline was caused by several factors, Dr. Kaufman said. These include anticipation of an economic recovery, the increasing supply of government debt, the mounting fiscal deficit, and skepticism about the Federal Reserve's huge intervention. ''The market is testing the Fed's intentions and desires,'' he said. 
 In testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, alluded to some of these issues. He said the government must ''demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term,'' even as it engages in short-term deficit spending on a gargantuan scale. But he did not say whether the Fed would increase its purchases of longer-term bonds and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to drive down yields. 
 Edward E. Yardeni, an economist who runs Yardeni Research in Great Neck, N.Y., said that while he forecasts an end to the recession in the second half of this year, he does not expect a strong recovery. Furthermore, he said long-term fiscal deficits were unlikely to be eliminated quickly. 
 These circumstances, he said, make it hard for a stock market rally to continue for long. ''The stock market is starting to decouple from the economy,'' he said. 
 Improvement in the credit markets has given the Fed some breathing room, Ms. Miller said. While Treasury yields have risen, the ''spread,'' or gap between Treasuries and other debt instruments, has narrowed sharply. That has occurred partly because of lessening risk aversion among investors, and partly because of increased liquidity in markets like municipal bonds. Although the mortgage market is a concern, she said, interest rates have declined, not risen, for most corporate borrowers. 
 AFTER the wild swings of last year and early 2009, many markets have been returning to more typical ranges in a process of ''mean reversion,'' said Timothy W. Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. His firm last week shifted its asset-allocation recommendation to the most aggressive rating for equities, a judgment that the stock market rally is very likely to continue.
 But Dr. Kaufman foresees trouble ahead for stocks. It is ''difficult to project a significant corporate profit recovery,'' he said, and it is likely to become clear later in the year that another bout of fiscal stimulus is needed. The government bond market might rally, he said, ''if the administration recognizes that the economic recovery is not as strong as projected.'' 
 Meanwhile, he said, the stock market ''does not want to deal with a subnormal economic expansion'' and would weaken. 
 Asked how he would advise investors, he said that those in the stock market should limit themselves to companies with extremely strong balance sheets and market share. Unless a corporate bond investor is ''in a position to do extraordinarily deep analysis,'' he said, he would suggest avoiding anything that isn't ''very high quality.''

HEADLINE: Why Home Prices May Keep Falling

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
HOME prices in the United States have been falling for nearly three years, and the decline may well continue for some time. 
 Even the federal government has projected price decreases through 2010. As a baseline, the stress tests recently performed on big banks included a total fall in housing prices of 41 percent from 2006 through 2010. Their ''more adverse'' forecast projected a drop of 48 percent -- suggesting that important housing ratios, like price to rent, and price to construction cost -- would fall to their lowest levels in 20 years.
 Such long, steady housing price declines seem to defy both common sense and the traditional laws of economics, which assume that people act rationally and that markets are efficient. Why would a sensible person watch the value of his home fall for years, only to sell for a big loss? Why not sell early in the cycle? If people acted as the efficient-market theory says they should, prices would come down right away, not gradually over years, and these cycles would be much shorter. 
 But something is definitely different about real estate. Long declines do happen with some regularity. And despite the uptick last week in pending home sales and recent improvement in consumer confidence, we still appear to be in a continuing price decline.
 There are many historical examples. After the bursting of the Japanese housing bubble in 1991, land prices in Japan's major cities fell every single year for 15 consecutive years. 
 Why does this happen? One could easily believe that people are a little slower to sell their homes than, say, their stocks. But years slower? 
 Several factors can explain the snail-like behavior of the real estate market. An important one is that sales of existing homes are mainly by people who are planning to buy other homes. So even if sellers think that home prices are in decline, most have no reason to hurry because they are not really leaving the market.
 Furthermore, few homeowners consider exiting the housing market for purely speculative reasons. First, many owners don't have a speculator's sense of urgency. And they don't like shifting from being owners to renters, a process entailing lifestyle changes that can take years to effect.
 Among couples sharing a house, for example, any decision to sell and switch to a rental requires the assent of both partners. Even growing children, who may resent being shifted to another school district and placed in a rental apartment, are likely to have some veto power.
 In fact, most decisions to exit the market in favor of renting are not market-timing moves. Instead, they reflect the growing pressures of economic necessity. This may involve foreclosure or just difficulty paying bills, or gradual changes in opinion about how to live in an economic downturn. 
 This dynamic helps to explain why, at a time of high unemployment, declines in home prices may be long-lasting and predictable. 
 Imagine a young couple now renting an apartment. A few years ago, they were toying with the idea of buying a house, but seeing unemployment all around them and the turmoil in the housing market, they have changed their thinking: they have decided to remain renters. They may not revisit that decision for some years. It is settled in their minds for now. 
 On the other hand, an elderly couple who during the boom were holding out against selling their home and moving to a continuing-care retirement community have decided that it's finally the time to do so. It may take them a year or two to sort through a lifetime of belongings and prepare for the move, but they may never revisit their decision again.
 As a result, we will have a seller and no buyer, and there will be that much less demand relative to supply -- and one more reason that prices may continue to fall, or stagnate, in 2010 or 2011. 
 All of these people could be made to change their plans if a sharp improvement in the economy got their attention. The young couple could change their minds and decide to buy next year, and the elderly couple could decide to further postpone their selling. That would leave us with a buyer and no seller, providing an upward kick to the market price.
 For this reason, not all economists agree that home price declines are really predictable. Ray Fair, my colleague at Yale, for one, warns that any trend up or down may suddenly be reversed if there is an economic ''regime change'' -- a shift big enough to make people change their thinking. 
 But market changes that big don't occur every day. And when they do, there is a coordination problem: people won't all change their views about homeownership at once. Some will focus on recent price declines, which may seem to belie any improvement in the economy, reinforcing negative attitudes about the housing market.
 Even if there is a quick end to the recession, the housing market's poor performance may linger. After the last home price boom, which ended about the time of the 1990-91 recession, home prices did not start moving upward, even incrementally, until 1997.

HEADLINE: Dressing It Up Before Tearing It Down

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
ACROSS the country, hotel projects have stalled because of a lack of funding. But the owner of one Los Angeles hotel is not only spending millions on improvements -- it is also getting ready to replace the hotel with a new one.
 The Wilshire Grand is in the midst of a $20 million makeover that involves upgrades to all 900 guest rooms. But while the renovation will help keep the building fresh, it still won't provide the spaciousness and sheen that some travelers expect. 
 ''There is just so much you can do with a 50-year-old structure,'' said Penny Pfaelzer, a spokeswoman for Korean Air, the hotel's owner. Even with upgrades, she said, the rooms are ''dated.''
 So Korean Air hopes to tear down the hotel a year or two after the renovation is finished. 
 Then, a pair of high-rise buildings -- one containing offices, the other a new hotel with 700 rooms -- will be constructed in its place. 
 James A. Thomas, whose company, the Thomas Properties Group, was hired by Korean Air to oversee the redevelopment, said ''the decision has been made to scrape the site.'' His client, he said, ''decided that it doesn't make sense to keep putting money into the property if they're not able to come up with the kind of quality hotel they want.''
 The rebuilding project is expected to cost around $1 billion, according to Mr. Thomas, and it will proceed despite the tight credit market. Korean Air ''has the wherewithal to build the hotel off its balance sheet,'' he said. 
 The airline, a part of the Hanjin Group, a conglomerate based in South Korea, had more than $8 billion in revenue in 2008, according to Ms. Pfaelzer. 
 Korean Air has strong ties to Los Angeles, which has the largest Korean population of any city outside Korea, according to Eui-Young Yu, the founder and director of the Center for Korean American and Korean Studies at California State University, Los Angeles. That generates a lot of trans-Pacific traffic.
 The company's chairman, Y. H. Cho, is a graduate of the University of Southern California, as are his three children, Ms. Pfaelzer said. One of them, Heather Cho, runs the company's hotel division. 
 Korean Air bought the Wilshire Grand about 20 years ago -- when it was known as the Hilton Hotel and Towers -- and has watched as downtown Los Angeles burgeoned around it. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, which opened in 2003, and the Staples Center arena, which opened in '99, are both in easy walking distance of the hotel. L.A. Live, a vast entertainment complex, is under construction next to the Staples Center. 
 The Wilshire Grand advertises itself as having the best location of any hotel in the city. But if that's true, the hotel hasn't lived up to its potential. On a recent night, rooms were available as little as $79. 
 Even so, occupancy has been around 50 or 60 percent, according to Marc Loge, the hotel's director of public relations.
 And the Wilshire Grand is about to face new competition. L.A. Live, which is expected to open next year, will contain two separate hotels -- a Ritz-Carlton, with 123 rooms, and a J. W. Marriott, with more than 800 rooms -- in a single, 54-story tower designed by Gensler, the international architecture firm. The hotels will operate as distinct entities despite sharing a building. 
 The new neighbors ''are raising the bar'' for the Wilshire Grand, Ms. Pfaelzer said. But they may also bring it new business.
 According to Carol Martinez, an executive of LA Inc., the city's convention and visitors bureau, some of the largest conventions ''didn't want to come to Los Angeles because we didn't have enough hotel rooms to accommodate them.'' The addition of nearly 1,000 rooms at L.A. Live will change that, she said. A result could be more convention business for the Wilshire Grand.
 But the existing Wilshire Grand would have a hard time satisfying some conventiongoers, Ms. Pfaelzer said. Among other things, she said, its cramped public spaces are incompatible with ''the pedestrian and cafe lifestyle Southern Californians enjoy.''
 It may take up to two years to win approval for the project from government agencies, according to Mr. Thomas, and for that reason, the company decided not to halt the renovations that were under way. 
 But it did decide to speed things up. Instead of renovating floor by floor, as originally planned, it is tackling three floors at a time, Mr. Loge said. That will allow the hotel to complete the renovation this fall, about a year ahead of schedule.
 Low occupancy during the economic downturn has made it easier to renovate large swaths of the building at once, Mr. Loge added. 
 Once it was decided that the hotel would be demolished, some items were dropped from the original renovation plan. The rooms will receive new carpet, window treatments, wallpaper, flat-panel televisions, mattresses and upholstery, Mr. Loge said. But, he said, ''the bathrooms will no longer be completely refurbished and expanded.'' He said that decision, along with other changes, reduced the cost of the renovation to about $20 million from about $60 million.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas, the real estate developer, is focused on maximizing the use of the Wilshire Grand site -- nearly three acres at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Figueroa Street, on the southwestern corner of downtown Los Angeles. 
 The site is particularly valuable to Korean Air, he said, because ''the name Wilshire Boulevard is recognized around the world.'' As a result, he said, the airline ''is very anxious to have the hotel front on Wilshire, because they anticipate an international business.''
 The new hotel is as yet unnamed; the company is talking to all the major brands -- known as ''flags'' -- before deciding which of them will operate it, Mr. Thomas said. 
 In the meantime, executives of the Wilshire Grand are focused on running their hotel. ''When employees know that a hotel is going to eventually close, that can be an issue,'' Ms. Pfaelzer said, noting that some employees may seek other employment, while morale among those who remain could suffer. She said the company has offered Wilshire Grand employees ''preferential hiring when the new hotel becomes operational.''
 ''And we're hopeful that many will return,'' she added. 
 But that will take time.
 ''Before we could have the hotel up and running, we're talking about four to five years,'' said Mr. Thomas, who was figuring on at least two years for various approvals from the city and at least two years for construction. 
 ''Hopefully by then,'' he said, ''the economy will have turned around.''

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Ontario 

 BODY:
 IN the spring of 1968, Michael Wolfson, a 20-year-old Vietnam draft resister, crossed the border to live in Canada. The following January, he was one of nine men indicted by a federal grand jury in Buffalo for failing to report for military duty.
 He had applied for conscientious objector status but was rejected, based on an extensive investigation by F.B.I. agents in three cities: Buffalo, where Mr. Wolfson went to high school; Pittsburgh, where he'd attended Carnegie Mellon as a freshman; and Berkeley, Calif., where he'd spent his sophomore year before dropping out and working in a research lab.
 Though Mr. Wolfson was a run-of-the-mill protester with no connections to groups like Students for a Democratic Society, the F.B.I. interviewed 19 people and produced an 11-page single-spaced summary of its dossier on him. His high school principal told the agents that while ''very gifted,'' Mr. Wolfson had received seven detentions for infractions like cutting classes and was ''in need of correction and discipline in some of his thinking.'' 
 One neighbor described him as a loner, another said he'd adopted a ''beatnik style of life and would dress accordingly.'' A relative reported he was a typical ''peacenik.'' A third neighbor claimed his ''basic problem'' was he worried about what is ''principle and what is morality to an unusual extent.'' A high school teacher forecast doom: ''He would not be able to succeed in some of his pursuits due to his rebellious nature and his reluctance to accept any responsibility or respect authority.''
 It did not turn out that way. Mr. Wolfson, now 61, rose to be a top federal bureaucrat in Canada, an assistant chief statistician for the government agency that tracks census and employment data, Statistics Canada. Last week, he flew to Geneva to represent Canada at a United Nations gathering and this week he will be host to an international conference on microsimulation.
 He's been with his wife, Eleanor, since 1974. They have four grown children and own two lovely homes, here and on a lake. In a few months he will retire with 35 years of government service. As his wife, a native Canadian, said, ''Canada did very well by the draft -- we got a lot of very fine young men.'' About 25,000 draft-age men left the United States for Canada in those years, and even after President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty, half have remained, according to John Hagan, a Northwestern professor and author of ''Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada'' (Harvard Press). For his 2001 book, Mr. Hagan, who himself moved to Canada to avoid the draft, interviewed about 100 who did not return to the United States.
 He found that they did not live on the margins of Canadian society; instead, they typically prospered, earning on average about $65,000 a year (at the time of the decade-old survey). ''It's not surprising,'' Mr. Hagan said, ''they were an atypically well-educated group.'' Indeed, Mr. Hagan, a sociology professor who now has dual citizenship, will share the 2009 Stockholm Prize in Criminology in a few weeks.
 When Mr. Wolfson left for Canada, he said, ''I assumed I'd be lucky to get a job driving a forklift.''
 He'd always been a top math student but never fully applied himself, and that only got worse when he arrived in Berkeley that summer of '66. Country Joe and the Fish were playing at Berkeley Park, the Cream, Vanilla Fudge and Jefferson Airplane were at the Fillmore, and at his boarding house lived the real Melinda from Bob Dylan's ''Highway 61'' album. ''School seemed utterly boring,'' he said. He'd ride public transit back from San Francisco with a shopping bag full of pot and ''started doing a lot of acid.'' When he dropped out that fall, he was classified 1A for the draft.
 Still, a piece of him remained grounded. He took a job at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and long before most heard of it, was building computer simulation models. He made an exploratory trip to Canada, meeting with counselors at the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, who explained that he could stay legally if he had a job. They kept lists of sympathetic Canadians and sent him to Leslie Mezei at the University of Toronto, a professor in computer graphics who hired Mr. Wolfson as a research assistant.
 On Oct. 1, 1968, he wrote his draft board from Toronto: ''The reason I did not comply with your order is that I did not, on that particular day, feel like it. It was a nice sunny day here and I enjoyed a pleasant walk on the campus.'' He concluded by asking the Selective Service System to ''cancel my subscription to SSS Death and take my name off your mailing list.''
 Sitting in his Statistics Canada office recently, on the 26th floor overlooking the Ottawa River, he noted, ''That's not how I would have written that letter today.''
 He's not sure, but he thinks a few times during those years, United States officials, who he assumed were hostile, actually might have been sympathetic. During a visit to the United States consul in Toronto, he recalled: ''I said, 'I want to renounce my citizenship.' He said, 'No you don't, get out of here.' '' Mr. Wolfson listened; today, he has dual citizenship.
 In January 1975, a few years before amnesty, Mr. Wolfson got a letter from the federal prosecutor in Buffalo stating, ''Your file was found to be procedurally incorrect and prosecution was declined.'' In other words, case dismissed. Still, for 10 years, whenever he crossed the border to visit his parents or attend a business conference, he carried that letter.
 Shortly after arriving, he enrolled at the University of Toronto, and at first continued to do poorly (''Too much smoking pot and listening to Leonard Cohen albums at 3 a.m.'') But in his junior year, he changed, for reasons he cannot explain, beyond maturity. ''I just became a more serious student,'' he said. ''I stopped smoking, went to the library in the morning, did my homework.'' After graduating he earned a doctorate in economics from Kings College at Cambridge University in England.
 He knows of draft resisters who went to prison, has friends who destroyed their minds with drugs and can't explain why he landed on his feet. ''Is it luck? Instinct? Self preservation? I don't know,'' he said. ''Could I have had a different outcome? Yes.''
 These days, he has a reputation as a workaholic. ''He's considered a very serious person,'' said Mr. Hagan, who knows of Mr. Wolfson from a Statistics Canada research project. ''He's very careful what he says about his work.''
 He has always been open about his background. ''I made no efforts to hide it,'' he said. ''People either didn't care, thought it was very cool or didn't bother asking.''
 He has long considered Canada his home, and is critical of the military role of the United States in the world. As a lifelong government worker, he believes Canadians put more value on public service than Americans.
 Mr. Hagan has found that the draft resisters who stayed in Canada have maintained a commitment to social issues, although they're quieter about it than they were in the day, and this seems true of Mr. Wolfson.
 He is environmentally conscious and year round commutes three miles to work by bike.
 He created a landmark mortality study in the early 1990s using Social Security data for 500,000 Canadians, which showed that the wealthier people are, the longer they tend to live.
 He initiated aJoint Canadian-United States Survey of Health in 2003 that has been used to argue the benefits of universal health care. The survey showed that in Canada -- which has universal care -- 23 percent of the poorest Canadians complained of bad health, compared with 31 percent of the poorest Americans. Asked if the topic selection for his government surveys reflected his social concerns, Mr. Wolfson said, ''It was all done very scientifically.''

HEADLINE: Sparks Take Down Rival, in Every Sense, in Opener

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Lisa Leslie and the Los Angeles Sparks were as good as advertised on opening day.
 Tina Thompson had 18 points, Betty Lennox added 17 points and 10 rebounds and the Sparks easily defeated the defending champion Detroit Shock, 78-58, on Saturday in Los Angeles in the opening game of the W.N.B.A. season. 
 The Sparks, the favorites to win the title as the league begins its 13th season, wore jerseys with the logo of the Farmers Insurance Group, the most obvious result of a new multiyear sponsorship agreement. The Sparks and the Phoenix Mercury are the first teams in the league, which has been hard hit by the recession, to sign jersey sponsorship deals.
 Leslie, a four time-Olympic Gold medalist, had an off-game, scoring only 6 points. But Los Angeles had plenty of star power -- and a little bit of fight -- to back her up, even with Candace Parker sidelined.
 Parker, last year's league most valuable player, had a baby in May and is not expected to play until July. Thompson was added during the off-season in an attempt to offset Parker's absence.
 ''It's great,'' Leslie said. ''We have a lot of weapons and I think it's going to be like an orchestra -- any given night, anybody's going to have a solo.''
 It was not opening day for everyone. The Houston Comets were shut down in December, leaving the league with 13 teams. That left the Liberty as the odd team out on Saturday; it will open the season against Connecticut on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. The Sun lost to visiting Washington, 82-70, in its opener Saturday. 
 In Los Angeles, Detroit played without two key players: Cheryl Ford and Kara Broxton. Ford is recovering from knee surgery, and Broxton is serving a suspension after pleading guilty to drunken-driving charges.
 Detroit's bench became thinner after Plenette Pierson went down with a shoulder injury in the first quarter. Pierson and Thompson tangled while going up for a rebound and fell.
 Coach Bill Laimbeer said Pierson, who hurt her shoulder, would probably miss the rest of the season. He called Thompson's action intentional.
 ''You can't intentionally pull them over your back and injure them; that's not good,'' he said. ''They targeted Plenette today, and that's unfortunate. Tina did it on purpose. She had her and she took advantage of her.''
 HOLDSCLAW RETURNSChamique Holdsclaw scored 23 points in her first game in two years, leading the Atlanta Dream to an 87-86 double-overtime victory over the visiting Indiana Fever. Holdsclaw, who battled depression during her career and retired after playing only five games for Los Angeles in 2007, came 2 points shorts of becoming the ninth player in league history to score 4,000.

HEADLINE: Helping the Job Seeker Without Hurting Yourself

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
Q.You have been receiving several phone calls a week from people seeking help in finding a job. Although you want to be helpful, there is a limit to the time you can spend thinking about someone else's job search. Whom should you help?
 A. Those who are looking for work rely heavily on their networks for leads and often believe that because you have a job, you must know of other jobs. Because of layoffs and cuts, however, it is more likely that your job responsibilities have increased and that you are feeling insecure about your own position. 
 Yet it's a good policy to help if you can, because you never know when the tables will turn. To avoid becoming overwhelmed, establish a system to process calls you receive, said Thom Singer, a business development consultant in Austin, Tex., and author of ''The ABC's of Networking.''
 ''Often the issue isn't that you're getting too many calls; it's when the calls are from friends of friends or strangers, people you cannot vouch for,'' Mr. Singer said. 
 Start by asking callers what they want -- whether it's an introduction, job search advice or resume assistance -- and then determine if you can help.
 ''I set a clock alarm for 10 minutes and in that time I see if they can tell me their story succinctly and articulately,'' said Duncan Mathison, president of Duncan Mathison & Associates, a career coaching firm in San Diego. ''I want to determine if they know what they want and see what they bring to the table.'' 
 Q. Do you need to meet face-to-face with everyone who requests it?
 A. If you plan to refer the caller to someone in your professional network or at your company, take time to sit down with the candidate first, because your credibility is on the line, Mr. Singer said. ''Have them come to your office for a 30-minute informational interview,'' he said. ''If you refer them and they screw up, that will reflect poorly on you.'' 
 If the person asking for help is a client or a relative of a client, you should meet with that person, said Sally Haver, a career counselor and senior business development executive at the Ayers Group, a career transition consulting firm in Manhattan. ''For corporate clients and prospective clients,'' she said, ''I will go out of my way to help, because I view it as part of my overall marketing plan, which includes building and maintaining relationships.''
 Q.What kinds of requests can be handled over the phone?
 A. If the best you are prepared to offer someone is general career advice or information about your industry, you can talk over the phone. ''Set a time limit for the call so you can get back to work quickly,'' said Susan Bartell, a workplace psychologist in Port Washington, N.Y. The time limit will help you avoid becoming emotionally drained from listening and trying to help people in need, she said, especially if you're taking several of these calls a week.
 Compile a list of industry-related resources that you can give to callers. 
 Q.If you try to help too many people, do you run any risks to your own career?
 A. Yes, because you risk using up your political capital. Use your connections sparingly and wisely, and tap your most treasured contacts only for very important favors, Ms. Haver said. If a person's connection to you is very tenuous, she said, give only general advice. On the other hand, a successful referral can be a boon to your reputation, Mr. Mathison said. 
 Q.Is there a way to politely decline to give help?
 A. Always be kind to a job seeker, because this is an especially difficult time to be unemployed. ''Tell them, 'I wish I could help but right now I do not see a connection with any opportunity.''' Mr. Mathison said. ''Then add that they can send a resume and if you see something that fits their background, you will pass it along.''
 If you know you will never be able to help the person, tell him or her that you appreciate the call but don't think that you can be of any assistance, he said. 
 Q.If you're the one asking for help, what is the best approach?
 A. One of the worst things you can do is to ask point blank if a contact knows of any jobs, said Allison Cheston, a career adviser in New York City.
 Networking is a lot like dating, she said: ''You don't want to seem desperate; you want to put your best foot forward.'' Give a very brief -- and well-prepared -- explanation of your skill set, background and what you have to offer an employer, she said.
 ''The goal is to figure out what you are good at, where you can do it and then find people who can help you get into that organization,'' Ms. Cheston said. ''Companies make room for those who have something to offer.'' 
 Approach your networking call as you would an informational interview, Mr. Mathison said. ''You have an obligation,'' he said, ''to do your research, be well organized and know what you want.''
 Very specific requests can be effective -- for example, asking someone you know at a company to forward an e-mail you have written to a hiring manager, as opposed to asking that person to write an e-mail on your behalf, Mr. Mathison said. ''Always make it easy for the person you are calling,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 'In Living Color,' the Sequel

BYLINE: By STEPHEN P. WILLIAMS

 BODY:
FRIENDS and neighbors often suggest that Stephen Park and Kelly Coffield Park must still be on their honeymoon, because they're so often spotted together at odd times in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. 
 There is their standing Friday-afternoon movie date, when they'll sometimes sneak lunch into the Cobble Hill Cinema, which is just a few blocks from their Sackett Street duplex. And there are the late-morning cappuccinos at Cafe Pedlar, up the street from the public school attended by their children: Owen, age 8, and Eliza, age 6. 
 But while there still seems to be a spark in their nine-year marriage, the truth is that the Parks are actors whose schedules are in flux, so they hang out together whenever they can. The two met while dancing and performing comedy skits on the groundbreaking '90s television show ''In Living Color,'' alongside future stars like Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Lopez.
 ''That was back when she was Jenny From the Block,'' Ms. Park said with a laugh. 
 ''In Living Color'' was known for dealing hilariously, but directly, with racial and economic issues.
 ''It's really incredible that people still come up to me and have so much to say about that particular time and what it meant to their entire neighborhood,'' Ms. Park said. 
 Recently two strangers on the subway regaled the couple with a perhaps apocryphal story about a suicidal guy who removed a gun barrel from his temple when an episode of ''In Living Color'' came on the TV. 
 ''I thought, 'Wow, we added another half hour to his life!' '' Ms. Park said.
 She and Mr. Park were acquaintances, but nothing more, when they worked together on the show, in Los Angeles.
 For six years after Mr. Park left the show, they lived near each other in the Hollywood area, using the same dry cleaners and visiting the same groceries. But they didn't run into each other again until they were cast together in 1998 as a married couple getting a divorce in the play ''Big Hunk o' Burnin' Love.''
 ''Having been through this intense period on 'In Living Color,' our friendship jumped ahead a million steps and we became very close very quickly,'' Mr. Park said.
 ''We decided we were meant to get married because we'd already gotten divorced so many times on stage,'' Ms. Park said. 
 Soon they were living together in a light-filled house in Los Feliz, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. 
 ''It was spacious and we could slide around the floors in our socks,'' Mr. Park said. ''It was great for parties.''
 ''There was an enclosed den that felt like a back porch overlooking the water,'' Ms. Park said, ''so everyone called it the Lake House.'' 
 ''We miss that house so much,'' the couple said in unison as they sat in the narrow living room of their two-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath apartment in a converted lumberyard. 
 They traded their spacious Los Angeles lifestyle for more restricted New York living when Ms. Park was pregnant with Owen.
 Mr. Park, especially, was a little burned out on the Los Angeles acting world, and both of them had ties to the East. She had grown up in Bronxville in Westchester County, and Mr. Park as the son of Korean immigrants in Vestal, N.Y., a suburb of Binghamton where his parents still live.
 They moved to a rental apartment in Bronxville, then decided that Brooklyn would be a better fit.
 First they moved into a noisy apartment in Windsor Terrace. After they realized they were spending much of their time in parks and restaurants in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, they decided to move and found the apartment on Sackett Street.
 Although they hadn't given it any thought, they just happened to move into the catchment area for Public School 29, one of the most sought-after primary schools in Brooklyn.
 By New York standards, the $3,600-a-month apartment is rather spacious. It has high ceilings and brickwork worthy of a less utilitarian building.
 But the layout is a bit awkward, with a narrow center living area that has room for a couch, a kid-size table with kid-size chairs, a television and bookshelves.
 On one end of the roughly 45-foot-long apartment is a light-filled reading room overlooking a shared garden. At the other end is a kitchen with a table in front of windows overlooking the street. But it is barely big enough for the family. Downstairs, on the ground floor, are two large bedrooms and access to the garden. A washer and dryer are in the basement.
 ''If you lined up these two floors side by side, it's not enormous,'' Ms. Park said, ''but being able to go upstairs and downstairs makes it feel like a house, psychologically. It would be tough to go back to one floor.'' 
 Both keep busy. She has appeared in films like ''Jerry Maguire,'' ''Bride Wars'' and ''Scary Movie,'' and in television shows like ''Law and Order.'' Mr. Park has acted in movies like ''Do the Right Thing,'' ''Fargo'' and ''State of Play,'' and TV shows including ''Mad About You'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' He plays a rapping weatherman in an upcoming movie called ''Morning Glory.'' 
 They work so much that neither has even seen everything that the other has done.
 ''Which is not necessarily a bad thing,'' Ms. Park said.
 In a few weeks they hope to start production on their first project together in years, a film called ''The Best and Brightest,'' about the lengths people will go to get their children into a prestigious Manhattan kindergarten. 
 ''We play George and Cindy Tanaka Bloomstein,'' Mr. Park said, ''and we represent the worst of a conniving and desperate culture.'' 
 Which is really playing against type. They describe themselves as ''incredibly boring'' people. But in truth, they have an enviable life. 
 Sure, the rent feels high and the kitchen's too small. But there's a turtle named Rose in their fish tank, and a place just down the street where the kids can skateboard. And when they need a break from reality, they can stroll up to the Chocolate Room, a restaurant on Court Street with a self-explanatory name that helps fulfill all their escapist urges.

HEADLINE: In Chicago, U.S. Rouses the Home Fans

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
 The common wisdom is that the United States does not like to schedule -- is afraid to schedule -- World Cup qualifiers in major Latino cities. But the Americans dared to play in front of a crowd of 55,647 fans at Soldier Field that was 60 percent in favor of Honduras on Saturday night, and the United States survived.
 Giving up the first goal, a highly dangerous habit, the Yanks scrambled back for a 2-1 victory that kept them in second place in their region in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. 
 With Costa Rica beating Trinidad and Tobago, and Mexico being stunned in El Salvador, the Americans are second to Costa Rica, both having played an extra match. 
 ''You take care of business at home,'' said the United States coach, Bob Bradley, who insisted his players were not put off by playing in front of a predominately blue-clad Honduras crowd that knew how to chant and blow horns and wave pennants. After their ghastly 3-1 loss in Costa Rica on Wednesday night, the Americans upgraded their act despite another weak start.
 The blue-clad fans arrived from Honduran enclaves in New York, Florida, Texas and Washington, D.C. Faustino Cruz, who lives in Springfield, Va., took a 12-hour bus ride with family and friends. This was a big-time soccer atmosphere, and the second largest World Cup qualifying crowd ever in this country, trailing a previous crowd in Foxborough, Mass., by about 2,000.
 But the passion of the Honduran majority in the stands had nothing to do with the way the United States had to scramble after a 1-1 draw at halftime, with defensive mistakes leading to both goals. 
 Clint Dempsey's loss of the ball led to Carlos Costly's goal in the fifth minute, only marginally better than the second-minute goal given up in Costa Rica. But the United States stabilized, and a handball by Mario Beata of Honduras set up Landon Donovan's penalty kick in the 43rd minute, to get the desperate Americans back in the match.
 Then the captain, Carlos Bocanegra, scored in the 68th minute to ultimately win the match. Donovan drove a corner kick from the left, and Dempsey made up for his early flub by heading the ball back into the goal mouth, where Bocanegra knocked it home with a diving header. Moments later, Bocanegra felt a twinge in his hamstring and wisely removed himself, rather than be exposed for a costly goal. 
 The Americans showed more energy than they had in Costa Rica. Donovan and Jozy Altidore were more active, Jonathan Bornstein and Jonathan Spector were vast improvements at the two outside backs, and Ricardo Clark, given a start at midfield, might have been the most persistent player. 
 ''It's a big crowd,'' Bradley said of the atmosphere. ''We don't let outside things influence us. You control what you can.''
 Good for the United States officials for daring to put the game in a showcase stadium like this. Sunil Gulati, the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, who teaches economics at Columbia University, can dabble in probabilities and demographics. He committed to playing Honduras in Chicago, which was listed as 26 percent Hispanic according to the 2000 census. 
 By choosing its spots carefully, the United States has not lost to a regional opponent at home in 53 straight matches, going back to a loss to Honduras in 2001. They have won 43 and drawn 10, including 14 World Cup qualifying matches.
 Although many of the Latinos in Chicago are of Mexican descent, Gulati did not think Mexican fans would be a major factor because their national team's game in San Salvador would be available on television. 
 ''We beat Mexico in the Gold Cup final here,'' Tim Howard, the United States goalkeeper, said Friday, referring to the 2-1 victory in 2007 in front of 60,000 fans. 
 Howard praised the red-clad Sam's Army, the United States boosters who follow the national team to all continents, and added, ''We thrive in front of big crowds and big environments.''
 There is a history of American players feeling like foreigners on American soil. In 1985, the United States scheduled a vital World Cup qualifier against Costa Rica for a small college football field in Torrance, Calif. An hour before the match, several thousand Costa Ricans came over the hill, waving banners and chanting.
 The United States lost, 1-0, and a young American player plaintively asked the American coach, Alkis Panagoulias, when the United States would ever play a home game. His response was, ''Never.''
 That is not exactly true, since the United States does well against Latin countries in Foxborough, but regional qualifying matches remain a challenge in most major cities, including R.F.K. Stadium in Washington. 
 On Sept. 1, 2001, the United States dared to play Honduras at R.F.K., and the crowd of 54,282 sounded decidedly pro-Honduran, as their players kicked the Americans around during a 3-2 victory.
 Since then, the federation has put the first game of the final qualifying round in 2001 and 2009 in cold, blustery Columbus, Ohio, and was rewarded both times with a 2-0 victory. Mexico has its own version of atmospheric difficulty. It is called Azteca Stadium, and the Americans will travel there on Aug. 12. 
 This time the United States was willing to play a major regional opponent just a short walk from the home office of the U.S. Soccer Federation -- Soccer House, a mansion of French Chateau style in the charming Prairie Avenue Historic District. The United States gained 3 points at home and made a few dollars at the same time. There might be a lesson in that.

HEADLINE: The Eclectic Minds Behind Asia's Transformation

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
FOR the last few years, Bill Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund and an astute reader of the markets if there ever was one, has compared Americans to Blanche DuBois, the aging Southern belle in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' when she says she has ''always relied on the kindness of strangers.''
 Mr. Gross fears that our economic future is increasingly in the hands of strangers, too. As he notes, China and Japan are the two largest foreign holders of United States Treasury bonds. These Asian superpowers -- and, to a lesser extent, their neighbors like India, Taiwan and Singapore -- have enabled us to live beyond our means for some time because they have been kind enough to buy mountains of our debt. 
 We are about to get to know these countries intimately. There was a time when we could smugly lecture them about how to run their economies. Now our Asian creditors can tell us what to do.
 If you are interested in how Asia became an economic tiger, read ''The Miracle: The Epic Story of Asia's Quest for Wealth'' (Collins Business), a lively account by Michael Schuman of the region's economic transformation over the last 60 years. Mr. Schuman knows the subject intimately. He is the Asian business correspondent for Time magazine; before that, he was a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal in South Korea and Indonesia. Mr. Schuman is not just a skilled reporter -- he is also a gifted journalistic storyteller.
 Some people would argue that culture played an important role in Asia's success. After all, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore are all steeped in the Confucian culture of self-reliance. 
 Politics shouldn't be discounted, either. Asian governments have often protected their favored companies at home so they could better compete in the global marketplace. Remember when Lee Iacocca, as the chief executive of Chrysler, fumed that he wasn't just competing with ''Mr. Honda and Mr. Toyota,'' but the entire apparatus of the Japanese government? Mr. Iacocca may have been exaggerating a bit to get attention, but he wasn't paranoid, either. 
 Mr. Schuman, however, writes that economists have overlooked a third factor in the Asian economic miracle. He argues that since the 1950s, the region has been ''blessed'' with enormously talented politicians and business leaders who were determined to succeed economically. 
 They have been a disparate group, to say the least. Some were dictators like Park Chung Hee of South Korea and Suharto of Indonesia; others were reconstructed Communists like Deng Xiaoping of China. 
 In addition, there were brilliant entrepreneurs like Soichiro Honda of Japan, whose company was the first Japanese carmaker to open a factory in the United States; Stan Shih, founder of Acer, the Taiwanese computer company; and Azim Premji of India, who became one of the world's richest men by pioneering the outsourcing industry.
 ''The Miracle,'' to be released on June 30, is the story of these Asian Gatsbys and many more. No, they are not all saints. Some of them arguably allowed sweatshops to flourish. Others suppressed ideological foes. But, Mr. Schuman writes, ''they all shared common goals: to elevate their people from poverty, to build thriving economies on war-torn landscapes, to forge new nations from disaggregated colonies, to hoist Asia into its proper place in the world.''
 Mr. Schuman makes it hard for the readers not to root for most of these remarkable individuals.
 He recounts how horrified he was when he first visited India in 1991 and witnessed people brushing their teeth in the filthy waters of the Ganges. Now he rhapsodizes how Asians ''who would have been stuck knee-deep in muddy rice paddies, living in thatch huts and surviving on subsistence diets now work in air-conditioned glass-and-steel skyscrapers, inhabit glitzy high-rises with stuffed refrigerators and sip Starbucks cappuccinos.''
 But Asia's prosperity has come partly at our expense, and the book incompletely addresses the implications of this. Mr. Schuman argues that the miracle benefits Americans, too. He points out that thanks to the miracle, we can buy cheaply made jeans at Wal-Mart. He argues that we have better relations with China now that our economies are intertwined. 
 THE more subtle argument is the one that Mr. Gross makes. Some of these countries have financed our deficit and stuffed us full of cheaply manufactured luxury goods. (Who do you think is assembling all those iPhones for Apple? The Chinese, of course.) 
 Yes, we brought this on ourselves. But now that the United States is in hock to China and Japan, why should we assume that they will treat us gently? If our Asian bondholders start selling off our debt, we'll be in even worse shape than we are now. The book ignores this.
 Remember that Blanche DuBois was clearly headed for trouble at the end of ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' That's what happens when you rely on the kindness of strangers. Hopefully, we aren't in for a similar fate. If so, we'll need a miracle of our own in order to survive.

HEADLINE: Labor Lost, and Found

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
Last year, 57 million people started new jobs, despite the floundering economy. Most of them had left a job recently -- by choice or not -- but successfully found a new one in the same industry. 
 The sheer size of job turnover in the United States is staggering. Even as unemployment has climbed, every sector has millions of jobs waiting for qualified applicants.
 The figures for hires and separations (employees who quit, retire or are fired) and job openings provide crucial information about job demand by surveying 16,000 employers every month.
 ''The labor market is like any other market, driven by supply and demand,'' said John Wohlford, branch chief of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''But for a long time, we only measured the supply, in unemployment. The job openings survey, started in 2000, allows us to measure demand.''
 Some employment sectors, like retail and manufacturing, may be leading indicators for economic changes. Others, like heath care and education, seem unaffected by the recent turmoil.
 In many industries, as the number of hires begins to fall, separations decline as well, because employees may be reluctant to leave jobs if they believe it will be harder to find new ones. When the number of separations ticks upward even as hiring falls, as in the construction sector last year, it means that employers have been forced to shed jobs.
 How employers respond to economic downturns, and when they turn to layoffs to keep their businesses afloat, is a research question being studied by Steven J. Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
 ''Employers like to use attrition to adjust to changing markets, but that's not enough to achieve downsizing,'' Professor Davis said. ''You can see it clearly in the data: an employer who shrinks more than a few percentage points will have to depend on layoffs.''
 Economists are now looking closely at possible bellwether industries, like food service and retail. When consumers start spending their money on restaurants and new clothes, employers start hiring, and we all start seeing more of those welcome ''help wanted'' signs.

HEADLINE: Downturn Puts a Chokehold on Those Caring for Family Members

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
Teresa Denk is 59 years old and lives with her father, a former mechanic who is 92 and requires constant care. Ms. Denk has not held a full-time job since 2000, when her mother developed cancer and required her daughter's full-time care. 
 Asked how she meets her monthly expenses, she said, ''I do a lot of praying.''
 The economic crisis has spread its pain widely, but it has placed special stresses on the estimated 44 million Americans who provide care for an elderly or disabled relative or spouse, many of whom have already made themselves financially vulnerable trying to balance work and family. Many like Ms. Denk, who stepped away from the work force, are now facing ever-bleaker prospects. 
 In a recent survey of 1,005 caregivers, one in six said they had lost a job during the downturn, and 21 percent said they had to share housing with family members to save money. The survey was conducted by the National Alliance for Caregiving and Evercare, a division of the UnitedHealth Group, which provides long-term health care. 
 In many cases these caregivers, who rely on help from the government and nonprofit organizations to make ends meet, are finding that such services are being cut in the downturn and have had to assume even more care-related expenses. 
 ''All the calls we're getting are, 'Is there money to assist me, either pay me to be a caregiver or assist me in other ways, like provide pro bono services,' '' said Suzanne Mintz, president of the National Family Caregivers Association. 
 Caregivers spend an average of $5,500 a year as part of their responsibilities, not counting lost wages, according to a 2007 survey by the National Alliance for Caregiving. 
 For Ms. Denk, who lives in Rainbow City, Ala., the recession has narrowed her options even as her expenses have grown. Before she left the work force, she was a preschool teacher, worked at Wal-Mart and took a class to become a medical coder. But that training is dated now, she said. As she approaches retirement age, she has no savings and expects minimal Social Security benefits because she has not worked for nine years. According to her last notice, she said, if she starts collecting benefits at age 62 she will get about $450 a month, not enough even to pay the $520 rent on the apartment she shares with her father. 
 Even with her father's benefits of $1,100 a month, she said she has had to buy less food -- ''or less healthy food'' -- because her expenses have gone up. 
 ''I try to do a little work for Avon,'' Ms. Denk said, ''but my daughter can only give me one day a week to help with my father, and anybody else I'd have to pay to come in.''
 Ms. Denk added that the money she could make working part-time would not be enough to pay for home care for her father. ''Agencies charge a minimum of $15 an hour,'' Ms. Denk said, adding, ''I might be able to earn $8 to $10 an hour.''
 Lucinda Hardy and her father, Warren Hardy, are feeling the squeeze on several fronts. Ms. Hardy and her husband, Tim Church, both work, but their income is falling because Mr. Church's hours have been cut. 
 But their big problem is the housing market. In November, as Mr. Hardy's health deteriorated, he moved from a condominium 15 miles away to a trailer home near his daughter. He took a $75,000 mortgage and expected to sell the condominium to pay off that debt. But he has had no offers.
 Now, on a fixed income of $1,700 a month, he spends two-thirds of that on his mortgage, trailer park fees, condominium association fees and utilities on both homes. 
 ''He doesn't have enough income to meet his expenses,'' Ms. Hardy said. 
 This year for the first time he was unable to send money to Ms. Hardy's sister for her birthday, he said. 
 ''It doesn't make me feel very good,'' said Mr. Hardy, 93. ''I'm under a great deal of strain. I'm worried I might run out of money. I had to go into my savings, really taking it down terribly. I can't go on like this forever.'' 
 Mr. Hardy tried to avoid debt all his life, and the strain of having it makes him unhappy with the trailer and sometimes unhappy with his daughter for having encouraged him to move, Ms. Hardy said. ''He says it was a bad decision on my part,'' she said. 
 She added, ''I'm the closest person to him, so I'm the one who hears about it.''
 ''If my mother was still alive,'' Ms. Hardy said, ''he'd have a spouse to vent his frustrations on. Isn't that why we marry? He doesn't have that, so he vents them on me.'' 
 Caregivers often struggle with isolation even in a good economy. In a recession they can become completely cut off. 
 Marianne Szalega and her sister Carol take care of their parents outside Detroit. Carol Szalega, 56, lives with them in their home; Marianne Szalega, 55, goes over every afternoon. Both sisters would like part-time work, but neither can find it. 
 ''For people who quit their jobs to take care of their parents, there's no stimulus plan for us,'' Carol Szalega said. She has written a children's book and would like a writing job she could do at home, she said. ''But the computer crashed, and there isn't cash around to buy a computer. I can use Marianne's, but that takes time away from my parents.'' 
 She fears leaving them alone, she said, because if anything happened to one of them, the other would not notice or call the hospital. And if strangers came to the door, her parents would just let them in, she said. 
 Marianne Szalega, who has been a hairdresser and a gardener, recently completed a state training program to work in the film industry, where jobs pay well, she said. ''But,'' she said, ''I wonder how I'm going to do that because I'd be gone a majority of the day.''
 In the meantime, both she and her sister are approaching their 60s with no health insurance, no savings and worries about their own future. ''Neither of us have children,'' Marianne Szalega said. 
 ''There isn't going to be anybody around to help us, so we have to prepare for our own future,'' she said. 
 ''But how?''

HEADLINE: If All Doctors Had Time To Listen

BYLINE: By JULIE WEED

 BODY:
WHEN Dr. Jose Batlle met his 93-year-old patient in her small Bronx apartment, she didn't have much furniture beyond a small TV, a sofa and a wheelchair. What she did have in abundance were pills -- 15 types from a variety of doctors, including a pulmonologist, a cardiologist and a gerontologist. He discovered that some medicines had expired, others were unnecessary and some were dangerous if taken together. 
 Sitting with his patient and her son, Dr. Batlle cut the number of her medicines to four. He also gave the family his personal cellphone number. 
 Before coming to see him, the woman had endured several emergency-room visits and hospital stays. With Dr. Batlle, she was able to avoid all of that. 
 Calling a doctor on his cell? No waiting for an appointment? It's the type of service that Dr. Batlle tries to offer to all of his 1,500 patients. ''I prefer to keep them healthy than treat them when they are sick,'' he says.
 The efforts of Dr. Batlle and other primary care physicians may get a boost at the federal level. The Obama administration is considering ways to persuade medical students to pursue careers in primary care by raising their pay, and is channeling them to work in underserved rural areas. And the White House has already set aside $2 billion for community health centers through the economic stimulus package. 
 But more far-reaching health care reform remains an uncertainty, and in the interim a small but growing number of doctors are trying to take matters into their own hands. 
 By stepping off the big-clinic treadmill, where doctors are sometimes asked to see a different patient every 15 minutes, Dr. Batlle has joined the vanguard of physicians trying to redefine health care. These doctors spend more time with patients, emphasize prevention and education to keep them healthy and can handle many medical problems without referrals to specialists. 
 In many cases, this kind of care can reduce a patient's medical bills. That's more crucial than ever: according to a study published online by the American Journal of Medicine, 60 percent of all bankruptcies in the United States in 2007 were driven by health care costs. 
 Exact numbers are hard to come by, but doctors involved in this movement, called ''patient centered'' practices, say its popularity is growing. 
 ''I travel to a lot of medical conferences, and I'm meeting more and more doctors embarking on this path,'' said Dr. L. Gordon Moore, who runs IdealMedicalPractices.org, a program to help small practices become more innovative and efficient. The Web site IdealMedicalHome.org has about 800 doctors who post and trade ideas, while more than 700 physicians have adopted methods from HowsYourHealth.org. Many of these doctors see fewer patients per day than they did before.
 To make personalized care possible in an era when compensation is often tied to the number of patients they see, doctors use technology to streamline processes and reduce administrative costs. Dr. Batlle, for example, uses online appointment scheduling and manages his medical records electronically. He prescribes medications from his computer and offers virtual visits by phone and e-mail. 
 It cost Dr. Batlle about $25,000 to buy the technology to make all of this possible, but he estimates that he saves close to $100,000 a year in salaries and billing costs. And he has made enough money to begin renovations on a new office in Washington Heights in Manhattan.
 The model seems to be working, according to a 2008 study by Dr. John H. Wasson at Dartmouth Medical School. His research showed that patients in patient-centered practices were more likely to say they were informed about how to manage chronic diseases and got the care they needed, compared with those in a national sample of medical practices. They also were less likely to say they had to wait for an appointment. 
 ''If the goal is to deliver patient care when and how they want and need it, this is the way to go,'' Dr. Wasson said.
 Of course, even doctors in this movement acknowledge that it is not a panacea for the country's health care problems. Privacy advocates warn that electronic patient records can be breached, and computer glitches can make patient records inaccessible for hours. Big clinics can be better for people who have several health problems and need easy access to a variety of specialists. Moreover, some doctors may not want to leave a big clinic because they feel they lack the technical or business skills they need -- or because a salaried job there may be more stable in this economy. 
 And while the patient-centered movement is growing, the nation may not be able to afford to have all its primary care doctors reduce the number of patients they see. Across the country, primary care physicians are in short supply, in part because average salaries for family practitioners are the lowest of any medical specialty. According to a 2008 survey of physician salaries by the American Medical Group Association, their average annual salary is $201,555, versus $356,166 for a general surgeon and $614,536 for a neurological surgeon. 
 ''Medical school loans can be so high, you need to be a specialist to pay them back,'' Dr. Batlle said. ''But our country doesn't need yet another sleep apnea specialist.'' 
 LILI SACKS, a primary care doctor in Seattle, says she began thinking differently about her work on the day she realized she was beginning each appointment with the words, ''Sorry I'm late.''
 Scheduled to see as many as 25 patients a day at a large clinic, she lacked the time for thorough examinations and discussions. Because of this, she said, primary care doctors are often forced to order tests and send patients to specialists.
 ''Could I have helped some people without specialists and tests? Absolutely,'' said Dr. Sacks. ''Would it have saved the patient and the insurance company both money? Absolutely. Is the system set up for the best care and cost efficiency? Absolutely not.'' 
 Dr. Sacks said she worried that seeing so many patients would lead to errors. Last year, she moved to a clinic that focuses on longer patient appointments, 30 to 60 minutes. This translates to 10 to 12 patients a day. Patients also communicate directly with her by phone or e-mail. 
 During those longer appointments, Dr. Sacks can perform basic lab tests and simple procedures, so patients see fewer specialists.
 ''I probably head off a handful of emergency-room visits and hospital stays every month because patients can see me as soon as they have a problem, and I can be thorough rather than rushed,'' she said.
 One patient who avoided the emergency room was Todd Martin, a store manager in Seattle who went to Dr. Sacks's clinic on a Saturday. 
 ''I couldn't stop coughing and was having trouble breathing,'' Mr. Martin said. ''They were able to see me and give me a chest X-ray.'' 
 Mr. Martin said he spent $40 for the resulting prescription but the rest was covered by a monthly fee he pays Dr. Sacks. ''A weekend visit to the E.R. would have easily cost $1,000,'' he said.
 Dr. Sacks charges patients a direct monthly fee of $54 to $129 based on age, and she doesn't take insurance. Her office calls its philosophy ''direct practice'' because it's a direct contract between doctor and patient. But she advises patients to obtain insurance plans to cover large, unexpected health costs like those to treat cancer or a heart attack.
 ''We say it's like having a car and paying for your own oil changes and tuneups, but getting insurance in case you need a big repair,'' she said. 
 Dr. Garrison Bliss, who in 2007 founded the group where Dr. Sacks works, has offered direct-practice services since 1997. He says patients can save 15 to 40 percent of their medical costs by using this model, based on his examination of insurance rates and his belief that good primary care can fill most of a patient's needs. 
 Insurance plans that cover every little thing can be very expensive, Dr. Bliss said. He said that a patient who paid an annual fee at his clinic and took out a higher-deductible insurance plan would usually come out ahead, even if the patient's health needs meant that he or she had to pay the entire deductible.
 Dr. Bliss's office operates with just two administrative employees for seven doctors. He estimates that if he took insurance, one or two administrative workers would be needed per doctor.
 Insurance administration costs can take a big bite out of a practice's revenue. A recent Weill Cornell Medical College study found that a third of the money received by primary care physicians pays for interactions between a doctor's practice and patients' health plans. 
 Patricia Rogers Caroselli, a retired assistant principal who is a patient of Dr. Sacks, dreaded going to her former clinic. ''The waiting room was always noisy and crowded,'' she said. In the examining room, she felt that she should ''get in and out and not waste the doctor's time with questions,'' she said. 
 In contrast, she said, she appreciates the friendly calm of Dr. Sacks's new surroundings and the personal attention. ''Everyone should have this kind of patient care,'' she said. 
 Dr. Sacks said the financial mechanics of the direct-practice model match her medical goals. When she was compensated based on insurance, she was paid every time she saw a patient. Now, if she can use education and prevention to reduce office visits, she and her patients benefit, she said.
 ''Having more time to sit with each patient has made me a better doctor,'' she said. ''I had a disabled patient that I saw for 13 years. Until she came to my new clinic, I never had the time to learn the details of her accident and the resulting complications. I was always treating whatever the immediate concern was.''
 TECHNOLOGY has helped many doctors reduce costs. Dr. Batlle says he has been building his arsenal of technology solutions one by one, with ''lots of trial and error,'' for eight years. 
 Recently, he saw a 52-year-old patient with hypertension. As he examined the patient, noting blood pressure and other vital signs, he entered the information into his laptop computer to add to the patient's electronic medical record. He also typed in the codes for billing and insurance. 
 The patient wondered if he was due for a prescription refill, so Dr. Batlle checked his computer again, found that he was, and hit a button to send the refill request to the pharmacy. As the patient left, Dr. Batlle hit the keyboard to send the bill electronically to the insurance company. 
 ''He'll even go to the Web to schedule his follow-up appointment,'' Dr. Batlle said. ''I don't pay a receptionist to sit and answer phones.'' 
 Dr. Batlle says other doctors could outfit an office for less than the $25,000 he spent on technology.
 ''Most doctors think they need to hire two receptionists, a billing person and two nurses to run a primary care office,'' he said. ''But they can learn about these technologies from other doctors, and the software salespeople do some training.'' 
 Some physicians hire consultants to find and install the right equipment. Doctors who want to switch to electronic health records may also receive financial support from the government through the stimulus package.
 By using new technology and streamlining processes, small primary care practices can reduce their costs to half of what a typical practice pays, from about 60 percent of income down to 30 percent, Dr. Wasson said. He said that doctors who focus on reducing their costs can see fewer patients without sacrificing income. Dr. Sacks said she and her colleagues didn't have to take a pay cut when they moved to Dr. Bliss's practice.
 As Congress and the Obama administration begin to focus more closely on health care, some primary care doctors are weighing in. Dr. Bliss, for instance, has been to Washington twice in the last month to share his ideas with legislators. He knows he's in a debate with powerful voices, especially insurance companies and hospitals. So he and other doctors are encouraging patients to speak up as well. 
 ''We need to bring the patients to the barricades with us,'' Dr. Batlle says.

HEADLINE: An Electric Glide, at a Price

BYLINE: By KRISTEN HALL-GEISLER

 BODY:
CRAIG BRAMSCHER is betting that there are thousands of motorcycle riders eager to buy zero-emissions bikes. He ought to hope that his potential customers are as prosperous as they are environmentally conscious.
 Mr. Bramscher's latest creation, the Brammo Enertia, an 18-horsepower electric motorcycle with a top speed of 55 miles an hour, will make its public debut in New York on June 9. The 280-pound Enertia is available for preorder at $11,995 -- that's $4 less than a Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide -- though the electric motorcycle is eligible for a 10 percent federal tax credit. 
 When Enertia deliveries begin in early July -- they will be sold through Best Buy -- new owners can fill up for pennies per charge rather than dollars per gallon. The motorcycle's on-board charger can plug into a standard 110-volt outlet and recharge the lithium-ion batteries in less than four hours. Some of the Enertia's components are made entirely of materials that began life as pop bottles and carpets, while the body panels are created from a mixed percentage of recycled and new materials. 
 Unlike many proposed electric vehicles, the Enertia comes from a company with some experience. Mr. Bramscher knew, even as his company was building the open-frame Ariel Atom sports car in 2002, that he wanted to go electric. He even looked into making an electric version of the Atom, but could not strike a royalty agreement with the car's designer. 
 Mr. Bramscher contemplated a competitor for the Tesla Roadster, but determined it would take a half-billion-dollar investment to engineer and build an electric car. And there was a bigger challenge: while the promise of fast charging was (and still is) on the horizon, electric cars were not yet affordable for the average commuter. 
 ''What makes sense now, in terms of power-to-weight ratio and energy density,'' Mr. Bramscher said in a recent interview, ''is a motorcycle.'' 
 Mr. Bramscher sold the rights to produce the Ariel Atom, which reviewers have described as more like a four-wheel motorcycle than a car, to one of Brammo's original investors. Mr. Bramscher said he was still friends with the new owner, who is based in Virginia, and ''the product is in good hands.'' The Brammo operation in Ashland, Ore., was cut from about 50 employees to a core research and development team of up to 18 people. 
 The new team started almost from scratch. Lessons had been learned from manufacturing the Atom, including how to make a prototype rapidly and then take the motorcycle into production. The motorcycle would not have the Atom's handcrafted parts. 
 It would be engineered for high-volume production and have labor costs lower than what it would take to ship the completed bike from China. Though parts come from around the world, Mr. Bramscher said he wanted to make assembling the bike in the United States economically feasible. 
 Mr. Bramscher also said he wanted to keep the supply chain as green as possible. Brammo coordinates ''milk runs'' through Europe to consolidate components before shipping the parts to the United States. It also works with vendors to use recycled shipping materials. Sapa, a supplier of aluminum products in Portland, Ore., puts Brammo's orders in recyclable, reusable plastic crates for shipment to Ashland, at the state's southern border. Brammo then ships the crates back to be reused. 
 The first Enertias will roll out of Brammo's headquarters this summer. These first bikes will have a range of 45 miles at 25 m.p.h. (as with any battery-powered vehicle, maxing out the speedometer will significantly decrease the range). Mr. Bramscher expects to ramp up production into the tens of thousands quickly and employ 80 to 100 people by the end of the year. 
 Mr. Bramscher said he asked himself when embarking on the project whether this was a product for a lot of people. His research says yes; among the 10 million to 12 million motorcycle riders in the United States, many are looking for cleaner transportation. Mr. Bramscher said: ''We've seen a tremendous amount of interest from women and aspirational riders, people who say, 'I've always wanted to, but ...'''

HEADLINE: For Sotomayor and Thomas, Paths Fork at Race and Identity

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR and DAVID GONZALEZ; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
If Judge Sonia Sotomayor joins Justice Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court, they may find that they have far more than a job title in common.
 Both come from the humblest of beginnings. Both were members of the first sizable generation of minority students at elite colleges and then Yale Law School. Both benefited from affirmative action policies.
 But that is where their similarities end, and their disagreements begin. For the first time, the Supreme Court would include two minority judges, but ones who stand at opposite poles of thinking about race, identity and opportunity. Judge Sotomayor and Justice Thomas have walked parallel paths and yet arrived at contrary conclusions, not only on legal questions, but on personal ones, too.
 Judge Sotomayor celebrates being Latina, calling it a reason for her success; Justice Thomas bristles at attempts to define him by race and says he has succeeded despite the obstacles it posed. Being a woman of Puerto Rican descent is rich and fulfilling, Judge Sotomayor says, while Justice Thomas calls being a black man in America a largely searing experience. Off the bench, Judge Sotomayor has helped build affirmative action programs. On the bench, Justice Thomas has argued against them with thunderous force. 
 The two may sit together on a court that is struggling over whether race and ethnicity should be a factor in legal thinking, each pitting his or her hard-won lessons against the other's. Both judges are passionate about minority success, dedicating countless hours to mentorship. But Judge Sotomayor sees herself as the successful product of diversity initiatives, whereas Justice Thomas, who thinks of himself as a scarred survivor of those efforts, believes they often backfire.
 The two judges have lived, not just argued, the strongest cases for and against affirmative action, said Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University. With both on the court, he said, ''their voices are going to come to exemplify the contending positions.'' 
 When Ms. Sotomayor and Mr. Thomas arrived at college -- she at Princeton in 1972, he at Holy Cross in 1968 -- they worried about the same thing: what others would think when they opened their mouths. 
 Ms. Sotomayor had grown up in the Bronx speaking Spanish; Mr. Thomas's relatives in Pin Point, Ga., mixed English with Gullah, a language of the coastal South. Both attended Catholic school, where they were drilled by nuns in grammar and other subjects. But at college, they realized they still sounded unpolished.
 Ms. Sotomayor shut herself in her dorm room and eventually resorted to grade-school grammar textbooks to relearn her syntax. Mr. Thomas barely spoke, he said later, and majored in English literature to conquer the language.
 ''I just worked at it,'' he said in an interview years later, ''on my pronunciations, sounding out words.''
 For many East Coast colleges, it was a new era. After the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Holy Cross pledged to do its part in the civil rights movement by recruiting black students; just a few months later, Mr. Thomas became one of six in his freshman class. 
 Princeton was integrating not only by race and ethnicity, but also by gender. Ms. Sotomayor was one of 20 Hispanics in her class, students estimate. Princeton had admitted women just a few years earlier, and ''husband-hunters,'' as one of the alumni still campaigning against their presence called them, were vastly outnumbered at the college. 
 When the students arrived, they were subject to constant suspicion that they had not earned their slots. ''It was a question echoed over and over again, not only verbally but in people's thoughts,'' said Franklin Moore, a former Princeton administrator. Ms. Sotomayor and Mr. Thomas, honors students in high school, considered themselves qualified. But to prove their critics wrong, they studied with special determination. 
 ''We can't let these people think we just came off the street without anything to offer Princeton,'' said Eneida Rosa, another member of the Hispanic contingent, describing how seriously she and Ms. Sotomayor took their studies. 
 The two future judges led similar student organizations -- Mr. Thomas helped found a black student group, while Ms. Sotomayor was co-chairwoman of a Puerto Rican one -- and shared the same liberal politics. They graduated at the top of their classes. And afterward, they each headed to Yale Law School.
 Interpretations
 But perhaps because of their backgrounds, Judge Sotomayor and Justice Thomas came to view their campus experiences in very different ways.
 Even by the standards of the Jim Crow South, Mr. Thomas's childhood was marked by bitter blows and isolation. He was taunted not only by classmates at his all-white high school but also by blacks, who called him ''ABC,'' for ''America's Blackest Child,'' on account of his dark skin. A black among Catholics and a Catholic among blacks, he sometimes seemed to fit in nowhere at all.
 Mr. Thomas learned he could rely only on himself. His father left when he was a toddler. A few years later, his mother sent him to live with his grandparents, dumping his possessions in grocery bags and sending him out the front door, he wrote in his autobiography, ''My Grandfather's Son.''
 Ms. Sotomayor also grew up without a father; hers died of heart problems when she was 9. But her mother was a sustaining force, supporting the family by working as a nurse. In a recent speech, Judge Sotomayor recalled her mother and grandmother chatting and chopping ingredients for dinner. ''I can't describe to you the warmth of that moment for a child,'' she said. 
 In New York, Puerto Ricans were pitied for poverty and blamed for crime. Popular images were dominated by the gangs of ''West Side Story'' and bumbling comics with broken English. According to friends, Ms. Sotomayor was not active in her high school's small Latino club. Ethnicity was not something to be ashamed of, they said, but they did not really celebrate it either. 
 But on Princeton's manicured campus, Ms. Sotomayor explored her roots in a way she never had on trips to Puerto Rico or in ''Nuyorican'' circles back home. In a Puerto Rican studies seminar, she absorbed the literature, economics, history and politics of the island, and by senior year, she was writing a thesis on its first democratically elected governor. In its dedication, she sounds newly enchanted with her heritage.
 ''To my family,'' she wrote, ''for you have given me my Puerto Rican-ness.'' 
 ''To the people of my island, for the rich history that is mine,'' she continued.
 Back to Their Roots
 Ms. Sotomayor was not alone; for many minority students who arrived at elite colleges, the first thing they wanted to study was their own backgrounds. ''What we did on campus was to use its resources to understand ourselves in a larger context,'' said Eduardo Padro, a New York State Supreme Court justice who was raised in East Harlem and arrived at Yale in 1971, part of the first group of working-class Puerto Ricans there. 
 Ms. Sotomayor also became a passionate advocate for Hispanic recruitment. She took a work-study job in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects. As co-chairwoman of Accion Puertorriquena, she wrote a complaint accusing Princeton of discrimination, convinced the leaders of the Chicano Caucus to co-sign it and filed it with the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
 But Ms. Sotomayor was no campus radical. She was more likely to mete out discipline than to be subjected to it: in an early turn at judgeship, she sat on a panel that ruled on student infractions. 
 William Bowen, Princeton's president at the time, recalled in an interview that he used to call her for advice on Hispanic issues. After all, the university's leadership wanted to make it more diverse, and Ms. Sotomayor's activism helped them make their case. As a result of her efforts, other students said, Princeton hired its first Hispanic administrator and invited a Puerto Rican professor to teach.
 While Ms. Sotomayor embraced her ethnicity in college and helped bring more Hispanics to campus, Mr. Thomas began to worry about the consequences of racial categorizations and grew skeptical of Holy Cross's efforts to enroll blacks. 
 He flirted a bit with black nationalism, reading Malcolm X's autobiography until the pages were worn. He drank in Ayn Rand's ideas about individualism. He identified with the protagonists of Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison novels, whose destinies were determined by racial stereotypes. 
 ''I began to think of myself as a man without a country,'' he wrote in his autobiography about his increasing alienation.
 Some of his black classmates were losing their way, failing classes or falling into drug use, and he began to think of the college's recruitment efforts as misguided. In his autobiography, he wrote of ''these gifted young people being sacrificed on the altar of an abstract theory of social justice.''
 Ms. Sotomayor and Mr. Thomas missed each other at Yale by only a few years, but they might as well have studied at entirely different institutions.
 Given her standout record at Princeton, said James A. Thomas, a former dean of admissions, Ms. Sotomayor's background had little role in her acceptance to the school. Again, she immersed herself in Puerto Rican issues, winning a spot on the law review with an article about Puerto Rico's rights to resources in its seabed, leading the minority students' association and urging the administration to hire a tenured Hispanic faculty member. (A quarter-century later, she is still pressing the school on the issue.) 
 Mr. Thomas, though, felt out of place from the moment he arrived and only became more disaffected. He had listed his race on his application and later felt haunted by the decision. 
 ''I was among the elite, and I knew that no amount of striving could make me one of them,'' he wrote. He ran into financial troubles and applied for scholarship money from a wealthy Yale family, a process he found humiliating. Friends recall that he insisted on dressing like a field hand, in overalls and a hat.
 Shared Rejection
 Mr. Thomas and Ms. Sotomayor did have one experience in common: law firm interviewers asked them if they really deserved their slots at Yale, implying that they might not have been accepted if they were white. 
 Ms. Sotomayor fought back so intensely -- against a Washington firm, now merged with another -- that she surprised even some of the school's Hispanics. She filed a complaint with a faculty-student panel, which rejected the firm's initial letter of apology and asked for a stronger one. Minority and women's groups covered campus with fliers supporting her. Ms. Sotomayor eventually dropped her complaint, but the firm had already suffered a blow to its reputation.
 Mr. Thomas was more private about the experience -- even some friends do not recall it -- but he took it hard. With rejection letters piling up, he feared he would not be able to support his wife and young son. 
 The problem, Mr. Thomas concluded, was affirmative action. Whites would not hire him, he concluded, because no one believed he had attended Yale on his own merits. He felt acute betrayal: his education was supposed to put him on equal footing, but he was not offered the jobs that his white classmates were getting. He saved the pile of rejection letters, he said in a speech years later.
 ''It was futile for me to suppose that I could escape the stigmatizing effects of racial preference,'' he wrote in his autobiography. 
 From Yale, Mr. Thomas and Ms. Sotomayor took what seemed like entirely different paths: he as a Reagan official who helped dismantle affirmative action programs; she as a prosecutor and litigator. 
 But once in a while, their stories have converged. In their nominations to the Supreme Court, both were presented as barrier-breaking success stories. Both have seen those nominations become bogged down in debates about race and ethnicity.
 And at times, each of them has viewed opposition to their confirmations in racial or ethnic terms. When Democrats opposed Justice Thomas's nomination because of sexual harassment accusations, he called it a ''high-tech lynching,'' a triumph of stereotype. 
 Judge Sotomayor saw a hitch in her own confirmation for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a not entirely dissimilar light. Senate Republicans had held up her nomination for a year, and shortly afterward, she said they made assumptions about her views simply ''because I was Hispanic and a woman.''
 ''I was dealt with on the basis of stereotypes,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Economy Is Still at the Brink

BYLINE: By SANDY B. LEWIS and WILLIAM D. COHAN. 
Sandy B. Lewis, an organic farmer, founded S. B. Lewis & Co., a brokerage house. William D. Cohan, a contributing editor at Fortune and former Wall Street banker, is the author of ''House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street.''

 BODY:
WHETHER at a fund-raising dinner for wealthy supporters in Beverly Hills, or at an Air Force base in Nevada, or at Charlie Rose's table in New York City, President Obama is conducting an all-out campaign to try to make us feel a whole lot better about the economy as quickly as possible. ''It's safe to say we have stepped back from the brink, that there is some calm that didn't exist before,'' he told donors at the Beverly Hilton Hotel late last month. 
 Mr. Obama thinks that the way to revive the economy is to restore confidence in it. If the mood is right, the capital will flow. But this belief is dangerously misguided. We are sympathetic to the extraordinary challenge the president faces, but if we've learned anything at all two years into the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes, it is that a capital-markets system this dependent on public confidence is a shockingly inadequate foundation upon which to rest our economy. 
 We have both spent large chunks of our lives working on Wall Street, absorbing its ethic and mores. We're concerned that nothing has really been fixed. We're doubly concerned that people appear to feel the worst of the storm is over -- and in this, they are aided and abetted by a hugely popular and charismatic president and by the fact that the Dow has increased by 35 percent or so since Mr. Obama started to lay out his economic plans in March. But wishing for improvement and managing by the Dow's swings are a fool's game. (Disclosure: One of us, Mr. Lewis, was convicted on federal charges of stock manipulation in 1989, pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001 and had his lifetime trading ban overturned by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006; documents relating to the case can be found at sblewis.net.)
 The storm is not over, not by a long shot. Huge structural flaws remain in the architecture of our financial system, and many of the fixes that the Obama administration has proposed will do little to address them and may make them worse. At another fund-raising event, for Senator Harry Reid, President Obama said: ''We didn't ask for the challenges that we face. But we are determined to answer the call to meet those challenges, to cast aside the old arguments and overcome the stubborn divisions and move forward as one people and one nation .... It will take time but I promise you, I promise you, I'll always tell you the truth about the challenges we face.''
 Keeping that statement in mind -- as well as an abiding faith in the importance of properly functioning capital markets -- we have come up with a set of questions meant to challenge a popular president, with vast majorities in Congress, to find the flaws in the system, to figure out what's being done to fix them and to get to the truth about the difficulties we face as we set out to restore the proper functioning of our markets and our standing in the world. 
 Six months ago, nobody believed that our banking system was well designed, functioning smoothly or properly regulated -- so why then are we so desperately anxious to restore that model as the status quo? Nearly every new program emanating these days from the Treasury Department -- the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Public Private Investment Program, the ''stress tests'' of major banks -- appears to have been designed to either paper over or to prop up a system that has clearly failed. 
 Instead of hauling out the new drywall to cover up the existing studs, let's seriously consider ripping down the entire structure, dynamiting the foundation and building a new system that rewards taking prudent risks, allocates capital where it is needed, allows all investors to get accurate and timely financial information and increases value to shareholders and creditors. 
 As a start, the best-compensated executives at the top of these big banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms should be treated like general partners of yore. If a firm takes prudent risks that pay off, this top layer of management should be well compensated. But if the risks these people take are imprudent and the losses grave, they should expect to lose their jobs. Instead of getting guaranteed salaries or huge bonuses, they should have the bulk of their net worth completely at risk for a long stretch of time -- 10 years come to mind -- for the decisions they make while in charge. This would go a long way toward re-aligning the interests of these firms with those of their shareholders and clients and the American people, who have been saddled with their risks and mistakes.
 Why is so much effort being put into propping up those at the top of the economic pyramid -- the money-center banks, the insurance companies, the hedge funds and so forth -- when during a period of deflation like the one we are in, any recovery will come only by restoring the confidence of the people down at the bottom of the pyramid? 
 Confidence will return only when jobs can be found and mortgage payments are made. Even if Mr. Obama's claim is true that his $780 billion stimulus package ''saved or created'' some 150,000 jobs, we seem a long way away from the point where those struggling to get by will feel like spending again. What happens when people buy a car once every 10 years instead of once every two or three, especially now that we taxpayers own such a big percentage of the American auto industry?
 Instead of promising the imminent return of good times, why isn't Mr. Obama talking more about the importance of living within our means and not spending money we don't have on things we don't need? We used to be a frugal nation. The president should be talking about kicking our addictions to easy credit, to quick fixes and to a culture of more is better (and Congress's new credit-card legislation, while perhaps eliminating some of the worst aspects of that industry, certainly didn't send the right message about personal finance). 
 Gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s, cigarette boats, no-income mortgages and private jets should be relegated to the junk heaps of history, or better yet, put in a museum dedicated to never forgetting the greed and avarice that led us so far astray.
 Why is the morphine drip still in the veins of the financial system? These trillions in profligate federal spending are intended to make us feel better again even though feeling pain, and dealing with it responsibly, would be healthier in the long run. It is time to stop rescuing the banks that got us into this mess. If that means more bank failures on a grander scale or the dismemberment of Citigroup, so be it. Depositors will be protected -- up to $250,000 per account -- but shareholders, creditors and, sadly, many employees will, for the long-term health of the system, need to feel the market's wrath.
 Is there to be any limit on bailouts? We have now thrown money at the big banks, any number of regional ones, insurance companies, General Motors, Chrysler and state and local governments. Will we soon be bailing out Dartmouth, which just lost its AAA bond rating? Is there no room left for what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter termed ''creative destruction''? And what is the plan to get the American people out of all these equity stakes we now own and don't want? 
 Furthermore, for government leaders to decide who shall live and who shall die in an economic sense opens them up to legitimate charges of crony capitalism and favoritism. We will benefit in the long run from a return to market discipline.
 Why has Mr. Obama surrounded himself largely with economic advisers who are theoreticians and academics -- distinguished though they may be -- but not those who have sat on a trading desk, made a market, managed a portfolio or set a spread?
 In our view, one of the ways out of this economic conundrum is to have experienced traders -- not hothouse flowers -- design incentives that will encourage the market to have buyers and sellers meet anew around the proper valuations of assets, not some artificial construct of a market propped up by a pliant Financial Accounting Standards Board or government-sponsored programs that appear to be virtually giving money away to hedge funds and private-equity firms so that they will buy assets they would not ordinarily buy. We're not talking about putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, just putting people who know how markets function in the real world into the important seats in Washington.
 Why isn't the Obama administration working night and day to give the public a vastly increased amount of detailed information about what happens in financial markets? Ever since traders started disappearing from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the last decade of the 20th century, there has been less and less transparency about the price and volume of trades. The New York Stock Exchange really exists in name only, as computers execute a very large percentage of all trades, far away from any exchange. 
 As a result, there is little flow of information, and small investors are paying the price. The beneficiaries, no surprise, are the remains of the old Wall Street broker-dealers -- now bank-holding companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- that can see in advance what their clients are interested in buying, and might trade the same stocks for their own accounts. Incredibly, despite the events of last fall, nearly every one of Wall Street's proprietary trading desks can still take huge risks and then, if they get into trouble, head to the Federal Reserve for short-term rescue financing. 
 Here's something that should change in terms of transparency. The most recent price that any stock traded for should be published online in real time for all to see. And the public should have access to a new type of electronic ticker that provides market information in language that all can understand, not just the insiders.
 As for those impossibly complex securities that caused so much of the trouble -- among them derivatives, credit-default swaps and asset-backed securities -- the S.E.C. should have the power to make public all the documentation surrounding these weapons of mass financial destruction, including all data about the current costs of buying and selling them and the cash flow underlying them. We also need widely accessible, real-time reporting of all trades in the bond market. We bet Mike Bloomberg's company could help design such a system for our benefit.
 Why is the government still complicit in making the system ever less transparent, even when it comes to what should clearly be considered public information? For instance, it took more than a year for the Federal Reserve to disclose that it had agreed to pay BlackRock -- the huge money manager that is 45 percent owned by Bank of America -- and others $71 million in a no-bid contract to manage the $30 billion of toxic assets that JPMorgan did not want when it bought Bear Stearns in March 2008. And that is only one of the five contracts BlackRock has with the government as a result of this crisis -- the nature of the other contracts remains secret. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has made much of financialstability.gov, the Treasury's new Web site dedicated to ''transparency, oversight and accountability.'' But look it over and try to find, for example, just one record of a bona fide credit-default swap, or the names of the hedge-fund and private-equity investors who have participated in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility bonanza. It was only a lawsuit filed by a watchdog group that convinced the Treasury to divulge details of former Secretary Henry Paulson's October meeting with the chief executives of the 10 largest Wall Street firms to force them to take money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. A lawsuit filed last November by Bloomberg News to force the Federal Reserve to reveal the details on more than $2 trillion in loans that went to banks including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs is still pending in federal court. 
 And what has become of the S.E.C.'s year-old investigation into who made short-dated, out-of-the-money bets in March 2008 hoping Bear Stearns would fail -- bets that were suddenly worth millions of dollars when the company did collapse later that month? 
 Why do we still not know why Mr. Paulson, Mr. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, allowed Lehman Brothers to file bankruptcy last Sept. 15 but then, a day later, saved A.I.G.? Or why last November this trio decided to absorb potential losses on $301 billion of Citigroup's shaky assets, when conventional wisdom among insiders held that they were worth only $150 billion at best? 
 Also, before Dick Fuld, Lehman Brothers' chief executive, appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last October, it demanded from company executives boxes of documents about what happened at Lehman and why. Where are those documents? 
 Why hasn't President Obama insisted on public hearings over what happened during this financial crisis? 
 Not 
 a single top executive of a Wall Street securities firm responsible for causing the financial crisis has had the courage or the decency to step forward in front of the cameras and explain to the American people in his own words exactly how and why he allowed his firm to cause the crisis. Both Mr. Fuld and Alan Schwartz, the chief executive of Bear Stearns at the end, in their Congressional testimony blamed the proverbial once-in-a-century financial tsunami. Do they or any of their peers really think this is true? 
 There may be a way to find out. There is much talk nowadays coming from top bankers -- Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorganChase, John Mack of Morgan Stanley and even Ken Lewis of Bank of America -- about seeing how quickly they can repay to the Treasury the TARP money Mr. Paulson forced on them. One precondition of their being allowed to repay the funds should be a requirement that each gives a public deposition and explains, under oath, what truly happened and why. 
 Such a public hearing would be meant only to offer a truthful assessment of the errors in judgment made at each firm and to promote understanding, so that we -- somehow -- can avoid repeating the same mistakes again. It would not be about indictments. These men should be offered use immunity from prosecution for their honest testimony, but only with a clear understanding that the failure to tell the truth at any point would result in serious legal consequences. The hearing could be complemented by a truth-seeking commission established to hear the accounts of several people who have departed the scene, including, among others, Mr. Paulson, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Wall Street chiefs like Mr. Fuld, Hank Greenberg of A.I.G., Sanford Weill of Citigroup, Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns and Stan O'Neal of Merrill Lynch. While far removed from their positions of authority, these men have tales to tell about how this crisis got started and why. 
 Why are we not looking to change our current civil and criminal racketeering statutes, which are playing a perverse role in investigations of the crisis? Statutes meant to give prosecutors extraordinary powers of seizure before an indictment is handed up, or to impose treble damages, are appropriately used to break up rings of criminal behavior like the Mafia or drug cartels. 
 But 
 a few clever prosecutors could use such laws to bring charges against people or firms in the financial services industry whose pattern of bad behavior played important roles in the collapse. Such outright seizure of capital or assets through use of the racketeering statutes can do much harm by giving prosecutors an unnecessarily powerful role in our capital markets. There must be a way to keep what is good about the statutes and to make sure they are not used for ill in trying to get to the bottom of the financial meltdown.
 We are in one of those ''generational revolutions'' that Jefferson said were as important as anything else to the proper functioning of our democracy. We can no longer pretend that our collective behavior as a nation for the past 25 years has been worthy of us as a people. Many of us hoped that Barack Obama's election would redress the dire decline in our collective ethic. We are 139 days into his presidency, and while there is still plenty of hope that Mr. Obama will fulfill his mandate, his record on searching out the causes of the financial crisis has not been reassuring. He must do what is necessary to restore the American people's -- and the world's -- faith in American capitalism and in our nation. Answering our questions may help us get back on track. But time is wasting.

HEADLINE: Someone To Pick Up After the Pup

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
IN rough economic times, Lashelle and Mark Davis have cut back on treats like date nights, their outings to New York City from their Westchester County home for dinner and a show. But Mrs. Davis has made it clear that there is one luxury she will not give up: her professional pooper scooper. 
 His name is John Patterson, and he arrives twice a week, waste pan and shovel in hand, to clean up the mess left on their wraparound lawn by Daisy, their white German shepherd. His scooping is particularly appreciated in warm weather, when lawn use and bad odors rise along with the temperature. 
 ''It's the best money we spend every month,'' said Mrs. Davis, 36, who has four children, ages 2 to 9. 
 ''This dog was my husband's and my older son's idea,'' she added. ''One of the things I said was, 'I'm not taking care of the dog.' ''
 Even in a recession, some pet-waste pickup businesses say they are thriving because of their low cost (typically $12 to $16 per weekly visit), their convenience and their environmental appeal. The Association of Professional Animal Waste Specialists, which was formed in 2002 and has about 150 members, estimates that the country has 400 to 500 scooping businesses, up from a handful two decades ago. 
 George Sichler, a detective with the New York Police Department's scuba-diving team who started a DoodyCalls franchise in Westchester in 2001, said business is up 20 percent this year, though he declined to say how many clients he has, beyond ''hundreds.'' In Port Monmouth, N.J., When Doody Calls (no connection), has grown 12 percent this year, according to the owner, Mary Ellen Levy.
 Most local pooper-scooper laws deal with public spaces, not private property. But in suburbs of New York and elsewhere, mom and pop operators with a sense of humor (the companies have names like Poop Patrol and ScooperDude and slogans like ''We're No. 1 in the No. 2 business''), have found a market: the super-busy, families with children who play in the yard and homeowner associations with common greenspace or dog runs. 
 To increase their marketability, many of the companies cast themselves as environmental guardians, emphasizing the dangers of dog waste, which can carry bacteria and parasites that cause disease and contaminate waterways.
 The scoopers, who also handle cat, goose and deer waste, typically place it in plastic bags and, depending on local ordinances, dump it in the homeowner's trash or drop it off at local landfills or incinerators. Their growing popularity parallels that of styling boutiques and travel services that have sprung up to help Americans spend about $45 billion on their pets each year. 
 Mr. Sichler said he and his wife ran a pet-food delivery business in the late '90s and got into waste removal in 2001 after an epiphany: ''We hated cleaning up after our own dogs, and we wondered if other people hated it as much and would pay someone else to do it.''
 The latest survey by the American Pet Products Association estimated that in 2008, Americans owned 94 million cats and 78 million dogs. There were pets in 71 million households, or 62 percent of all homes -- up from 56 percent in 1988. Enter the scoopers, which Cheresee Rehart, the president of their professional association, said range from ''a guy completely happy with 20 customers'' and an income of $30,000 a year to multimillion-dollar chains with franchises.
 The service Mrs. Davis uses is DoodyCalls, a Virginia company founded in 2004 that now operates from 42 sites in 21 states. Its Web site proclaims: ''Woof-woof waste does not a good fertilizer make. It is actually toxic to your lawn.''
 But for harried customers, convenience trumps all other incentives. ''We sell time,'' said the company's founder, Jacob D'Aniello, 32, a former technology consultant.
 One customer, Kevin Durkin, 50, a stay-at-home father of two in the Westchester hamlet of Katonah, said it fell to him to retrieve the waste produced by his black Labrador, Savannah, until he spotted a DoodyCalls ad and signed up for the service this spring. ''It's just something else I don't have to take care of,'' he said on a recent Monday morning as he watched Mr. Patterson, his DoodyCalls ''technician,'' traverse the lawn in a grid pattern. 
 ''Go through the flower beds, too!'' Mr. Durkin shouted from the porch. 
 Mr. Patterson, 26, whose previous job was stocking supermarket shelves, said his fiancee laughed when she first heard about his new vocation. But he said he enjoys working outside and makes sure he uses a long-handled scoop to keep a safe distance from the waste. He is one of five scoopers employed by the franchise, earning about $15 an hour.
 On tree-lined suburban streets, the bright green DoodyCalls pickup trucks blend in easily with the other service vehicles. Wearing khaki shorts and a green jacket with the company logo and slogan, Mr. Patterson could easily be mistaken for a landscaper. He enters and leaves without supervision while homeowners are at work, walking fast and stopping here and there to scoop with a flick or two of the wrist. Then he dumps the waste into biodegradable bags in his truck.
 It takes Mr. Patterson as little as 10 minutes to finish a job. He said he does 20 to 30 properties a day, including some estates with several acres of land but dogs that use well-marked territories. In West Harrison, the Davises' dog, Daisy, greeted Mr. Patterson with a wagging tail and a leap onto his chest. 
 Some customers see the service less as luxury than necessity. Robin A. Fries, 56, who lives on Staten Island, said that when her back problems worsened last year, she thought she might have to get rid of her three cats: an arthritic 15-year-old female who sometimes cannot make it to the litter box, a 10-year-old female who ''throws up for a living'' and a young stray male who is always trying to escape.
 Then she hired When Doody Calls of Port Monmouth, which has about 70 clients on Staten Island. Her scooper, Bruce Levy, comes by twice a week for $130 a month and even takes out her trash and brings in her mail as a favor.
 ''I'd give up my cleaning woman before I'd give up this service,'' said Ms. Fries, a retired teacher. ''A lot of cleaning women don't clean up kitty litter.''

HEADLINE: Morning in America

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
 As the host of the television news show ''Morning Joe,'' you are known as a token conservative at MSNBC. But your new book, ''The Last Best Hope,'' is a critique of Bush-style conservatism and suggests that the Republican Party has basically gone off the deep end. I'm serious about this. The Republican Party needs to reform or die. President Bush did three things. He destroyed the Republican majority, he crippled the American conservative movement and he weakened the country. That's a hell of a trifecta. 
 Do you think it will take the Republicans a generation to recover? Somewhere between a generation and a year. 
 Your book argues for a return to ''the restrained approach'' of the Reagan years. But do you think that's just nostalgia for the vanished past? I don't want to return to the past. I don't yearn for when I was 18 years old. I was in high school then. I had acne. I had a terrible hairdo. I'm sure I was sporting polyester pants. 
 Obama has been described as the Ronald Reagan of the Democratic Party. He is. He understands where America is temperamentally. He thinks big like Ronald Reagan.
 You're not so admiring of him in your book. Just because everybody else is engaged in a group hug with Barack Obama doesn't mean that somebody doesn't have to tell the truth.
 You accuse him of ''employing Nixonian devices'' that cynically prey on the fears of Americans. What would you call it? Two weeks into his presidency, he said, Pass my bill or the economy will collapse forever.
 As a former congressman from Pensacola, Fla., who resigned during your fourth term, do you think your criticism of politicians is tinged with envy? No. I'm not an angry person. When I write, the lawyer in me tries to make it as easy to read as possible. 
 What led you into politics? I was always fascinated by politics, and I did not like the direction the country was going under Bill Clinton. 
 You were elected to Congress in 1994, as part of the historic Republican landslide. Presumably you met Clinton then. Yeah, I met Bill Clinton. The first time you meet him you think he's about 7-foot-4. By the third or fourth time you meet him, you say, Hey, I think I may be a couple inches taller than this guy.
 You do try to be genial. No, I am genial. It's not that I want to be. I am. 
 What about that spat with Rachel Maddow, when you abruptly walked off the set in the middle of a disagreement over Obama? Oh, gosh, I don't even remember that. How long ago was that? In '67? Who remembers anything from the summer of love? 
 Didn't you once make TV history for uttering a certain profanity on your show? I think Bono said the word, too, during the Grammy Awards. He's worth about $200 million more than me. He can get away with it.
 Have you had coffee with Keith Olbermann, your fellow MSNBC host? We don't hang out. We don't go to Mets games or Yankees games together, but then again, with my hours, I don't hang out with anybody. I work and come home to my Upper West Side apartment.
 But your wife and two youngest children live in Washington. They bounce back and forth. 
 How do you justify living apart from your family? Would you ask a liberal the same question? Do you think I am less of a father or husband because I have to commute? 
 How did you end up living on the Upper West Side? I love the Upper West Side. I walk down the street all the time and am stopped by Democrats. I don't think they've ever actually met a Republican before. 
 Do they shriek when they see you? Actually, they hug me, especially the little old ladies.

HEADLINE: Taking the Hill

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Inside the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
Sometime in the next few weeks, Congress and the White House will descend into the labyrinthine politics of comprehensive health care reform. For Barack Obama, this signals the end, in a sense, of the eventful prologue to his presidency. Impressive as they are, Obama's legislative victories to this point -- most notably the $787 billion stimulus bill and a stunningly ambitious $3.6 trillion budget resolution -- have been relatively easy lifts for a popular new president installed at a time of economic crisis and buffered by comfortable majorities in the House and Senate. Sure, getting those bills passed required a fair amount of perseverance on the part of the White House, but persuading congressmen to spend public money in their districts doesn't exactly qualify as dark magic. Designing a new health care system, on the other hand, is a legislative goal that has eluded every Democratic president since Harry Truman and that Obama repeatedly vowed to accomplish during last year's campaign; he has said that it is not only a moral imperative but also a crucial part of his plan to remake the American economy, an ever-expanding share of which is swallowed up by doctors' bills and hospital stays. 
Making good on his promise will require not just public expenditure on a disorienting scale but also the kind of activism and creativity, the birthing of new rules and institutions, at which Washington hasn't succeeded for generations.
 It has been 16 years, in fact, since another young, freshly inaugurated Democratic president with a Democratic Congress tried to remake the architecture of health care, and the catastrophe that followed is generally cited as the main deterrent to thinking big about anything in the capital. The plan Bill Clinton took to Congress then, running to more than 1,000 pages of impenetrable new regulations, wasn't what you'd call politically savvy, but the strategy used to sell it was even worse. Having been elected as the latest in a series of outsider presidents after Watergate, ex-Governor Clinton seemed to believe he had been sent by the voters to purify the fetid culture of Washington; he installed a boyhood friend as his chief of staff and stocked his White House with loyal Arkansans and campaign aides ready to overrun a fossilized Congress. His wife, the current secretary of state, developed the health care plan largely without taking House and Senate leaders into her confidence, instead dropping it at the doorstep of the Capitol as a fait accompli. Ever jealous of its prerogative, Congress took a long look, yawned and kicked the whole plan to the gutter, where it soon washed away for good -- along with much of Clinton's ambition for his presidency.
 The first senator elected directly to the Oval Office since 1960, Obama has an entirely different theory of how to exercise presidential power, and he has consciously designed his administration to avoid Clinton's fate. After winning the office with the same kind of outsider appeal as his predecessors, he has quietly but methodically assembled the most Congress-centric administration in modern history. Obama's White House is run by Rahm Emanuel, a former House leader who was generally considered to be on a fast track to the speakership before he resigned to become chief of staff, and it is teeming with aides plucked from the senior ranks of both chambers. Obama seems to think that the dysfunction in Washington isn't only about the heightened enmity between the parties; it's also about the longstanding mistrust between the two branches of government that stare each other down from twin peaks on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
 And so, from Obama's perspective, passing a health care plan this fall isn't primarily a question of whether to include an ''individual mandate'' requiring every American to have insurance or how fully to regulate providers or even how to hit back against ''Harry and Louise''type attack ads, although his aides spend time contemplating all of those things. It's more about navigating the dueling personalities and complex agendas within his own party's Congress. Rather than laying out an intricate plan and then trying to sell it on the Hill, as Clinton did, Obama's strategy seems to be exactly the opposite -- to sell himself to Congress first and worry about the details later. As Emanuel likes to tell his West Wing staff: ''The only nonnegotiable principle here is success. Everything else is negotiable.''
 That this White House seems to view its majorities in Congress almost as its principal constituency reflects, in part, the shared worldview of the three former legislators who are the administration's most powerful figures: Obama, Emanuel and Vice President Joe Biden. ''I'm a Senate guy,'' Biden told me bluntly when I visited him a few weeks ago in his West Wing office. ''It's been my whole life, and I'm incredibly proud of it. Other presidents I've worked with, they view Congress almost as a constitutional impediment, you know?'' 
 As I listened to Biden talk about his Senate career, nearly uninterrupted, for half an hour, I was reminded that leaving any job after 36 years presents, psychologically, a difficult adjustment; at times, the vice president sounded a little like the high-school football star who has received his diploma but can't help hanging around practice anyway, throwing imaginary passes on the sideline. Biden described for me working out at the Senate gym as vice president and stopping into the Senate dining room alone for a bowl of soup. He was amazed, he said, when his former colleagues lined up to say hello. 
 Part of Biden's White House portfolio is to act as unofficial ambassador to the Senate, carrying information back and forth between his old colleagues and his new boss. During the recent debate over the budget, he walked onto the Senate floor and plopped himself down, uninvited, next to Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who as chairman of the powerful Finance Committee will be a central figure in the coming health care debates. Biden asked Baucus what he needed from the White House in order to get a health care bill through his committee, according to both men, and then the talkative Biden spent the better part of a half-hour simply listening quietly, promising as he left the chamber (''I give my word as a Biden,'' he likes to say) to faithfully relay Baucus's thoughts to the president. It was the kind of exchange that rarely took place in 1993, and it is a large part of why Obama's team is optimistic about succeeding where Clinton failed. 
 Obama has told Congressional leaders that his top priority is to get a health care bill signed into law this year. But whether that happens will depend, in some part, on whether the members in both chambers feel they can take the new president at his word. Veteran lawmakers know that presidents always arrive with grand plans to spend their political capital, but more often than not they end up cutting deals with their adversaries or retreating altogether. When they do compromise, it's the representatives and senators who stood with them who often end up paying the price with their constituents. Clinton's failure on health care embarrassed Democrats who had agreed to help build support for his plan, just as his proposal to pass a new energy tax the same year -- a proposal that passed the House but died in the Senate -- left the representatives who voted for it feeling needlessly exposed. When many of them went down to defeat in the midterm massacre of 1994, the lesson that surviving Democrats took away was to beware of presidents who care more about their own survival than they do about yours.
 Obama faces a different political climate; if nothing else, consensus on health care, both in Washington and among employers and providers, is far more advanced than it was in 1993. Even so, Obama's success in passing an expensive and sprawling new health care program will depend, in some part, on whether he can persuade Democrats in Congress that he is not going to wilt under pressure from industry lobbyists or allow a bill to be undone by tensions in his own party. They also have to be persuaded that the cost savings Obama is projecting from a new health care system really are going to materialize in the near future -- and that members aren't going to have to face furious voters a few years out, when deficits are reaching unsustainable levels and showing no signs of remission. 
 Having served under seven commanders in chief during his time in the Senate, Biden understands as well as anyone the pervasive fear in Congress that presidents are out only for themselves. ''I've had presidents who say to me, 'Hey, Joe, get out on that limb for me,' '' Biden told me. At this, he rose from his chair and began acting out the metaphor, half-crouching as he glanced at the limb behind him. ''And I'm out there. I'm out on that limb. And then you hear this shew shew shew'' -- he nicely approximated the noise of a saw rasping back and forth -- ''and you look back, and the limb's being sawed off. 
 ''I've been there with these other presidents,'' he said, returning to his seat. ''I've been there when they said later, 'Well, you know, things change.' '' He leaned forward and touched my knee, in a way that I imagined he might while making the very same case to one of his former colleagues. ''Not this guy,'' Biden said, pointing toward the Oval Office. ''And they know that not over my dead body would it be that way with me.'' 
 IN THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE as a candidate, Obama expected to rely on two close allies who carried enormous influence on the issue with the Democratic Senate. The first was Tom Daschle, the former majority leader and a mentor of sorts, whom Obama considered as a chief of staff and ultimately nominated, instead, to the dual post of health secretary and ''health care czar'' in the West Wing. But then Daschle ran into tax issues during the prelude to his confirmation hearings (he failed to pay income taxes on a car and driver), and Obama, after some hesitation, rather bloodlessly cut him loose. The second man was Ted Kennedy, whose decades-long dedication to health care reform remains, like his stature, unrivaled on the Hill. Kennedy, of course, grew gravely ill during the presidential campaign, and while his staff remains deeply engaged in negotiations on a bill, the senator himself seems in no shape to muscle it through.
 This strange sequence of events has suddenly elevated the profile of Max Baucus, a senator little known outside Montana. (It's a circumstance made all the more striking by his longstanding disdain for Daschle, going back to a dispute over tax cuts.) Low-key and slightly nervous, Baucus has emerged as the pivotal Democrat on what is once again the most pivotal debate in Congress. He is the man charged with designing a plan that can win broad support in the Senate. ''It's a lot of fun,'' Baucus told me recently, which is something you don't often hear a senator say.
 Obama hardly knew Baucus during his abbreviated Senate term; Baucus remarked to me offhandedly that Obama ''didn't really serve in the Senate,'' which seems to be the prevailing sentiment among senators who saw him for only a brief time before he took off to run for president. But Obama's White House has been trying mightily, in ways both overt and indirect, to make up for lost time. Since the inauguration, Baucus has been to the White House twice for personal meetings with the president and once for a dinner at which he was seated next to the first lady. (They talked about Sidwell Friends, the school from which Baucus's son graduated and where the Obama girls are now.) 
 On a flight to Trinidad aboard Air Force One in April, Obama called Baucus to his cabin -- along with Charles Rangel, Baucus's counterpart in the House -- to talk health care for a half-hour or so. ''He just turned to me and said, 'This is my No. 1 issue,' '' Baucus recalled. ''He wants meaningful, comprehensive health care. He doesn't want to pass something where everybody gets flu shots.''
 Perhaps most significant, Rahm Emanuel hired Jim Messina, who was Baucus's longtime chief of staff and who worked last year on the Obama campaign, as a deputy chief of staff at the White House -- a move that seems not entirely coincidental. Messina wasn't just another aide to Baucus; when Messina informed the senator, on the eve of Baucus's son's wedding last summer, that he was leaving the Senate to go work for Obama's campaign, Baucus amended his dinner toast to say that he was losing not one son but two. The two men talk more or less constantly, giving Baucus a close ally in the White House and the president an influential advocate. 
 All of this strategizing and ingratiating appears to be paying off. When I asked Baucus, who worked with George W. Bush to pass his tax cuts in 2001, what kind of impression he had formed of Obama to this point, he looked down at his hands and thought for a moment. ''How do I say this delicately?'' he asked. ''President Bush, he liked being president. You know, there are be-ers, and there are doers. And I think he liked being president, as opposed to doing.'' Obama, on the other hand, strikes Baucus as a doer. ''You've really got to work at it, rather than just enjoying the job,'' he said.
 OBAMA'S AGGRESSIVE COURTSHIP of Congress is plotted and directed by Emanuel, who despite his legendary personality flaws -- his penchant for profane mockery is now so well documented that you sometimes have the sense he's cursing at you so as not to disappoint -- is freakishly well suited to the job. Emanuel served as a senior aide in Clinton's White House before running for Congress and then overseeing the Democrats' successful drive to take back the House, which means he is that rare politician who feels equally at home on both ends of the avenue. ''Rahm is family to all of us,'' Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, told me recently. 
 Emanuel has taken an unusually personal role in handling Congress. One of the first things he did as chief of staff was to give out his cellphone number to every Democratic senator (and some Republicans too), and he occasionally pops up on the House floor, jawing with one member or another. Like Biden, he still exercises on the Hill, at the House gym, mostly so he can jog next to members who might have a question or some new rumor to share. Emanuel's wife and three children are still back in Chicago (they arrive in Washington later this month), and his social calendar is taken up by dinners with former House colleagues on both sides of the aisle, often at one of the trendy downtown restaurants he favors. 
 During a recent conversation in his expansive West Wing office, Emanuel explained that he was well aware, as he and his fellow transition aides set out to fill the various roles in Obama's White House last fall, that many of the aides they hired had pivotal friendships on the Hill that Obama could exploit. ''That was a strategy,'' Emanuel said. ''We didn't kind of parallel-park into it. We had a deep bench of people with a lot of relationships that run into both the House and Senate extensively. And so we wanted to use that to our maximum advantage.'' 
 On health care, for instance, the administration has both chambers of Congress well covered. In addition to hiring Messina, Obama chose as his legislative director Phil Schiliro, who was for 25 years Henry Waxman's closest aide. Waxman, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, just happens to be the one taking the lead, along with Rangel, on drafting health care legislation in the House. (He is also working on a ''cap and trade'' bill on carbon emissions.) Dozens of other former top-level Congressional aides are serving in the administration, including several within steps of the Oval Office: Pete Rouse, whom Senate aides used to refer to, only half-jokingly, as the 101st senator because of the power he wielded as Daschle's longtime chief of staff; Lisa Konwinski, Schiliro's deputy, who spent nearly a decade alongside another influential Senate chairman, Kent Conrad, on the Budget Committee; and Melody Barnes, the domestic policy director, who used to be Ted Kennedy's most trusted aide. Across the alley, in the Old Executive Office Building, the Office of Management and Budget is run by Peter Orszag, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, and Rob Nabors, the former staff director of the House appropriations committee. With Emanuel's encouragement, these aides are constantly in touch with their old bosses and colleagues on the Hill, vouching for the new president and gathering intelligence from the halls of the Capitol.
 ''There's a couple different parts to the theory,'' Emanuel told me, speaking generally about the way the White House tries to engage Congress. ''First, if you go back and study mistakes in the White House, you find they get leadership-driven and they don't reach beyond that.'' By ''leadership-driven,'' Emanuel meant that previous White House teams tended to focus almost entirely on the handful of leaders of each caucus rather than on building relationships with individual members. ''I mean, if I think of one thing that we did that was a mistake under President Clinton,'' he said, ''it was that early on it was just too driven through a couple of committee chairmen.''
 The second tenet of Emanuel's theory is that the White House itself comes with strategic assets you can put to good use, if you allocate them properly. There's the White House theater, where guests can watch movies and sporting events; formal state dinners; smaller gatherings in the first family's residence, which spouses can join; tickets to the Easter-egg roll for kids; tickets to the White House tours that members like to give out to their constituents. These prizes are not handed out randomly or, as in the Bush White House, doled out mostly as rewards to allies who've demonstrated the requisite loyalty. Rather, in Obama's nascent administration, they are considered carefully and accounted for obsessively. Emanuel holds a daily legislative meeting at which aides discuss the status of pending legislation, and often they go over the distribution of White House assets during those sessions. ''We have a tracking system,'' Emanuel told me. ''Who came to watch the football game? Who came to watch the basketball game?''
 Often in my visits to the White House this winter, as Congress debated first the stimulus bill and then the president's budget, I watched as one long bus after another, surrounded by Capitol police on motorcycles, pulled up to the northwest gate of the White House, dropping off a Congressional delegation for a personal briefing with Obama. According to the legislative-affairs office, which keeps track of such things, as of mid-May, some 320 members of Congress and about 80 senators had visited the White House since Obama got the keys.
 Of all the assets the White House has at its disposal, of course, none are more valuable than a three-dimensional president with a 60-plus-percent approval rating. Emanuel and I had been talking for just a few minutes when his office door suddenly burst open and the president strode in. I hadn't seen Obama since interviewing him last September on the day when the stock market crashed (John McCain crashed soon after), so I congratulated him belatedly, and he chatted amiably for a few minutes, appearing entirely untroubled in the midst of the myriad crises facing his administration. Fumbling clumsily to button my suit coat as I stood in his presence, I was reminded of how different it is to talk with someone who has actually assumed the historical weight of the presidency, even if you've spoken with him before. Emanuel knows this phenomenon is as real for senators and congressmen as it is for reporters, which is why he choreographs the same kind of ''spontaneous'' drop-bys when members comes to see him. ''I'll have a lunch here, and he'll come by to say hi to Susan Collins the way he came by to see you,'' Emanuel told me after Obama departed, referring to the senator from Maine. ''It's an efficient use of his time.'' 
 Obama is not the schmoozer that Clinton was, nor does he bestow nicknames like Bush. Rather, he has impressed lawmakers with a direct, businesslike manner and an outward deference to the legislative branch. As Obama mulled whether to nominate Sonia Sotomayor or some other jurist to the Supreme Court last month, he called every member of the Judiciary Committee personally, taking the ''advise'' part of ''advise and consent'' to a level that impressed some longtime senators. ''This is the first time I've ever been called by a president on a Supreme Court nomination, be it a Republican or a Democrat,'' Charles Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, told Peter Baker and Adam Nagourney of The Times after Sotomayor's nomination was announced. A hallmark of Obama's style, in these early months, has been to meet with key senators alone, without the phalanx of aides who almost always attend Oval Office meetings. Three senators with whom I spoke, including Baucus, had been impressed by this tactic; it implies equality between the branches of government and enables Obama to establish personal relationships more quickly than he otherwise might. (''You been hunting lately?'' Obama asked Ben Nelson when the Nebraska senator walked into the Oval Office and found himself, much to his surprise, alone with the president.) Advisers, of course, generally hate for their bosses to meet by themselves; the general rule among aides is that you should never leave politicians in a room alone where they might say or agree to something that can't easily be reversed. When I asked Emanuel if he would prefer that the president have someone around while negotiating with individual lawmakers, he smiled tightly. ''I prefer whatever he prefers,'' the chief of staff said, sounding uncharacteristically diplomatic. 
 ALTHOUGH WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, in their euphoria over winning back total control of the capital, often overlook this fact, Clinton's Congressional landscape during the health care debate in 1993 was, in terms of sheer numbers, strikingly similar to the one Obama has now inherited. At this time in 1993, Clinton's party controlled 56 seats in the Senate and 258 seats in the House. Obama can claim a slightly higher margin than that in the Senate -- he'll have 60 seats, including independents, if the Minnesota courts release Al Franken from his purgatory -- and his party has 256 House seats, or two fewer than Clinton's. In other words, if Obama is to succeed where Clinton did not, it will have to be a triumph of circumstance and political salesmanship rather than a reflection of simple math.
 Clinton's health care experience indicates that Obama faces, in his approach toward Congress, two overarching strategic questions. The first might be called the problem of calibrating distance. The Clintons, fresh from their shared experience with a small-state legislature, at first chose to commandeer the legislative process, simply delivering their bill to Congress for ratification. This is, incidentally, precisely the same tactic that George W. Bush tried when he virtually demanded that a Republican Congress pass his prepackaged Social Security plan in 2005. The lesson, according to members of Obama's team, is that professional legislators consider it their business to legislate. ''One of the mistakes of the past is that when presidents arrive on Capitol Hill with legislation chiseled into stone, it's not well received,'' says David Axelrod, one of Obama's most influential advisers. ''You have to give people a sense of ownership.''
 Obama seems to have decided early on that his model for pursuing legislation would be something closer to Ronald Reagan, a president whose political savvy he has often expressed admiration for. Partly by necessity, because he had to work with a Democratic Congress, Reagan was known for providing broad policy frameworks while delegating the details to lawmakers. In this way, he managed to fundamentally reform the tax code and shore up Social Security during his first year in office -- achievements for which he gladly took credit, even if Congress didn't give him precisely what he wanted. To this end, Obama's chief health care adviser, Nancy-Ann DeParle, has been all over Capitol Hill, consulting with various members and soliciting their advice, but the administration has been careful not to weigh in with too much authority or to make any public pronouncements on the negotiations.
 Obama's situation is somewhat different from Reagan's, however, and more complex. Working with a Congress controlled by your allies, rather than by your adversaries, means having to provide a more significant degree of leadership on the intricacies of policy than Reagan did, while at the same time avoiding the appearance that you are trying to dictate the result. And finding that balance -- the optimal relationship with Congress that is at once neither too removed nor too meddlesome -- has proved to be a significant challenge for Obama's young administration in other legislative forays leading up to the health care debate.
 The most useful illustration here is the debate over an economic stimulus package, which the administration started working on with Congress even before Obama's team moved from its K Street transition offices into the White House. Obama's policy advisers had in mind enough specific plans to fill a 300-page binder -- plans that might total some three-quarters of a trillion dollars in public spending. Fearful of handing Congress one of Axelrod's stone tablets, however, they decided to offer only the vaguest outlines of their plan, laying out broad categories on spreadsheets rather than in binder-length written proposals. They were surprised when aides to David Obey, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, soon complained that the Obama plan was, in fact, too vague. The suspicion in the House, perhaps not entirely unfounded, was that Obama wasn't really being sensitive to Congressional prerogative when he punted on the details; instead, he was trying to dump the whole spending bill -- and the potentially onerous responsibility for throwing around billions in taxpayer money -- on lawmakers, so he wouldn't have to own it. 
 ''There's a cognitive dissonance there,'' a senior administration official complained to me, trying to grasp the contradictions in Congress. ''On one hand they want to feel like they're in charge, but then on the other they also want guidance and political cover.''
 The $819 billion bill that passed the House in February, after much informal consultation with the White House, ran into trouble right away in the Senate, where a powerful centrist bloc takes a dim view of wasteful spending. Obama's new legislative team had helped ''scrub'' the bill, as Hill veterans like to say, for overblown expenditures or pet projects that could be easily caricatured by Republican opponents -- the lurking equivalent of the $640 submarine toilet seat that vexed Congress during the Reagan years. They noted the roughly $200 million for restoring the National Mall but left it in because they actually deemed it a worthy-enough project. (The money would later be ridiculed and withdrawn.) But they completely missed a provision, backed by Pelosi, to finance contraception programs. When Republicans extracted that explosive provision from the bill and detonated it in the media, a frustrated Obama sided with them, irritating Pelosi and other House Democrats in the process. 
 Meanwhile, as even centrist Democrats in the Senate began to raise objections over the size of the bill, public support for the stimulus began to falter. It started to dawn on Obama's team that, as nice as a hands-off approach might sound in theory, a stimulus bill owned by a notoriously unpopular Congress rather than by an unusually popular president might not actually garner enough votes to pass. They had calculated that Congress would be more apt to pass the bill quickly if the White House wasn't meddling in it and taking the credit, but now they ran up against another reality -- that the House wasn't going to pass anything if the public deserted it en masse. 
 ''We realized we had to go out and sell it,'' Messina, the deputy chief of staff, told me later. And so Obama left Washington for big rallies in Indiana and Florida, where he stood behind the bill and urged voters to support it. Not long after, the polling data stabilized, and the Senate passed its own version of the bill. The lesson Obama's team took from this experience, and one that will no doubt inform its approach to health care, is that it's fine for a president to stand back from the process -- but not so far back that Congress thinks he's trying to duck the consequences or that the public comes to see the whole enterprise as just another Congressional spending spree. If Obama is going to sign a transformative health care law this year, it will, at some point soon, have to become his plan, no matter how much autonomy he wants to confer on his allies in Congress. 
 THE SECOND STRATEGIC QUESTION confronting Obama has to do with the relationship between the two chambers of Congress, and it's a question of knowing just how much disagreement between them constitutes a sort of advantageous disharmony -- and at what point that disharmony becomes, instead, potentially calamitous. There is a cliche in the capital, attributed to George Washington, that the House of Representatives is like a hot cup of coffee, and the Senate is the saucer that cools it. The metaphor, like most Washington decor, could use some updating (maybe something about a Starbucks latte and its cardboard sleeve), but it is as apt for the 111th Congress as it was for the first. The Democratic House is a decidedly liberal body, its leadership dominated by members from the coasts and the industrial Midwest, and Obama has very little to worry about when it comes to getting legislation through. Of course there are caucuses set aside for fiscally conservative ''blue dogs'' and moderate ''new Democrats,'' and Emanuel personally lobbied many of those members to vote for the president's budget. Generally speaking, though, the president can rely on the House to pass an agenda that reflects a more activist view of American government, with less concern about fiscal restraint, than any that Congress has produced since at least the 1970s.
 The Senate -- more deliberative or just more timid, depending on your point of view -- is considerably trickier. Here the fate of Obama's top legislative priority probably depends on that small group of self-proclaimed centrist Democrats who will invariably try to roll back some aspects of whatever sprawling legislation comes over from the House. So far, there don't seem to be many policy differences separating Rangel and Waxman in the House from Baucus and Kennedy in the Senate, but at least one potential disagreement threatens to complicate the negotiations. Waxman strongly favors a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers, an idea that is anathema to most Republicans. Kennedy has come out for a public plan, too, but Baucus hasn't committed himself one way or the other, and it's not clear how many other centrist Democrats will go along with the proposal. 
 Clinton faced similar tensions within his party's caucus in 1993; liberals in the House complained that Clinton's plan didn't go far enough toward the single-payer, government-run system they wanted, while a compromise bill in the Senate, spearheaded by the majority leader at the time, George Mitchell, failed to win enough Democratic support. (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York senator who then occupied Baucus's perch atop the Finance Committee, savaged the Clinton plan for the onus it would place on small businesses, which he feared would be tempted to shed full-time workers rather than assume the bulk of their health care costs.) It was generally clear where Clinton stood in this kind of debate; as the leader of the ''new Democrats,'' he sympathized more with the centrists in the Senate than he did with his party's more doctrinaire liberals.
 What makes Obama different is that his own ideological loyalties remain, as they have from the beginning of his presidential campaign, more opaque. House leaders seem confident that Obama stands squarely with them in favor of a new liberal renaissance in America, if only a few calcified senators would get out of the way. But some of Obama's former colleagues in the Senate feel just as certain that he shares their concerns about an ever-expanding federal government. ''He's basically a pragmatist, I think, with a bit of a liberal twist,'' is how Baucus described Obama. Ben Nelson, who is probably the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, told me: ''You probably couldn't tell from the votes, and the other side kept saying he was the most liberal senator, but you'll notice that he approaches most things from the center. On most issues, we're just not that far apart.''
 Here again, the stimulus process is illustrative, specifically at the point when negotiators for the two chambers met to reconcile the differences in their bills. A bipartisan group of senators led by Nelson and Collins had secured enough votes to hold up final approval of the bill, and they wanted it scaled back to under $800 billion -- a symbolic threshold, really, but one that would slash billions in school construction and other programs from the final package. It was at this point that the White House, in the person of Emanuel and Orszag, inserted itself as arbitrator and effectively took charge of the process. For several contentious days and late nights, a frenetic Emanuel personally shuttled between the offices of Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, bargaining and cajoling and bullying his way toward a compromise. At a typically chaotic point late one evening, as one participant described it to me, Emanuel was standing in Reid's office shouting at Pelosi over the speakerphone, then dismissed her to take a call from the president on his cellphone. Ultimately, the marathon process yielded a deal more to the centrist senators' liking than it was to Pelosi's; the bill Obama signed came in at about $787 billion.
 Virtually the same routine was repeated in internecine struggles over Obama's $3.6 trillion budget and the federal government's $410 billion omnibus spending bill. In each case, once the two chambers passed their versions of the bills, the White House stepped in to referee a compromise. With each succeeding negotiation, tempers seemed closer to the surface. During the back and forth over the budget resolution, Emanuel grew so furious at one of Pelosi's policy aides, Wendell Primus, that he refused to stand in the same room with him, letting loose a string of expletives long enough to reach the Washington Monument. ''You can't keep doing this,'' Reid told Emanuel one night, and by this he meant the round-the-clock brawling that seemed to accompany every conference report. 
 EMANUEL MAY HAVE been the one doing the shouting, but the House and Senate negotiators have reserved most of their rancor for one another. As a result, friction between House and Senate Democrats now seems to have reached a point where they might want to build their own virtual fence down the middle of the rotunda. And yet Obama has, thus far, gotten more or less what he wants out of the deal. Far from finding his path obstructed by centrist senators, in fact, Obama seems to be running a sophisticated game in which those senators are actually doing him a significant political favor. Thanks to them, Obama doesn't have to pick any fights over spending or ideology with the liberal leaders in the House or with outside interest groups on the left, even when he thinks they've given in to excesses that will serve as fodder for his conservative critics. Rather, he simply encourages the House to go wild, and then he relies on centrists in the Senate to do the unpleasant work of scaling back the legislation, which yields a more politically palatable bill and one that's probably more in keeping with his own essentially pragmatic philosophy anyway. And while House and Senate leaders may end up wanting to throttle one another, Obama gets to play the reluctant arbiter between the two, rather than actually having to challenge his base. 
 It's an impressive balancing act, but it may not be sustainable as the emotional debate over health care unfolds. Some House Democrats I talked to have already begun to wonder audibly why they're the ones who always have to surrender in Emanuel's middle-of-the-night negotiating sessions. They accuse Reid and his lieutenants of repeatedly placating Republicans to avoid a filibuster, rather than taking a stand on principle now and then. Why not force centrist Democrats to vote against their party and let Republicans filibuster the agenda on national television? What would the voters think then? Centrists in the Senate, meanwhile, have grown furious at some of Pelosi's backroom maneuvering -- most notably, the final negotiations over the stimulus bill, when she brazenly reinserted $50 million in arts funding that had been struck as part of an earlier compromise. (The move sent Emanuel into a state too, but by then it was too late to do anything without unraveling the entire bill.)
 The danger here for Obama is that, at exactly the moment when he most needs House and Senate Democrats to pull together and accept a compromise, the growing friction between leaders in his own party could erupt to the point where it's no longer so easy to bridge the differences over something as intricate as a new national health care system. ''It's genius when it works, but it's disaster when it doesn't,'' Tom Daschle told me recently, speaking generally of Obama's skill in playing the two chambers against each other. ''On some of the president's biggest issues, he's going to have to make sure he hasn't so ruptured the relationships on the Hill that he can't get them together when he needs to.'' On health care, Daschle said, ''I've told the president there will come a time when I think it's going to be very important for him to take control of the process or at least to insert himself and be a major player.''
 ''HILLARYCARE,'' AS OPPONENTS referred to Clinton's 1993 health care plan, has been ridiculed ever since as the apotheosis of liberal, out-of-control bureaucracy-building. However flawed the politics of the effort may have been, however, the plan itself, weighing in at the size of an urban telephone book, was less a testament to Orwellian ambition than it was to the sheer mind-bending complexity of the issue itself. Few policy aims in American life could involve so many moving parts as designing a new health care structure, which has to involve fundamental changes in how medical providers are paid, how consumers are insured, how businesses pay their employees and even how Americans safeguard their own health. To use a home-improvement metaphor, if welfare reform was like remodeling your kitchen, and if adding the prescription-drug benefit to Medicare was like building a sizable addition onto the back porch, then overhauling the health care system is more like ripping out all the walls of your house and completely reconfiguring the plumbing, the air ducts and the wiring all at once. Each aspect of the job is painfully complex and essential to the whole, and if one piece is poorly conceived, then none of the others may actually work as planned. 
 The good news for Obama and Congressional Democrats -- and, you would hope, for Americans as a whole -- is that the climate for such an undertaking is considerably improved from what it was in 1993, partly because the circumstances surrounding health care in America are so obviously worse. According to the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, health care spending in the United States nearly doubled in the decade after Clinton's plan died, reaching about 16 percent of the gross domestic product -- the highest percentage on record. Some businesses that might have opposed reform in 1993 are now desperate to address their growing health care costs, and insurance companies and health care providers seem increasingly open to compromise if it means they can avoid more drastic forms of government regulation. 
 Working on parallel tracks, committees in the House and Senate seem to be reaching a broad consensus around what a new system would look like. The separate bills they come up with will probably mandate that every American have health care coverage, establish a government-regulated marketplace for private insurance and require employers with a certain payroll (perhaps of more than $500,000) to offer health insurance to their workers or pay a tax. 
 What House and Senate leaders don't agree on, necessarily, is how to get the legislation done. Waxman and Rangel are more than happy to shove a bill down the throats of their Republican colleagues, if need be. That's why the House forced Senate leaders to accept a provision in the budget that allows health care to pass by ''reconciliation'' -- an arcane budgeting maneuver that would enable Senate Democrats to force through a bill with a simple majority, rather than with the 60 votes needed to forestall a filibuster. But in the Senate, Baucus remains determined to send to the floor a bill with bipartisan support; passing health care reform by reconciliation, he says, would make the new law unsustainable in the long term. This is why Baucus hasn't yet committed to the idea of a public plan to compete with private insurers. It's not that he particularly dislikes the policy or that he can't find enough centrist Democrats who might vote for it. It's more that Baucus fears the provision will drive away Republicans, making it far less likely that Democrats can pass a bill without resorting to reconciliation. During our conversation in his office, Baucus told me his main goal is to keep Senate Republicans at the negotiating table for as long as he can. ''Everything is on the table,'' Baucus told me more than once, which is the same theme he's been hammering home to his Republican colleagues. 
 When I asked Baucus what he needed from the White House in order to help pass a viable health care plan, his answer, more or less, was nothing -- as in, the most helpful thing they can do is butt out and let the Senate worry about the details. No doubt this has something to do with the traditional turf battles among the branches; Baucus has been a legislator now for 35 years, and he doesn't need another Democratic president telling him how to do his job. But there is a more practical reason for his wariness, as well. So far, he has managed to keep the parties talking largely because neither Democrats nor Republicans have any clear idea of which specific provisions Obama will accept -- and that's exactly the way Baucus wants to keep it. If the president were to shed his reticence and set out his terms for a bill, Republicans would focus on their differences with Obama and would most likely end up abandoning the process, either because they wouldn't believe a compromise was possible or because they would want to seize on any excuse to derail his agenda. ''Right now, the president sort of keeps them guessing as to what he might be supportive of,'' says John Breaux, the former Democratic senator who is now a corporate lobbyist. ''I think that's why you still see Republicans actually trying to work on it.''
 As it happens, this arrangement -- whereby Baucus negotiates the bill and Obama keeps his distance -- is politically advantageous to the president too. During his campaign last year, Obama took at least two positions on health care that he may soon find hard to maintain. First, in the primaries, he differentiated his plan from Hillary Clinton's by refusing to back an ''individual mandate'' -- that is, the provision that would require every American to obtain insurance. Then, during the fall campaign, Obama criticized John McCain for proposing to tax employer-based health benefits. If he were to offer a detailed proposal of his own right now, Obama might have to walk out into the Rose Garden and reverse himself on one or both positions. But with Baucus urging him to leave the details to his committee, Obama can instead wait for a plan to emerge from the Senate and then, if need be, reluctantly change his mind in the interest of compromise. Thus he preserves the option of backing away from his previous anti-big-government stances, and he gets to appear statesmanlike and pragmatic in the process. 
 THE NETTLESOME THING about leaving the details of the health care plan to Congress, though, is that this Congress, like most every other Congress, doesn't appear inclined to pay for much of anything. And it is this part of the health care debate -- where to find the money -- that seems most likely to derail the process. Most discussions of America's health care woes begin with talk of the uninsured -- some 46 million of them at last count. How much a new health care system will cost depends primarily on how close to universal coverage you really want to get. On the high end of the scale, insuring every American might well cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next decade at a time when deficits are gobbling up a greater share of the nation's income than at any time since World War II.
 The White House has focused mostly on new efficiencies in health care, insisting that lowering the costs of medical care could easily save $2 trillion in public money over the next decade. A coalition of providers, drug makers and insurance companies -- no doubt looking for the best possible deal in health care legislation -- helpfully vowed in a White House photo-op last month to institute changes that would lead to such savings, but their promise was maddeningly vague and utterly unenforceable (and in any event, the industry groups almost immediately distanced themselves from it). Short of realizing these projected savings, there are only so many ways to pay for health care -- and, not surprisingly, congressmen and senators aren't exactly lining up to embrace them. One way, as McCain proposed, is to rescind the tax exemption for some workers who receive health care benefits from their employers; Baucus is open to at least capping the exemption, but labor unions are adamantly opposed, and Rangel has publicly renounced it (though he and other House Democrats appear to be re-evaluating that stance). Another way is to slap new taxes on some of the products that cause health problems in the first place, like soft drinks, but industry lobbyists are already spending satchels of cash to head that off. Congress can always choose to slash Medicare benefits or the payments that doctors receive, but that idea generates about as much enthusiasm as you might find for putting George W. Bush's face on the $5 bill.
 In a larger sense, this may be the nagging flaw in Obama's notion of the Congressional presidency, this strategy that leaves the lawmaking to Congress, even as it enables him to claim credit for one legislative success after another. Professional legislators can be great at devising complex language and finding creative ways to get a deal. What they are not especially good at -- at least not in the current era -- is making the difficult decisions that governing responsibly often requires. Left to their own devices, legislators rarely seem to ask the voters to sacrifice anything by way of taxes or entitlements or services, if only because voters don't find the entreaties of legislators all that persuasive. And so, absent his own engagement, Obama's vow to reverse our ''collective failure to make hard choices,'' as he put it in his inaugural address, may well be pushed aside for another day. 
 At critical times in his young political life, and several times already in his presidency, Obama has fallen back on his gift for explanation and oratory to try to change the dynamic of a national debate. He did it on race relations, delivering a historic and bracingly candid speech in Philadelphia during the Democratic primaries. On two consecutive days last month, he undertook to lay out his thinking on national security and civil liberties in twin speeches at the National Archives and the Naval Academy. In a recent speech at Georgetown University, he tried to tell the larger story of the nation's economic crisis and his response to it, riffing on the Biblical image of a house built on shifting sand. It seems likely that Obama, who has to this point focused on a sophisticated legislative strategy for achieving health care reform, will at some point soon have to take his case to the public instead -- this time asking Americans not just to support an ambitious expansion of government but to accept the sacrifices necessary to do it. Only a president will make that case, and only a president can.

PERSON: Ernest R. May 

HEADLINE: Ernest May, 80, International Relations Expert, Dies

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Ernest R. May, a leading historian of international relations who published major works on the United States' entry into World War I and the fall of France in 1940 and who explored how history influences decision-making, died last Monday in Boston. He was 80 and lived in Cambridge, Mass., where he had continued to teach full time at Harvard.
 The cause was complications of cancer surgery, his wife, Susan Wood, said. 
 Professor May had particular historical expertise as an analyst of intelligence-gathering failures -- for several years he helped teach a course on the subject at Harvard for intelligence operatives -- and he brought that knowledge to bear as a senior adviser to the Sept. 11 Commission, the bipartisan panel appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 to examine the terrorist attacks of 2001. 
 Professor May was the author or co-author of 14 books. His first, ''The World War and American Isolation 1914-17'' (Harvard, 1959), based primarily on new material from German archives seized by the Allies at the end of World War II, won the George Louis Beer Prize, awarded annually by the American Historical Association for the best work on European international history. 
 His 2000 book, ''Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France'' (Hill and Wang), chronicled the Nazis' stunning victory, after six weeks of blitzkrieg in May 1940, while stripping it of its veneer of inevitability. 
 France's surrender had commonly been interpreted as ''the last gasps by a nation already doomed,'' Professor May wrote. In fact, he contended, ''there was nothing inevitable or foreordained about the German victory.'' Rather, he found a variety of causes, including poor military decisions, a misperception of Hitler by French and English politicians, and plain bad luck.
 ''I think Ernest May is the most important scholar of American foreign relations to emerge during the second half of the 20th century,'' Philip D. Zelikow, a fellow historian and the executive director of the Sept. 11 Commission, said on Wednesday. 
 Professors May and Zelikow together edited ''The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), an annotated history of secret recordings made as President John F. Kennedy agonized in October 1962 over whether to order a pre-emptive air strike to destroy Soviet missiles in Cuba, risking nuclear war, or to impose a naval blockade. The book was the main source for the movie ''Thirteen Days.''
 Other books by Professor May examined the Monroe Doctrine, the United States' rise to power at the end of the 19th century and the decisions leading to the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
 Professor May was a member of the Harvard faculty for 55 years. He was the dean of Harvard College from 1969 to 1971 and chairman of the history department from 1976 to 1979. He was also a faculty member of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 As an adviser to the Sept. 11 Commission, Professor May helped prepare its 604-page report on the terrorist attacks. The report, released in 2004, laid bare the failures of American intelligence agencies and warned that without a historic restructuring of them and a new emphasis on diplomacy, the United States would leave itself open to an even more catastrophic attack.
 At Harvard, with the eminent historian Richard E. Neustadt, Professor May developed a course on the systematic use of historical comparisons to determine current public policy choices. They also wrote a book on the subject, ''Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers'' (Free Press, 1986), whose methodology has since been used by ''a cadre of historians'' and students, said Graham Allison, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School.
 ''No other historian of recent memory has so successfully bridged the chasm between history and public policy,'' Professor Allison said.
 Ernest Richard May was born in Fort Worth on Nov. 19, 1928, the only child of Ernest and Rachel Garza May. He received his bachelor's degree in 1948 and his doctorate in 1951, both from the University of California, Los Angeles. After serving in the Navy during the Korean War, he joined the Harvard faculty in 1954.
 His first wife, Norma Caughey, died in 2000. Besides his wife, Ms. Wood, he is survived by his children from his first marriage, a son, John, and two daughters, S. Rachel May and Donna May; and three grandchildren. 
 Professor May found that there were major turning points in American foreign policy and believed that the United States had recently arrived at another with the rise of China. In his last published essay, he rejected the view that China's rise must lead to war with the United States. 
 ''Yes, China's rise feels threatening to the sole superpower,'' Professor Allison said, ''but Dr. May believed that China's choice to concentrate on economic growth through integration in global markets offers a path for it to emerge peacefully.''

HEADLINE: Paterson's Economic Development Chief Announces Resignation

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
One of New York State's top economic development officials announced her resignation on Saturday, after less than a year in office, in yet another setback for the troubled agency she had been appointed to lead.
 The official, Marisa Lago, president and chief executive of the Empire State Development Corporation, said she would step down at the end of the month, according to a press release from Gov. David A. Paterson's office. Just last August, Mr. Paterson appointed Ms. Lago to run the agency, which had long been buffeted by turf wars, management problems and a lack of direction.
 Ms. Lago, a former Citibank executive who had worked for economic development agencies in New York City and Boston, provided little detail about why she was leaving, saying only that she had received other job offers and decided to take a position outside of state government. 
 But those with knowledge of the agency and its inner workings said Ms. Lago's departure came as a result of conflicts with the corporation's chairman, Robert G. Wilmers, who they said often inserted himself into the agency's day-to-day operations, like hiring. 
 One of Ms. Lago's first tasks was to work with Mr. Wilmers on naming a downstate president of the development corporation to guide projects in New York City and its suburbs. That post is still vacant. 
 Conflicts developed over who was actually in charge of the agency and who was authorized to make decisions about projects like Brooklyn Bridge Park and the future of Governors Island, and Ms. Lago began to feel undercut and unhappy in her position, said people with knowledge of the agency's workings who spoke on condition they not be identified because they did not want to harm their relationship with the state.
 A spokesman for Mr. Wilmers, who is chairman and chief executive of MT Bank Corporation of Buffalo, said he could not be reached for comment on Ms. Lago's departure or his role in the direction of the agency, which is involved in the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the planned expansion of Pennsylvania Station and the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn.
 In addition to its own instability, the agency has been slammed by the turmoil on Wall Street, the broader economic decline and its effects on the state's financial outlook. Unemployment in New York has risen to 7.7 percent as the financial crisis has spread, but that is still lower than the national average of 9.4 percent.
 Ms. Lago becomes the latest official to decamp from the Paterson administration. Last month, the state's budget director and insurance superintendent also stepped down.
 She will be replaced by Dennis M. Mullen, a Rochester development official who oversees the development corporation's upstate activities. Mr. Mullen said he would focus on bringing jobs and business to the state.
 ''We will continue the forward movement of assisting New York's businesses and encouraging economic investment and prosperity in the state,'' he said in a statement. ''My focus now will be on ensuring a smooth transition as our team moves forward.'' 
 With Ms. Lago's leaving, New York City loses a voice in the agency's leadership, as its two highest-ranking officials hail from Rochester and Buffalo, raising the question of whether the city's influence in the agency would fade. 
 ''This is a top priority, and we will be moving quickly to ensure that we achieve the correct balance and representation throughout the state,'' said Warner Johnston, a spokesman for the development corporation.

HEADLINE: The Economy Is Still at the Brink

BYLINE: By SANDY B. LEWIS and WILLIAM D. COHAN. 
Sandy B. Lewis, an organic farmer, founded S. B. Lewis & Co., a brokerage house. William D. Cohan, a contributing editor at Fortune and former Wall Street banker, is the author of ''House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street.''

 BODY:
WHETHER at a fund-raising dinner for wealthy supporters in Beverly Hills, or at an Air Force base in Nevada, or at Charlie Rose's table in New York City, President Obama is conducting an all-out campaign to try to make us feel a whole lot better about the economy as quickly as possible. ''It's safe to say we have stepped back from the brink, that there is some calm that didn't exist before,'' he told donors at the Beverly Hilton Hotel late last month. 
 Mr. Obama thinks that the way to revive the economy is to restore confidence in it. If the mood is right, the capital will flow. But this belief is dangerously misguided. We are sympathetic to the extraordinary challenge the president faces, but if we've learned anything at all two years into the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes, it is that a capital-markets system this dependent on public confidence is a shockingly inadequate foundation upon which to rest our economy. 
 We have both spent large chunks of our lives working on Wall Street, absorbing its ethic and mores. We're concerned that nothing has really been fixed. We're doubly concerned that people appear to feel the worst of the storm is over -- and in this, they are aided and abetted by a hugely popular and charismatic president and by the fact that the Dow has increased by 35 percent or so since Mr. Obama started to lay out his economic plans in March. But wishing for improvement and managing by the Dow's swings are a fool's game. (Disclosure: One of us, Mr. Lewis, was convicted on federal charges of stock manipulation in 1989, pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001 and had his lifetime trading ban overturned by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006; documents relating to the case can be found at sblewis.net.)
 many of the fixes that the Obama administration has proposed will do little to address them and may make them worse. At another fund-raising event, for Senator Harry Reid, President Obama said: ''We didn't ask for the challenges that we face. But we are determined to answer the call to meet those challenges, to cast aside the old arguments and overcome the stubborn divisions and move forward as one people and one nation .... It will take time but I promise you, I promise you, I'll always tell you the truth about the challenges we face.''
 Keeping that statement in mind -- as well as an abiding faith in the importance of properly functioning capital markets -- we have come up with a set of questions meant to challenge a popular president, with vast majorities in Congress, to find the flaws in the system, to figure out what's being done to fix them and to get to the truth about the difficulties we face as we set out to restore the proper functioning of our markets and our standing in the world. 
 Six months ago, nobody believed that our banking system was well designed, functioning smoothly or properly regulated -- so why then are we so desperately anxious to restore that model as the status quo? Nearly every new program emanating these days from the Treasury Department -- the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Public Private Investment Program, the ''stress tests'' of major banks -- appears to have been designed to either paper over or to prop up a system that has clearly failed. 
 Instead of hauling out the new drywall to cover up the existing studs, let's seriously consider ripping down the entire structure, dynamiting the foundation and building a new system that rewards taking prudent risks, allocates capital where it is needed, allows all investors to get accurate and timely financial information and increases value to shareholders and creditors. 
 As a start, the best-compensated executives at the top of these big banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms should be treated like general partners of yore. If a firm takes prudent risks that pay off, this top layer of management should be well compensated. But if the risks these people take are imprudent and the losses grave, they should expect to lose their jobs. Instead of getting guaranteed salaries or huge bonuses, they should have the bulk of their net worth completely at risk for a long stretch of time -- 10 years come to mind -- for the decisions they make while in charge. This would go a long way toward re-aligning the interests of these firms with those of their shareholders and clients and the American people, who have been saddled with their risks and mistakes.
 Why is so much effort being put into propping up those at the top of the economic pyramid -- the money-center banks, the insurance companies, the hedge funds and so forth -- when during a period of deflation like the one we are in, any recovery will come only by restoring the confidence of the people down at the bottom of the pyramid? 
 Confidence will return only when jobs can be found and mortgage payments are made. Even if Mr. Obama's claim is true that his $780 billion stimulus package ''saved or created'' some 150,000 jobs, we seem a long way away from the point where those struggling to get by will feel like spending again. What happens when people buy a car once every 10 years instead of once every two or three, especially now that we taxpayers own such a big percentage of the American auto industry?
 a frugal nation. The president should be talking about kicking our addictions to easy credit, to quick fixes and to a culture of more is better (and Congress's new credit-card legislation, while perhaps eliminating some of the worst aspects of that industry, certainly didn't send the right message about personal finance). 
 Gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s, cigarette boats, no-income mortgages and private jets should be relegated to the junk heaps of history, or better yet, put in a museum dedicated to never forgetting the greed and avarice that led us so far astray.
 Why is the morphine drip still in the veins of the financial system? These trillions in profligate federal spending are intended to make us feel better again even though feeling pain, and dealing with it responsibly, would be healthier in the long run. It is time to stop rescuing the banks that got us into this mess. If that means more bank failures on a grander scale or the dismemberment of Citigroup, so be it. Depositors will be protected -- up to $250,000 per account -- but shareholders, creditors and, sadly, many employees will, for the long-term health of the system, need to feel the market's wrath.
 Is there to be any limit on bailouts? We have now thrown money at the big banks, any number of regional ones, insurance companies, General Motors, Chrysler and state and local governments. Will we soon be bailing out Dartmouth, which just lost its AAA bond rating? Is there no room left for what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter termed ''creative destruction''? And what is the plan to get the American people out of all these equity stakes we now own and don't want? 
 Furthermore, for government leaders to decide who shall live and who shall die in an economic sense opens them up to legitimate charges of crony capitalism and favoritism. We will benefit in the long run from a return to market discipline.
 Why has Mr. Obama surrounded himself largely with economic advisers who are theoreticians and academics -- distinguished though they may be -- but not those who have sat on a trading desk, made a market, managed a portfolio or set a spread?
 not some artificial construct of a market propped up by a pliant Financial Accounting Standards Board or government-sponsored programs that appear to be virtually giving money away to hedge funds and private-equity firms so that they will buy assets they would not ordinarily buy. We're not talking about putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, just putting people who know how markets function in the real world into the important seats in Washington.
 Why isn't the Obama administration working night and day to give the public a vastly increased amount of detailed information about what happens in financial markets? Ever since traders started disappearing from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the last decade of the 20th century, there has been less and less transparency about the price and volume of trades. The New York Stock Exchange really exists in name only, as computers execute a very large percentage of all trades, far away from any exchange. 
 As a result, there is little flow of information, and small investors are paying the price. The beneficiaries, no surprise, are the remains of the old Wall Street broker-dealers -- now bank-holding companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- that can see in advance what their clients are interested in buying, and might trade the same stocks for their own accounts. Incredibly, despite the events of last fall, nearly every one of Wall Street's proprietary trading desks can still take huge risks and then, if they get into trouble, head to the Federal Reserve for short-term rescue financing. 
 Here's something that should change in terms of transparency. The most recent price that any stock traded for should be published online in real time for all to see. And the public should have access to a new type of electronic ticker that provides market information in language that all can understand, not just the insiders.
 As for those impossibly complex securities that caused so much of the trouble -- among them derivatives, credit-default swaps and asset-backed securities -- the S.E.C. should have the power to make public all the documentation surrounding these weapons of mass financial destruction, including all data about the current costs of buying and selling them and the cash flow underlying them. We also need widely accessible, real-time reporting of all trades in the bond market. We bet Mike Bloomberg's company could help design such a system for our benefit.
 it took more than a year for the Federal Reserve to disclose that it had agreed to pay BlackRock -- the huge money manager that is 45 percent owned by Bank of America -- and others $71 million in a no-bid contract to manage the $30 billion of toxic assets that JPMorgan did not want when it bought Bear Stearns in March 2008. And that is only one of the five contracts BlackRock has with the government as a result of this crisis -- the nature of the other contracts remains secret. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has made much of financialstability.gov, the Treasury's new Web site dedicated to ''transparency, oversight and accountability.'' But look it over and try to find, for example, just one record of a bona fide credit-default swap, or the names of the hedge-fund and private-equity investors who have participated in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility bonanza. It was only a lawsuit filed by a watchdog group that convinced the Treasury to divulge details of former Secretary Henry Paulson's October meeting with the chief executives of the 10 largest Wall Street firms to force them to take money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. A lawsuit filed last November by Bloomberg News to force the Federal Reserve to reveal the details on more than $2 trillion in loans that went to banks including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs is still pending in federal court. 
 And what has become of the S.E.C.'s year-old investigation into who made short-dated, out-of-the-money bets in March 2008 hoping Bear Stearns would fail -- bets that were suddenly worth millions of dollars when the company did collapse later that month? 
 Or why last November this trio decided to absorb potential losses on $301 billion of Citigroup's shaky assets, when conventional wisdom among insiders held that they were worth only $150 billion at best? 
 Also, before Dick Fuld, Lehman Brothers' chief executive, appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last October, it demanded from company executives boxes of documents about what happened at Lehman and why. Where are those documents? 
 Why hasn't President Obama insisted on public hearings over what happened during this financial crisis? 
 to the American people in his own words exactly how and why he allowed his firm to cause the crisis. Both Mr. Fuld and Alan Schwartz, the chief executive of Bear Stearns at the end, in their Congressional testimony blamed the proverbial once-in-a-century financial tsunami. Do they or any of their peers really think this is true? 
 There may be a way to find out. There is much talk nowadays coming from top bankers -- Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorganChase, John Mack of Morgan Stanley and even Ken Lewis of Bank of America -- about seeing how quickly they can repay to the Treasury the TARP money Mr. Paulson forced on them. One precondition of their being allowed to repay the funds should be a requirement that each gives a public deposition and explains, under oath, what truly happened and why. 
 Such a public hearing would be meant only to offer a truthful assessment of the errors in judgment made at each firm and to promote understanding, so that we -- somehow -- can avoid repeating the same mistakes again. It would not be about indictments. These men should be offered immunity from prosecution for their honest testimony, but only with a clear understanding that the failure to tell the truth at any point would result in serious legal consequences. The hearing could be complemented by a truth-seeking commission established to hear the accounts of several people who have departed the scene, including, among others, Mr. Paulson, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Wall Street chiefs like Mr. Fuld, Hank Greenberg of A.I.G., Sanford Weill of Citigroup, Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns and Stan O'Neal of Merrill Lynch. While far removed from their positions of authority, these men have tales to tell about how this crisis got started and why. 
 Why are we not looking to change our current civil and criminal racketeering statutes, which are playing a perverse role in investigations of the crisis? Statutes meant to give prosecutors extraordinary powers of seizure before an indictment is handed up, or to impose treble damages, are appropriately used to break up rings of criminal behavior like the Mafia or drug cartels. 
 Such outright seizure of capital or assets through use of the racketeering statutes can do much harm by giving prosecutors an unnecessarily powerful role in our capital markets. There must be a way to keep what is good about the statutes and to make sure they are not used for ill in trying to get to the bottom of the financial meltdown.
 We are in one of those ''generational revolutions'' that Jefferson said were as important as anything else to the proper functioning of our democracy. We can no longer pretend that our collective behavior as a nation for the past 25 years has been worthy of us as a people. Many of us hoped that Barack Obama's election would redress the dire decline in our collective ethic. We are 139 days into his presidency, and while there is still plenty of hope that Mr. Obama will fulfill his mandate, his record on searching out the causes of the financial crisis has not been reassuring. He must do what is necessary to restore the American people's -- and the world's -- faith in American capitalism and in our nation. Answering our questions may help us get back on track. But time is wasting.

HEADLINE: Yes I Can

BYLINE: ERROL MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Increasingly, through his speeches, Obama has found his (first-person, singular) voice. 

 BODY:
Last week I was driving home listening to President Obama's speech on the General Motors bankruptcy, and I heard the full emergence of a note that had been sounded only occasionally in the two-plus years since the announcement of his candidacy. It was the note of imperial possession, the accents and cadences of a man supremely aware of his authority and more than comfortable with its exercise. 
I was reminded of the last scene of "Godfather I," when Michael Corleone, who begins the film as a young idealistic patriot, ends it by striking the pose of a Roman emperor as subordinates kiss his ring. Obama is still idealistic and a patriot, but he is now also an emperor and his speech shows it. "Language," Ben Jonson says in Discoveries, "shows a man; speak that I may see thee." 
What Obama's language showed when he began his campaign in February 2007 was a commitment to a project larger than his personal ambitions: "It's humbling to see a crowd like this, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me." He acknowledges that "there is a certain presumptuousness" to his candidacy and in the body of the speech he begins sentence after sentence (the rhetorical figure is "anaphora") with this inclusive construction "Let us be the generation": "Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy"; "Let us be the generation that ends poverty." Later, he insists that "this campaign can't only be about me; it must be about us." 
When he does use the first personal pronoun, its self assertion is immediately muted. "I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity. I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all." Both syntactically and substantively, the "I" is subordinated to the projects to which it is dedicated.
When he wins the Iowa caucus on Jan. 3, 2008, the rhetoric alters as he imagines himself (perhaps for the first time) performing in the office he aspires to. "Let us" is replaced by "I'll": "I'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers." "I'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable." "I'll be a president who ends this war in Iraq." 
A little more than two months later (March 18), in the great speech on race, the "I" is once again firmly in check. He announces a resolve - "I have asserted a firm conviction" - but it is a conviction that acknowledges and embraces others: "...that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds." After saying that, the "we" takes over: "We can come together." "We want to talk about the crumbling schools. "We want to reject cynicism." "We want to talk about the shuttered mills." "We want to talk about how to bring them home from war." And he concludes with a call to collaborative arms: This "is where we start. It is where our union grows stronger."
If there is an occasion on which self-promotion would be understandable, even reasonable, it is on the night one accepts the nomination for president. But Obama signals from the beginning that he's not going to go there: "With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination." That's the last "I" we see for a long time. It's "we democrats who have a very different measure"; "We measure progress by how many people can find a job"; "We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires"; "Ours is a promise that says..." 
When he comes to rehearse the changes he hopes to bring about, the use of "I" is unavoidable - "I will tap our natural gas reserves," "I'll help our auto-companies retool," "I will never hesitate to defend this nation" - but these promises are obligatory and generic and so escape the taint of boasting. As the speech climaxes America, not Obama, is the exhorted agent of change: "America, this is one of those moments." "America, we cannot turn back."
This restraint and modesty also mark the victory speech delivered in Grant Park, Chicago, on Nov. 4. The key note is struck early: "This is your victory." When he promises, the promise is made not to the people, but on their behalf: "I promise you, we as a people will get there." It is a short sentence, but by the end of it the self assertion of the "I" has been entirely dissipated. Repeatedly, agency and power are transferred to the audience. Change "cannot happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice." And, of course, the repeated refrain, "Yes we can."
Everything alters in the inaugural address (Jan. 20, 2009). The promises are now made to an America that is asked only to stand by while they are fulfilled. "Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. "But know America" - or, in other words, "hear me" - "...they will be met." And later, when he says, "We will build the roads and bridges... We will restore science to its rightful place... We will harness the sun and winds," the "we" is now the royal we: just you watch, "All this we will do."
By the time of the address to the Congress on Feb. 24, the royal we has flowered into the naked "I": "As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress." "I called for action." "I pushed for quick action." "I have told each of my cabinet." "I've appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general." "I refuse to let that happen." "I will not spend a single penny." "I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves." "I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term." That last is particularly telling: it says, there's going to be a second term, I'm already moving fast, and if you don't want to be left in the dust, you'd better fall in line.
There's no mistaking what's going on in the speech delivered last week. No preliminary niceties; just a rehearsal of Obama's actions and expectations. Eight "I"'s right off the bat: "Just over two months ago I spoke with you... and I laid out what needed to be done." "From the beginning I made it clear that I would not put any more tax dollars on the line." "I refused to let those companies become permanent wards of the state." "I refused to kick the can down the road. But I also recognized the importance of a viable auto industry." "I decided then..." (He is really the decider.) 
Accompanying the "I"'s are a bevy of "my"'s, which reach out to embrace the universe. The third time he says "my auto task force," it sounds as if he were referring to a lap dog. Ditto the mention of Karen Mills, "my Small Business Administration" chief. When he thanks Canada and Germany for doing their part, it is as if those sovereign nations were doing him a personal favor to which he was entitled. When he invokes "my administration" you might think he was talking about some prized possession. (My daughter...my ducats.) It is always "I couldn't in good conscience," "I became convinced," "I wanted to ensure," "I instructed," "I recognized," "I want" (three times), "I'm calling on Congress." At least he doesn't say "my Congress," although that is certainly implied.
No doubt this pattern of pronouns reflects a reality. By all the evidence we have, the guy's completely in charge, making decisions, giving instructions, deploying resources, assigning tasks - a combination point guard, quarterback and clean-up hitter. And if he gets results, as he seems to be doing, that's O.K. 
But it may not be O.K., as a matter of rhetoric and politics, to advertise it. An occasional passive construction to soften the claim of agency would be a good idea (even though the grammar books warn against it). It's one thing to be calling the tune; it's another to proclaim it in every sentence. Someone is going to say, "Am I the only one who thinks that Obama likes the sound of his own voice?" (Sea Urchin, here). 
Of course we all like the sound of our own voices. The trick , which Obama will probably learn down the road, is to avoid making it too obvious.

HEADLINE: China and U.S. in Cold War-like Negotiations for a Greenhouse Gas Truce

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For months the United States and China, by far the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, have been warily circling each other in hopes of breaking a long impasse on global warming policy. 
 They are, as President Obama's chief climate negotiator puts it, ''the two gorillas in the room,'' and if they do not reach some sort of truce, there is no chance of forging a meaningful international treaty in Copenhagen later this year to restrict emissions.
 As a senior American team arrived in Beijing on Sunday for climate talks, the standoff was taking on the trappings of cold-war arms control negotiations, with gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions replacing megatons of nuclear might as a looming risk for people across the globe. 
 Both sides are demanding mutually assured reductions of emissions that are, in the current jargon, ''measurable, verifiable and reportable.'' In the background hover threats of great retaliation in the form of tariffs or other trade barriers if one nation does not agree to ceilings on emissions. 
 ''This is going to be one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations in the history of the world,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, co-sponsor of an energy bill being debated in the House, who just returned from a week in China.
 Many take the simple fact that the two nations, jointly responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, are even talking seriously to each other about the issue as a propitious sign after years of mutual distrust.
 But there is cause for profound skepticism as well. The Chinese continue to resist mandatory ceilings on their emissions and are making financial and environmental demands on the United States that are political roadblocks. 
 The United States, despite optimistic words from the White House and Congress, has yet to enact any binding targets on greenhouse gas emissions. The energy bill now before Congress proposes emissions targets that are far short of what China and other nations say they expect of the United States.
 Compounding the difficulty is the fact that both countries are struggling economically and the Chinese and American publics appear far more interested in jobs than in tackling environmental problems, a task that would necessarily be costly.
 The main product of the discussions with Beijing so far has therefore been agreement to hold more discussions.
 Yet the clock is ticking. Only six months remain before the opening of United Nations-sponsored talks in Copenhagen to produce a climate change treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. 
 Without the full participation of the United States and China, most negotiators believe that any agreement is doomed to fail. Congress and two American presidents refused to accept the Kyoto accord, which expires in 2012, because it imposed no pollution limits on China or other developing countries. The American refusal to ratify the treaty and the lack of participation by China and other developing nations have left the pact all but toothless.
 ''China may not be the alpha and omega of the international negotiations, but it is close,'' said Todd D. Stern, the top American climate negotiator at the three-day talks in Beijing. ''Certainly no deal will be possible if we don't find a way forward with China.''
 The Obama administration has pledged to be a leader in the talks that culminate in December in Copenhagen, although it is far from clear that Congress has the will to approve emissions targets and furnish enough aid to developing countries to satisfy the Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Brazilians and other major participants. Mr. Stern described the demands from China and other countries as ''not serious,'' and said the United States was ''jumping as high as the political system will tolerate.''
 As a measure of how far apart the two nations are, China says the United States should reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. The bill before Congress, which could be further weakened, now calls for less than a 4 percent reduction over that period.
 The Chinese have begun to consider a series of unilateral actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, stepping up production of renewable electricity and increasing the efficiency of their manufacturing, buildings and vehicles. But Beijing insists it will not sacrifice China's economy to meet the demands of outsiders, particularly those in the developed world that are responsible for the vast majority of human-caused carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere.
 ''What they are saying right now is, 'We can do a lot of things, but we don't want to commit to any targets,' '' said Jin Jiaman, executive director of the Global Environmental Institute, based in Beijing, which has helped pave the way for the current talks. ''They want to preserve their right to develop.''
 One of China's senior climate negotiators, Su Wei, has said that although China will not accept absolute limits on its emissions, officials have begun to consider putting in place domestic targets to significantly reduce the carbon intensity of the country's heaviest-emitting industries. Under the current official five-year plan, China is trying to reduce the amount of energy emitted per unit of gross domestic product by approximately 20 percent by 2010, a goal it may or may not meet. Some experts question the accuracy of China's official reports, and say it will be impossible to monitor the nation's progress without a better system for tracking greenhouse gas pollution.
 In a tough speech in Washington last week, Mr. Stern said that such modest reductions would do little to affect atmospheric concentrations of climate-altering gases. He also noted that China emitted four times as much carbon dioxide as the United States and six times as much as the European Union or Japan for every unit of gross domestic product.
 ''China and other developing countries do not need to take the same actions that developed countries are taking,'' Mr. Stern said, ''but they do need to take significant national actions that they commit to -- internationally -- that they quantify, and that are ambitious enough to be broadly consistent with the levels of science.''
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, who led a delegation of lawmakers to China at the end of May, said in an interview that she was hopeful about the dialogue between the two countries, but fearful that they would fall into the old trap of hiding behind each other.
 ''They told us if we're not going to do something, they're not going to do anything,'' she said. ''Some of the people we talked to there said we should do more. I think we should do more, too. But we all have to go down this path together.''

U.S. Tech Chief Talks Priorities
 The first question for Aneesh Chopra, below, the chief technology officer of the United States, not surprisingly, was ''What does the nation's C.T.O. do?'' Mr. Chopra said that his top goal was economic development using government policy to create jobs and business around technology. ''My job is to serve as the innovation platform champion in addressing private market opportunities in support of public priorities,'' he said. 
 When Mr. Chopra talks of platforms, he is echoing the Silicon Valley concept that companies -- Facebook, for example -- become most valuable when they offer services that other companies can work with. Mr. Chopra wants the government to use the latest tools and technologies, just as the Obama campaign was quick to use social networking and other trendy techniques.
 He cited an example in which video feeds from public transit systems had been incorporated into an iPhone app for commuters.
 ''An entrepreneur has taken government information, mashed it up with information and application value to deliver something of value to the general public,'' he said. ''The work we do in government, if made more accessible to the public, could spawn new industries.'' 
 Mr. Chopra's top idea is to change how the government looks at the money it spends on research and development. Rather than thinking purely about basic research, he said, the government should focus on investing in technologies that can be developed. A first step is to find ways to measure how much research is being commercialized.
 ''There is an implicit assumption that R.& D. investment will lead to job growth and economic success,'' he said. ''The measurement question will lead us to think about, how do we begin to assess the outcomes.''
 Mr. Chopra said there is a wide range in the effectiveness of universities in commercializing the work of their laboratories. He wants to take the practices used by the most commercial of universities and spread them to other research centers.

HEADLINE: Divorce in a Recession: Families With Extra Stress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I agree with Andrew J. Cherlin that this is a time when families must pull together (''Married With Bankruptcy,'' Op-Ed, May 29). 
 Clearly the recession makes the situation more difficult when couples want to get divorced and cannot afford to maintain two households. Parents of the divorced couple are often the light in a storm during a marital crisis. They provide love and support by putting out the welcome mat, opening their purse and spending more time babysitting.
 Today seniors are feeling the economic pinch. Many have lost jobs, and their retirement accounts have been reduced 40 or 50 percent. They are having a harder time finding employment. Wanting to do more with less can be a strain for seniors who want to help heal their families. But for many parents, helping their adult children and grandchildren stabilize their lives is not a choice. It is a necessity.

HEADLINE: Erratic Afghan Security Units Pose Challenge to U.S. Goals

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Afghan foot patrol descended a mountain and slipped through a canyon. Then things went wrong. One Afghan soldier insulted another. And there, exposed on dangerous ground, a scuffle erupted.
 The soldiers turned on each other with shoves, punches and kicks. One swung an ammunition can in a slow-motion haymaker. The patrol had already been hapless: a display of errant marksmanship, dud ammunition and lackluster technique. 
 ''For months I've been telling everyone how proud I am of you,'' seethed an American captain, yanking the Afghans apart. ''Today you embarrassed me.'' 
 The Obama administration has put a priority on expanding the size and abilities of Afghanistan's security forces, first to help fight an expanding war and eventually to allow the Pentagon to draw down its troops. The task was inherited from the Bush administration, and the United States has helped to field roughly 170,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers in units created from scratch. In plans now under review, these numbers could double. 
 Many Afghan units, especially in the army, have shown signs of competence at basic missions and skills. But this joint patrol late last year in Nuristan Province, and dozens of others from 2007 to this spring, along with interviews with trainers and the senior officers who supervise them, showed problems on the Afghan and American sides alike.
 American training units have been short-staffed and overstretched. Essential equipment has at times proved to be in poor condition or mismatched. Accountability for weapons and munitions has been broadly criticized.
 Among the Afghans, mass illiteracy, equipment loss, crime and corruption, which is prevalent in the police, have blunted readiness. Immaturity and ill discipline bedevil many units. Illicit drug use persists, and some American officers worry about loyalty and intelligence leaks.
 The Americans started rebuilding Afghanistan even before a similar effort in Iraq, where the Pentagon badly underestimated the difficulties -- and initially overstated its success. Iraqi forces now operate broadly in their country. 
 American trainers in Afghanistan attend courses taught by veterans of the Iraq experience, and the lessons learned from Iraq are distilled into plans for Afghanistan, the training command says.
 Those plans are ambitious. In Afghanistan, the Pentagon wants to make Afghanistan's military able to direct artillery and airstrikes, and to develop an air corps with attack aircraft. And Western trainers are emphasizing supervisory skills required for a professional force: personnel and payroll management, logistics and maintenance.
 Simultaneously, the Afghan government plans to require police officers to undergo drug testing and senior police officials to disclose personal assets. The United States is also entering Afghan soldiers and officers into a biometrics database, to verify identities and scrub payrolls of members who do not exist.
 ''We're making a lot of progress,'' said Maj. Gen. Richard P. Formica, who leads the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, the unit coordinating the training. 
 The United States has spent more than $15 billion fielding Afghan forces, by the command's tally. Officers throughout the ranks say Afghan security self-sufficiency is years off, even in the Afghan National Army, or A.N.A.
 ''I think if you come back in a couple of years, you should see advances,'' said Brig. Gen. Anthony R. Ierardi, the command's deputy commander. ''I wouldn't tell you that the A.N.A. is going to be ready across the board in a couple of years. I don't think that's a true statement.''
 Rebooting the Police
 American officers training the Afghan forces describe two different views. By one view, the security forces, especially the army, represent one of the most promising institutions the Afghan government has yet offered: a large group of men who rejected the Taliban and staked their lives on the faith that the government would prevail.
 Seasoned by fighting and shaped by Western trainers, a corps of Afghan officers and noncommissioned officers has begun to emerge. The units they lead have allowed the Afghan government to provide security in Kabul and extend the government's presence to areas once beyond reach.
 The forces' casualty figures point to the loyalty and resolve of many Afghans in uniform. Nearly 1,700 police officers and 600 Afghan soldiers were killed on duty from January 2007 through April. Western forces suffered 586 deaths in that time.
 By another view, the same forces, though most pointedly the police, are minimally skilled, unreliable, prone to crime and little match for an insurgency that has grown since 2006. Problems are widespread enough that many Western soldiers openly regard the Afghan police with suspicion. 
 In interviews over three years, American soldiers have complained that police officers and supervisors sell promotions and equipment, skim subordinates' wages, shake down villagers, take bribes or participate in other schemes, including the opium trade. 
 Journalists for The New York Times have seen officers accused of selling fuel for their American-provided trucks, and of burglarizing a home they had been ordered to search. Officers at one southern post in 2007 were cultivating poppy plants inside their post's walls.
 Maj. Vincent G. Heintz, who supervised a police mentoring team last year, said that the district where he worked, Chahar Darreh in Kunduz Province, cycled through several Afghan commanders during the year, including one who was ''wholly incompetent'' but apparently politically connected.
 The next commander, Major Heintz said, was ''a professional criminal who brokered a detente with the local Taliban'' and who showed up with 10 or 15 of his own bodyguards, fired the police and put his gang into police uniforms. They then set up roadblocks and shook down motorists, he said.
 Afghan units have also not eradicated the presence of ''chai'' boys, who often are uncompensated teenagers who live closely with commanders. Afghans and American officers say some are apprentices, others valets, and some suffer sexual abuse, which a few commanders regard as a perquisite of power.
 The training command said that if abuse of these teenagers was reported, it would be acted on. ''It is totally unacceptable,'' General Ierardi said, but added that he had not seen reports of it from the field.
 American officers acknowledge that corruption has hampered efforts to make a viable police force, which now has about 82,000 members. They also say corruption should not define all the officers serving, and that burnishing the force's skills and reputation is a focus.
 Last fall, President Hamid Karzai appointed a new interior minister, Muhammad Hanif Atmar, a former education minister. Mr. Atmar, educated in Britain and largely viewed as uncorrupt, has pushed for changes that could foster credibility, including requiring senior officials to disclose private assets and testing the A.N.P, or Afghan National Police, for drugs.
 Officers testing positive can be fired, said Brig. Gen. Anne Macdonald, who supervises police development. 
 The United States is also retraining uniformed police units in a process called Focused District Development. Under this program, police units in districts are mentored intensely through phases, including being replaced by an interim unit for several weeks while they undergo refresher training and have their equipment inventoried, examined and, as necessary, replaced. 
 The program implicitly acknowledges problems. General Ierardi said it was essential because it provided a chance to ''refresh the screen.'' To date, 65 of the country's 365 districts and 12 companies have enrolled in the program. The Pentagon plans to expand the training.
 The program has shown merits, officers said. Major Heintz, for instance, said that in his duties under the program, following up on the police in Chahar Darreh, he was able to get the crooked commander relieved less than a month after he showed up. The new commander ''has done a good job with the force,'' he said.
 Improving the Army
 The situation is different in the army, for which the American effort is trying to build momentum, General Formica said. The Afghan Army has nearly 90,000 soldiers and is slated to grow to 134,000.
 In units on the ground, some previous initiatives have shown results. 
 On patrols observed by The Times this year, many Afghan soldiers wore their equipment, remained alert, walked with weapons ready and moved by bounds across dangerous ground. These are not difficult tasks, but on patrols in past years Afghans often neglected them.
 Sgt. Maj. Arthur L. Coleman Jr., the senior American enlisted soldier in the training command, said improved fundamentals reflected a significant development: the army has grown experienced sergeants, who enhance performance.
 ''We're really starting to see discipline,'' he said. ''You're starting to see accountability.'' He added: ''That's going to pay big dividends down the road as we mature.''
 Other indicators also suggest that military discipline, while behind Western standards, is improving. The army's percentage of soldiers absent without leave has dropped to under 10 percent for more than a year, the command said. Not long ago, it exceeded 15 percent.
 This year, an inaugural class of 84 lieutenants graduated from the National Military Academy of Afghanistan, a four-year school modeled after West Point. Next year the academy is scheduled to produce about 300 more lieutenants. The Pentagon hopes to build a more able military around these and other new officers and sergeants.
 Enlisted soldiers with specialties are also appearing in the field. Of a squad of Afghan soldiers recently assigned in the Korangal Valley, for example, one had been trained as a trauma medic. The training command said 3,500 such medics had completed an eight-week course.
 But poor officers remain. During an insurgent mortar attack late last year, an Afghan lieutenant did not require his soldiers to take cover or put on their protective gear. Instead, he proposed holding a formation in the open to ask which soldiers were collaborating with the Taliban. 
 Two American Marines present directed the lieutenant to order his soldiers to safety. Minutes later, an incoming round exploded yards from where the soldiers were to stand.
 In a recent attack on Korangal Outpost, an Afghan captain ignored his duties. Incoming 30-millimeter rounds landed among his men. He spent the fight in a latrine, while Marines checked for injured Afghans and directed the return fire.
 Problems Beyond the Ranks
 The Pentagon's plans have been undercut at times by the American military's own management, or by larger trends in Afghanistan's educational and economic development.
 Over the years, as American units have cycled through, they have often been forced to repeat the work of previous units.
 Several years ago, for example, the Americans distributed 8,000 donated Czech assault rifles to Afghan units. The weapons fired the same ammunition as existing Afghan rifles, but were otherwise incompatible. The weapons had to be recalled last year, even as the military was trying to rush other weapons to the field. 
 Other equipment has disappeared in vast quantities, trainers in the field said, including sleeping bags and warm clothing required to operate much of the year, especially at night. The shortages were so acute in 2007 that units in the 82nd Airborne Division canceled overnight missions because Afghan soldiers could not participate. 
 A year later, the same shortages limited the work of Afghans in Nuristan Province.
 One American officer said Afghan soldiers had been issued the gear, often two or three times. They had either sold it or given it to their families, he said.
 This year, the American military said it issued storage containers to the army, and cold-weather gear had been locked up. It will be reissued in the fall, the military said.
 Events on the patrol that became an intraplatoon brawl also underlined concerns about ammunition. Much of the Afghan government's ammunition is old surplus donated by nations trimming arsenals or sold to the Pentagon by low-bidding contractors. For years, little was independently tested for reliability.
 In Nuristan, the captain tried firing five rounds of 40-millimeter high-explosive ammunition at a cave. All five failed: three skipped off the cave's face without exploding; two did not leave the barrel. The captain, Markus Trouerbach, was disgusted. ''Dud!'' he said. ''Nice dud. Great.''
 Later, he said that of 20 rounds fired during an exercise, 9 worked. An Afghan sergeant said he fired seven rounds at insurgents. Two did not explode. 
 The training command held its own test. Of 720 40-millimeter rounds fired, 22 did not work properly, according to two American officers; the command said it heard no other complaints. 
 The failure rate, 3 percent, was much less alarming than the troops' experiences in Nuristan. But it exceeded by many times the acceptable failure rate of similar ammunition issued to American troops.
 In interviews, three arms dealers and a manufacturer said the Pentagon paid less for the 40-millimeter ammunition than the ammunition typically costs to produce. They said Arcus, the Bulgarian firm manufacturer, provided substandard ammunition. (The vendors asked not to be identified out of fear of being blocked by the Pentagon from future bids.)
 Arcus said the rounds had been made to exacting standards and passed company tests. Neither the Pentagon nor Arcus would discuss the ammunition deal in detail, including how the prices were arrived at, saying the information was proprietary.

HEADLINE: In One City, Two Soirees Ages Apart

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com http://twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
At the Century Club in New York last Wednesday, more than a hundred people, many of them journalists, gathered for a farewell to Peter Kaplan, the outgoing editor of The New York Observer, a newspaper that served as a wiring diagram in a city where printed information and power have historically held hands.
 Mr. Kaplan told the crowd that when he was a young boy riding into the city with his family from New Jersey and New York reared into view, his father suggested they were about to enter a magical kingdom.
 ''Gentlemen, there lies the Emerald City,'' he would say. 
 Again and again, young talented writers and editors have come here to test themselves in the furnace of ego and ambition and created a sprawling media apparatus with a global reach. But as the Web has splintered audiences and enabled access to talent everywhere, the media's primacy here seems open to question. 
 For more than 100 years, the Century Club on 43rd Street just off Fifth Avenue has served as a Midtown hideaway for big-deal writers and artists. With its gracious doormen, free-flowing bars and ambient bonhomie, the private club is a portrait of a bygone time in publishing, when journalists pounded out copy all day and then gorged on canapes someone else paid for at night.
 But the bounce of those times has all but disappeared as the invitations littering the desks of journalists have been replaced by pink slips. Most of the people in the room to toast Mr. Kaplan still have jobs, but now worry that the jig is up.
 It was difficult to miss the aura of elegy that hung over the goodbye party for Mr. Kaplan -- the party also celebrated the opening of an art show of the work of Arthur Carter, who sold most of his interest in The New York Observer to Jared Kushner. The night seemed in part to be an obit for a media kingdom brought low by calamitous changes in the economy and publishing in particular. Mr. Kaplan himself made oblique reference, suggesting the night was a kind of ''punctuation on an era.''
 Ever the diehard print guy, Mr. Kaplan, a storied figure who will now work as a creative director at Conde Nast Traveler magazine, could not resist one more call to arms.
 ''If The Observer is anything it's a battle for New York,'' he said. ''It's the fight for wit, for integrity, for real reporting, for real writing, and for not killing stories even when they irritate the publisher. A fight for the New York idea.''
 Shortly after his entreaty, Mr. Kaplan said that the bar at the club was closing and invited everyone to Elaine's, a name that single-handedly evokes a fading demimonde.
 Many journalists who have spent their lives scrambling up the greasy pole of traditional media have drank away many hours at Elaine's ruing the passing of the good old days. But in another part of New York on Wednesday night, the allure of this city and this industry was just as shiny and magical as it has ever been.
 Downtown, the doorman at the Hotel on Rivington was far less accommodating. With a baleful stare and forearms like Hercules, he adjudicated those before him without mercy. There was a list, and if you were not on it, you joined the clump of the forlorn who were trying to text their way upstairs for a party celebrating Internet Week hosted by CollegeHumor and Guest of a Guest, a Manhattan social calendar site.
 But once the door had been breached, there was no elegy on the roof deck of the hotel, only thumping techno, a hot tub and hordes of young people staring at the lights of Midtown in the distance (when they weren't riveted by the data stream on their smartphones). A nautical theme added to the antic vibe, guests who adopted sailor dress while drinking like pirates. The recession, along with the decline of their print-bound brethren, seemed like it was happening in some other city.
 Beyond the reach of mainstream authority and tradition, an entire cadre of the next generation of media titans was taking their ease. No, they probably won't publish ''Frank Sinatra Has a Cold'' -- CollegeHumor relishes videos clips of a good Tasering, while Guest of a Guest has a bit about the party introducing the Aston Martin DBS Volante -- but the authors of the city's next media epoch, this time rendered in pixels, are already nascent. (The Observer co-sponsored an opening night party for Internet Week with YouTube, so it clearly has a foot in both worlds.)
 E. B. White suggested that the primary requirement for success in New York is a willingness to be lucky. Rachelle Hruska, the founder of Guest of a Guest, took Mr. White -- and the city -- at its word.
 She came here from Lincoln, Neb., four years ago. She said she did not know anyone, she did not have a job, and ''my parents never sent me a dime.''
 ''I am living 150 percent of New York,'' she said. Her site has come out of nowhere to serve as a social blueprint for growing numbers of young people in the city. 
 Ricky Van Veen, founder of CollegeHumor, said that while he and Ms. Hruska don't need the infrastructure of a Manhattan media company, being in New York is important.
 ''It is still the same story,'' he said. ''Kids come here, end up living in some outer borough and doing whatever it takes to make it happen here. New York is for hustlers. Always has been.''
 CollegeHumor moved from its San Diego base in 2004 and was acquired by Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. ''I would have never sold my company if we hadn't moved here,'' Mr. Van Veen said. ''New York is the place where you find the people and ideas that make things happen in a bigger way than they would anywhere else.''
 I wandered the rest of the party and noticed people staring at me. Had I become the dad in the basement at the teenage party? No, as it turned out, it was the analog act of taking notes with a pen on a notebook that was freaking people out. I may as well have been prancing around with an abacus. 
 I like that notebook and some of the things that pop out of it. While guests milled at Mr. Kaplan's going-away party, they were handed a faux copy of The Observer about his tenure. It was a treasure, with page after page of amazing bylines cracking wise and mordant about Mr. Kaplan's idiosyncrasies. A keeper.
 Ms. Hruska wondered what the point of all that might be. 
 ''I would never get my company involved in a print product,'' she said over a Prince song. ''That is just a very expensive way of soothing your own ego and feeling important. I can't see any value in that.''

PERSON: Peter L. Bernstein 

HEADLINE: Peter L. Bernstein, 90, an Explainer Of Stocks' Risks and Rewards, Is Dead

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Peter L. Bernstein, an economic historian and a widely read popularizer of the efficient market theory, which changed trading behavior on Wall Street, died Friday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
 The cause was pneumonia contracted after he broke a hip, his family said. 
 Mr. Bernstein published most of his best-known books in the last 20 years of his life, including the best-selling ''Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk'' (John Wiley & Son) in 1996 and ''Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street'' (Free Press) in 1991. 
 In these books and in earlier work, he embraced and explained an investment strategy that came to be known as efficient market theory. Rather than just picking stocks because they seemed to be good bets, investors increasingly diversified their portfolios, using sophisticated mathematical equations, developed in academia, with the goal of measuring and managing risk.
 ''We went from naive and haphazard stock-picking to looking at the whole portfolio in the context of how capital markets operate,'' said William F. Sharpe, an economist at Stanford who received a Nobel Prize for his work developing the new strategy. ''Peter Bernstein's contribution was as an interpreter and communicator, and he certainly did popularize academic finance.'' 
 The hope was that with diversification, the stock market would be less likely to collapse, although Mr. Bernstein worried that a collapse could occur. He was an advocate of more market regulation to prevent one. But he also argued that the wealth and entrepreneurial energy generated by a rising stock market were worth the risk.
 He made that point in 2005 in a semimonthly newsletter that he published for many years. Five days before his death, he republished the article in the same newsletter, Economics and Portfolio Strategy, adding a prologue in which he said, ''With hindsight, most readers today would find our position in 2005 to have been a prescription for tragedy.''
 Then, quoting the Alfred Lord Tennyson line, '' 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,'' he concluded: ''There was wisdom in Tennyson's words. Who can say he was wrong beyond debate? That would be a sorry world indeed.'' 
 Mr. Bernstein was the founder, in 1973, of Peter L. Bernstein Inc., which published his newsletter and also had as clients wealthy families and foundations, helping them manage their wealth. A year later, he founded the Journal of Portfolio Management, a scholarly journal that brought traders and academics into communication with each other as they developed efficient market theory. 
 They did so, in part, because more and more Americans held stock, mainly through mutual and pension funds. Picking stocks with a broker no longer met most people's needs. 
 ''As institutions and professional managers became the principal players, innovation was inevitable,'' Mr. Bernstein wrote in ''Capital Ideas,'' his best-known book on efficient market theory. ''But innovation must be preceded by theory.''
 In the last 25 years of Mr. Bernstein's life, nearly all his work focused on markets. But he had cast a broader net earlier, particularly in his writings with the late Robert L. Heilbroner, a historian and the author of a classic economics book, ''The Worldly Philosophers.'' 
 Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Heilbroner, both New Yorkers, were lifelong friends. They met in first grade at the Ethical Culture School and moved on together to Horace Mann Academy and then Harvard, graduating in 1940 with degrees in economics. For 25 years, until Mr. Heilbroner's death in 2005, they made a point of having lunch together on the day before Christmas.
 Like many others of their era, they were Keynesians, and they argued that public spending was necessary for a healthy market economy. They also argued that government's role in the economy should not have been curtailed as President Ronald Reagan sought to do in the 1980s, when he argued that the deficit was too large to maintain public spending. It was not too large, they said, as a percentage of the nation's economic output. 
 Peter Lewyn Bernstein was born in Manhattan on Jan. 22, 1919, a son of Allen and Irma Lewyn Bernstein. After graduating from Harvard magna cum laude, and after a year as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York -- working for a Harvard professor who had gone to the Fed -- he spent World War II as an officer in the Office of Strategic Services, the C.I.A.'s predecessor, in London. 
 While in Europe, he married the former Shirley Dowd, an American working as a secretary for the military. She died in 1971. The couple was childless. In 1972, Mr. Bernstein married a widow, Barbara L. Soskin, who took his last name. She survives, as does a stepgrandson, Peter Brodsky of Dallas, from Mrs. Bernstein's first marriage, and three stepgreat-grandchildren. 
 After the war, Mr. Bernstein taught at Williams College and then became a loan officer in a commercial bank in New York, learning about risk, he later explained, as he assessed the creditworthiness of the borrowers. 
 Family pressure led him to Wall Street. After his father died in 1951, the family insisted that he take control of the father's business, Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a wealth management firm. It was sold in 1967 and Mr. Bernstein stayed on as manager until 1973, having agreed to do so. 
 But he had already immersed himself in writing and scholarship, and from then on he focused on markets and risk, with occasional digressions. One of those was ''Wedding of the Waters: The Erie Canal and the Making of a Great Nation'' (W.W. Norton, 2005), in which he returned to public works spending.
 ''Without the gritty determination of a small group of men convinced of the prospect of a great nation,'' he wrote, ''the Erie Canal would not have been built and the Western territories would in all likelihood have broken away.''

HEADLINE: Buyers of Old Jewelry in a New Appeal to Women

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
IN a television commercial that began showing recently, a woman in her 30s places jewelry into a small box.
 ''Steve -- crazy jealous, but very generous,'' she says, examining a bracelet. Then, putting an engagement ring into the box, she says, ''Marty -- he just couldn't get off the fence.''
 The ad -- running on cable networks including Bravo, Oxygen and Style -- is for OutOfYourLife.com, a company that mails a ''Break-Up Box'' that customers return with jewelry, for which they receive a check. (If the check is insufficient, they may return it for their jewelry.) The company's tagline: ''It's time to break up with his jewelry, too.'' 
 OutOfYourLife.com is a new venture by Lippincott, based in Pennsylvania, which buys scrap gold and other jewelry, mostly to melt down. Lippincott has an established business, GoldKit.com, but the new brand aims specifically at women, and takes a more subtle approach than many mail-in jewelry buyers, whose ads have proliferated as the value of gold and the need for cash have increased.
 The industry leader is Cash4Gold.com. Its best known commercial made its debut during the Super Bowl and stars Ed McMahon, who nearly lost his home to foreclosure last year, and rapper MC Hammer, who filed for bankruptcy in 1996. In the commercial, Mr. McMahon contemplates selling his gold hip replacement, and Mr. Hammer his gold records.
 ''We didn't want to go down to this slimy area where Ed McMahon and MC Hammer are looking to pay their mortgage,'' said Malcolm Karlin, president of Karlin+Pimsler, the New York agency that produced the OutOfYourLife.com spots. ''We wanted to get out of that desperation area and raise that bar.''
 Mr. Karlin's agency was hired by Lippincott last year to produce ads for GoldKit.com, and he was at a meeting in the company's offices outside Philadelphia when he saw an employee opening a parcel containing a 5-carat diamond ring. ''She said, 'This is a person we hear from quite a bit,' '' Mr. Karlin said. '' 'She has a bunch of boyfriends, and they're very generous with the jewelry.' '' From that, and a conversation with his co-worker who reported she owned three engagement rings, Mr. Karlin came up with the concept for the commercial. Lippincott liked the idea so much that, instead of using it as a GoldKit ad, it decided to build an entirely new brand.
 ''There's a whole core of women who have jewelry they would love to sell but who would not respond to a distressed, depressed approach,'' said David Taffet, majority owner of Lippincott. 
 The fact that there is a market for selling jewelry from exes is not news to Megahn Perry, who co-founded exboyfriendjewelry.com in 2008.
 Ms. Perry, who is divorced, started the site after bringing her dust-gathering wedding and engagement rings to a pawnbroker, whom she found unpleasant, and a consignment store, where the commission seemed excessive.
 On the advertising-supported site, which monthly draws 23,000 unique visitors who buy about 2,000 items, the tales are of relationships more tarnished than some of the goods.
 ''My ex-husband bought this for me on our honeymoon,'' begins a recent listing for a ring. ''Too bad he wasn't as generous with his communication as he was with the jewelry.''
 Jeff Aronson, chief executive of Florida-based Cash4Gold, said that since its Super Bowl ad, the volume of transactions the company had been completing had tripled. 
 ''It really cast the company into American culture,'' said Mr. Aronson, who added that it had been mentioned repeatedly in Jay Leno monologues. (''The economy is so bad,'' Mr. Leno joked in January, that ''Steven Spielberg sold his Oscars to that Cash4Gold company.'')
 But the ad also drew what Advertising Age called a ''backlash'' of negative news coverage, including a Los Angeles Times article that reported Cash4Gold had a D rating from the Better Business Bureau. A report on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' also mentioned the D rating, while the syndicated series ''Inside Edition'' reported that Cash4Gold issued them a check for only $209 after investigative reporters sent in jewelry valued at nearly $1,000.
 ''I'm never going to be able to pay the highest price all the time,'' Mr. Aronson said, adding that his company takes a bigger cut because his service is more convenient than going to pawn shops. (A Cash4Gold spot last year, however, promised, ''Get TOP DOLLAR for your gold!'' The Better Business Bureau says on its Web site that it asked Cash4Gold to substantiate the claim in October, but that the company declined to do so, though it ceased making the claim.)
 ''BBB complaints account for less than 1/29th of 1 percent of all the 900,000 transactions we have done,'' Mr. Aronson said in a written statement, adding that he expected ''our ranking to improve when judged according to national BBB standards like other large, nationally advertising companies.''
 But Alison Southwick, a Council of Better Business Bureaus spokeswoman, said there are not unique ''national BBB standards,'' and that local BBB chapters rank businesses, including multinational companies in their districts, on the same criteria.
 ''It's just not possible for Cash4Gold to get a better grade by going around or above their local BBB,'' Ms. Southwick wrote in an e-mail message. ''If Cash4Gold isn't pleased with their grade, the ball is in their court and it comes down to treating customers with fairness and honesty.'' 
 Mr. Taffet of OutOfYourLife.com, whose company has an A-plus rating from the BBB, said Cash4Gold's negative news coverage ''has brought a lot of negative attention to the industry and created a level of disdain that I do not think is fair to the entire industry.'' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: OutOfYourLife.com invites women to sell reminders of old loves, while Cash4Gold uses celebrities like Ed McMahon to attract the financially stressed.

BYLINE: By HAROLD O. LEVY. 
Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor from 2000 to 2002, has been a trustee of several colleges.

 BODY:
AMERICAN education was once the best in the world. But today, our private and public universities are losing their competitive edge to foreign institutions, they are losing the advertising wars to for-profit colleges and they are losing control over their own admissions because of an ill-conceived ranking system. With the recession causing big state budget cuts, the situation in higher education has turned critical. Here are a few radical ideas to improve matters:
 Raise the age of compulsory education. Twenty-six states require children to attend school until age 16, the rest until 17 or 18, but we should ensure that all children stay in school until age 19. Simply completing high school no longer provides students with an education sufficient for them to compete in the 21st-century economy. So every child should receive a year of post-secondary education. 
 The benefits of an extra year of schooling are beyond question: high school graduates can earn more than dropouts, have better health, more stable lives and a longer life expectancy. College graduates do even better. Just as we are moving toward a longer school day (where is it written that learning should end at 3 p.m.?) and a longer school year (does anyone really believe pupils need a three-month summer vacation?), so we should move to a longer school career. 
 President Obama recently embraced the possibility of extending public education for a year after high school: ''I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training.'' He suggested that this compulsory post-secondary education could be in a ''community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship.'' (I helped start an accredited online school of education, and firmly believe that the coursework could also be delivered to students online.)
 If the federal government ultimately pays for the extra year, it would be a turning point at least as important as the passage of the 1862 Morrill Act that gave rise to the state universities or the 1944 G.I. Bill that made college affordable to our returning service personnel after World War II. Every college trustee should be insisting that we make the president's dream a reality.
 And for those who graduate from high school early: they would receive, each year until they turn 19, a scholarship equal to their state's per pupil spending. In New York, that could be nearly $15,000 per year. This proposal -- which already has been tried in a few states -- has the neat side effect of encouraging quick learners to graduate early and free up seats in our overcrowded high schools.
 Use high-pressure sales tactics to curb truancy. Casual truancy is epidemic; in many cities, including New York, roughly 30 percent of public school students are absent a total of a month each year. Not surprisingly, truants become dropouts. 
 But truant officers can borrow a page from salesmen, who have developed high-pressure tactics so effective they can overwhelm the consumer's will. Making repeated home visits and early morning phone calls, securing written commitments and eliciting oral commitments in front of witnesses might be egregious tactics when used by, say, a credit card company. But these could be valuable ways to compel parents to ensure that their children go to school every day. 
 Advertise creatively and aggressively to encourage college enrollment. The University of Phoenix, a private, for-profit institution, spent $278 million on advertising, most of it online, in 2007. It was one of the principal sponsors of Super Bowl XLII, which was held at University of Phoenix Stadium (not bad for an institution that doesn't even have a football team). The University of Phoenix's enrollment has clearly benefited from its advertising budget: with more than 350,000 students, its enrollment is surpassed by only a few state universities.
 The University of Phoenix and other for profits have also established a crucial niche recruiting and serving older students. Traditional colleges need to do far better, using advertising to attract paying older students and to recruit the more than 70 percent of the population who lack a post-secondary degree. They have a built-in advantage, since attending a for-profit college instead of a more prestigious, less expensive public college makes no more sense than buying bottled water when the tap water tastes just as good.
 Unseal college accreditation reports so that the Department of Education can take over the business of ranking colleges and universities. Accreditation reports -- rigorous evaluations, prepared by representatives of peer institutions -- include everything students need to know when making decisions about schools, yet the specifics of most reports remain secret. 
 Instead, students and their parents rely on U.S. News & World Report rankings that are skewed by colleges, which contort their marketing efforts to maximize the number of applicants whom they already know they will never accept, just to improve their selectivity rankings. Meanwhile, private counselors charge thousands of dollars claiming to know the ''secret'' of admissions. Aspiring entrants submit far too many applications in the hope of beating the odds. Everyone loses. Opening the accreditation reports to the public would provide a better way.
 The biggest improvement we can make in higher education is to produce more qualified applicants. Half of the freshmen at community colleges and a third of freshmen at four-year colleges matriculate with academic skills in at least one subject too weak to allow them to do college work. Unsurprisingly, the average college graduation rates even at four-year institutions are less than 60 percent.
 The story at the graduate level is entirely predictable: in 2007, more than a third of all research doctorates were awarded to foreigners, and the proportion is far higher in the hard sciences. The problem goes well beyond the fact that both our public schools and undergraduate institutions need to do a better job preparing their students: too many parents are failing to insure that their children are educated. 
 President Obama has again led the way: ''As fathers and parents, we've got to spend more time with them, and help them with their homework, and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in a while.'' Better teachers, smaller classes and more modern schools are all part of the solution. But improving parenting skills and providing struggling parents with assistance are part of the solution too. 
 At a time when it seems we have ever fewer globally competitive industries, American higher education is a brand worth preserving.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Funds Spent to Keep Sun Belt Cool

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. 

 BODY:
The federal government is spending $5 billion in stimulus money to weatherize homes across the country. That is almost as much as it has spent on weatherization since the program was created in the 1970s to cut heating bills and conserve oil for low-income people. 
 But this year, there is a twist. 
 An unusually large share of the money will be spent not on keeping cold air out but on keeping cold air in. As a result of a political compromise with Sun Belt lawmakers last decade, the enormous expansion of the weatherization program will invoke a rarely used formula that will devote 31 percent of the money, nearly double the old share of 16 percent, to help states in hot climates, like Florida, save on air-conditioning. 
 Many environmentalists say cutting electricity use for cooling is just as worthwhile as reducing the use of oil or gas for heating. But there are substantial questions about whether it is the most efficient way to save energy. 
 The nation spends twice as much on heating as on cooling, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, and it consumes more energy heating homes than cooling them. When it comes to emissions of heat-trapping gases, the department found, home heating is responsible for emitting twice as much carbon dioxide as home cooling. And a 2005 survey of home energy use by the agency found that the average household in New England spent $1,188 a year on heating, while the average household in Florida spent $597 on air-conditioning. 
 Repeated questions have been raised about the effectiveness of weatherization in hot-climate states. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which evaluates the program for the Energy Department, released a study last year questioning the program's results in Texas, which will get $327 million in weatherization money from the stimulus law. The laboratory found that insulating homes did not save a significant amount of money on cooling, a finding it said was consistent with previous studies. 
 Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group that favors weatherization, said the spending formula reflected the tension in balancing national goals with regional interests. ''If you were doing it on a national basis,'' Mr. Nadel said, ''you'd do the most cost-effective jobs first, which would mean doing a lot in places like the Dakotas and Minnesota.'' 
 Gil Sperling, the program manager at the Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Affairs at the Energy Department, said more studies of weatherization in hot climates were needed to take into account recent technological advances. 
 ''While the Department of Energy is gathering the latest data about the savings in cold-weather and warm-weather states,'' Mr. Sperling said, ''this program has a proven track record of saving money, saving energy and creating jobs across the country.'' 
 The stimulus money is being divided according to a formula devised in 1995 after members of Congress from the hot states complained that they received too little money through the weatherization program. The formula has been used just twice, since it is invoked only in the rare years that the program financing exceeds a threshold, now set at $233 million. 
 J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana who pushed for the new formula at the time, said more people were dying from extreme heat than extreme cold. ''This was not so much an energy saving proposal; it was more of an equity proposal, one that gave attention to public health,'' Mr. Johnston said, adding that it would save energy.
 Now, the formula favoring hot states is being used just as the government makes its biggest investment in weatherization. 
 So while all states will get more money for weatherization than ever before, and cold states will still get a majority of the money, the share going to cold states will be smaller than usual. In the past, cold states received two-thirds of the weatherization money; now they will take just over half. 
 This is one of several examples where the stimulus law relies on existing Congressional formulas to divide billions of dollars. Doing so made it hard to direct the spending but avoided messy fights in Congress over how to divide the money.
 As Florida's weatherization money climbs to $176 million over the next couple of years, from $5 million this year, the scene that played out recently at Jessica Langston's double-wide mobile home in Crawfordville is likely to become more common. 
 A large truck, parked by a palm tree in the front yard, was pumping fiberglass insulation into small holes bored in the corrugated metal roof. Glaziers were sticking tinted film to the windows to dull the sun's heat. And cool air was streaming through the floor vents, much stronger now that the metal ducts beneath the floor had been sealed tight and the air-conditioner unit outside had been serviced. 
 ''Before, it would just be hot, unbearably hot,'' said Ms. Langston, 27, who had covered the windows with tin foil and taped a leaky window shut when she moved in last summer, pregnant with her third daughter. Her monthly electricity bills can top $400. 
 Officials here say that the program has cut electricity use and costs. A review of the utility bills of nine Floridians whose homes were recently weatherized showed varied savings. A couple of bills were halved, with monthly savings of up to $178; most customers saved $13 to $44 a month, and one customer saw her electric bill rise as she consumed more electricity after her house had been weatherized.
 Norm Gampel, who manages the program for the Florida Department of Community Affairs, said new training tailored to Sun Belt states had helped. Florida workers now use infrared cameras to pinpoint leaks, along with blower doors, large fans that suck the air out of a house to measure how airtight it is.
 There is no doubt that the program will have its intended effect of putting people to work: nine people worked on Ms. Langston's house. Robin Dias, the weatherization coordinator here for Wakulla County, said that he was preparing to expand to six crews, from two, to handle the additional work and that he was having no trouble finding workers since the housing market went bust.
 ''When everything was going so good, I couldn't hardly get nobody,'' Mr. Dias said. ''But since the drop -- oh man, I've got a list of contractors.''
 Mr. Gampel said he was convinced that with the increased financing, the program would prove its worth in hot states. 
 ''This is our chance to shine,'' he said. ''Or, we're in the spotlight, however you want to look at it.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 2-Sided Downturn
 In Jamaica Center
 The streetscape of downtown Jamaica, the commercial and transit hub of southeast Queens, is a riot of color: Zebra-print handbags, pink Betty Boop suitcases and rainbows of T-shirts for 99 cents seem to burst from small shops onto the sidewalk. Outside one shop, a recorded voice squawks: ''Air Maxes, Uptowns, Jordans, $40 in the back! Leather jackets, buy one get one free! Closing out!'' 
 In the recession, Jamaica Avenue's reputation as a discount emporium is a blessing and a curse. ''Most consumers now are looking for value, and that's a competitive edge Jamaica Avenue has,'' said Brigit Pinnell, executive director of the Jamaica Center Business Improvement District.
 Buses of shoppers still come from as far as Philadelphia, and there are recent signs of recovery: Retail vacancy rates between Sutphin Boulevard and 169th Street, which had jumped to 6.9 percent in March from 3.7 percent in November, are back down to 4.2 percent, Ms. Pinnell says.
 On the other hand, sales are down for many merchants, and nearby residents fear the downturn will scare off the higher-quality and national retailers they have wanted to lure back since department stores fled in the 1970s. 
 Adjoa Gzifa, president of Community Board 12, which covers Jamaica, walked the avenue recently with a reporter and Yvonne Reddick, the district manager.
 Q. What signs of the recession have you seen?
 A. Southeast Queens has more foreclosures than anybody anywhere. On my block, on 179th Street, one guy started to knock down his house and rebuild. Now he ran out of money. And it looks terrible; it's blight.
 Q. What about in your job teaching career development at York College?
 A. I'm trying to teach young people how to get a job, but there are no jobs to be gotten. The banks are not hiring, and when they do hire bank tellers, they're hiring them part time.
 Q. What are some ripple effects of the foreclosure crisis?
 A. If you're losing your house, you want to pay your mortgage, and you can't pay the gas, the electric and the water bill, then you can't shop. It's basic needs first. People don't have enough money to support the store owners.
 Q. Are you concerned the recession will slow down redevelopment of the commercial district?
 A. Yes. How many 99-cent stores do we need? Mom-and-pop shops replaced the national stores, but now the mom-and-pop shops are closing. The Music Factory, a record store, became a cellphone store; we have one on every corner. What the community needs is quality, affordable merchandise.

HEADLINE: Your Soda: Do You Want a Tax With That?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Healthy Tax'' (editorial, June 3):
 One can of soda has the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the single leading contributor to obesity, and obesity is a leading contributor to disease -- diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and even cancer -- triggering billions of dollars of medical costs each year. 
 As child advocates fighting to improve access to healthy, affordable food, we support an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages as an effective means to deter consumption. Congress must take the lead and place the health and well-being of children before that of the beverage industry.
 Jennifer March-Joly Executive Director Citizens' Committee for Children of New York New York, June 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 What happened to personal responsibility? What happened to parental responsibility? When did taxation become the best solution to any problem? Is the federal government the only entity in our country that can raise children now? 
 This is just another idea on how to raise money for state-sponsored health care with a fig leaf of a reason to do so. Let's try removing soda machines from our schools, providing healthier school lunches and ensuring that our gym classes are financed. There are plenty of common-sense things that can be done to achieve healthier progeny, alas not many that simultaneously finance health care.
 Andrey Abramov Los Angeles, June 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Our industry agrees that obesity and the need to improve health care in America are serious challenges facing our nation. Scientists agree that there is no single cause of obesity, and there will be no single solution. In fact, a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine reaffirms that calories are calories, regardless of their source.
 Balancing calories consumed with those expended through physical activity is the critical factor in preventing obesity. Therefore, we must continue to educate Americans about the importance of energy balance. 
 Taxing soda is not the solution. It will have no impact on public health. It will only take our eye off the ball and deter us from meaningful solutions. 
 There are better initiatives to tackle obesity than discriminatory taxes. As policy makers seek ways to finance health care reform, we encourage them to seek broad-based, equitable solutions based on science, economic realities and common sense. These are policies America can support.

HEADLINE: After Years in the Works, Train Tunnel Is Becoming a Reality

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New Jersey officials have been planning the next train tunnel under the Hudson River for so long that it is already on its third name. This month, work is scheduled to begin on the Mass Transit Tunnel -- formerly known as the Trans-Hudson Express and, before that, Access to the Region's Core -- more than 15 years after it was conceived.
 A ceremonial groundbreaking was set for Monday alongside a highway in North Bergen, N.J., the site of the first small piece of what could be the biggest transit project in the country. The tunnel, which is expected to take eight years to complete, bears a current price tag of $8.7 billion. That is about $6 billion less than the so-called Big Dig highway tunnel in Boston cost but about $6 billion more than the project's original price. 
 By getting started this month, the tunnel project will qualify for $130 million in federal money from the economic stimulus package President Obama signed in mid-February. The project's planners, who estimate that it will create more than 5,600 construction jobs, are hoping to receive an additional $3 billion in federal money.
 ''In addition to creating thousands of jobs and promoting mobility and regional competitiveness in the global economy for decades to come, the Mass Transit Tunnel will provide enormous environmental benefits by taking thousands of cars off the road,'' said New Jersey's governor, Jon S. Corzine, who has been one of the project's most ardent champions.
 The project, however, does have environmental costs, and would ''destroy between 19 to 25 acres of wetlands and open waters and approximately 112 acres of upland natural areas including 1.7 acres of forest,'' according to a decision from the Federal Transit Administration.
 The Hudson tunnel was designed to help ease the jam-packed rides that rail commuters from the west have long endured. New Jersey Transit, which runs as many as 23 trains an hour through a century-old tunnel into Pennsylvania Station in New York, has said that it is nearing maximum capacity. The riders of those trains share Penn Station with passengers of the Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak.
 The solution, elected officials, labor unions and business groups agree, is to bore a second tunnel through the Hudson Palisades, under the river and into the bedrock of Manhattan. That tunnel would bring trains from the suburbs of North Jersey and would end in a bilevel station to be built about 180 feet below 34th Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenues. 
 That station, dubbed the Penn Station Expansion, was originally designed to connect to Penn Station so that Amtrak and New Jersey Transit would have another route in and out of New York. But the project's planners threw out that idea when they decided that they needed to cut much deeper under the city. 
 Politically, the planners at New Jersey Transit are taking a path of less resistance in their quest to pull off a giant public works project in another state. One reason they chose to dig deeper was to avoid the tracks the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to lay down on the West Side for the extension of the No. 7 subway line. They also abandoned plans to extend the station under Macy's flagship store on the north side of 34th Street after Macy's executives protested.
 Now Macy's is endorsing the project, as are New Jersey's two United States senators and several influential organizations, including the Regional Plan Association and the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority.
 But the project's sponsors have not placated all critics.
 Some mass transit advocates have insisted that the tunnel connect to either Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal, or both, to be useful to many of the commuters. Others have argued that the proposed station, 18 stories below ground, will be too difficult to evacuate in a fire or other emergency.
 Residents of some towns along New Jersey Transit's rail lines, like Summit, have complained about being rerouted from Penn Station to the new station. And some property owners in the city have sounded off about the prospect of losing their land because an out-of-state transit agency has designs on it. New Jersey Transit plans to obtain more than a dozen pieces of property in Manhattan as sites for station entrances, air shafts and fan plants. It estimated that those acquisitions were worth about $29 million and would eliminate 178 jobs in the city.
 Among them, according to project documents, would be seven positions at the Blarney Rock Pub on West 33rd Street near Madison Square Garden. Tom Dwyer, whose family has run the Blarney Rock for 40 years, sent an e-mail message last year to the project's planners pleading with them to take a neighboring sex shop called Peep World instead. He said he had been told that that building was less suitable because of some adjacent windows.
 ''Windows!!'' Mr. Dwyer wrote. ''The engineers can cut through solid rock a hundred feet under ground and under water but they can't deal with some windows.''
 New Jersey Transit has begun the process of selecting companies to tunnel under Manhattan, work that is scheduled to begin next year.

HEADLINE: Yes to 'Buy American'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding your June 3 editorial ''The Peril of 'Buy American,' '' the idea that, in the current crisis, we are going to take taxpayer dollars and buy Chinese or other foreign materials for infrastructure construction is absurd. This would do nothing to stimulate our economy or create jobs. A Department of Transportation study shows that every $1 billion invested in federal highways supports 35,000 American jobs. 
 The United States is the most open market in the world, running a $456 billion manufacturing trade deficit in 2008. ''Buy America'' provisions allow the waiver of domestic preference, for reasons of cost or availability, and their implementation is consistent with United States international trade obligations. 
 Steel imports are taking historically high market share while the domestic industry is producing at half its capacity. American mills are on hot idle waiting to produce quality steel for America's needs. Let's stop being apologists for foreign protectionists and put Americans back to work!

HEADLINE: Opponents of Chrysler Sale to Fiat Make Appeal to Supreme Court

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Three Indiana state funds asked the United States Supreme Court late Saturday to delay a deal to sell most of Chrysler's assets to Fiat, their last hope of challenging the transaction after two lower courts approved it. 
 In documents filed to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, lawyers for the funds asked to extend a stay on the sale, which is set to expire Monday at 4 p.m. The funds are seeking to have the high court re-examine the case, after the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the sale Friday afternoon.
 Justice Ginsburg, who oversees the Second Circuit, may decide the matter on her own or refer it to the full Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court declines to issue its own stay of the deal, Chrysler and Fiat will be free to close the transaction immediately.
 The three Indiana funds, which represent teachers and police officers, have sought greater compensation for their portion of Chrysler's $6.9 billion in secured debt. They have also argued that the Obama administration illegally used federal bailout money earmarked for financial institutions to help Chrysler.
 ''The negative economic consequences of permitting an unlawful sale to proceed may well over time dramatically outweigh Chrysler's short-term harm,'' the funds said in their brief.
 Lawyers representing Chrysler, the Indiana funds, the government, Fiat and others made their arguments in a two-hour hearing before the Court of Appeals. The judges issued their decision after a 10-minute recess, affirming a bankruptcy court judge's approval of the sale.
 Lawyers for Chrysler and the government argued that the sale to Fiat should be completed as quickly as possible to preserve Chrysler's viability and to save thousands of jobs. Fiat can walk away if no agreement is struck by June 15.
 Last week, Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved the sale to Fiat, overruling more than 300 objections. He later agreed to shorten a customary 10-day stay of the sale to four days, though the Court of Appeals stayed the transaction pending its hearing.

HEADLINE: Gordon The Unlucky

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
 What would have happened if hanging chads and the Supreme Court hadn't denied Al Gore the White House in 2000? Many things would clearly have been different over the next eight years.
 But one thing would probably have been the same: There would have been a huge housing bubble and a financial crisis when the bubble burst. And if Democrats had been in power when the bad news arrived, they would have taken the blame, even though things would surely have been as bad or worse under Republican rule.
 You now understand the essentials of the current political situation in Britain. 
 For much of the past 30 years, politics and policy here and in America have moved in tandem. We had Reagan; they had Thatcher. We had the Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982, which dismantled New Deal-era banking regulation; they had the Big Bang of 1986, which deregulated London's financial industry. Both nations had an explosion of household debt and saw their financial systems become increasingly unsound.
 In both countries, the conservatives who pushed through deregulation lost power in the 1990s. In each case, however, the new leaders were as infatuated with ''innovative'' finance as their predecessors were. Robert Rubin, in his years as the Treasury secretary, and Gordon Brown, in his years as the chancellor of the Exchequer, preached the same gospel.
 But where America's conservative movement -- better organized and far more ruthless than its British counterpart -- managed to claw its way back to power at the beginning of this decade, in Britain, the Labor Party continued to rule right through the bubble years. Mr. Brown eventually became prime minister. And so the Bush bust in America is the Brown bust here.
 Do Mr. Brown and his party really deserve blame for the crisis here? Yes and no.
 Mr. Brown bought fully into the dogma that the market knows best, that less regulation is more. In 2005 he called for ''trust in the responsible company, the engaged employee and the educated consumer'' and insisted that regulation should have ''not just a light touch but a limited touch.'' It might as well have been Alan Greenspan speaking.
 There's no question that this zeal for deregulation set Britain up for a fall. Consider the counterexample of Canada -- a mostly English-speaking country, every bit as much in the American cultural orbit as Britain, but one where Reagan/Thatcher-type financial deregulation never took hold. Sure enough, Canadian banks have been a pillar of stability in the crisis.
 But here's the thing. While Mr. Brown and his party may deserve to be punished, their political opponents don't deserve to be rewarded.
 After all, would a Conservative government have been any less in the thrall of free-market fundamentalism, any more willing to rein in runaway finance, over the past decade? Of course not.
 And Mr. Brown's response to the crisis -- a burst of activism to make up for his past passivity -- makes sense, whereas that of his opponents does not.
 The Brown government has moved aggressively to shore up troubled banks. This has potentially put taxpayers on the hook for large future bills, but the financial situation has stabilized. Mr. Brown has backed the Bank of England, which, like the Federal Reserve, has engaged in unconventional moves to free up credit. And he has shown himself willing to run large budget deficits now, even while scheduling substantial tax increases for the future. 
 All of this seems to be working. Leading indicators have turned (slightly) positive, suggesting that Britain, whose competitiveness has benefited from the devaluation of the pound, will begin an economic recovery well before the rest of Europe.
 Meanwhile, David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic and demand that the British government tighten its belt immediately.
 Now, many commentators have raised the alarm about Britain's fiscal outlook, and one rating agency has warned that the country may lose its AAA status (although the others disagree). But markets don't seem unduly worried: the interest rate on long-term British debt is only slightly higher than that on German debt, not what you'd expect from a country doomed to bankruptcy.
 Still, if an election were held today, Mr. Brown and his party would lose badly. They were in power when the bad stuff happened, and the buck -- or in this case, I guess, the quid -- stops at No. 10 Downing Street.
 It's a sobering prospect. If I were a member of the Obama administration's economic team -- a team whose top members were as enthusiastic about the wonders of modern finance as their British counterparts -- I'd be looking across the Atlantic and muttering, ''There but for the disgrace of Bush v. Gore go I.''

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Health Bill Is Possible, Leaders Say

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Plenty of people here think Senators Max Baucus and Charles E. Grassley are wasting time seeking a bipartisan health care bill to insure every American. And skeptics boast a 70-year winning streak. 
 The two men's roles as the Senate Finance Committee chairman (Mr. Baucus, Democrat of Montana) and the ranking Republican (Mr. Grassley, of Iowa) lack the clout of a generation ago. Each stands to attract more abuse than acclaim from his party's rank and file. 
 Republicans and Democrats differ sharply on the government's role in health care. Partisan habits make compromise difficult, and Democratic strength in Congress gives President Obama's party the option of shoving legislation through without Republican support. 
 Still, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley expressed optimism in a joint interview on Thursday that 2009 is different, and that their backstage negotiations would soon clear remaining obstacles. 
 ''As sure as we're sitting here, it's going to happen,'' Mr. Baucus said in their committee's hearing room, where they vowed to introduce legislation jointly by mid-month.
 ''It will get over the goal line,'' Mr. Grassley said.
 Who Makes the Call?
 Leaders of appropriations and finance committees in Congress have long held a reputation as a third party unto themselves. Lately, that reputation has soured, as appropriations dons like Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, and former Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, became symbols for waste or corruption.
 Finance Committee powers like former Senators Russell B. Long and Bob Dole once won praise for can-do deal-cutting. In 1986, the House Ways and Means chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat, and his Senate counterpart, Robert W. Packwood, a Republican, overcame squadrons of lobbyists to place tax reform legislation on President Ronald Reagan's desk.
 In recent years, however, the demands of partisan and ideological discipline have reined in committee leaders. ''They're still major players,'' Mr. Packwood said. ''But in my early years, they were the only players.'' 
 In Mr. Baucus's pursuit of a centrist compromise, he faces heat from liberals both in the Senate and out who share the more expansive government vision of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Asked which one of the two senators would make the final calls on health legislation, Mr. Baucus replied with a chuckle, ''It'll be a Senate decision.'' House Democrats stand closer to Mr. Kennedy.
 Mr. Grassley, first elected alongside Mr. Reagan in 1980, calls himself ''an honest broker'' for his party on legislation that would reshape one-sixth of the United States economy. Republican conservatives loathe the idea of a government-run ''public plan'' to compete with insurance companies, and they balk at proposed ''play or pay'' requirements that employers insure workers. 
 But as he explores compromises with Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley displays striking ease with the premises of the effort. He accepts Mr. Obama's commitment to overhauling health care delivery without expanding the deficit. 
 He embraces a mandate that individuals obtain at least basic health insurance, with subsidies for those who cannot afford it. He acknowledges the need for new market regulations and even ''some revenue raised,'' which Republicans typically deride as tax increases. 
 ''The federal government's already involved in 45 percent of the delivery of health care,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''We want to make sure that that 45 percent is more efficiently delivered. It seems to me that's a good Republican principle.''
 A Matter of Money
 No one has spelled out how to finance the roughly $1 trillion over 10 years for an overhaul that would provide care to the uninsured. But two recent Obama White House shifts have made that easier. 
 First, Mr. Obama vowed to find another $200 billion to $300 billion in savings from Medicare and Medicaid, beyond the $300 billion or so already proposed. That would leave lawmakers needing about $500 billion in higher taxes.
 Second, Mr. Obama signaled that he could support acquiring part of that money from limiting the existing tax exclusion for employer-provided health benefits -- a concept he criticized Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for proposing in the 2008 presidential campaign. Taxing only the most lavish 10 percent of benefit plans would raise an additional $336 billion in income taxes, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. 
 Remaining tax increases, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley agree, should come directly from other health-related sources. They all but rule out Mr. Obama's proposed limit on itemized deductions for high-income Americans or options tangentially linked to health care, like taxes on sweetened drinks and alcohol.
 Their effort could falter if the Congressional Budget Office decides this week that their numbers do not add up. But if they do, and a Baucus-Grassley bill clears their committee by month's end, Mr. Obama has a chance for the bipartisan bill he says he wants. 
 White House aides differ on whether that is possible. Even optimists predict that in the best possible case, a bill achieving their goals would draw fewer than 10 Republicans, besides Mr. Grassley.
 Mr. Baucus discerned a new ''sense of inevitability'' binding lawmakers and interest groups otherwise inclined to fight. 
 Mr. Grassley concluded, ''All I can tell you is we've been on schedule so far.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Plans Wider Oversight Of Compensation

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans to require banks and corporations that have received two rounds of federal bailouts to submit any major executive pay changes for approval by a new federal official who will monitor compensation, according to two government officials. 
 The proposal is part of a broad set of regulations on executive compensation expected to be announced by the administration as early as this week. Some of the rules are required by legislation enacted in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and they would apply only to companies that received taxpayer money. 
 Others, which are being described as broad principles, would set standards that the government would like the entire financial industry to observe as banks and other companies compensate their highest-paid executives, though it is not clear how stringent regulators will make them. 
 Citigroup, Bank of America, the American International Group, General Motors and its finance arm, GMAC, which all received two taxpayer infusions, will face the strictest scrutiny from the new federal official charged with vetting compensation, Kenneth R. Feinberg. He is known for overseeing payouts to the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 In the past, banks had free rein to determine the base salary and bonuses they awarded their employees. When the economy was riding high, bonuses for top Wall Street executives and traders soared to tens of millions of dollars. Critics say the bonuses often encouraged excessive risk-taking since star bankers could walk away with more money even if the bets they took failed to pay off. 
 But executive pay has been a delicate issue for the Obama administration and Congress, particularly since it was revealed that A.I.G., the recipient of at least $180 billion in taxpayer money, was handing out $165 million in bonuses. The episode left officials struggling with just how to balance public anger with compensation rules that would not put the industry at a competitive disadvantage or derail other economic recovery initiatives. 
 With the government handing out billions in bailouts, Congress passed legislation banning all companies that received support from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, from paying their top 25 executives bonuses greater than a third of their salary, though they were not subject to specific salary cap. 
 The banking industry had been lobbying the Obama administration to exclude traders and other highflying salespeople from the top 25, fearing it would lose top talent to competitors not constrained by the rules of a taxpayer bailout. A number of bankers at Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have already fled to higher-paying jobs with rivals. But officials say that the guidelines will apply to the top 25 earners, including the traders. 
 Banks that received money from the relief program must also curb outsize severance packages, and pull back bonuses that were based on fraudulent or misstated results. 
 But without clear rules, many banks have been altering their compensation policies, with some ratcheting up salaries to get around the restrictions until the legislation was codified. The industry has eagerly awaited the fine print. 
 ''Some of the provisions on the pay restrictions on relief TARP recipients are punitive, intended to emphasize that this is government money and we don't you want you giving it to executives,'' said Michael S. Melbinger, a lawyer at Winston & Strawn who specializes in executive compensation.
 In a sign of how eager corporations are to escape government diktats on pay, at least nine of the nation's biggest banks have asked to repay bailout money. The administration is expected to start granting approvals as early as Tuesday, allowing banks to leave the bailout program far earlier than many had envisioned. The early approvals are a sign that regulators and the banking industry believe that the worst of the crisis may have passed, even though the economy remains fragile.
 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and a handful of others have worked to rid themselves of their ties to the government in order to shed restrictions on pay that they say put them at a competitive disadvantage. 
 But under the administration's new plans, even companies that repay the taxpayer money will not escape some form of oversight on their compensation structure. 
 ''The industry has already adapted to the political and economic realities,'' said Scott E. Talbott, the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group made up of the nation's biggest banks and insurance companies. ''If they are draconian, they could put the financial services industry at a distinct disadvantage in attracting and retaining top personnel. If they are just principles, they will be redundant because the industry has already moved to connect employee compensation with the long-term health of the company.'' 
 The set of broad pay principles being drafted by the Treasury Department would authorize regulators to tell a bank to alter its compensation arrangements if it is found to encourage too much risk-taking. It is not clear how the government will define too much risk. 
 According to the two government officials, the new principles will not include bonus restrictions, although they will encourage banks to set compensation in a way that avoids rewarding risk-taking through short-term bonus awards. They will apply to a broad swath of financial companies, even the United States operations of foreign banks, as well as private companies like hedge funds and private equity firms.
 ''This is the government trying to tell the TARP banks not to worry, because everyone else's compensation will be monitored, too,'' Gustavo Dolfino, president of the WhiteRock Group, a financial recruiter, said of the industrywide principles. ''We're in a world of TARP and non-TARP.'' 
 The strictest oversight of all will come from Mr. Feinberg, the administration's compensation czar, who will actively vet all executive compensation changes at the companies that have received more than one taxpayer lifeline. 
 On Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing to examine how compensation practices contributed to the financial collapse and encouraged excessive risk-taking. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner plans to testify on compensation on June 18, and that may be when he outlines the principles for the entire industry. Those principles will be permanent: when bailed-out companies return the government money, they will still have to follow those principles.
