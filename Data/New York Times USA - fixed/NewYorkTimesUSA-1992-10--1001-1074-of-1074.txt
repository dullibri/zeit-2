Going Bananas

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The U.S. of A.: winner of the cold war, model to the world, heir to global leadership and greatness, incipient banana republic. Banana republic?
Banana-republichood is attained when political, business and community leaders do things that are plainly stupid and self-destructive, and when they cannot pull themselves together to fix obvious wrongs and advance the plain national interest. 
 Just read the newspapers in the last few days and contemplate the creeping decrepitude.
Friends and family buried Yoshihiro Hattori on Monday in Japan. He was a 16-year-old exchange student in Baton Rouge, La. Looking for a party, he knocked on the wrong door, was told to "freeze," didn't understand the word, and was shot dead by a homeowner with a .44 magnum pistol.
The Japanese were astonished that such a thing could happen. In their country, private handguns are prohibited. In almost all Western democracies, handguns cannot be purchased without a waiting period, a license and a good reason. Only in America can a tiny fraction of the population (our Frankenstein monster, the National Rifle Association) "convince" political "leaders" that our freedoms depend on easy access to handguns and semiautomatic weapons, and that the 12,000 people killed with handguns in 1990 was "the American way."
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told his fellow Germans this week that he would raise taxes to cut the Government's surging budget deficit. Germans are quite conservative and already more heavily taxed than Americans. But rather than see his newly unified nation go down the economic drain, Mr. Kohl finally stood up, took his political wormwood and asked his countrymen for sacrifice.
The U.S. is heading toward a $5 trillion national debt, and few American politicians dare to suggest paying bills and sacrificing to save the nation. The only politician to have done so and survived is not exactly a politician and has his own private fortune.
That daring fellow is Ross Perot -- whose virtues as an economic truth-teller seem somewhat clouded by his rather erratic behavior. Mr. Perot can be very scary. No one that strange, unpredictable and risky has come near national power in any other industrial democracy since before World War II. As Yogi Berra said when told Dublin had elected its first Jewish Mayor, "Only in America."
Almost only in America could one imagine tolerating a $400 billion annual deficit and a $4 trillion accumulated national debt. Only here, perhaps, can politicians talk about "growing out" of the deficit. If any banana republic tried to sell us that painless baloney, we'd cut off its supply of international loans.
Or take the case of Robert Stempel, whose board of directors just forced him out as boss of General Motors. Over the last two years in its North American operations alone, Mr. Stempel led his company to a $12 billion loss. In the last dozen years, he and his predecessors have presided over the demolition of one of America's greatest corporations.
Almost all the while, the executives of G.M. were awarding themselves fat yearly raises and bonuses -- and laying off workers. Boards of directors in almost any public corporation abroad would have bought gold Toyotas for such executives and sent them off long ago to the year-round golf course.
Or ponder President Bush's charge that Ross Perot is "nutty" for proposing a 50-cent increase in gas taxes. (Bill Clinton also opposes the idea, but secretly likes it, maybe.) Mr. Bush must think it's cosmically nutty, then, for gas taxes to be eight times ours in West Europe and four times ours in Japan.
But higher carbon taxes mean greater energy efficiency (ours is about half theirs), lower growth in air pollution, smaller oil import bills and, above all, greater security. Right now, the United States buys more than half its oil from the Persian Gulf. This means every time some gulf messiah has a yen for Saudi Arabia, we have to go to war. This could happen only in an America fast nurturing the mentality of banana-republichood.
For a decade, Japan and Asia have been trading our pants off. This year, a "Canadian" baseball team bested us for the first time in the World Series. If we don't shape up, in 10 years Mexico will be buying Rockefeller Center.

HEADLINE: Perot Plan Prescribes an Economic Disaster;
Deficit Delusion

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Perot Medicine for Clinton" (Op-Ed, Oct. 7), Robert Litan is the latest Brookings Institution scholar to recommend some kind of two-part economic plan to jump-start the economy: a temporary stimulus by way of deficit spending on infrastructure and investment tax credits for the first two to three years of a Clinton administration, to be followed by Ross Perot's plan for higher taxes and further budget cuts to eliminate the deficit. 
 Mr. Litan and the other jump-starters do not realize that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
In the Great Depression, some economists urged a similar two-part program that was labeled pump priming, that is, a temporary increase in Government spending financed by deficits to get the economy moving. After the economy improved, traditional budget balancing measures could be reinstated.
Thus, during the early years of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration, massive deficit spending on infrastructure (as in the Work Projects Administration) and other actions were undertaken.
By 1936 the economy was well on its way to recovery, while economic pundits were predicting catastrophe unless the deficit was eliminated. Roosevelt, running for re-election, promised to end pump priming and balance the budget. By drastically reducing Government expenditures, Roosevelt submitted a budget for 1937 that cut the deficit almost in half. In the first nine months of 1937 gross national product collapsed to approximately the same level it had fallen to in 1933.
Roosevelt quickly reversed course and throughout the rest of his Administration the Government permanently spent more than the revenues it took in. Prosperity was firmly reinstituted in the United States.
This experience should warn us that today's jump-start approach is a snare and a delusion that turns attention from the long-run and permanent need to develop Government policies necessary for the success of an entrepreneurial economy. A jump-start will merely turn over the motor. Once the ignition is shut off, the motor will die again -- unless the battery has been permanently charged, so that it can carry the load of keeping the economy going -- and in a growing economy, accelerating.
As long as our economy has idle workers who want to work and contribute to the growth of America, it is the Government's responsibility to assure them meaningful productive jobs. The best defense against welfare dependency is a full employment economy.

HEADLINE: Perot Plan Prescribes an Economic Disaster;
Roads to the Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is a grave mistake to view Federal spending on public works as merely a means of generating temporary work in times of economic distress. Rebuilding the nation's infrastructure should not simply be motivated by "activist risk-taking," as one economist characterizes it in "Old Idea Gains New Respect: Spending Way Out of Slump" (front page, Oct. 8). 
 American economic supremacy in the post-World War II period was directly linked to the superiority of our transportation and communication systems, and the decline of that infrastructure presaged the decline of our economic position in the world. The Federal Government should pursue programs that will restore our infrastructure while generating productive and rewarding work. The objective is not, however, simply to increase public works employment. It is to rebuild the foundation on which our future economic security rests.
In the long run, policies that rebuild our airports, highways and waterways will enable us to be a more productive country -- and that is surely the best way to reduce the deficit.

McDonnell To Contract Work Out

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 28

 BODY:
As part of a reorganization announced in August, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation may start trimming costs by contracting out some work that has been performed in house, company spokesmen said today, confirming a published report.
The cost-cutting strategy, which can save millions of dollars but costs workers their jobs, is just taking hold among aerospace companies, which are having to become more competitive as orders for airliners, fighter planes and weapon systems have declined. 
 Among the first companies to take this step was the General Dynamics Corporation, which last year sold its data processing unit for $200 million to the Computer Sciences Corporation. The business is worth $3 billion over 10 years to Computer Sciences and is that company's first important commercial contract, said Larry DeJarnett, a vice president with A. T. Kearney, a management consulting firm.
 
Trend in Aerospace Industry
 "It's a growing trend in the aerospace business," Mr. DeJarnett said, but one heretofore shunned by the industry, primarily because of worries about secrecy.
"Economic pressure to survive finally forces you to do it," he said.
The move to "outsourcing," in industry argot, by McDonnell Douglas could cost 2,500 to 5,500 jobs and could begin after Nov. 6, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported today. The paper said McDonnell was reviewing the possibility of contracting out research and testing, data processing and mail services. While McDonnell would not verify any of the numbers specified in the St. Louis article, it acknowledged that the idea was being considered.
As part of its previously announced restructuring plan, the nation's largest military contractor put its data processing group, which employs 1,400 people, up for sale.
A team of nine executives has just begun looking at whether laboratory jobs can also be hired out, said another company spokesman. The company is the Pentagon's No. 2 research contractor, having received $300 million in contracts this year, and it employs 2,000 lab workers in various sites. "We're taking a look," a spokesman said. "No decisions have been made."
In previous downturns, research and engineering staffs at aerospace concerns had some measure of job protection in working on the next generation of weapon systems, said Paul Nesbit, an analyst at Prudential Securities. These staffs are being let go today, he said. "You don't invest in the future if there isn't a future."
Martin J. Bollinger, a vice president in the aerospace group of the management consultant Booz, Allen & Hamilton, said: "Until two years ago, this industry had no incentive to cut costs. Now if they don't, they'll lose market share, because their competitors will."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans -- Candidate Aim at Crucial States, and Each Other;
Bush, Buoyed by Polls, Scrambles to Rebuild Winning Coalition

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 29

 BODY:
With some new polls providing encouragement, President Bush and his strategists have begun scrambling, hoping in the five days left them to rebuild the shattered bloc of Republicans and disaffected Democrats that won the White House in 1988. That is why they came to Michigan today.
Mr. Bush returned to an old wellspring of Democratic support, suburban Macomb County, to sound alarms about high taxes and low character that he hopes will drive voters away from Bill Clinton and into his camp. 
 Hoarse and shouting over the crowd of 10,000 people, Mr. Bush stripped his message to its most pointed and strident essence.
 
'Crazy, Way Out, Far Out'
 He accused Mr. Clinton of having "given up on reducing the deficit." Arms flailing, he denounced Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore, as an environmental extremist who is "crazy, way out, far out, man."
He underscored his "big difference" with people who would protest the Vietnam war overseas, as Mr. Clinton did, "when your brother's in prison in Hanoi or your kids are being drafted out of a ghetto somewhere."
Twice, he dismissed his two rivals with contemptuous remarks, declaring that "my dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos."
And he turned one of Mr. Clinton's favorite anti-Bush buzzwords against him, calling a band of sign-waving Clinton supporters at one Bush rally "a little pathetic."
"They feel it slipping away from them," he exulted. "They know we're going to win the election." The crowd at a cavernous junior-college fieldhouse roared its approval.
Later, at an outdoor rally in Grand Rapids dominated by a huge, pink, elephant-shaped balloon, Mr. Bush punched away at Mr. Clinton's credibility again, saying, "What's catching up with him now -- what's catching up with him just as we go down to the wire -- is this pattern of deception."
Mr. Bush's aides asserted today that their attacks had shifted the focus of the political debate to the issue of character, where the White House wants it, and to the best way to revive the economy, where they feel they are on at least equal footing.
In fact, Mr. Bush has begun to leaven his assaults on Mr. Clinton with large doses of can-do optimism about the future, something glaringly absent until this month. He has seized on Tuesday's report of a healthy rise in economic output as evidence of a looming American revival, even if voters have yet to notice it.
"There was very good news for this country two days ago, and they hate it," he told 9,800 supporters in Grand Rapids today. "The only way they can win is to convince America that we're in a recession. We had growth of 2.7 percent. We have grown for six quarters. And now let's keep it going."
Later, he spoke of "a worldwide recovery," led by the United States, that will "bring jobs to more Americans."
Mr. Bush's aides assert that the combination of slashing attacks and hopeful messages is raising Mr. Bush's popularity and lowering Mr. Clinton's.
The President's campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said today that he believed Mr. Clinton's lead was shriveling in Michigan. In large part, he said, that is because Mr. Bush had shone a spotlight on Mr. Clinton's pledge to raise taxes by $150 billion.
Mr. Clinton says that new burden will fall mostly on the well-off and on foreign companies. Bush strategists have responded by blanketing rallies with cardboard devices, akin to simple slide rules, that supposedly enable voters to determine how much Mr. Clinton's package of tax proposals "could" cost people in their income brackets. Invariably, the totals are in the thousands of dollars.
Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, Mr. Teeter said, "are the antithesis of what they want to hear."
How much ground Mr. Bush has gained in recent polls depends on which of the wildly varying surveys one reads.
The "tracking poll" conducted for CNN and USA Today showed Mr. Clinton preferred over President Bush by three percentage points today, 41 percent to 38 percent, with 16 percent favoring Ross Perot and 5 percent undecided or supporting another candidate. The margin of sampling error was three percentage points. In a tracking poll, new samples are interviewed each day and reports are issued on the combined results for two or more days at a time.
When the findings of the most recent major national polls are averaged, Mr. Clinton leads Mr. Bush by 43 to 36 percent, with 16 percent for Mr. Perot.
 
Poll in Michigan
 But the President was cheered this morning by a local television station survey that showed him in a statistical tie with Mr. Clinton in Michigan.
Macomb County's blue-collar conservatives are the key to Mr. Bush's failure or success here, and an indication of his national standing as well. They are the archetype of the financially struggling, anti-tax Democrats who deserted Jimmy Carter for Ronald Reagan in 1980, and stayed to vote for Mr. Bush in 1988.
With the economy lagging most of this year, conventional wisdom this year has held that these Reagan Democrats were rejecting Mr. Bush and swinging back to their party.
But Mr. Teeter, the Bush campaign chairman, said in a telephone interview today that it was not happening. He said Mr. Bush had pulled even in Macomb County, which he said "was strongly in favor of Bill Clinton" only two weeks ago.
Whether such trends are sufficiently strong or rapid to make a difference in Tuesday's election remains unclear. But Mr. Teeter, who has every incentive to appear optimistic, argued that the race was now close enough for Mr. Bush to begin consolidating his hold on the normally Republican South and West. Those are regions that Mr. Clinton has strongly contested all summer and fall.
"If we can get that base back of 190 to 210 electoral votes in the West and South," he said, "then you can go fight him for those 60 or 70 other votes you need to win an election."
Mr. Bush plans to pursue those votes next in Tennessee and Missouri, where he campaigns on Friday, and on Saturday by train in Wisconsin.
In addition to a faster pace on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush has been jamming as many television interviews as possible into his last week before the election, appearing on all the network breakfast programs. Tonight he appeared on the ABC News program "Prime Time Live" and he even consented to an interview on Saturday with a reporter for MTV, which he had been avoiding for months. The interview is to be broadcast on Sunday.
Tonight Mr. Bush seemed bent on driving home his argument that national news organization were unfair to him, saying he had been "hammered, hammered, hammered" on Iraq and other issues.
The ABC interview with Sam Donaldson grew testy at several points and Mr. Bush may have been trying to use the combative reporter as a foil for his feud with the press, much as he did with Dan Rather of CBS News in the 1988 New Hampshire primary campaign.
When Mr. Donaldson suggested that the Administration knew that Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, was diverting agricultural loans to weapons programs, Mr. Bush snapped: "Wrong, wrong and wrong. Wrong, wrong and wrong."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats -- Candidates Aim at Crucial States, and Each Other;
Clinton Is Abandoning His Emphasis on Issues For the Attack Strategy of an Underdog

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SECAUCUS, N.J. Oct. 29

 BODY:
Responding to a tightened Presidential race, Gov. Bill Clinton today essentially scrapped plans to spend the final days of his campaign concentrating on substantive issues and instead hop-scotched to three states directing his firepower at President Bush.
Even as he sought to strike a sober tone for speeches on the economy and AIDS research, Mr. Clinton cast his policy discussion in terms of what Mr. Bush lacked. And although he still led in most polls, Mr. Clinton said for the first time in weeks that he considered himself an "underdog" in the race for President. 
 "When Mr. Bush tells us we have to rejoice at our economic plight, I think we have to tell him it's time to move beyond the passivity and complacency of his Presidency and of this campaign," he said during a speech at the University of Toledo.
 
Crisscrossing Campaign Paths
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton have been all but colliding with each other as they jet from one must-win state to another. Today, Mr. Clinton followed Mr. Bush by a day in Toledo, then campaigned at the same time as the President in a different part of Michigan. He spent the afternoon and evening in New Jersey.
"The American people are going to have to think a long time before they want four more years of this," Mr. Clinton said of the Bush Administration. "It will be a miserable experience for them, and I don't think they're going to go through with it."
When a supporter wished Mr. Clinton good luck in Ohio and Michigan as he boarded a plane for Newark, he responded: "If I win both of them, this election's over."
Mr. Clinton's campaign day reflected the strategic tug-of-war within the Democratic campaign. Plans called for him to stick to a loftier message about the economy and jobs, and to deliver a long-awaited speech on AIDS in Jersey City.
In that speech, in the rotunda of the Brennan Courthouse this evening, Mr. Clinton linked the need for Federal action on AIDS to steps he has advocated on other health-care issues, including breast and ovarian cancer. But he made a special plea for new attention to AIDS and urged an end to prejudice directed at those who carry the virus.
Mr. Clinton promised AIDS advocates months ago that he would speak before the campaign ended about his plans for attacking the disease, and today was the fulfillment of that vow. New Jersey is a political plum that he would certainly have visited anyway, but he said he chose to speak on AIDS here because the state leads the nation in the incidents of AIDS cases among women and ranks third in the number of children infected with the disease.
"We must all remember that for all its terror and far reach, it is still a disease," Mr. Clinton said. "It is not vengeance or punishment or just desserts. It is an illness. We have fought illnesses before, and we must fight this one now."
 
Plans for War on AIDS
 Mr. Clinton said he would increase financing for AIDS research, enforce anti-discrimination laws, appoint a Federal official to oversee the Government's response and mount a "loud, clear and consistent war on AIDS."
He also said children should be taught about how the AIDS virus is contracted "at the earliest practical time."
"I do believe the instruction of our children should be based on values that we all share," he said. "I believe children should be discouraged from having premature sexual conduct and from ever having any conduct with needles carrying drugs. But they must be told that this killer can kill them."
Mr. Clinton criticized the Justice Department's support for allowing private employers to cut off insurance coverage for employees who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
Campaign aides had planned for Mr. Clinton to stick to such loftier tones throughout the day, but after he left the courthouse, he returned to the attack, launching another verbal assault on Mr. Bush outside.
Apparently stung by the President's energetic recent attacks, Mr. Clinton counterpunched for the second straight day, vowing, "We're going to slam him home in the next five days."
At a college, a downtown convention center and a small-town courthouse, the Governor's remarks, both on and off the stage, reflected new turmoil in a campaign that had been sailing well ahead of Mr. Bush in public opinion polls for weeks.
Michigan, where Mr. Clinton appeared today, is a classic example of the state of flux that has marked the recent days. Democratic officials there and in Ohio said Mr. Clinton's support had dropped significantly after Mr. Perot re-entered the race.
"It's all about trust," Donald Sweitzer, a national Democratic official who is following the Michigan campaign said. "On issues, it's all moving the other way. Bush is wrong on every issue with these voters."
The Clinton campaign today began broadcasting two new 30-second commercials. One uses blurry television images of President Bush making promises four years ago, like telling people they will be "better off" under his Presidency. The ad closes with a sober announcer saying, "Well, it's four years later. How're you doing?"
Another ad, which Clinton aides said they completed at 4 A.M. today, is a direct response to a Bush commercial that was broadcast beginning Wednesday, attacking the Governor's record in Arkansas. The ad uses third-party sources to accuse the Bush commercial of being dishonest.
"Harry Truman said it, and we're going to live by it," said Paul Begala, a Clinton strategist and speechwriter. "If he's going to tell lies about us, we're going to tell the truth about him."
Mr. Begala tried to draw a contrast between Mr. Clinton's tactics and the President's. "George Bush is out there bordering on the hysterical," Mr. Begala said.
Mr. Clinton has seemed more unsettled in recent days as well. After he first dismissed the tightening race as a natural phenomenon that had been expected, his remarks today were more aggressive, reminiscent of his style when he was struggling in the bleakest days of his primary campaign in New Hampshire.
"I wish it was Tuesday," said one campaign aide. "In 1988 with Dukakis, we used to say every day at this time that we wished we had two more weeks. Now I wish this had ended two weeks ago."
Throwing his entire arsenal of negative oratory at Mr. Bush today, Mr. Clinton accused the President of "fearmongering" and "mudslinging."
"He has made up charges about my record," he said in Toledo. "The man has no core of conviction. This is not Harry Truman. Harry Truman was never called, never called, dishonest by the American press corps. He fought for average people."
"There is no standard of truth in the Bush campaign," Mr. Clinton said. "He will say anything."
Although his attacks on Ross Perot have been much more muted, Mr. Clinton has also questioned the independent's candidacy, charging that Mr. Perot has been "spending anything to get elected."
"When Mr. Bush looks at an anxious and frightened America and tells us this is as good as it gets, that says something worse about his Presidency than anything I could ever say," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton has returned to the talk show cricuit for the closing days of the campaign. Today he taped appearances on both "Prime Time Live" on ABC and participated in a "town meeting" telecast on WWOR in New Jersey. He is also scheduled to appear on ABC'S "Good Morning America" on Friday and tape the PBS show "Talking with David Frost."
Campaign officials also said they planned to undertake a final marathon of campaigning on Monday, embarking on a 24-hour campaign day that would take Mr. Clinton through at least eight states from Pennsylvania to New Mexico before he returned to Arkansas to vote on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Bristol-Myers Squibb to Cut 4% of Its Global Workforce

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Acknowledging difficult times in its core drug and infant-formula businesses, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company announced yesterday that it would eliminate some 2,200 jobs in the next five months.
The big New York-based health-care company said it would cut the jobs in its worldwide pharmaceutical and nutritional groups. Jerry Parrott, a company spokesman, said the reductions would hit "all levels, departments and operations" of the drug and nutrition units around the world in roughly the same proportions. 
 About 330 of the cuts will be in central New Jersey at the company's units in Lawrenceville, Princeton, Plainsboro and New Brunswick. But none would apply to the headquarters staff in New York.
Bristol-Myers Squibb shares rose 25 cents to $67.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Workforce to Shrink 7%
 Combined with the announced sale this week of its Drackett household products unit to S. C. Johnson & Son Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb is shedding a total of 3,800 of the 53,500 employees on its payroll at the beginning of this year, or 7 percent. The company said the cuts would be partly absorbed by vacant positions.
The moves followed the appointment of Charles A. Heimbold Jr. as president two weeks ago, as Bristol-Myers Squibb struggled with disappointing single-digit earnings growth.
Wayne A. Davidson, president of the pharmaceutical and nutritional group, said, "1992 has been a difficult year." He said that the growth of health-care cost-containment programs are "increasingly affecting the business worldwide."
Analysts had mixed reactions. Richard R. Vietor at Merrill Lynch said the cutbacks were "very surprising -- you don't think of Bristol as a layoff type of company."
Barbara Ryan at Alex. Brown & Sons, noted that American patent protection on Capoten, a heart drug with annual sales of about $1.6 billion, would expire in 1995. Capoten generated about 26 percent of Bristol-Myers Squibb's prescription drug sales last year.
But David Lippman at Dean Witter Reynolds said Capoten sales growth was still strong overseas.

HEADLINE: 2 in Race Disagree On Defense And Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
With a troublesome economy and social issues as focal points of their rancorous race for the United States Senate, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Attorney General Robert Abrams have virtually ignored any discussion of foreign policy issues.
Even on those rare occasions a foreign policy issue has been raised, like military budgets and the future of Russia, their answers have been framed in domestic concerns, like the impact on jobs and trade possibilities. 
 But a broader examination of their positions on world affairs reveals a striking difference between them despite their relative agreement on narrow issues like favoring improved relations with Israel after the periods of strain through the last four years.
In essence, Mr. D'Amato, a Republican seeking his third Senate term, and Mr. Abrams, a Democrat in his first bid for national office, embrace fundamentally different visions of the future, in that Mr. Abrams sees a world less threatening to the United States than Mr. D'Amato does.
 
Quick-Strike Force
 The disparity emerges through the role they see the United States playing in the near future and the degree to which they would reduce the current national defense budget of $290 billion over the next five years.
While both envision the kind of mobile, quick-strike military force used in the Persian Gulf war in 1991, with a strong presence in Europe and other strategic places, Mr. D'Amato's force would be larger. He favors reductions of $85 billion in the defense budget over the next five years, and a decrease of 400,000 troops, to 1.5 million. Mr. Abrams would cut spending by more than three times as much, $280 billion over the same period, and require only 1.1 million troops.
Both see the need for reducing the 300,000 troops stationed in Europe -- Mr. Abrams to 75,000 to 100,000; Mr. D'Amato, to about 100,000.
In a recent interview, Mr. D'Amato assailed the continuing presence of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the ethnic wars in Yugoslavia, citing them as reasons for slower defense reductions. He said the demise of the Soviet Union and Communist governments in Eastern Europe was no guarantee military threats had evaporated. He called North Korea "still a military threat" and said he worries about countries like Iran and China buying weapons on the open market.
 
Similar Concerns
 Mr. Abrams cited similar concerns in a separate interview but not to the degree expressed by Mr. D'Amato, who he said "hasn't yet realized the cold war is over." Mr. Abrams argued that the cuts and troop levels he advocates, drawn from a recent study by the Brookings Institution, would be sufficient to safeguard the interests of the United States.
While he would keep the United States military advantage over other countries, he played down the need for the United States to act as "the world's policeman," saying he preferred what he described as the "collective action" of the gulf war.
In an election year in which voters are far more focused on domestic concerns, Mr. D'Amato's approach of seeking smaller cuts in military spending is tied to jobs. He says slashing the military further would not only undermine national security but also devastate New York's economy by eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs from defense contractors like Grumman on Long Island and General Electric in Schenectady.
But Mr. Abrams argued that the longer-term economic stability of New York requires conversion of military production to consumer businesses and reallocating dollars saved from military spending into programs to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. Mr. D'Amato favors the same kind of programs but a more gradual conversion rate.
 
'Responsible Reductions'
 "With the end of the cold war, we cannot bury our head in the sand and miss this opportunity," Mr. Abrams said. "We can remain the strongest military power in the world, but at the same time get the benefit of the end of the cold war with responsible reductions in the military budget."
On trade issues, Mr. D'Amato favors approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which means he supports the measure as written.
Like Gov. Bill Clinton in the Presidential race, Mr. Abrams supports the agreement in principle but would prefer amendments or parallel legislation to require Mexico to enforce its environmental standards and insure worker safety and the United States to provide retraining programs for Americans losing their jobs when their employers move to Mexico.
Both candidates contend that trade relations with China, specifically most-favored-nation status, should be tied to improved human-rights policies in China, especially in the wake of the Chinese Government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But Mr. Abrams takes a harder line against the Chinese Government than Mr. D'Amato, saying "the furthering of democratic principles and human rights should be at the cornerstone of foreign policy" with China.
The Senator called China a "very, very difficult situation." In July 1991, he voted against granting most-favored-nation status to China because of Tiananmen Square. Less than two years later, when the issue came before Congress a second time, he voted with the minority to grant most-favored trade status as a way to encourage the Chinese leadership to adopt more democratic principles.
But a month later, after the President vetoed Congressional rejection of favored-nation trade status, the Senator joined 59 other senators in an override vote that fell 7 votes short.
Mr. Abrams contended that Mr. D'Amato's change in position represented either an inconsistency in position or political opportunism, in that it never appeared that the Senate would gather enough votes to deny China the preferred status.
The Senator disagreed, saying his initial support in 1991 was based on the President's satisfying concerns of Congress through an executive order that, among other things, protected Chinese students living in the United States by not forcing them to leave. His override vote, he said, was cast in the spirit of supporting human rights.
Both candidates chided the Bush Administration for reacting too slowly to help Russia toward democracy and a market economy. Both would encourage investment to further open Russia to American products.

HEADLINE: G.M. Had Big Deficit In Quarter

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, laboring with excess car-manufacturing capacity and unable to trim costs fast enough, posted a third-quarter loss of $752.9 million, reflecting lower car and truck production in the United States and strikes by the United Automobile Workers union at G.M. plants at Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich.
G.M.'s poor financial results come as the board of the No. 1 auto maker has ousted its chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stempel, contending that he did not move quickly enough to turn the company around. Still, the financial results represented an improvement over a $1.1 billion loss in the third quarter of last year. 
 Revenue in the latest quarter was $29.44 billion, a 1.7 percent increase from $28.94 billion a year earlier. A spokesman said the strikes cost the auto maker about 50,000 vehicles' worth of lost production.
G.M. was the last of the Big Three to report financial results for the quarter. The Ford Motor Company said Wednesday that it had a loss of $158.9 million, compared with a loss of $574.4 million a year earlier. The Chrysler Corporation previously posted a profit of $202 million, in contrast to a net loss of $82 million a year earlier.
 
Similar to Estimates
 G.M.'s loss was in line with analysts' estimates and a company disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month. G.M.'s common shares were unchanged today on the New York Stock Exchange at $31.375.
John Casesa, an automotive industry analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, estimated that G.M.'s worldwide automotive operations lost about $1.3 billion, offset by about $600 million in profit from its three nonautomotive subsidiaries, which reported earnings yesterday. G.M. said its overseas automotive operations remained profitable.
Mr. Casesa rates at 50 percent the chances of a reduction or elimination of the dividend on G.M. common stock when the board meets Monday in New York. The auto maker, which last cut its dividend in 1991, currently pays 40 cents a quarter, or $1.60 a year; the dividend payments amount to about $1 billion annually.
"If G.M. is going to clean house, cutting the dividend would be consistent with a fresh start," he said. "Many institutional holders I speak to not only expect it, but think it's the right thing to do."
G.M. has been trying to cut costs so it can make money on lower production volume. But because the cost-cutting has not occurred fast enough to satisfy the directors, the G.M. board will be meeting to select a replacement for Robert C. Stempel, who resigned as chairman this week. It appears likely that John G. Smale, a G.M. director, will become chairman, while John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president, will be given the additional role of chief executive.
For the moment, however, Mr. Stempel said in a statement accompanying the financial results: "Aggressive cost-cutting activities are being intensified, and plans to streamline G.M. into a lean, flexible and highly competitive organization are being implemented at an accelerated rate." Mr. Stempel agreed to remain on the job until the board replaced him.
For the first nine months of the year, G.M. lost $970.7 million on revenue of $96.67 billion, compared with a loss of $1.99 billion a year earlier, on revenue of $89.45 billion.
 
Larger Tax Credit
 G.M.'s said it benefited from a $629.8 million income-tax credit in the quarter, compared with a year-earlier credit of $327.3 million. G.M.'s nonautomotive pretax income rose to $536.5 million, from $259.1 million a year earlier, partly because of a gain from the sale of its interest in a robotics joint venture.
Worldwide factory shipments of G.M. cars and trucks to dealers reached 1.5 million in the third quarter, down 5.2 percent from the quarter in 1991. G.M. records revenue and profit when a vehicle is shipped from the factory.
G.M. said its volume reflected an emphasis on retail sales to individuals and less stress on fleet sales, which are not as profitable as sales to individuals.
G.M. dealers in the United States sold 1.1 million vehicles in the quarter, down 3.2 percent from a year earlier. The auto maker's penetration of the American new-vehicle market dropped to 33.3 percent, compared with 34.5 percent in the 1991 quarter.
According to Mr. Casesa's calculations, G.M.'s gross profit margin dropped slightly from a year earlier, because of three factors: lower production volume, strengthening of the German mark and more money set aside to pay warranty claims.
Acknowledging that the rest of the year could be difficult for G.M. if the economy does not show more signs of strength, Mr. Stempel said, "G.M. is even more determined to continue reducing structural costs, improving efficiency and quality, and strengthening its product line."

HEADLINE: Bitterness for One Family and Relief for the Other

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
They had lived in limbo for more than a year, two families whose lives had been changed by the racial violence that ripped through Crown Heights in August 1991.
Norman Rosenbaum, an Australian tax lawyer, flew back and forth from Melbourne, urging the authorities to arrest and convict the black youths who set upon his younger brother Yankel, fatally beating and stabbing him. The attack was apparently in retaliation after a car driven by a Hasidic Jew killed a black child. 
 Lemrick Nelson Sr. and his former wife, Valerie Evans, waited to see whether their 17-year-old son, held in Rikers Island for a year, would be freed or convicted of the murder of the Hasidic scholar from Australia.
A Brooklyn courtroom held the answer. And for a moment this week as the jury deliberated, the bereaved brother and the worried father crossed paths in a hallway of the courthouse. The two shook hands, both now at the mercy of the jury.
But yesterday, as Lemrick Nelson Jr. was acquitted, one man's joy became another's searing pain.
 
A Cry of Pain
 Mr. Rosenbaum, who had sat so quietly in the courtroom, hoarsely and angrily vented his rage at the verdict in his heavy Australian accent. The sea of words could not stop.
"The ladies and gentlemen who were chosen to uphold the responsibility of justice have disregarded the blatant and obvious evidence that was placed before them," he cried out in pain, in the twilight outside State Supreme Court. "I believe that this jury -- in the same way that Lemrick Nelson has the blood of Yankel Rosenbaum on his hands and will have it until his dying day -- now the jury has the blood of Yankel Rosenbaum on their hands."
He alluded to the police testimony that had not swayed the jury -- testimony that 29-year-old Yankel, who was lying in a pool of blood awaiting an ambulance, stared at Mr. Nelson and cried: "The red shirt. That's the one. Why did you stab me?"
"My brother looked him in the eye and he identified not the shirt," Mr. Rosenbaum said to the throng of reporters. "He identified the person, the murderer, the person who killed him, and by God, if Mayor Dinkins hasn't heard me before, he better hear now: Jewish blood is not cheap."
As he spoke, Lemrick Nelson Sr., an unemployed baker, and Mrs. Evans were reunited with their son. Each day of the trial they had shared a few moments of whispered conversation with the young man before he was returned to jail.
 
A Good Turkey Dinner
 When the verdict was announced, the elder Mr. Nelson crossed himself. Lemrick Jr. hugged his mother, saying only, "Mommy, Mommy."
In the office of his defense lawyer, Arthur Lewis Jr., as Lemrick Jr. sat free and eating a hamburger, Mrs. Evans said, "It feels good that God freed him." She said she would cook her son a good turkey dinner.
"He's going to need some good soul food," the young man's father added. "As a first thing, he's going to need a good human bath."
Mr. Nelson, an immigrant from Trinidad, said his son would not remain long in New York. He said he would send him to stay with the youth's half-sister in Atlanta, then to Trinidad to finish his schooling, and would join him there soon.
Mr. Nelson had a message for Norman Rosenbaum: "Two days ago I shook his hand and wished him the best of luck. It could have been my brother it happened to. We have to work out a system to have harmony between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights. There's been tension for the past 12 years there."
He added: "I have no hatred against him. I feel bad about his brother."
But for Norman Rosenbaum, the ordeal was far from over. For one year he had crisscrossed continents, returning to New York again and again to demand justice. He spoke at rallies, denouncing the city's "pathetic leadership." He called for a Federal investigation.
Yesterday, dressed in the traditional dark suit and hat of the Hasidic Jew, he was left calling for justice once more. "You had a pogrom on your hands," he said. "My brother died. You could have died."
Behind him a crowd of supporters chanted, "Jewish blood is not cheap!"

HEADLINE: Nations Helping Ex-Soviet Lands Switch Systems

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The nations providing emergency aid to the former Soviet republics have agreed at a conference here to dismantle the year-old system for funneling billions of dollars to those newly independent countries and replace it with a process that would still offer large amounts of aid but would apply more pressure on the countries to open and reform their stagnating economies.
While the decision is intended to transform what had been an ad hoc process into a more permanent and efficient one, it also sends a strong message to political leaders in Moscow and the other capitals that the assistance they receive from the West could be jeopardized if they do not move faster to build market economies, officials here said. 
 The purpose of this conference was organizational rather than to provide a forum to pledge new funds for the former Soviet states. But the United States and Japan did announce new programs. The Japanese said they would provide an additional $100 million in food and other humanitarian assistance and the United States announced that it would provide $100 million in corn. Both countries said their aim was to insure that the people of the new states were adquately fed through the coming winter.
Delegates to the conference were united in calling this the last meeting under the old aid-coordination system, which was begun in January in Washington, and the first in a new regime. It will have two immediate effects.
 
Bleakness Gives Impetus
 Instead of being organized by sectors, like humanitarian assistance, technical assistance and energy aid, the new process will be broken down by country. And that means that Russia and the other new states will be treated much like third-world nations are treated by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The Russians had been resisting that approach until now. But what seems to have given impetus to the new phase is the bleakness of the economic situation in Russia and the other states.
In a report to the conference, which includes the United States, the European Community, Japan and more than 50 other countries here to observe the proceedings, the I.M.F., World Bank and other organizations offered a sobering analysis of the problems in Russia and the 14 other former Soviet republics.
Oil production has declined 30 percent over the last four years, they said. Grain production, while up this year from 1991, is still below average levels in the preceding five years. Inflation is rising at more than 20 percent a month.
The I.M.F. said today that it estimates Russia will need $22 billion of external loans and aid to pay its debts and meet its other financial needs next year. That calculation rests on the assumption that Russia meets its targets for reining in its budget deficit and slows the growth of its money supply, two things it has failed to do so far.
That means the number could be far larger. But another aim of the conference is to push ahead with programs that will make the newly independent states more self-sufficient. Most delegates said that was the heart of what is called technical assistance.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Independent;
Campaign Stalled, Perot Team Tries to Fix It, Fast

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Acknowledging that the Ross Perot's rise in the polls has stalled, his aides tried today to defuse two issues that they fear have slowed his momentum: the charge that he is trying to buy the election, and his unsubstantiated assertions that the Bush campaign planned to disrupt his daughter's wedding and to wiretap his business telephones.
The Perot campaign has developed different strategies for dealing with the two issues. Aides are confronting the first with claims that President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton have actually outspent Mr. Perot. They are confronting the second with silence. 
 "I think the realization was made yesterday or the day before that the attention on the nonissues, the character assassination, was really playing into the hands of the other two candidates," Clayton Mulford, the campaign's general counsel, said today. "We need to get back to our message."
 
'The Recession is Here'
 Mr. Perot hit hard on that message during an appearance on "Larry King Live" tonight, asserting that, contrary to Mr. Bush's claims, the recession has not ended.
"Oh, give me a break, Larry," Mr. Perot said when asked by his host if the recession was over. "The recession's not over. The recession is here. The recession is going to stay here because of deficit spending and competition for money."
Mr. Perot went on to say that "everybody out there except the White House knows the recession is here. And if you lived in that insulated bubble they've created for the President, you wouldn't know it either."
According to the classic definition of a recession as two straight quarters of no economic growth, the recession ended last year. The nation has had six straight quarters of economic growth, but because the recovery has been so sluggish, many people feel the nation is still mired in a recession.
In an interview taped with David Frost on Wednesday that is scheduled to air Friday night, Mr. Perot asserted that he would "hate being a Cabinet member," refused to rule out a 1996 Presidential race, and seconded the assertion of his running mate, Adm. James B. Stockdale, that anti-war protests had prolonged the Vietnam War.
Mr. Perot also repeated his charges that he has been redefined by political opponents. "I'm not paranoid," he said, rejecting the word used by Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. "You will never find the word 'paranoid' used once in all of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of words written about me before this started."
John Florescu, the executive producer of the Frost show, said today that Mr. Perot had become "testy" when Mr. Frost had asked him about his July withdrawal from the race and about his allegations of Republican dirty tricks. At one point, Mr. Florescu said, Mr. Perot asked that the cameras be turned off, and they were. "I think he just wanted to collect his thoughts," Mr. Florescu said. "He was annoyed."
 
Sliding in the Polls
 At a press briefing Mr. Mulford agreed with a reporter's suggestion that public opinion polls suggest that the air seems to be leaking out of Mr. Perot's campaign, and he attributed that development to critical stories about the independent that were "planted" by his opponents. Mr. Mulford produced no evidence to support that assertion.
A tracking poll conducted by Gallup for USA Today and CNN that will be released Friday indicates that 16 percent of those surveyed backed Mr. Perot. Last week a similar poll gave Mr. Perot the support of 20 percent of those surveyed. Similarly, a tracking poll by ABC News today showed Mr. Perot at 16 percent, a five-point drop from a similar poll released on Monday that had the Texan at 21 percent.
A tracking poll is a survey in which fresh samples of voters are interviewed daily and the combined results of two or three days of interviews are released.
Public opinion surveys are not the only indicators that the Perot boomlet may have peaked. Figures compiled by Nielsen Media Research News indicate that the number of people tuning into Mr. Perot's 30-minute and 60-minute "infomercial" ads has dropped sharply. About 16.5 million viewers watched his first one on Oct. 6. Since then none of the other half-hour programs have come close to attracting that many viewers. On Monday, 12 million viewers -- a respectable showing, but a 25 percent decrease -- watched at least part of his half-hour ad.
Obviously concerned about their candidate's stall, Mr. Mulford and Sharon Holman, the campaign's press secretary, told reporters today that they would no longer answer questions about Mr. Perot's assertions that Republican operatives had planned to conduct a smear campaign against his daughter or about his involvement in getting the F.B.I. to conduct an undercover sting operation on the chairman of the Bush campaign in Texas.
Meanwhile, seven former Perot volunteers held a news conference in Washington today to accuse Mr. Perot of ordering illegal credit checks on them and of forcing them out of the campaign. They also told stories of high-handed tactics like being pressured to sign "loyalty oaths."
Mr. Perot has admitted investigating some of his volunteers because he suspected wrongdoing. The participants provided documents showing they had been investigated but had no proof that Mr. Perot was directly involved.
 
All or Nothing
 Mr. Perot also continued his running feud with the news media today. The Texan was scheduled to be interviewed today on "Prime Time Live" and on Friday on "20/20". Since both programs are broadcast on ABC, the network's executives decided they might be giving Mr. Perot too much exposure. When they asked which program he would prefer to appear on, Mr. Perot told them that if he could not appear on both, he would appear on neither.
During his interview with Mr. King, Mr. Perot said ABC had appeared to be pushing him to appear on only "Prime Time Live," where host Sam Donaldson would interview him during one of the show's segments.
"I really object to being jerked around because I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican," Mr. Perot told Mr. King. "I'm just a cur dog put on the ballot by the people. I feel that if you invite somebody to do something, you should honor your commitment or at least give them a voice."

HEADLINE: Shirley Journal;
Where Bush's Remarks Hit Too Close to Home

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HIRLEY, Ark., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Linda Burgess at the Hair Fashion Beauty Shop said she didn't "give a rip because it's just politics." Watson I. Smith, a 79-year-old retired teacher, said it struck him as a "tad too mean-spirited."
And Everett Henderson, a farmer who warmed himself with his back to the pot-bellied stove in Privitt's Hardware store, said it reminded him of the "hillbilly put-downs" he and other Arkansans used to hear in the Army. 
 A little more than a week after President Bush spotlighted Arkansas's shortcomings in a Presidential debate and referred to the state as the "lowest of the low," feelings still run strong among many in this town of 354 in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains, where homes seem to hang from the sides of the roads.
Situated 75 miles northwest of Little Rock, Shirley is a place where the appellation "hillbilly" has ceased to be a fighting word and become more of a marketing tool, as in Bea Macke's "hillbilly pizza" at B & G's Bakery. ("It's a deep-dish affair with Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses," she said.) But many heard in the President's words an echo of the old negative stereotypes.
"He didn't use the word 'hillbilly,' but that's what a lot of us thought about when he said that," said Mayor John Clark Jr., a strong supporter of Gov. Bill Clinton, as he stood in the parking lot of Jones Grocery Store, where farmers, retirees and others often gather for morning coffee. "It's like he thinks we all left fresh, barefoot footprints out in the parking lot."
The President's reference to the state as "the lowest of low" as he recounted its meager standing in areas like children's health, teachers' pay, education spending, working conditions and income, reverberated throughout Arkansas, making many people feel as if they had been cast adrift from the rest of the nation. It sent Republican candidates scrambling either to distance themselves from the comments or to try to clarify them as aimed more at policies than people.
But more than anything else, it struck at what Art English, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, called the war between pride and a pervasive "inferiority complex" in the state. Arkansans are aware that they rank low in a number of categories, he and others noted, but also have a sense that they have done much with little and have come a long way in a very short time.
Betsey Wright, the research director of the Clinton campaign whose office prepared detailed responses challenging some of the President's comments, called them more of the effort to "divide us by race, age, gender and income" rather than bring people together.
"Bush doesn't know anything about rural people," said Mr. Smith. "He may be a smart man, but he's a dumb politician for attacking the state and the character of the people here."
The schools in Shirley sit atop a hill that looks down on the valley where the middle fork of the Little Red River flows. The river marked the path of the old Missouri and North Arkansas Rail Road that ran between Joplin and West Helena on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi Delta. Shirley was founded in 1907 as a station along that line carrying timber between the two cities. It is named for the first stationmaster's daughter.
The 46-year-old Mr. Clark remembers the old clapboard schoolhouse that was too cold in winter and sweltering in spring. The building, due to be renovated, sits in stark relief to the sprawling one-story brick buildings of the high school and elementary school. All that came in the last 10 years, he said, when Governor Clinton and his wife, Hillary, "literally forced the state education system to help itself and become better."
Not everyone in town was offended by the President's remarks. Mrs. Macke, the co-owner of B & G's Bakery, said that it was all hot air and that she still intended to vote for Mr. Bush. Jo Reid, Ailene Smith and Alice Wiley, customers at the bakery from nearby Fairfield Bay, a retirement community of 2,500, said that among their neighbors Republicanism runs deeper than Arkansas chauvinism.
Jades Goldman, a native of Shirley, pulled his pick-up truck in front of Privitts today on what was the last day of muzzle-loader deer season, got out and showed off the two-point, white-tailed deer he had shot with his single-shot weapon. The short season is one of the state's refinements for thousands of enthusiasts who like the gradations of skill and purity offered by special times for long-rifle and multi-shot hunting, the muzzle-loader season and the bow-and-arrow hunting season. But Mr. Goldman conceded that he enjoyed deer hunting so much that he would be out there if they had a rock-throwing season as well.
"I'm a George Bush fan and not a Clinton fan," said the 33-year-old. "After all, we are kind of low on the totem pole, and I don't think he meant anything bad or derogatory."
But others like Tom Kimmons, who runs a local development company, said President Bush's comments betrayed a certain condescension to rural people. "He made a fundamental error," said Mr. Kimmons. "He separated and excluded us and others like us. But we're Americans too."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Suspends Baltic Troop Pullout

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 29

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree today suspending the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, asserting a "profound concern" over the treatment of Russians there.
The decree was certain to provoke a storm in Estonian, Latvia and Lithuania, whose governments view the continuing presence of Russian troops on their territories as the greatest single threat to their security and independence. 
 The decree came nine days after the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it was suspending the withdrawal because there was nowhere for the troops to go. The announcement said that 24,000 more troops had been scheduled to leave the region by the end of the year, but that thousands of officers were already homeless in Russia and that forces were still returning from Eastern Europe.
Various numbers have been given for the size of the force in the Baltics. About 130,000 Soviet troops were stationed in the Baltic lands before they gained independence, and the United States State Department has said about 40 percent have been pulled out.
 
Rights Abuses Charged
 In the announcement of Mr. Yeltsin's decree, however, no mention was made of the housing problem. It said rather that troop withdrawal would be resumed after Russia signed agreements with the three Baltic states that included protection for the servicemen and met Mr. Yeltsin's "profound concern over numerous infringements of rights of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries."
The announcement said Mr. Yeltsin also linked this issue to "the implementation of economic agreements," suggesting that he might consider withholding fuel and other materials from the Baltic states, which are struggling with dire economic problems.
It was not clear what immediately prompted Mr. Yeltsin's decree, or why he included all three Baltic states. While Moscow has locked horns with Latvia and Estonia, both of which have large Russian minorities, it has agreed to pull all troops out of Lithuania by September 1993.
At home, the President is locked in a bitter power struggle with nationalist and Communist forces, and one possibility was that he wanted to deny them one inflammatory issue while combating them on others.
 
Voting Rights Limited
 Russians have seethed over laws passed in Latvia and Estonia limiting voting rights to residents who lived there before 1940 and their descendants. That in effect excluded many of the resident Russians, especially those in the military or military industries. An exception is made for Russians who are literate in the local language.
The Russian Parliament has passed stern resolutions threatening sanctions against the two Baltic states and has harangued the Government for purportedly doing nothing for the expatriate Russians.
At the same time, the absence of housing for returning officers has become a serious problem, one Mr. Yeltsin obviously did not want to worsen at a time of political instability.
There was the possibility that Mr. Yeltsin was reaching for a moral justification for a decision that had already been made by the military, or to which there was no alternative.
In August, Russia proposed agreements to the Baltic states offering to withdraw troops by 1994 on the condition that the three republics guarantee the rights of resident Russians and soldiers and abandon territorial claims on Russia. The agreements have been rejected by Latvia and Estonia, which argue that Russia is raising the human-rights issues only to sustain its hegemony over the region and to delay withdrawing its forces.
 
Hoping to Postpone Congress
 On the domestic front, Mr. Yeltsin said in a published interview that he still hoped to postpone the convening of a full Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the highest legislative body in Russia, which is now scheduled for Dec. 1.
"The struggle to postpone the Congress is not over yet," he said in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty.
Parliament's refusal to delay the session has fueled one of the most severe confrontations yet between Mr. Yeltsin and an increasingly aggressive bloc of hard-line deputies hostile to his Government and his reforms.
Mr. Yeltsin also reaffirmed his determination to keep Yegor T. Gaidar, the acting Prime Minister and chief architect of reforms, in office. Forcing him to step down, he said, "would be tantamount to derailing the reform."
In a war of nerves over the last week, the leadership of Parliament ordered guards from its 5,000-man security force to take up posts outside Izvestia, the independent newspaper that Ruslan Khasbulatov, the ambitious Speaker, has claimed for Parliament.
 
Force Said to Ignore Order
 Mr. Yeltsin countered by declaring the security force illegal. But at last report commanders of the force were ignoring his order.
The President also issued a decree banning the newly proclaimed National Salvation Front, a coalition of Communist and nationalist hard-liners that had called for his resignation.
But leaders of the front called a news conference today saying the ban was unconstitutional and accusing Mr. Yeltsin of "an open war against the people."
Adding to the air of intrigue was the fact that Mr. Khasbulatov spent the week in a hospital, reportedly suffering from hypertension. He was released today.
Mr. Khasbulatov was hospitalized Oct. 21 after being helped out of the Parliament chamber. Some deputies accused him of being drunk.

Digital to Close Two Plants

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation announced today that it was closing its manufacturing plants here and in Burlington, Vt., putting about 670 employees out of work.
The Springfield plant employs about 320 people and the Vermont operation about 350. Officials of the struggling computer maker said they expected the work force to be phased out and the plants shut by April. 
 "The movement of computing power to semiconductors; the shift in demand to high-volume, low-margin commodity products, and the decreased demand caused by a soft worldwide economy has left Digital with excess worldwide manufacturing capacity," said Edward B. McDonough, vice president for manufacturing and logistics.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Up Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose slightly in mid-October after falling for three straight weeks, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said 375,000 workers lined up at state unemployment offices to file claims for jobless benefits during the week ended Oct. 17. That compared with 367,000 applications filed the week before. 
 The four-week moving average for claims -- viewed as a more accurate indicator of longer-term labor conditions -- fell for the third straight week, to its lowest level in two years.
The Administration was quick to draw encouragement from the longer-term trend, as President Bush strives to overtake Gov. Bill Clinton with five days left until the election.
"This indicates a stronger labor market and is good news for America's working men and women," Labor Secretary Lynn Martin said.
 
Economists Restrained
Economists were more restrained, although they agreed that the worst might be over for the job market. "It's not death and destruction any more," said Brian Jones, an economist for Salomon Brothers in New York.
While layoffs may be moderating, the economy is growing so slowly that it is not creating many new jobs, said Robert Falconer, senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage firm.
In a separate report today, the Conference Board, a New York-based business research organization, said that help-wanted advertisements in 51 newspapers throughout the country fell in September from August to a level below that of a year earlier.
Still, analysts said they expected the job market to improve slowly in 1993 as the economy gathers steam.
"I suspect we will see some gradual movement there as we go into 1993, but it is not going to be dramatic," John LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said.
The Labor Department said 15 states reported that initial jobless claims fell by more than 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 17, led by California, Pennsylvania and New York. Only Delaware saw jobless claims rise by more than 1,000, a result of layoffs in the automobile industry.
Economists said the number of workers seeking jobless benefits may have been understated because of the Federal emergency unemployment compensation program. The Labor Department said 21,418 workers filed for Federal benefits in the latest week, compared with 23,340 the week before.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
For the Most Negative Ads, Turn On the Nearest Radio

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
It's the Great Invisible Attack campaign.
Heading into the final days of the Presidential race, the Bush campaign is running a series of highly critical, carefully aimed radio advertisements aimed at undermining Gov. Bill Clinton's support in crucial states. Over the weekend, when it will be almost impossible for the Clinton campaign to respond, the Bush campaign is planning to put more attack advertisements on the radio. 
 Far cheaper than television, radio advertising is also widely regarded as less effective. But radio, which receives far less press scrutiny than television, is often the medium that candidates use to deliver their most scathing -- and sometimes misleading -- critiques.
As the campaign moves toward the close, all three leading candidates -- Mr. Clinton, President Bush and Ross Perot -- are planning heavy advertising blitzes over the weekend on both radio and television.
On television, both the Clinton and the Bush campaigns are expected to continue broadcasting a mixture of positive and negative messages. But on radio the message is likely to be unremittingly downbeat.
 
'Hard-Hitting Attacks'
 "Radio is a great medium for delivering hard-hitting attacks," said Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University who studies campaign advertising. "It's a risk-free type of advertising. You can be incredibly obnoxious without being blamed for it."
Many of the television advertisements that have been broadcast during the Presidential campaign have been based on information that could, at best, be called questionable. But it is on the radio that the truth has been treated the most casually.
Several of the Bush campaign's radio commercials are variations on a single theme -- that Mr. Clinton will impose a tax on energy, a "carbon tax," that would drive up utility bills and cost jobs.
"He's said he's for change, but look at the change he's really talking about," says an advertisement running in states like Maine, Michigan, Maryland and Illinois. "An independent analysis says that Clinton-Gore radical environmental taxes will drive up our annual utility bills over $350."
 
Great Leap in Logic
 Mr. Clinton has not proposed a carbon tax, and aides to the Governor call the advertisements grossly misleading. But the Bush campaign says the commercials are justified because Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore, advocates such a tax in his best-selling book, "Earth in the Balance." Also, they note, the Governor himself has said that the nation's carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced, something, Bush aides insist in a leap of logic, that can be achieved only with a carbon tax.
"Governor Clinton has very specifically said he'll entertain the idea," said Bill Lacy, a senior political adviser to the Bush campaign.
Acting on the belief that any attack that goes unanswered is taken by voters to be true, the Clinton campaign has tried to reply to each of the Bush campaign's radio commercials within 24 hours. In their responses, the Clinton campaign has tried to inoculate the Governor against future attacks as well by planting doubts about the President's credibility.
"It's the same old story: George Bush will say anything to get elected," says a Clinton radio commercial that, with minor adjustments, is running in several states. "He said so himself."
The commercial ends, "So the next time you hear a George Bush ad, ask yourself, isn't it time for a President who will fight for Americans' jobs?'
The most recent Bush radio advertisement, which is running in New Jersey as well as in several other states, purports to "examine the facts" about Governor Clinton's record on child welfare and on crime.
"If he can't care for children and keep the public safety in his own state," the commercial asks, "how can he expect a promotion?"
The Clinton campaign has responded with an advertisement that says: "George Bush is at it again. Because he can't run on his own record, Bush is resorting to negative attacks against Bill Clinton."
Mr. Perot's radio advertisements do not mention either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton by name. Instead they offer the message of a pox on both your houses.
"Now here's an extreme case that just shows you how goofy things are in Washington," Mr. Perot says in one of his advertisements. "In order to find a Christmas tree, the White House decided it was necessary to send two people all the way to Oregon to look at the tree at taxpayers' expense. They are in the piggy bank that you and I created with our taxpayer money. We need to get 'em out."
 
New Bush Ads Planned
 Yesterday, aides to the President would not say what new radio advertisements were planned for the weekend. But when a reporter asked whether such commercials could be expected, Sig Rogich, who is coordinating the President's media campaign, said simply, "Yup." And because it is so difficult to respond to new advertisements over a weekend, when station offices are closed, the Clinton campaign is especially concerned about any last-minute attacks.
"Local radio is where the vilification and fear-mongering takes place," one adviser to Mr. Clinton said. The Clinton campaign has prepared several new radio advertisements, which aides to the Governor say they will broadcast, depending on what the Bush campaign has on radio.
To close its advertising campaign, the Clinton team is planning to air at least two new television commercials before Election Day. One is expected to continue the campaign's attacks on the President's economic record, while the other is supposed to be more positive, featuring either scenes from Clinton campaign bus trips or Mr. Clinton making a direct appeal to voters.
Yesterday the Clinton campaign began broadcasting a new television advertisement in Michigan and Ohio that describes how Japanese mini-vans that were labeled cars avoided import duties.
For its part, the Bush campaign has begun broadcasting two new television commercials, one that features spooky black and white landscapes and attacks Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas and another that touts Mr. Bush's qualifications for the nation's highest office.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Almanac;
Countdown to Election Day

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH
Buoyed by several new polls, President Bush made a foray into an old source of Democratic support, suburban Macomb County in Michigan, to sound the alarms about high taxes and low character that he hopes will drive voters away from Gov. Bill Clinton. Stripping his message to its essence, Mr. Bush told a crowd of 10,000 people that Mr. Clinton had "given up on reducing the deficit." Arms flailing, he denounced Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore, as an environmental extremist who is "crazy, way out, far out, man." He said of the Democrats, "They feel it slipping away from them."
 
BILL CLINTON
Governor Clinton dropped his plans to stick to a lofty message about the issues and leveled harsh words at President Bush in three toss-up states, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey. While he sought to strike a sober tone in speeches on the economy and on AIDS research, Mr. Clinton cast his policy discussion in terms of what Mr. Bush lacks. And although he still leads in most polls, Mr. Clinton said for the first time in weeks that he considered himself an "underdog" in the race. "The American people are going to have to think a long time before they want four more years of this," Mr. Clinton said of the Bush Administration.
 
ROSS PEROT
Mr. Perot's aides tried to defuse two issues that they fear have slowed his momentum: the accusation that he is trying to buy the election and his unsubstantiated assertions that the Bush campaign planned to disrupt his daughter's wedding. Aides are confronting the first issue by saying that his two rivals have actually outspent him. They are confronting the second issue with silence. In an interview with David Frost, Mr. Perot testily rejected criticism leveled by a Bush spokesman. "I'm not paranoid," Mr. Perot said. He also said he would hate being a Cabinet member, a possibility held out by the Clinton campaign.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Pulls for Jobs Bond Act as Regan Pushes Objections

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been traveling feverishly around New York State for the last few days, urging people to vote for his proposed $800 million jobs bond act. And practically wherever he goes, there also goes State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, nipping at his heels.
Mr. Regan, a Republican, is working just as hard to defeat the bond act as Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is to get it passed, saying that he would support it only if the Legislature passed measures giving voters more authority over borrowing, as well. "It is unaffordable in the current environment in which we finance ourselves," he said in Manhattan yesterday. 
 Under the bond act, Proposal 1 on the ballot in next week's election, the state would borrow $800 million to invest in a slew of infrastructure projects, like roads and sewers, with the goal of putting people to work and attracting businesses to the state. Governor Cuomo estimates that it would create 35,000 immediate jobs and eventually lead to 122,000 permanent ones.
Introduced by the Governor in his State of the State Message last January and finally passed after a bitter fight in the Legislature over the summer, the bond act is one of the Governor's major legislative achievements this year, and it would be a big blow to him if it were defeated. His previous bond proposal, a $1.975 billion environmental bond act, was turned down by the voters in 1990.
But convincing the voters of the necessity of borrowing money at a time when they are especially leery of excessive spending is no easy feat. The Governor's problem has been compounded by the opposition of Mr. Regan and of conservative groups like Change-NY and by a prohibition against using state money to promote the bond act.
Even so, the Cuomo administration has spent more than $150,000 on materials on the bond act, saying they are educational, not promotional. It has printed almost four million informational brochures and palm cards, which it is doling out at Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway toll plazas, government buildings and the like.
And various agencies, including the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Office of Hispanic Affairs and the Office for the Aging, have sent out letters that describe the bond act but stop short of asking for votes.
The Governor, who has made a number of trips on behalf of the bond act, said he is doing the best he can within the confines of the law.
"We're living within the letter of the law, even if the law seems irrationally inappropriate," he said at a rally with unemployed construction workers in Nassau County on Wednesday. "My counsel's office instructs me that I'm free to advocate with all the vigor I possess."
For his part, Mr. Regan has made a number of appearances and plans another swing through upstate New York, urging the public all the while to reject the proposal.

HEADLINE: Beijing Journal;
At Work Where the Cold War's Ice Still Lingers

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 29

 BODY:
A fault line rarely makes a cozy nesting spot, but for more than a year J. Stapleton Roy has occupied precisely the spot where the American and Chinese tectonic plates come grinding together.
As Ambassador to China, Mr. Roy is periodically scolded by the Foreign Ministry here because of disputes related to human rights, arms sales and other concerns. Chinese police guard the embassy, intimidating some Chinese from approaching, and security agents still sometimes follow American diplomats. 
 Diplomatic homes and most parts of the embassy are assumed to be bugged, while Chinese-dug tunnels run somewhere deep beneath the fenced embassy compound. A mysterious windowless building, said to be the C.I.A. station and communications center, looms over the embassy backyard as a constant reminder of the security concerns at the last American embassy in a hard-line Communist country.
Mr. Roy, a 57-year-old career diplomat and fluent Chinese speaker who was born in China as the son of missionaries, seems to relish his posting despite the official pressures.
 
Cycle Rides in the Capital
 Each Sunday he escapes from the world of neckties and diplomacy by cycling through the back alleys of the capital, chatting informally with those Chinese he meets. While Mr. Roy owns a locally made Flying Pigeon, he mostly uses his 21-speed Peugeot to whizz by Beijing cyclists on their single-speed Phoenixes and Golden Lions.
But while Mr. Roy has proved adept at managing relations with China, these days the entire embassy seems a bit disquieted about a challenge from the other side of the Pacific: the prospect of Gov. Bill Clinton becoming President and adopting a tougher policy toward China.
"I have no expectations," Mr. Roy said when asked what would happen to him if Mr. Clinton wins. "I'm a career diplomat, and you serve at the pleasure of the President."
The problem is that ever since Chinese troops opened fire on pro-democracy protesters near Tiananmen Square in June 1989, United States policy toward China has been highly politicized. Mr. Roy and other embassy officials have been effective spokesmen for President Bush's policy of constructive engagement, rejecting economic sanctions as counterproductive, but if Mr. Clinton wins the embassy may have to switch course.
"There's no question that one of the major consequences of Tiananmen was the shattering of the bipartisan consensus in favor of improved relations with China," Mr. Roy acknowledged in a recent interview in his home, over coffee and brownies prepared by his household's six-member staff. But he also suggested that some consensus remained at a deeper level.
"While there have been disagreements on specific questions about how we should advance our human rights and other objectives in China, I don't think there has been a shattering of the understanding that China remains an important country."
Mr. Roy arrived in Beijing as Ambassador only in the summer of 1991, but in some ways he seems to have spent his life preparing for the post. His first memories are of Japanese bombs exploding near his home in Sichuan Province. And he grew up speaking the Sichuan dialect of Chinese with his playmates.
After passing most of his boyhood in China, Mr. Roy and his family were among the few Americans who remained in China for the first year after the Communist revolution in 1949. In the fervor after "liberation," Mr. Roy learned to sing a few Chinese songs, like "The East Is Red" and "We Workers Are Strong," that are not normally part of a diplomat's repertory.
The United States Embassy, with 161 American officers and staff members, is the largest foreign mission in China. Other Western diplomats and resident foreigners praise it for having an excellent staff and for cultivating specialists on various topics and regions. But they also sometimes criticize it for its rapid turnover of diplomats -- many stay only two years -- and for persisting in a cold war-style disapproval of close friendships with Chinese.
In a city where Chinese are far more likely to talk openly over a beer or a game of mah-jongg than in a formal meeting, diplomats from Australia and several European countries have a reputation for cultivating warmer friendships with Chinese than do the Americans. Indeed, at least two European diplomats are having romantic relationships with Chinese women, while American diplomats rarely shed even their neckties during meetings with Chinese.
"We encourage our officers to go out and make as broad contacts as they can," Mr. Roy said. "But because this is a Communist country, we discourage intimacy."
A reminder of the risks came in 1988, when an American diplomat fell in love with a Chinese women. State Security agents reportedly burst in with cameras when they were in bed together, and tried to blackmail the American into spying for them. He immediately reported the incident to the embassy's security officer and was quietly whisked out of China the next day.
For all the lingering tensions, there is far less hostility in the air now than in the summer of 1989, shortly after the Tiananmen crackdown. The previous Ambassador, James R. Lilley, was then hiding a famous dissident, Fang Lizhi, in the embassy's medical clinic, and Chinese troops with submachine guns patrolled outside the compound. Fearful that the troops would invade the compound, the embassy destroyed its confidential files to avoid the risk of their falling into Chinese hands.
Almost overnight the atmosphere in the embassy changed from considerable optimism to deep pessimism about China. Those diplomats who were present during the killings have long since left China, however, and now the mood has swung back to one of relative optimism.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Youth Vote;
DEMOCRATS COURT YOUNGEST VOTERS

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEAUMONT, Tex., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Al Gore did not do much to draw wild applause. All he said was: "George Bush is out of time. Bill Clinton and Al Gore will be automatic for the people."
Michael Stipe, lead singer of the rock group R.E.M., had just given the Democratic ticket a passionate endorsement before a crowd of several thousand young people on the University of Georgia campus in Athens, and Mr. Gore's response was a wordplay on the title songs of the band's two hit albums. 
 The event was carefully scripted because this year the Democrats are mounting a broad, coordinated effort to win over a major voting block that has solidly backed Republicans in the last three Presidential elections and that has shown strong support this year for Ross Perot, the independent candidate.
Many voters born in the 1960's and 70's grew up with Ronald Reagan as their political hero. But now the Democrats, with their baby-boomer ticket and message of generational change, believe they have a chance to engineer a shift that could make the difference in an increasingly close election.
 
Making the Campus Circuit
 Last week, on the same day Senator Gore spoke outside the University of Georgia's student union, his wife, Tipper, Governor Clinton and his wife, Hillary, each made separate appearances on other college campuses around the country, and that kind of scheduling is not unusual. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have each appeared on MTV's political news program "Choose or Loose." President Bush, who has refused past invitations from the program and once dismissed it as a show for "teenyboppers," agreed today to appear on it Sunday.
In the last 48 hours alone, Mr. Gore has campaigned on campuses in Wisconsin, New Mexico and here in Beaumont, where he spoke today at Lamar University.
"The Democrats have not done anything like this to capture the youth vote since 1972, and meanwhile the Republicans seem to be taking it for granted," said Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, a research institute in Washington.
The effort appears to be paying off. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last week, Mr. Clinton had the support of 40 percent of the probable voters who are 19 to 30 years old; Mr. Bush had 30 percent. The margin between the two candidates was only five percentage points when respondents of all ages were tallied.
Mr. Perot had the support of 23 percent of the young voters in the poll, his strongest showing in any age group; his overall support was 15 percent. The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,854 adults nationwide, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
In the 1988 election, more than seven million voters between the ages of 18 and 24, or 55 percent, picked Mr. Bush, while 45 percent backed the Democratic candidate, Michael S. Dukakis. This year, Mr. Gans said, they may support the Democrats with the strength normally seen among black, Jewish and Hispanic voters.
On the level of political imagery, the Democrats' appeal is as simple as their ages: Mr. Clinton is 46 years old and Mr. Gore, his running mate, is 44. After Mr. Gore spoke at the University of Georgia, some students were asked by a reporter what they thought of Mr. Gore. One shouted, "At least he can relate to us!" Another added, "Bush reminds me of my parents."
Vice President Dan Quayle, who is 45, appears to hold little attraction for young Americans: those in the poll gave him a favorability ratings of 22 percent, lower than that for any top candidate except Mr. Perot's running mate, James B. Stockdale.
The generational endorsement of the Democratic ticket, of course, is not automatic. Tripp Greeson, a 19-year-old from Atlanta, said of Mr. Gore: "It doesn't matter much that he's young or that Michael Stipe likes him. It wouldn't matter at all if he wasn't out there talking about things we care about."
One of the things the Democrats are talking about, and the young care about, is the environment. In the Times/CBS News Poll, young voters gave Senator Gore, who has made the environment a matter of personal advocacy, favorability ratings of 35 percent, the highest of any top candidate.
For young audiences, the Democrats sauce their economic message with a touch of insurgency reminiscent of the George McGovern campaign of 1972, the last Democratic effort to galvanize young voters.
"All over the world we have seen young people lead the way to change," is the way Mr. Gore begins a passage inserted in his standard speech when he appears before young voters.
He brings them to their feet by concluding: "Now it's our turn in the United States of America to have change. Young people in the United States are saying: 'Trickle-down economics is really stupid! Let's get rid of it!' "

HEADLINE: Bush Remains the Favorite Among Executives

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
President Bush might have been trailing Gov. Bill Clinton in the opinion polls since midsummer, but like most Republicans in past campaigns for the White House, the President seems to have held a commanding lead among American business executives.
A Fortune magazine poll of 184 chief executives taken in July after Ross Perot withdrew from the race showed President Bush favored by 85 percent, with just 9 percent for Governor Clinton. Such samplings have limited statistical validity, but a fax poll conducted last week of 219 small-business owners by Ernst & Young, the accounting concern, showed that 51 percent favored President Bush, with 18 percent for Mr. Perot and 15 percent for Governor Clinton. 
 W. R. Timken Jr., chairman of the Timken Company, a manufacturer of roller bearings and specialty steel products based in Canton, Ohio, said business leaders in Ohio were "overwhelmingly for President Bush." Mr. Timken is the state's fund-raising chairman for the President, and he accompanied Mr. Bush Wednesday on his speaking tour of Ohio.
Many executives and small-business owners interviewed this week said the President was the candidate most likely to follow a set of policies that would keep taxes and interest rates in check, restrain the Federal debt and the surge in health-care costs, and nudge the economy toward a broader recovery.
 
Undersold Accomplishments
 Yet several said they were concerned that the President had lost precious time by underselling to voters many of his first-term accomplishments, as well as his plans to put more focus on domestic problems, especially the economy, during his second term.
Gilbert F. Amelio, president and chief executive of the National Semiconductor Corporation, in Santa Clara, Calif., said he was surprised in the last few months to discover how much work White House officials had completed on high-technology policy plans for a second term.
While some Republican executives, like John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc., and John A. Young, chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company, are backing Governor Clinton because of his promise to promote America's technology sector, Dr. Amelio is part of the San Francisco Bay Area technology leadership that remains behind Mr. Bush.
"I was surprised that the President had not seized the opportunity to counteract more rapidly what Clinton was doing" in Silicon Valley, he said.
At an Oct. 15 news conference in Santa Clara organized by the Bush-Quayle '92 campaign, Dr. Amelio said the Bush trade policies had helped American chip makers double their share of Japanese chip orders, to 16 percent, adding 25,000 jobs in the United States economy since 1986.
Likewise, Paul H. O'Neill, chairman and chief executive of Alcoa Inc. in Pittsburgh and head of a White House advisory group on education, said the President had not received or asked for much praise for setting ambitious education goals and stirring action at local levels.
"It was an historic achievement, but nobody's paying any attention to it," said Mr. O'Neill, a senior White House budget official in the Nixon and Ford Administrations. "Once in a while, one hears Bill Clinton say how he contributed and that President Bush gave him credit for it, which is true. But it was all under the President's leadership. There is a lot going on, but he has not done a good job of articulating the importance of what he accomplished."
Few pro-Bush executives fix much blame on Mr. Bush for the weak economy, since he entered the White House in 1989. Robert W. Galvin, chairman of the executive committee and former chief executive of Motorola Inc., said that the heavy debt loads and the real-estate bust that followed the boom times of the 1980's were created by business leaders themselves rather than by tax policy or the deregulation of banks that stimulated lending.
 
'Dumb Moves' of the 80's
 "Unless a President were a dictator, and we don't want that in this society, he couldn't have stopped my peers from making all the dumb moves in the 80's that sucked the strength out of the economy," Mr. Galvin said. "Frankly, I don't think Presidents have all that much to do with how an economy goes."
David Packard, the 80-year-old billionaire and chairman of Hewlett-Packard, agrees that the President's power is limited in the face of an increasingly global economy. "President Bush has really been a victim of the condition of the world economy," he said in an interview. "That makes it difficult in this election because not many people understand that.
"My view is that the President's experience, his relationships with other countries is very important. The proposals Clinton is making are not realistic. He probably won't be able to do what he plans to do, and things may become even worse if he does. Perot is pretty much out of it."
Several executives said their hopes for an improving economy were buoyed Wednesday by the Commerce Department report that the economy grew at a rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter.
"We asked American corporations to become leaner and more competitive, and I think they've done that," said Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of the Paine Webber Group. "We asked American individuals to go from being spenders to savers. And they are doing that."
Both trends, he said, would eventually make the economy stronger, but have dampened growth during the Bush Administration by adding to unemployment and slowing consumer spending. If taxes were raised under a Clinton Presidency, Mr. Marron added, "it would be a further drag on the economy."
Betty Hardle, majority owner and chief executive of Good Value Homes, which builds 200 to 300 homes a year in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, said she would vote again for the President, though reluctantly.
"I had hoped that he would be a more forceful leader somehow," she said. "The No. 1 issue is building an economy that creates jobs. I'm tempted to say that a little Government spending would help. But over a longer picture, I'm not so sure."
 
Small-Business Incentives
 James I. Milner, owner of an electrical construction and engineering company in Lexington, Ky., said President Bush had the best position of the three candidates for improving tax incentives for small businesses like his, with its 225 employees.
Many of these Bush supporters said the Democratic majority in Congress and the Republican White House were both to blame for the heavy spending that have helped cause the Federal debt to more than double, to nearly $4 trillion, since President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981.
Mr. O'Neill struck a common theme, saying that because President Bush could not be elected for a third term in 1996, he would be free to act aggressively to limit spending. He added that he hoped the President would disregard conventional Washington advice and talk frankly about the perils of the mounting Federal debt.
"I'd like to believe that the American people are willing to do something serious about the deficit," Mr. O'Neill said. "That means reducing their time at the pig trough, or ponying up some more taxes. The world is picking up its pace, and we're going to lose ground unless we solve some of these problems."
 
Policies and Jobs
 A study of economic policies advocated by the Bush, Clinton and Perot camps sponsored by the National Center for Policy Analysis concluded last week that the Bush plan would add 602,000 jobs to the domestic economy by 1998 as low interest rates stimulate economic growth.
The Clinton program would cut nearly a million jobs during the same period; 335,000 jobs would be lost under the Perot plan, said the privately financed research center. The organization, based in Dallas, studies Federal tax policies.
The center added that economic proposals embraced by Edmund P. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California and an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for President this year, would have created 2.4 million jobs -- the most of any plan offered by this year's candidates.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Almanac;
A Narrow Lead

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton continues to lead President Bush, while the increased support Ross Perot received after the final debate appears to have faded slightly, according to four new polls.
When the polls are averaged, Mr. Clinton has 43 percent of the support, Mr. Bush 36 percent and Mr. Perot 16 percent. 
 Most national polls are being reported in terms of "likely voters" in an attempt to reflect the views of the 50 percent of adults who actually turn out on election day rather than the 75 percent who say they are registered.
The Harris Poll uses three questions to identify likely voters. In a Harris Poll conducted last week, views of likely voters did not substantially differ from those of all registered voters.
The Gallup Organization uses eight questions. In a CNN/USA Today poll conducted by Gallup and and made public yesterday Mr. Clinton's advantage over Mr. Bush was 3 percentage points among likely voters but seven points among all registered voters. The poll was conducted with 2,000 registered voters.
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken with 553 likely voters showed Mr. Clinton's advantage at five points.
An ABC News tracking poll of 903 likely voters placed Mr. Clinton's lead at nine points. Tracking polls interview new samples each day and report combined results two or more days at a time.
A ten point advantage for Mr. Clinton was measured in a Washington Post Poll of 1,837 likely voters.
The margins of sampling error range from three percentage points on the larger samples to plus or minus five percentage points on the smaller samples.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Vice President;
In the Final Push, Quayle Rallies Turn Into a Blur

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUGUSTA, Ga., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle was heading into the home stretch of his standard speech at a Bush-Quayle rally here when he threw in his usual charge that Gov. Bill Clinton "waffles" on issues.
To the dismay of Secret Service agents, a dozen frozen waffles flew up from the audience. Mr. Quayle caught one and the friendly crowd roared its approval. The waffles were a rare unscripted moment for the Vice President in his campaign for re-election, although they have now become a signature part of an event when he mentions waffling by the opposition. 
 In the homestretch of the campaign the days with Mr. Quayle have become a blur of sameness: rope-line greetings, handshakes, local interviews, rallies and the oxymoronic "scheduled impromptus" with voters in shopping malls and restaurants.
"Why am I here?" Mr. Quayle has been known to ask his aides as Air Force Two touches down in yet another state. "Is this one it would be nice to win, or one we must win?"
 
A 'Must Win' State
 Georgia is in the "must win" category, so Mr. Quayle, fueled by the red licorice he snacks on, was here for the second of three visits scheduled before Election Day. At the Savannah Christian Preparatory School he rallied an audience of mostly students who are too young to vote.
"Is this crowd fired up?" Mr. Quayle asked. "Is this crowd pumped up? Is Savannah going for George Bush? Is the South going for George Bush? Is America going for George Bush?"
The students, hoisting red, white and blue Bush-Quayle campaign signs, yelled back in affirmation.
Campaigns take on a sameness in their final days, a numbing repetition of speeches and events. For a rally like the rally here at the Augusta Mall, the plan called for open press coverage, 1,000 people in attendance, off-stage announcement, brief remarks and rope line.
Mr. Quayle touches hundreds upon hundreds of people along rope lines in this campaign. Since the campaign started, he said, he has surely shaken thousands and thousands of hands.
 
Meeting Mr. Wonderful
 But for Susan Davis, an unemployed secretary who happened to be in the S & S restaurant in Savannah when Mr. Quayle stopped, shaking hands with the Vice President was a singular event.
"He may be out in right field, but at least he's right," said Ms. Davis, a staunch Republican. "I think he's wonderful."
Mr. Quayle also got his standard cup of coffee -- black, no sugar. He always offers to pay. And as usual, on this stop he mostly ignored his coffee and spent his time pressing the flesh of Sunday after-church diners.
One woman, not aware that the coffee was not the point of the visit, chided the entourage of reporters and technicians for not letting the Vice President sit down and eat.
He had shaken her hand, she added, and remarked that he was "a very nice man" who would probably get her vote.
By the end of the day Mr. Quayle had grasped the hands of more than 300 people in stops at the Calvary Baptist Temple, the Savannah Christian Preparatory School, two political rallies, a fund-raising event here in Augusta, the mall visit and an air show.
 
Political Incantation
 Much of a campaign consists of repetition that becomes almost incantation. "Is this crowd pumped up?" Mr. Quayle roared again to Bush-Quayle supporters here. "Is this crowd fired up? Is Augusta going for George Bush? Is Georgia going for George Bush? Is the South going for George Bush? Is America going for George Bush?"
It was the same, with appropriate substitutions, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin. Bill Clinton cannot be trusted. Bill Clinton will tax.
Lately, Mr. Quayle has begun adding "courage" to his theme of "trust" in his appeals to voters. "Have courage to stand up for George Bush," he said here. "Have courage to stand up for yourself; have courage to stand up for your families; have courage to stand up for your values; have courage to do what is right for America, and that means vote for George Bush."

PRESIDENT BUSH
In a speech yesterday at a rally in Warren, Mich.
"Change. Governor Clinton and Ozone. They just keep talking about change, change, change. That's all you will have left in your pocket if Governor Clinton becomes President of the United States. That's it.
No, the last time we had that kind of inflation rate that Gore and Clinton would take us to, it was up there, as I said, inflation 15 percent, interest 20. How would you like that. If we'd stayed at their rate of inflation, milk, which costs $2.70 would be $8.23. That's what would happen. Bread, 84 cents, be up about $2.50. We cannot go back to that Clinton-Gore inflation by raising taxes and raising spending. 
 Now there's been some bad news. There's been some very bad news for Clinton and Gore. It comes out that we are not in a deep recession. We grew at 2.7 percent. And these guys are weeping tears. The only way they can win is the tell everybody everything isn't worth a darn. They criticize our country and say we are less than Germany and slightly better than Sri Lanka. My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON
In remarks at a photo session in Toledo, Ohio.
"The American people are going to have to have a lot of courage to vote for change in this election. You've got a President who will say anything to be elected and a billionaire who's going to spend anything to be elected. And I'm the only person who's really offering a real departure and honest change, and I think the American people will sense that in the last five days and we will win.
But you know, I am not at all surprised by this. I mean, this guy's been out there for two months making up charges about me, deliberately falsifying my plan and, you know, essentially getting a free ride out of it because he can pay to keep putting this stuff on. The media can only say one time this is not true. And if you're totally shameless and somebody tells you you're not telling the truth, and you keep on doing it anyway, which is what Bush does, it's hard for the American people to know what to make of it."
 
ROSS PEROT
In an speech at a rally Wednesday night in Denver.
"There's an interesting thing happening this week that I just find fascinating. Day after day after day, somebody comes up with some excuse to attack my integrity. My integrity is a matter of record. My integrity was never questioned until the Republican dirty tricks guys started after it in June.
But, since we're talking about polls, I think you will find it interesting. People are taking polls and they find the American people believe me and don't believe Bush. And so their solution is to intensify the attack. Let me just say this. It's all Silly Putty. It's nothing to do with anything that concerns the American people and I just look at it and marvel."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Bush: Denouncing Clinton's Record

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
The Bush campaign began broadcasting this 30-second commercial Wednesday in unidentified markets around the country.
 
ON THE SCREEN Opens with gloomy black and white images of a rainy day, a deserted road, weeds rustling in the wind. Key phrases from the narration, and sources for the statistics, are superimposed over similar depressing images. Closes with a tree and a buzzard in the desert and these words: "America Can't Take That Risk."
 
PRODUCER The November Company
 
TELEVISION SCRIPT Announcer: "In his 12 years as Governor, Bill Clinton has doubled his state's debt. Doubled Government spending and signed the largest tax increase in his state's history. Yet his state remains the 45th worst in which to work. The 45th worst for children. It has the worst environmental policy. 
 "And the F.B.I. says Arkansas had America's biggest increase in rate of serious crime. And now Bill Clinton wants to do for America what he's done for Arkansas. America can't take that risk."
 
ACCURACY This ad is a case study in how allegations can be made and how facts can be used to bolster them or tear them down. The Bush campaign backs its accusations with statistics and cites its sources on the screen. And the Clinton campaign refutes every accusation with its own statistics.
For example, the while it is true that Arkansas doubled Government spending, most of that growth came from inflation. And the Clinton campaign cited figures from the National Governors' Association that all but six states have doubled general spending since Mr. Clinton took office.
 
SCORECARD This ad takes facts out of context to paint Mr. Clinton as a Governor who brought only misery to Arkansas. In reality, Mr. Clinton has been considered a better than average Governor of a small, poor state. It tries to scare viewers into thinking that a Clinton Administration would bring only gloom and doom to the whole country. In 30 seconds, the ad tries to hit Mr. Clinton on the hot-button issues of the environment, children, crime and taxes --all issues that Mr. Bush has been attacked on.

HEADLINE: Pre-Election Mood in Washington Is, Polls Notwithstanding, Post-Bush

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
One of President Bush's top appointees, a man known more for competence than political zeal, recently got a telephone call dangling the prospect of new employment in January. Nothing odd about that; with Mr. Bush's re-election uncertain, many Republicans are furtively fielding job offers.
But this call stood out for its source: Bill Clinton's campaign staff. Already it was plucking at the carcass of the Bush regime more than a month before Election Day. 
 "They were probably testing my loyalty," the Bush official said, sounding both bitter and philosophic. "We did the same thing to Carter's people in '80."
Mr. Bush himself might call Washington Tension City these days. Not since Ronald Reagan pried the White House away from Jimmy Carter a dozen years ago have the final days of a Presidential election taken on such a Crockett-at-the-Alamo urgency.
Yes, polls show the race has tightened in the last few days, but that has not been enough to dispel the gloom that has been settling in for months. Republicans despair at finding their shining city on a hill -- seat of the cold war triumph, gilded monument to a decade of prosperity -- besieged by Mongols camped at the gates and hungrily awaiting capitulation. Democrats are savoring the giddiness of revolutionaries pulling down the statues in the town square.
Politics is not geometry, of course. Whatever Mr. Clinton's advisers hope in their hearts, his victory on Tuesday is so far but a statistical assumption, hedged by margins of error and the volatility of an electorate that has already exceeded its flash point more than once.
But a last-reel sense of finality pervades much of official Washington anyway, like a movie in which the outcome seems foreordained but the suspense still tingles.
Rumors, some based in fact, take flight almost hourly. A top Cabinet member is plotting his senatorial campaign. (True.) The Administration is renting space for Mr. Clinton's White House transition team. (True, but that happens in every election.) Washington fashion salons are dumping their inventories of Nancy Reagan-red and Barbara Bush-blue inaugural gowns for flashier Democratic fare. (False, says Lashea Green, salon buyer for Clare Dratch Inc., one trend-setting shop. She will head to Manhattan, to the Garment District, the morning after Election Day, but the gowns she buys have no ideological stripe, she says.)
 
Booming Business In Resume Polishing
 "Be the first in the Democratic Party to have a copy of the new ELECTRONIC PLUM BOOK," screams a direct-mail flier that landed this week on desks around town. The Plum Book is the Federal version of the Social Register -- a listing of the capital's most powerful jobs and, until now, the Republicans who occupy them. The new edition, the flyer confidently states, includes "over 8,600 Federal policy and supporting positions which will become available under the new President."
Eight blocks from the White House, the traffic at Star Personnel Inc. does little to discourage that conclusion. "I'm handling a resume for an assistant secretary right now," said Karen Hillian, the staffing manager there. The resume-burnishing trade was slow through the Presidential debates, she said, then began to take off this week as mid-level Administration officials seriously began pondering the prospect of unemployment.
"The political appointees -- from Cabinet members on down -- have very, very discreetly expressed interest in new jobs," said Eric Vautour, a former personnel official in the Nixon Administration who now directs Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive-search concern in Washington. "They are stating a preference if, indeed, some client has an interest in their abilities. And they're asking that no meetings take place, and no paper be forwarded, till after the election."
Many are in for a discreet shock. The world outside the White House is not the one they left four, eight, even 12 years ago for the power and prestige of high public service. Since 1989, when Congress enacted a carrot-and-stick package of Federal pay increases and strict new ethics laws, Government salaries have catapulted past those in the private sector; six-figure bureaucratic jobs are now common. "A number of people will have to take cuts in pay to get a job," Mr. Vautour said.
When jobs exist, that is. Once, out-of-office Republicans could land safely in Congress; this time, Republicans fear a Democratic landslide in legislative races that will cut the number of Capitol Hill jobs available to departing Administration officials. Nor does the private sector offer much hope.
"I probably have more talented executives on file than I've ever had in the 24 years I've been in the executive-search business," said Barbara Laumann, managing partner of Laumann and Associates, another Washington head-hunting concern. "It's a terrible market to be unemployed."
 
While Democrats Knock on Wood
 Democrats want desperately to believe all this, but they will not let themselves.
"I was in a meeting yesterday of the National Jewish Democratic Council where people were explicitly admonished, whenever they said, 'When Clinton is elected,' to instead say, 'If Clinton is elected,' " said Stuart Eizenstat, a Washington lawyer, former domestic policy adviser to President Carter and member of the Democratic establishment-in-exile. "They were acting out of fear that somehow, someone was putting a hex on a party that's been star-crossed for so long."
Republicans know how close the precipice is. In mixed company, Administration officials maintain a determined cheeriness. "I don't have time to think about the future," a senior White House aide snapped. "I'm too busy getting this guy re-elected."
Others fend off gloom with dollops of black humor. "Basically, things are pretty steady," another White House aide said dryly of the progress of Mr. Bush's campaign. "Sixty percent of the people didn't want to re-elect him nine months ago, and 60 percent don't want to re-elect him today."
Among the true believers, pessimism remains a minority view. But longtime election-watchers have charted a bevy of leading indicators of political panic that do not bode well for the White House. Mid-level political appointees are postponing vacations, knowing they may well have plenty of free time after Jan. 20 and that the Government will pay them for time off that is not used. "There are a lot of people saving it up," one Administration official said.
More senior Bush aides, with grander ambitions, are discreetly asking reporters how much their book proposals might command in the publishing market, and which literary agents are best retained. (One top agent says the memoirs of the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, would be welcomed, but that the public appetite for many more Bush books in a Clinton Presidency would be at best limited. "The talk is, is there anyone else that's interesting now?" she said.)
Some political and policy advisers are beginning to resemble football fans who bolt the stadium when their team is hopelessly down, cursing the quarterback and telling all within earshot what they would have done differently.
Last month, for example, Washingtonians clucked knowingly when, in a Washington Post article, the President's budget director and fiscal strategist, Richard G. Darman, publicly blamed his boss's plight on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's economic advice and on the political "idiocy" of Mr. Bush himself.
Lately, other Bush aides prefer to sock it to the Bush-Quayle chairman, Robert M. Teeter, who they contend ran a BarcaLounger campaign when circumstances clamored for a Land Rover. They refer to "the Teeter principle," a snide allusion to the Peter principle, that every talented worker gets promoted, sooner or later, to a job beyond his or her abilities.
 
A Few Democrats Have Been There
 Mr. Eizenstat recalls what it felt like in 1980.
"I don't think people who aren't part of an administration can understand it," he said. "It's not just a job you're losing. It's a sense of being part of a broader enterprise. You come into the job to get certain things done for the country, and you have a sick sense you're not going to be able to complete your mission -- and, in fact, people are coming in with an entirely different agenda that you abhor.
"You can't understand why the country can't understand what you've done for the last four years, and why they're not rewarding you instead of punishing you."
Asked if he feels sympathy for Mr. Bush and his team, Mr. Eizenstat quickly responds: "Sure. For about one second."
Later he called back to say that his response had been unnecessarily harsh. "I recognize how difficult it is to face an impending loss when you're in the White House," he said, "but my sympathy tends to evaporate when I recognize how long they've been in power and the need for change."
Man of Substance
Eyes a Pink Slip
He is 36 years old, an East Coaster, excellent dresser. He is a lawyer, although, in the Washington way of things, he has never practiced law. Before entering this Government he lobbied for various foreign ones.
He is one of about 1,700 workers with the greatest stake in Mr. Bush's future. They are political appointees -- "schedule C" employees, in bureaucratese -- who got their jobs because they are loyal Republicans, and who will lose them if Mr. Clinton takes over. Like most of his colleagues, he is a bright, white, male graduate of a good school, one of those now in their 30's -- the anointed managers of the Reagan Revolution, and presumably the future Republican aristocracy.
He works in a respectable, mid-level Cabinet office. The $70,000-a-year salary is not what he had enjoyed as a lobbyist but enough to pay the mortgage on his tony Georgetown town house (hot tub on the patio, gourmet kitchen, a tiny wood-burning fireplace in the living room). He still buys suits at Hugo Boss; still makes the payments on his hunter-green Miata; he has even begun a wine collection.
The job has been a surprise. Bureaucrats actually work hard and wield great power. Amazingly, he found, he is a man of substance, flying around the world to tell foreigners in equally expensive suits what the United States of America wants of them. Ambassadors treat him with respect. Reporters call him looking for disclosures, and he rebuffs them with pleasure.
In late September, sipping a Frescobaldi Chianti Reserve in his kitchen, he said calmly that he assumed this was all going to go away. He spoke of the outlook:
"I don't see any way Bush can win at this point. I am making all my plans on the assumption of a Clinton landslide. It isn't just the economy or that people are mad at Bush. It's bigger. All of a sudden it's like people are tired of us, of Republicans, of conservatism. It's cool to be a Democrat again. The excitement is with them now.
"The good thing is, it takes them a long time to get down to replacing people at my level. I certainly won't be fired on Jan. 21. I figure more like late March, maybe even April. And I will insist on being fired; I need the unemployment money."
He marveled at the novelty of it. "I am actually going to get a pink slip," he said. "It will actually be pink. I think I'll frame it."
 
In Highest Places There's Still Hope
 But inside the besieged Bush camp, they are still shoring up the ramparts.
Most pundits say Mr. Clinton has already locked up more than the 270 electoral votes he needs to win on Tuesday. But in a handful of polls, Mr. Clinton's insurmountable lead has seemingly shriveled -- to eight, then five, then two percentage points.
Mr. Bush, a soporific campaigner all year, is suddenly his old spontaneous, slightly goofy, self, spitting fire on the stump. He calls Senator Gore "Ozone Man," and the name sticks. He rails at the northern spotted owl -- "a feathery, fine-looking little bird," he says, "but I'm also worried about those 30,000 families that might be thrown out of work." His audience laughs, then cheers.
A senior official who often flies with Mr. Bush aboard Air Force One telephones a friend.
"You may think I'm crazy," he said, "but I think we can win this thing."

HEADLINE: Roe Retires and District Sees an Abrasive Contest

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., Oct. 28

 BODY:
For nearly a quarter-century, Representative Robert A. Roe's iron grip on the Eighth Congressional District not only assured Democratic control of the seat but was also the linchpin to the Democrats' majority in the New Jersey Congressional delegation.
But Mr. Roe's decision not to seek a 13th term, together with a redrawn map that apparently favored the Republicans, produced a district that is untried and unpredictable. The result has been one of the fiercest and most abrasive campaigns in the state. 
 Nestled in Northern New Jersey, the Eighth District was once dominated by Paterson, a Democratic fief of 141,000 residents and New Jersey's third-largest city.
But in recent elections, such wealthier, generally Republican suburban areas like Wayne and Upper Montclair have outvoted the urban centers and carried the district for Republican candidates in state and national races.
Mr. Roe's popularity and incumbency made him the exception to that trend. But his absence from the ballot this year, an anticipated strong showing by the Democratic Presidential candidate, Gov. Bill Clinton, and redistricting have made the Eighth District race between State Senator Joseph L. Bubba, a Republican, and Herbert C. Klein, a Democrat and a former State Assemblyman, one of the state's hottest.
A third of the district's residents live in Paterson or Passaic, its biggest urban areas; a third live in such blue-collar communities as Belleville and Nutley, and a third live in suburban enclaves, including West Orange and South Orange, which were just added to the Eighth.
"I believe this district fits the Republican plan," Mr. Klein said Tuesday, "but you're looking at a Democrat who is happy with the district."
Mr. Klein may be happy because the district's 92,347 registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one, but Mr. Bubba can take comfort in knowing that the district includes more than 125,000 undeclared voters, who in the most recent elections have favored Republicans. Furthermore, in 11 years as a State Senator, Mr. Bubba has at one time or another represented about 55 percent of the Eighth District.
Mr. Roe, the senior member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation with 23 years in the House, announced in March that he would not run again. At the same time, New Jersey lost one of its 14 seats, a Democrat-held one, in a delegation where Democrats had an 8-to-6 advantage.
 
Personal Attacks
 In such a volatile situation, the campaign quickly turned into a barrage of personal attacks from both candidates.
Each candidate has questioned the other's ethics.
Mr. Bubba has attacked Mr. Klein as "a millionaire lawyer" who has used his position as a Democratic fund-raiser to win legal work. One of his radio advertisements accuses Mr. Klein of being untrustworthy, citing the lawyer's handling of a wetlands case that was criticized last year by State Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo.
Mr. Klein has fired back with allegations that Mr. Bubba accepted campaign contributions from a vending-machine company owner accused of organized crime ties and from a contractor who pleaded guilty this year to bribing Mayor Joseph Lipari of Passaic.
Mr. Klein also has accused his opponent of failing to pay property taxes on his house for several years.
"When he takes a poke at me, I certainly do not take it lying down," Mr. Klein said.
Mr. Bubba says of his opponent, "There are many differences between Herb Klein and Joe Bubba, but the main difference is Joe Bubba is going to be elected; Herbert Klein isn't."
The most contentious issue has been the economy. Mr. Klein has proposed shifting $140 billion the Federal Government spends annually to defend Germany and Japan and using it to reduce the budget deficit. Mr. Bubba has attacked the plan at every opportunity.
"First of all, his figures are all wrong," said Mr. Bubba, who supports reducing the deficit through a balanced budget and a line-item veto for the President.
 
Gun Control
 Although it has not been a major issue, gun control has figured in the race.
The National Rifle Association has contributed $10,000 to Mr. Bubba's campaign and has sent literature to its members in the district urging them to vote for the Republican.
Sarah Brady, the wife of James Brady, the former White House spokesman who was paralyzed by gunfire intended for President Ronald Reagan, came to the state this week to give Mr. Klein her endorsement and that of her national organization, Handgun Control Inc.
In what has become a theme in many campaigns this year, the Eighth District candidates have frequently traded barbs about political experience.
Mr. Bubba has described his Democratic opponent as a "political insider" and Mr. Klein's response has been to label the Republican "a good old boy politician."
Described by one Republican State Senator as "middle-level players" in state politics, Mr. Bubba and Mr. Klein both have extensive political backgrounds.
Mr. Bubba, 54 years old, of Wayne was elected to the State Senate in 1981 and has been re-elected three times since. Earlier, he was chairman of the Passaic County Republican Committee. He is retired from New Jersey Bell, where he worked for 29 years, most recently as an account manager.
Mr. Klein, 62, is a Clifton lawyer. He was a State Assemblyman from 1971 to 1976. Although he has not held an elective office since leaving the Assembly, he has remained in politics as executive director of the Passaic County Democratic Committee.

GRAPHIC: Photo: New Jersey's redrawn Eighth Congressional District is no longer the secure haven of a Democrat incumbent. State Senator Joseph L. Bubba was able to bring such the President's daughter, Dorothy Bush-Koch, to his side as he campaigned in West Paterson.; The burden of extending the nearly quarter-century Democratic reign in New Jersey's Eighth District has fallen to Herbert C. Klein, a former State Assemblyman, since Robert A. Roe chose not to run for a 13th term. Mr. Klein visited voters on Wednesday in Paterson. (Photographs by Ray Stubblebine for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Dow Is Off 5.13, but Advances Top Declines

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The stock market ended mixed yesterday, as fresh political uncertainty rippled through the market after a new public opinion poll showed President Bush gaining on his Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 5.13 points to close at 3,246.27. But in the broader market, gainers outpaced declining issues, 975 to 774. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was active at 206.6 million shares, compared with 203.9 million Wednesday. 
 After Mr. Bush's unexpected gain in a Cable News Network/USA Today/Gallup poll released late Wednesday, investors were sensitive to any new developments in the race.
The most active stocks on both the Big Board and Nasdaq involved companies that released earnings results.
"There's a desire to try to find growth during a nongrowing economy," said Robert Caputo, director of research at the Swiss Bank Corporation's investment banking unit. "People are driven to find niche growth, and that falls more to secondary companies."
Stocks could trend higher Monday, Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear Stearns, said. He noted that the market had been up the day before the election 14 out of the last 16 times.
Still, he said, it was encouraging that the blue-chip market did not suffer larger losses given the weakness in International Business Machines, which fell 1 1/8, to 66, and General Motors, which was unchanged at 31 3/8.
Expectations that the Presidential election "might be more of a horse race" provided a support, Mr. Solomon said.
"Big-cap weakness" detracted from the market's performance, Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said, using a market term for large companies. "I think everything is on hold. We're treading water in front of the election."
Mr. Caputo called the session "pretty much a snoozer."
Shares of Telefonos de Mexico rose 1 3/4, to 50 3/8. Analysts repeated buy ratings after the Mexican telephone company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.
Legent led on Nasdaq, gaining 1 1/4, to 45 1/4, after its fourth-quarter net exceeded analysts' expectations.
Triton Energy slumped 4 1/8, to 38 1/2. An oilfield in Colombia in which both Triton and British Petroleum have stakes was estimated to have reserves of two billion barrels, which was below some analysts' expectations. B.P. lost 3/4, to close at 44 3/8.
Cooper Industries tumbled 6 1/2, to 46 1/4, after saying it expected earnings to be down 3 percent from a year earlier.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.73, to 420.86.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Long-Term Funds Hold Less Allure

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
A GROWING number of mutual fund investors are moving away from long-term bond funds, evidently fearing lower bond prices that could be brought on by higher interest rates, some mutual fund companies said yesterday. The investors seem to be shifting into stock mutual funds and money market funds.
The drift from longer-term bond funds is by no means a rout, and some fund groups said their bond funds continued to pull in investor money. But it nonetheless signaled investor caution, which no doubt was brought about by rising interest rates and falling bond prices earlier this month. If the drift continues, it could help to push interest rates even higher. 
 The statements about October sales came as the Investment Company Institute reported a slowing of cash flowing into bond funds in September, although they still took in $8 billion.
Bond funds have benefited from huge investments by people disappointed by low interest rates paid by banks, and some money continues to come from such investors. But many fund groups voiced disappointment at the amount now coming in, and others said the inflow was not enough to offset the withdrawals from bond funds by existing investors. For the industry as a whole, bond funds have not seen a net outflow of cash in any month since April 1990, and it appears unlikely that that happened this month.
One fund category that did see large withdrawals was junk-bond funds. At Vanguard Investments, a spokesman, Brian Mattes, said, about $550 million was withdrawn -- a quarter of the assets in what had been a $2.2 billion fund.
Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, said that while withdrawals were strongest in junk funds, there was a net withdrawal from other types of Fidelity bond funds as well.
There was much less activity in the funds that are sold through brokers and insurance agents, but some of them also reported outflows from bond funds. "We had a net outflow from government bond funds," said John Reilly of Massachusetts Financial Services.
On the other hand, Jon Fossel, the chief executive of Oppenheimer Funds, said bond fund sales continued to be strong. "Our typical investor is probably a little more long-term oriented than a lot of no-load funds," he said.
Bond funds have enjoyed enormous sales this year, as investors have fled from bank certificates of deposit, on which rates dropped sharply earlier this year, and sought higher yields. But C.D. rates have risen recently, said Bruce Speca of the TNE Fund Group, and some investors "are having second thoughts and saying, 'Maybe I should wait.' "
Mr. Speca said bond funds in his group still took in substantial amounts of money, and Stephen Gibson, an official at the Putnam funds, agreed. But Mr. Gibson added that "it looks to us like a few people are waiting on the sidelines."
The large withdrawals of money from junk funds, reported by several fund groups but not in as large amounts as seen at Vanguard, appear to represent concerns brought on by the slide in values of bonds issued by the Marriott Corporation after it announced plans for a corporate reorganization. In addition, some market timers apparently concluded that the large rise in junk-bond prices may have run its course. The shift came at the end of a strong period in junk sales, capped by September when a net $779 million came into such funds, the highest for any month since October 1986.
The cash-flow figures include sales and redemptions, as well as the movement of cash between different types of funds. But they do not include reinvested dividends.
The $8 billion that came into bond funds in September was the lowest since April and was down from an inflow of $9.3 billion in August. But that decline was largely because of a $2.2 billion outflow from global bond funds, brought on by the currency turbulence in September.
Stock funds took in $4.5 billion in September, up from $3.5 billion a month earlier, and a number of fund groups said stock-fund sales had risen this month. Both Fidelity and T. Rowe Price reported growing sales of more aggressive stock funds, as opposed to ones that pick safer stocks less likely to rise rapidly in a bull market.
Over all, long-term funds took in $12.5 billion in September. By historical standards, that is a very good figure. But it is the lowest of any month in 1992 and is almost a third less than July's $18.4 billion.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Traders Focus on Jobs Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With just three trading days before the election results are in, some bond traders and dealers are turning their focus to an event that already seems much more important to them: the employment report for October, which the Labor Department will release next Friday.
Some traders contend that the market has already pretty well discounted a victory by Gov. Bill Clinton given the selloff of the last four weeks. So that news is in the market. 
 But the employment data could still be important enough to set the tone for the post-election economic outlook.
If the jobs data are weak enough, the expectation of another cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve could take hold in the market again. That could provide the impetus for a rally.
 
Easing Is Not Expected
 The fact that the Fed did not ease rates after the September employment data were released Oct. 2 was a major reason the market sold off this month. And recently the talk has turned to the possibility of no further Fed easing, especially if Mr. Clinton wins and prepares a stimulus program to get the economy moving faster than a crawl.
On the other hand, if the data are not weak, then there may be less reason for whoever is President to push a big economic stimulus program, especially given the economy's surprisingly strong 2.7 percent growth in the third quarter of this year.
"I believe the employment number next week is more important than who is elected," one bond trader said. "That could bring the Fed-ease story back into the market."
Because the elections would be past and because the dollar has strengthened in the last several weeks, the trader said that it would be easier for the Fed to cut interest rates now than before.
Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, "If Clinton wins, we know there will be a fiscal stimulus program, and the employment report will diminish the negative impact of that or rub salt into the wounds."
 
Stimulus by Bush Unlikely
 But he contended that if President Bush won on Tuesday the employment report would have much less of an impact on the credit markets because Mr. Bush is less likely to push any economic stimulus program. In addition, the market would be likely to have already rallied on a Bush victory for this reason. So this means that the employment report would have a major impact only if it showed the economy to be much stronger than expected.
However, neither Mr. Giordano nor Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, expect the employment report to be weak enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut its target for the Federal funds rate, which is now at 3 percent.
Both predict that the nonfarm payroll figures will show a net job increase in the range of 50,000 to 60,000, which is about what the increase was in September, after adjusting for ups and downs of a special Government summer jobs program.
Mr. Platt said that would not be enough weakness for the Fed to act on, adding that he believed that the Fed had decided to tolerate slower economic growth.
Mr. Giordano said, "If they didn't ease on the last round of numbers, it is hard to see this stirring up another round of easing."
 
Treasury Market

Prices rose and yields fell a little in the Treasury bond market yesterday. Traders said that some of the small lift in the market came from reports that showed that Mr. Bush had narrowed Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls.
Other traders said that with many of the major players on the sidelines waiting for the election results, the moves in the market might be exaggerated.
"There has been quite a lot of euphoria," said one trader about the narrowing of Mr. Clinton's lead in the political polls. He said that had forced some people to buy bonds to cover their positions in case President Bush does win.
In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 96 6/32 , up 11/32 to yield 7.57 percent, down from 7.60 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note was also up 11/32 to yield 6.66 percent, down from 6.71 percent the day before.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
UAL's 3d-Quarter Earnings Fell 14%

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, parent company of United Airlines, reported that third-quarter earnings fell 14 percent, a better-than-expected performance in the face of industrywide fare cuts initiated largely by its rival American Airlines.
UAL's profits fell to $21.5 million, or 89 cents a share, from $25 million, or $1.05 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 11 percent, to $3.58 billion from $3.24 billion, because of the heavier traffic the low fares generated. Revenue per passenger mile fell, however, to 11.26 cents from 12.02 cents. 
 UAL's results contrasted sharply with the $85 million third-quarter loss posted by the AMR Corporation, American's parent.
Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive, called the quarterly results "exceptionally poor for what is traditionally the strongest quarter in the airline industry."
But Kevin Murphy, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the results were somewhat higher than analysts had expected. He said United had handled the discounting last summer better than American had by being less aggressive in putting low-priced seats on the market.
"They got dragged into the battle reluctantly," he said. "They tried to stay out of the crossfire."
He also said United reduced its operating costs from the year earlier.
UAL's stock rose 62.5 cents a share, to $122, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
UAL's earnings were helped by its stake in Covia, its reservation system; the company also sold some property. The gains were largely offset, however, by foreign-exchange losses and litigation costs. On an operating basis, UAL's third-quarter earnings rose 16 percent, to $68 million from $58.4 million.
Mr. Wolf said United, which has a major route system to the Pacific, will see a drag on earnings from its East Asian operations because economies there have weakened.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed as Mark Rises On Inaction by Bundesbank

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed in uneventful foreign-exchange trading yesterday. Currency traders said the market ignored a Government report that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose by 8,000 in mid-October, the first increase in four weeks.
Instead, the dollar traded in a narrow range, as traders awaited the outcome of next week's Presidential election, John Nelson, a trader at ABN Amro Bank in New York, said. 
 The German mark, meanwhile, benefited because the Bundesbank did not lower interest rates as some traders had expected. High rates tend to keep a nation's currency strong by making investments denominated in that currency attractive.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.5390 marks from 1.5405 late Wednesday. In New York, the dollar brought 1.5375 marks, down from 1.5455 marks.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.28 yen, up from 123.18 yen. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.02 yen, up 0.97 yen from Wednesday's close, and in London, the dollar was quoted at 122.35 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5735 from $1.5745 late Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.5730, down from $1.5735 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.3735 Swiss francs, down from 1.3745; 5.2140 French francs, down from 5.2470; 1,313.75 Italian lire, down from 1,331.00, and 1.23875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2378.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.3735 Swiss francs, up from 1.3715; 5.2210 French francs, down from 5.2265; 1.7325 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7350; 1,316.00 Italian lire, down from 1,331.75, and 1.2413 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2400.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $339.50 an ounce, up 10 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $340 an ounce, up $1.15.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $339.50 an ounce from $338.55 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $339.60 from $338.60 bid late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Restaurants;
Seeing Matisse? How About a Matching Lunch?

BYLINE: Bryan Miller

 BODY:
When blockbuster exhibitions come to the Museum of Modern Art, crowds at the restaurants and snack stands there can make the painting galleries look underattended. To help accommodate the crush during the current Matisse retrospective, the museum has opened a 240-seat French-style cafe serving sandwiches and salads. Called Le Cafe Francais, it is scheduled to operate during museum hours for the duration of the exhibition.
For those who seek more substantial lunch fare outside the museum, or just want to escape from the masses, there is good news: the blocks around the museum probably have more quality restaurants per square foot than any other place in New York City. And while prices are generally high in midtown Manhattan, many spots offer prix fixe lunches that are relative bargains considering the food and the settings. 
 Here is a broad-brush survey of options within a short walk of the Matisse show.
Just north of the museum is one of the city's most authoritative Indian restaurants, DARBAR. Its specialty is northern Indian fare. Try the roasted chicken suffused with sweetened coconut and yogurt, tandoor-cooked lamb in onion sauce, and the baked lobster with coconut cream. But if you like scorching vindaloos, they can be found, too. Darbar's $19.95 lunch, offering a choice from seven appetizers and seven main courses on the regular menu, is a good deal.
Less than a block west of Darbar is a new Chinese restaurant, CHOP SUEY LOOEY'S LITCHI LOUNGE, done up in a tacky-cocktail-lounge-in-Honolulu decor. The food and the drinks (some served in 32-ounce aquariums complete with parasols and sculpted fruit) are diverting, if you are in the mood for this kind of tomfoolery. Try any of the dumplings, like the steamed seafood version accented with fresh coriander. Also good are giant steamed scallops with black bean sauce, pork chops with sweet fried pastries, and shredded chicken with garlic sauce.
If you are simply looking to take the weight off your feet while having an espresso and pastry or a well-made salad, there is LE SALON DE THE in Henri Bendel at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street. An animated little cafe and a sleek espresso bar are on the second floor of this elegant store, where your lunch tab may be amplified by items picked up while browsing on the way out
West 55th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas is so dense with eating places that the aromas alone could satiate a potential luncher. Closest to Fifth Avenue is the most lavish venue, ADRIENNE, in the Peninsula Hotel. Adrienne has had its ups and downs over the years, but recent visits reveal a new vigor in the kitchen. The food is polished, visually alluring and generally harmonious. Two enticing main courses on the $28 prix fixe lunch are grilled chicken with pan juices and fennel, and grilled salmon with rosti potatoes and crisp eggplant.
A few steps west is the best California-style restaurant in New York City, MICHAEL'S, on West 55th Street. The breezy dining room, which is embellished with modern art, is spacious and relaxing. Michael's is not cheap. But it is consistently good, and if you are in the mood for a main course salad, two can be heartily recommended: the grilled chicken and Montrachet goat cheese with grilled peppers, onion and tomatoes, and the generous Nicoise salad with grilled bluefin tuna, calamata olives, new potatoes and grilled peppers.
Across the street is LA CARAVELLE, an enchanting, veteran luxury French restaurant that has received a shot of youth serum in the form of a Japanese chef, Tadashi Ono. Mr. Ono's amalgam classic French cuisine lightened with Oriental touches and technique is as refreshing as it is titillating. On his new lunch menu are fusion dishes like duck breast with green mustard and rice cakes, and fillet of veal with carrot-juice sauce and a noodle pancake. At the same time, there are Gallic standards like pike quenelles with lobster sauce and roast chicken with tarragon.
One of the most popular bistros in the neighborhood is LA BONNE SOUPE. This peppy, inexpensive and thoroughly French spot turns out a sturdy onion soup, a spicy steak hache au poivre (or peppered hamburger) and periodic specials like couscous and mini-bouillabaisse. Be prepared for a short wait at peak lunch hours. On Saturdays and Sundays, a classical guitarist entertains.
Heading east on 55th Street across Fifth Avenue the rents get higher and so do restaurant prices. LESPINASSE is the sumptuous restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel, the kind of place where guests look as if they had just walked out of a glossy magazine spread. The extraordinarily gifted chef, Greg Kunz, challenges the palate with surprising juxtapositions, many involving Oriental ingredients. His $38 prix fixe lunch, while hardly inexpensive, can still be thought of as a bargain considering the quality of the meal and the magnificent, pampering setting. A highlight on the current lunch menu is the mignonette of lamb and eggplant tart with an invigorating curry-carrot-juice sauce. Another is grilled fillet of bass and sauteed scallops with a sauce redolent of lemon thyme and basil.
Just across the street is another lavish lair, LA COTE BASQUE, with its evocative murals of the Basque coast, red leather banquettes and black-tie staff. Lunch is a relatively reasonable $28, and with the owner, Jean-Jacques Rachou, back at the stove, the cooking is as generous and loving as ever. The lunch menu is copious. Among seafood entrees are poached salmon with sorrel sauce, and a grilled red snapper with mustard sauce. Other choices include classics like calf's liver lyonnaise, a paragon of a cassoulet, and roasted chicken with tarragon.
One block south, even closer to the museum, is OCEANA. This contemporary two-story town house with hazy bucolic murals formerly housed Le Cygne, the gracious French restaurant that succumbed to a feeble economy. A restaurant family from Westchester County took over and turned it into a first-rate seafood house with highly professional service. A prix fixe lunch is $26 to $36, depending on the main course chosen. For example, a three-course meal built around roasted cod with a citrus crust, black beans with scallions, and rice is $26; South American prawns with white beans in rosemary broth, $32.
One of the city's most provocative restaurants is partly obscured under the A.T.& T. Arcade at the corner of Madison Avenue and 55th Street: THE QUILTED GIRAFFE. The Japanese-influenced cooking can be exquisite, if relatively pricey. A $45 prix fixe lunch menu offers striking dishes like wasabi pizza with sashimi tuna, smoked venison with wild rice salad and cranberry cinnamon sauce, grilled shrimp with creamy polenta, confit of duck with vegetable risotto, and caramelized apple tart with vanilla sauce.
Just down the block is a crisp North Italian newcomer called SAN PIETRO. The kitchen is more experimental and multiregional than most, and you can find distinctive pastas like vermicelli with garlic, capers and anchovies, and malloreddus, which is gnocchi-shaped dumpling tossed with baby clams, squid and shrimp.
A short distance west on the other side of the street, you can't miss BICE -- on clement days the glass-paneled doors are flung open and spilling onto the sidewalk are bronzed, polyglot diners, making this slice of New York look like happy hour in Milan or Florence. The setting inside is tasteful and warm. Better yet, pastas and salads at Bice are bright and well composed, whether you order the marinated salmon with horseradish mustard, the grilled vegetables with virgin olive oil, the grilled Cornish hen with garlic, or rigatoni with eggplant, tomatoes and aged ricotta.
To the west, across Fifth Avenue, is AQUAVIT, the striking Scandinavian restaurant. Aquavit has an informal cafe on the main level and a larger dining room in a rear atrium. The cafe serves a $19.92 lunch that can begin with baked Baltic herring with cod roe and cream or wild mushroom soup, followed by a gravlax club sandwich on seven-grain bread or cabbage rolls with mashed potatoes and lingonberries. In the main dining room you can choose from an a la carte menu of smoked Swedish salmon with horseradish cream or Skagen toast (Scandinavian shrimp, creme fraiche and bleak roe). Among main courses to try are seared salmon with sherry vinaigrette and warm potato salad, and poached cod with red pepper sauce.
Jean-Michel Bergougnoux was the masterly chef at Le Cygne. Fortunately, he moved two blocks west to take the reins at RAPHAEL, a decorous little spot near the Avenue of the Americas. Mr. Bergougnoux's Provencal-bistro style is ideal for those who want an exciting but light repast at lunch. His a la carte menu includes tuna steak with potato galettes and a peppered wine vinegar sauce, fricassee of chicken with lemon confit, and risotto with braised veal seasoned with star of anise and cilantro.
It's a three-minute walk west to REMI, the smart-looking northern Italian restaurant on West 54th Street near Seventh Avenue. At lunch a smartly dressed midtown business crowd frequents this dining room with bold murals of Venice. Virtually all the pastas can be recommended, especially the fusilli with radicchio and smoked bacon, and the tortelli filled with braised beef in red wine sauce.
On 53d Street is CHINA GRILL, at Avenue of the Americas, a futuristic setting in the brooding CBS headquarters known as Black Rock. Soaring ceiling and marble walls make for a loud and echoing ambiance in this block-long space. The food is sort of California-Oriental, which can be light and vigorous when well executed. Peking duck salad with a semisweet tangerine sauce is a winner, as are grilled prawns with pesto and barbecued salmon with Chinese mustard sauce and stir-fried greens. China Grill has a long dining counter facing the kitchen that is suitable for solitary diners.
East of Park Avenue is one of New York City's few round-the-clock restaurants, BRASSERIE. The sprawling, functional space has a large dining bar near the entrance and several seating areas. The food has improved in recent years and one can recommend the roasted chicken with french fries, grilled entrecote, and salade nicoise.
On 52d Street just east of Fifth Avenue is LA GRENOUILLE, a sumptuous setting with its glittering room embellished by explosions of fresh flowers. The food is classic French for the most part, and a $39.50 prix fixe lunch offers a good range of samples: poached chicken with sea salt and horseradish sauce, braised sweetbreads with sauce diable (flavored with vinegar, shallots and black pepper), and oxtail cooked in red wine.
Heading back across Fifth Avenue to West 52d Street brings you to the brownstone facade of the legendary "21" CLUB. Since the arrival of Michael Lomonaco as chef three years ago, the food has steadily improved. Dine in the bar with its checked tablecloths and ceiling festooned with vintage model airplanes. A $19.92 lunch special is offered daily, with choices that include black bean soup or Caesar salad, followed by a mini version of the "21" burger with shoestring potatoes or a grilled chicken paillard sandwich with avocado. For dessert there is a fruit plate or chocolate cake. Customers can also order from the a la carte menu.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Russia Rumbles

 BODY:
While America focuses on choosing a President, Russia slides toward disaster.
A misguided policy of pumping rubles into state-owned factories has sent prices skyrocketing, threatening to shatter the economy and reform. The political situation is equally alarming. While demagogues exploit ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet republics, President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament are locked in a constitutional power struggle. 
 Election campaign notwithstanding, Americans have a powerful interest in the survival of a stable reformist government in Russia. But Washington's influence is evaporating fast. November will be a crucial month; if America wishes to offer a steadying hand, the time is now.
Mr. Yeltsin has risked hyperinflation in an effort to head off a more immediate danger, the collapse of Russia's state-owned factories. Mostly, these dinosaurs have stayed alive only because of huge Government subsidies.
Reformers like Prime Minister Gaidar wanted to end the subsidies to force factories to become productive or go belly up. But the latter would have thrown millions of Russians out of work. Mr. Yeltsin took the easy way out. He allowed the factory managers to go to the central bank for credit to pay wages and buy raw materials. That, in effect, meant printing money.
This politically expedient decision quickly turned economically ruinous. The issue is no longer whether Russia pursues slow or rapid economic reform. Pouring billions of rubles into an economy producing fewer and fewer goods is sure to send prices roaring skyward, and destroy any hope of creating a market economy.
What drives Mr. Yeltsin to easy money is rough politics. Challenged by an unholy alliance of old-guard Communists, authoritarian nationalists and disgruntled military officers, Prime Minister Gaidar's liberals lacked the strength to sustain their reforms. Mr. Yeltsin broadened the governing coalition by drawing in reform-minded industrial managers. But he had to promise that they wouldn't lose control over their factories.
Meanwhile, nationalist demagogues have demanded military action to protect millions of ethnic Russians left behind in former Soviet republics. Mr. Yeltsin has so far held the line, arguing that military repression would poison the Western good will on which his economic strategy depends. But with Russia's mounting economic problems and the West's waning interest, Mr. Yeltsin's position has become far more difficult.
And on top of it all, he finds himself in a power struggle with the leader of Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov. This has already led to armed confrontations and a parliamentary challenge to freedom of the press.
There may not be many more weeks, or days, for the U.S. Government even to try exerting constructive influence. It's probably too late to use aid to spur reform. But Washington could still give the reformers a steadying hand -- and warn their opponents that America won't support ruinous economic policies or backsliding on democracy.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
It's the Economy, Stupid

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now that the campaign is almost over, the country owes the candidates gratitude for what Americans want so much -- a vacation from the realities of national life.
That might seem a crabby thought -- after all those months when the candidates kept lecturing the country about the economy. 
 "The economy, stupid," reads the sign in the office of Bill Clinton's campaign strategist. President Bush is boiling down the whole election to two words: trust and taxes. Ross Perot managed to do it in one -- deficit.
The attitude surveys convinced candidates that all that Americans cared about was the economy and how it translated into jobs. Ignore that and lose.
The surveys were probably right. So given the choice of lead, follow or get out of the way, the candidates trotted right behind the polls.
But something strange happened -- all the virtuous talk and position papers on the economy had a smothering, flattening-out effect on American reality and the American memory. It homogenized the very problems that a sturdier economy was supposed to cure. That allowed them to be comfortably diminished in our mind, priorities and conscience.
In April, when Los Angeles was burning, the country, in shock, literally prayed that this time our "leaders" would pay attention and do something, do something.
But look what happened, lamebrain: by summer Los Angeles was getting footnote political attention, barely.
Los Angeles was the result of economic and racial rage. Nonsense -- Los Angeles was the work of lawless hooligans looking for an excuse to riot. No -- Los Angeles was the result of both.
Take your pick. But one thing is sure -- everything that made for the Los Angeles riot still exists in cities around the country.
The mesmerized focus on broad-issue economics blunted the needle of national awareness that emergency social and law-enforcement action was imperative. That is dangerous.
Incidentally, whatever happened to the matter of racial tensions? Democrats are pushing race relations into the background because they do not want Jesse Jackson in the foreground. Republicans don't see political capital in talking about it at all. Mr. Perot is still recovering from the discovery that "you people" is not the way African-Americans prefer to be addressed.
Drugs, crime, a paralyzed justice system: candidates do put out some position papers. They don't get much attention, because they do not convey the horror.
Did anything from the candidates show they understood what "urban affairs" now means? What it is like to live in a neighborhood controlled by drug mobs and know they kill at whim or at random? Or where parents take their kids out of school to try to keep them from being shot down in the streets outside?
And which candidate or which position paper dealt with men and women with broken minds living, wandering and defecating in the streets?
The political professionals pound it into our heads that the rest of the world matters zero in this campaign -- no clout in surveys at all. Still, it is hard to believe that Americans really don't care whether the next Presidency would try to prevent Bosnians from being murdered or Somali children from walking about with swollen bellies, just because Bosnians and Somalis don't create jobs, except for foreign grave diggers.
Unpleasantly specific truths are not ignored -- just smoothed down, made less scary, by over-generalized economy talk. We are told repeatedly that unemployment is about 7.5 percent -- but rarely that it is at least triple that for teen-agers in ghettos.
The candidates explain that strengthening the whole economy will help us find money to deal with drugs, crime, violence, maybe even a few Bosnians and Somalis.
That's nice. But the candidates should explain something else. How do other democracies manage to have cleaner streets, safer neighborhoods and safer banks, less drugs, no guns, better medical insurance, fewer wreckages of tenements and people, without waiting until the complete grand, overall, very macro, big-picture economic problem is settled, by some unspecified superstrategy?
Maybe Presidential candidates will find out. Maybe they will think city, town and neighborhood economics, as well as national.
When? In 1996, stupid.

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber

 BODY:

Sex Battle, No Codes
Landing in the wake of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings and in the midst of the Barbara Wood-Randy Daniels tumult, "Oleanna," David Mamet's stringent battle of the sexes at the Orpheum, has an obviously polarizing potential. During one performance, when the college professor (William H. Macy) who is accused of harassment finally lashes back at his accuser (Rebecca Pidgeon), there was scattered applause in the audience, leading one woman, when the lights came up, to mutter angrily: "Let's find those guys who clapped."
In an interview this week, Mr. Mamet, who has, fairly or not, been accused in the past of misogyny, would not be drawn into a discussion of his intentions. "The play is not a code for some deeper feelings of mine," he said. "It's not an elaborate attempt to say anything other than what it says." 
 The first draft, he said, was written some eight months before the Hill-Thomas hearings, but it was the hearings that led him to pull it out of a drawer and work on it again.
Mr. Mamet acknowledged that a longtime friend of his, a college teacher whom he would not name, had been the target of a sexual harassment charge, and that the friend had written an article relating to it, which he has submitted to The New Yorker magazine. But Mr. Mamet, who had read the article, said that the play was written before he learned of his friend's story.
"He sent me the piece," Mr. Mamet said. "It's about his coming to see the show, and he describes himself as realizing that it isn't about him." (An editor at The New Yorker acknowledged the manuscript's existence but would not comment further, saying no decision had been made on whether to publish it.)
Asked, then, what drew him to the subject in the first place, Mr. Mamet, who has taught at Yale, the University of Chicago, New York University and other places, said: "That's like asking Capa why he took pictures of war."
Mr. Mamet also spoke briefly about the evolution of the end of the play. In an earlier version, the play ends, with several pages of dialogue in which the student tries to get her teacher to admit he is a harasser and that he has failed in his responsibilities.
The final lines were these:
CAROL: What do you see? What will you do differently?
JOHN: I...I... (PAUSE)
CAROL: It's difficult. Isn't it? (PAUSE) I know.
But as it is being performed now, the end is more oblique, more of a standoff. Both characters are exhausted, their weapons spent. The silence chills.
Here's Mr. Mamet's explanation for the change: "Stanislavski said the last 90 seconds are the most important part of the play. And Aristotle said that what one wants in a tragedy is for the hero to undergo the recognition and reversal of the situation in the same moment. That's the climax of the play. Put those two ideas together, and what you end up with, as Mel Blanc informed us, is: 'Th-th-th-that's all, folks!' "
 
'Tommy' to Be Staged
 Though it seems a natural mix at a time when producers are desperate to attract new audiences, rock-and-roll -- real rock-and-roll -- and musical theater have never been easygoing partners. On the one hand, the throbbing, high-volume rock sound is exactly what traditional musical audiences are seeking to escape, and on the other, the musical is part of a tradition that rock-and-roll has long been in rebellion against. Nonetheless, times change and extremes slouch toward the middle, and it was announced this week by Dodger Productions and the Pace Theatrical Group that "Tommy," an adaptation of the 1969 rock opera by the Who, would be presented at the St. James Theater beginning in April.
For those too old to care or too young to remember, "Tommy" was one of a number of song-cycle albums produced by the most ambitious bands of the time, among them the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Arthur" by the Kinks. "Tommy" tells the story of a young boy, just after World War II, who is traumatized by witnessing his mother's infidelity and becomes psychosomatically deaf, mute and blind. Tormented by demonic relatives, he seeks refuge in his uncanny ability to play pinball. Eventually cured, he becomes, during the early 1960's, a kind of pseudo-guru, leading true believers to salvation.
Over the years, "Tommy" has been dramatized in various ways, including a wacky 1975 movie directed by Ken Russell, but it has never received a full-scale musical theater production.
The show's developmental run at the La Jolla Playhouse in California, with a cast of 22, closed on Oct. 4. It had an eight-piece rock band, including three synthesizers, a French horn (John Entwistle of the Who played the horn on the original recording), two guitarists, bass and drums. The director, Des McAnuff, will also direct in New York.
He said this week that he and Pete Townshend, the composer and a founding member of the Who, had just begun adjusting the show for Broadway. The budget has not yet been determined, but Mr. McAnuff said it was likely the show would be recast and the size of the company would increase. He also said it was possible that new music by Mr. Townshend would be added.
"I'd like to think that this is the ultimate family show," said Michael David, one of the Dodger producers, who is 50 years old with two grown children. "Unlike most shows, you can take your kids and they'll think you're cooler when it's over."
 
'Falsettos' in the Black
 The economic news from Broadway is generally so dismal that a small-scale success is welcome. "Falsettos," the William Finn and James Lapine musical at the Golden, has earned back its investment after just 28 weeks, the producer Barry Weissler said this week. Capitalized at $1 million, and with a small cast and minimal set, it is, of course, a relatively low-budget show for Broadway, particularly for a musical. But it is rare nonetheless that a show recoups so quickly, more so since the house is small (805 seats) and attendance has dropped to about three-quarters capacity for the last several weeks.
The "Falsettos" star, Michael Rupert, will be vacationing from Nov. 5 through Nov. 21. His central role as Marvin will be taken by Adrian Zmed, who will subsequently play Marvin in the national tour, which begins in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 1.
 
A 'Guy' Takes a Vacation
 Speaking of replacements, from Nov. 9 through Dec. 22, Adam Arkin will fill in for Nathan Lane/ Detroit in "Guys and Dolls," while Mr. Lane films "Life With Mikey," with Michael J. Fox, for Touchstone Pictures.

HEADLINE: Politics of the Trade Pact: A Lawmaker Who Is Torn

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Oct. 26

 BODY:
In the neighborhoods of Maryland's Third Congressional District, where Barry Levinson's movies and Anne Tyler's novels are set, people talk about lacrosse games and crab cakes and crime and health care and, especially this week, whether Baltimore is getting a raw deal from the National Football League.
But in the Washington office of Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, the Congressman from the Third District, the talk is of little else but the North American Free Trade Agreement. Labor leaders business executives, professional lobbyists, Cabinet members and even other members of Congress, all wanting to make the case for or against the trade measure, line up daily in his waiting room like ants at a sugar bowl. 
 "This is a very active issue in terms of lobbying, more active than any other issue since I've been in Congress," said Mr. Cardin, a Democrat in his fourth term.
It makes him very uncomfortable, he says. If he votes for the agreement, he offends the labor movement, which for years has been a foundation of his political strength. If he votes against it, he will be bucking President Clinton, to whom he is devoted.
He thinks both sides have vastly exaggerated the potential benefits and drawbacks of expanded trade with Mexico. So his decision on how to vote will ultimately be a political one.
Not quirky enough to be a character in a Tyler novel and too polished for a Levinson movie, Mr. Cardin is nonetheless a Baltimorean through and through. Born and reared in a neighborhood northwest of downtown, he was first elected to the Maryland legislature when he was 23 years old and still in law school. Now 50, he has been in politics and represented many of the same constituents ever since.
He is an unusually serious politician, a member of the Ways and Means Committee who works to master complicated legislation and who would much rather be devoting his time to health care, which is what he says his constituents truly care about.
 
Stuck With Trade
 But that will be impossible, the Congressman says, until after mid-November, when Congress votes on the trade accord, which would gradually lift trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Politically, it is the most important vote facing him, Congress and President Clinton the rest of this year. The outcome will probably hinge on the votes of a couple of dozen Democrats like him who have not made up their minds on the issue.
And while most of his constituents do not know Nafta from a cheese spread, the ones who come to his office to lobby him view the agreement as a matter of life and death.
"This isn't a moral issue for me an issue of conscience," Mr. Cardin said. "I'm going to vote for it or against it depending on what I decide it means for the jobs in my district."
His district is in many respects a microcosm of the country as far as international trade is concerned. Extending from Baltimore's newly developed Inner Harbor, the district takes in two wide strips of the city and some of the northwest and southwest suburbs.
It has large Bethlehem Steel, General Motors and Westinghouse factories and a Domino Sugar refinery. It has the nonunion plants of national consumer-products companies like Procter & Gamble and McCormick, the spice company, that are eager to sell their wares in Mexico. The district also has strong unions, which fear losing jobs to Mexico. It has the vestiges of a once flowering textile industry. And it has one of the largest ports on the Atlantic Seaboard, which stands to benefit from imports and exports alike.
To help him decide how to vote, Mr. Cardin's staff is trying to evaluate how the various industries in the region might fare under the trade agreement.
 
'Faces of the Employed'
 A preliminary analysis shows that jobs would clearly be lost in the garment industry. Financial services companies like USF&G, the insurance conglomerate whose headquarters are in the Third District, would probably not be affected one way or another. Procter & Gamble, which makes Dawn, Ivory and Joy detergents in Baltimore, does not export from this plant to Mexico, so there should be no effect on jobs.
But the staff found that the steel products made in Baltimore would probably find a market in Mexico and that General Motors ought to be able to sell in Mexico many more of the commercial vans it builds at its plant on Broening Highway.
For a politician like Mr. Cardin, this kind of cold analysis may be helpful but it is generally not decisive. Even if he decides that more new jobs would be created than lost in his district as a result of the trade agreement, he says, he still may vote against it.
"I see the faces of the employed people who are vulnerable," he said. "I don't see the faces of those who will gain jobs. They don't even know who they are. Gaining jobs is just much more uncertain."
For anyone following Mr. Cardin around this week and watching the lobbying, one point is clear: If his decision boils down to who has presented the best case, the unions will win hands down.
Take, for example, Carmen Papale, the Baltimore regional director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers. In a session in Mr. Cardin's office this week, the first sentence out of Mr. Papale's mouth was, "All these years, you've been great with us."
Then he said: "This is a very serious issue. This is such a critical issue. This Nafta is so important to us."
And then he mentioned an unsubstantiated rumor that if the trade agreement is approved, London Fog might move 500 jobs and its Maryland plants to Mexico.
Mr. Cardin's next meeting was with Rodney Trump, president of the Baltimore local of the United Automobile Workers. It is much more likely, Mr. Trump said, that G.M. will close its plant in Baltimore, where 3,500 people work, and move to Mexico than it is that Mexicans will buy the commercial vans assembled in Baltimore. "Mexicans," Mr. Trump said, "don't make enough money to buy the headlight of my Chevy Cavalier."
Mr. Cardin was blunt. He told the union officials that two factors weighed against them.
First, he said: "I want to support the President. I worked hard for him, and he's the person I want in there."
Second, he said, even without the trade pact, companies like London Fog and General Motors might move.
But afterward, Mr. Cardin said he had been very impressed. "They told me directly what they thought it would mean for Baltimore, for our jobs," he said. "We haven't been able to pin the companies down on that."
Indeed, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel, for example, sent Washington lobbyists instead of executives from their Baltimore plants to see Mr. Cardin, and the pitch they made was about how good the agreement would be for their companies nationwide, not what it would do for Baltimore.
The exception to this rule about ineffective corporate lobbying has been Bailey A. Thomas, the chairman of McCormick.
The company, which has 2,000 employees in the Baltimore area, is selling $150 million worth of spices and seasonings in Mexico this year, and the market is growing by as much as 20 percent a year. Much of what the company sells in Mexico is produced there.
 
Administration Unpersuasive
 But if Mexican tariffs are cut, Mr. Thomas told the Congressman, a significant portion would probably be produced in the United States, some of it in Baltimore, and shipped to Mexico.
Over time, Mr. Thomas said, manufacturing jobs at the Baltimore plants, which pay $9 to $12 an hour, could be expected to increase by 10 percent because of additional sales to Mexico.
That, Mr. Cardin said, is the kind of information he is looking for.
Strangely, the Clinton Administration has also been generally unpersuasive, Mr. Cardin said. He recalled, for instance, that when Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, came by, he asked her for a historical example of a free-trade agreement between countries with economies as disparate as those of the United States and Mexico. (Mexico's economy is one-twentieth the size of this country's -- about the size of the economy of Southern California.)
According to Mr. Cardin, Ms. Tyson replied that no such case existed but that she saw an analogy in the way the North and South in the United States both prospered after Northern industry moved South beginning in the 1920's.
Mr. Cardin said after the meeting that Ms. Tyson seemed to be making her opponents' point. While, say, Massachusetts as a whole surely prospered, some towns in the state never recovered after their mills closed.
That is his dilemma, the Congressman said. Because he really wants to support Bill Clinton.

Selling What America Should Keep

 BODY:

Selling Our Security
The Erosion of America's Assets
By Martin and Susan J. Tolchin
427 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
 This is an important and an intensely disturbing book. The authors are Martin Tolchin, a longtime Washington correspondent for The New York Times, and Susan J. Tolchin, a public administration professor at George Washington University. The Tolchins have set out to show how the United States, in the name of global free enterprise, neo-classical laissez-faire economics and a mythical level playing field, has bartered its economic future for the temporary lure of foreign investments and the illusion that strategic industries or investment in technology don't really matter, as long as you can buy what you need somewhere in the world, at the moment. 
 "None of America's major trading partners," they write, "subscribe to the U.S. vision of free trade. None regard technology with a cavalier notion that ownership doesn't matter -- unless they are the owners. Instead, each nurtures technologies it deems vital to its economic competitiveness in the 21st century."
With this as their starting point, the Tolchins go on to show first how American policy makers' trust in a global economy -- still piously believed to be based on the laws of comparative advantage -- has sacrificed national security considerations to the point where much of our leading technology in the Persian Gulf war, for example, was dependent on foreign suppliers. But the problem transcends mere defense concerns. In the post-cold war world, it is almost impossible to disentangle a nation's security from a strong and technology-oriented economy, whether or not the connection with actual defense needs is a direct one.
Despite the constant talk about trade friction, the United States remains the one country that as a matter of policy separates trade and investments; thus foreign investment -- as distinct from trade -- is not scrutinized for any negative effects it may have. On the contrary, during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, with the horrendous deficit piling up, the country became increasingly dependent on foreign investment. Foreign buyers were given a constant walk-in tour of what the Tolchins call America's "casino economy."
By contrast, American corporations and big-time investors were notably laggard in putting money in good, innovative technology companies, which require what the Tolchins call "patient capital." (That is to say, you don't see a return on your money until a long way down the road.) Nor did the Government assist them. This contrasts with the behavior of nations like Japan -- and for that matter, the countries of the European Economic Community -- whose Governments have clear ideas of where their national security lies and how broad that definition is today.
Actually from the 1950's and 60's on, Americans thought of defense in very broad terms. Building roads, improving education and developing technology were all part of building up the national defense posture. But with the 80's, the authors point out, the definition of what was actually security shrank to a narrow, strictly military perimeter. Even in military applications, the idea of keeping a certain amount of technological productivity in this country was often sacrificed to a totally uncritical definition of global interdependence.
The ideas in this book are by no means new. The argument over whether this country should have an industrial policy -- "the notorious I-phrase" that became anathema to the Bush and Reagan White House -- has been going on for a long time. Many people have been sounding the alarm bell about the erosion of American technological advantage in industry after industry. The drift intensified through the 80's and into the 90's, as both Presidents Reagan and Bush persistently refused to avail themselves of Congressional safeguards adopted to try to keep at least part of American technology at home and intact. All this is part of the national debate.
The particular value of this book, however, lies in the abundance of fact and detail with which the authors support their thesis. Starting with the almost successful attempt of a British corporate raider to hijack the Goodyear Company, and the sale to a German group of the last American silicon wafer maker in the commercial market, they have compiled a case history of technologies and companies -- robotics, digital imaging, supercomputers and complex machine tools, among them -- where American advantage and security have been lost to what they call the "passive globalism" of the last two Administrations.
They summarize: "The ease of acquiring assets in a nation that refuses to differentiate between potato chips and computer chips virtually invites the rest of the world to snap up its choice industries."
The loss of irreplaceable assets is facilitated not only by the hordes of foreign-employed lobbyists in Washington -- many of them only recently resigned from the United States Government -- but also by the international irrelevance of so many United States laws, antitrust legislation in particular, which were created originally to regulate a game with only American players. Another contributing factor is a tax code that favors spenders, rather than savers. Worst of all is a business philosophy that seems to hold that government must always be the enemy.
The authors' suggestions for reform range far and wide. They include a kind of Export-Import Bank for technology to provide a reservoir of patient capital and an Endangered Technologies Act. Why not, they argue, provide critical technology the same protection we give the spotted owl and the snail darter?
They urge a greater pooling of resources in research consortiums; Japan, they note, has 75 of them going. Above all, they warn us that cherished ideals of American pluralism and a reliance on Adam Smith's marketplace no longer work in a constantly changing global climate.
"Participation in the global economy," they conclude, "shouldn't mean wholesale capitulation on issues that will determine the nation's national security and economic health. If a nation can't collect its own data, protect its national security and promote its economic interests without foreign intervention, it begins to look more and more like the original colonial government its forebears fought so hard to overturn."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats -- Clinton and Bush Compete to Be Champion of Change;
Democrat Fights Perceptions of Bush Gain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Battling the impression that President Bush is closing on him, Gov. Bill Clinton returned today to the basics of his strategy, playing to the interests of the vast middle class of Americans who decide every Presidential race.
Mr. Clinton and his strategists said Mr. Bush had moved closer, as they have predicted he would. But Mr. Clinton's poll taker and several other aides said today that their own surveys showed Mr. Clinton's slippage had stopped, and that he still retained a seven-point lead in their own surveys. 
 Arguing this and working to dispel the perception that Mr. Bush is gaining on Mr. Clinton, the Democratic campaign tried to renew its focus on the message that got it to this point.
 
'The Economy, Stupid'
 Mr. Clinton and his aides have said from the very beginning that those interests can be summed up in three phrases, which are on a sign in the campaign's headquarters: "Change vs. more of the same. The economy, stupid. Don't forget health care."
Campaigning in the state of almost perpetual motion that characterizes the Democratic candidate's final campaign days, Mr. Clinton made a mantra of those points today, in speeches streamlined to include only one other critical element: Don't believe anything George Bush says.
In selling that latter point, Mr. Clinton received a gift today with the disclosure of a memorandum written in 1986 by the Secretary of Defense at the time, Caspar W. Weinberger, in which Mr. Weinberger wrote that Mr. Bush, then the Vice President, had, in an Administration meeting, supported selling arms to Iran in exchange for the freeing of Americans held hostage by Iranian-backed terrorists in Lebanon.
"Today's disclosure that President Bush knew and approved of the arms for hostages deal with Iran not only directly contradicts the President's claims, it diminishes the credibility of the Presidency," Mr. Clinton said in a hastily called news conference this afternoon at a hotel in Pittsburgh.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Clinton used the disclosure to try to turn against Mr. Bush the questions of honesty and character the President has so assiduously raised about his adversary.
"President Bush says this election is about trust and character and judgment," Mr. Clinton said. "He has seriously called into question those issues and now has to answer your questions on all."
While Mr. Clinton took care to avoid seeming pleased about the disclosure of the Weinberger memo, contained in an indictment by a Federal grand jury under the direction of the Iran-contra special prosecutor, his aides greeted the news with open excitement.
The news came on a day that began with Mr. Clinton in a notably upbeat mood. Chatting with staff members and reporters aboard his jetliner this morning, the candidate was in such an apparently good mood that he even joined in joking about his weight.
Mr. Clinton's mood seemed to reflect a sense within the campaign that his slippage in popular support had stopped, at least for now, with the Democrat still well ahead of Mr. Bush.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, said today that the campaign's national and state-by-state surveys of 1,200 and 10,000 people respectively both showed the race between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush had stabilized on Wednesday and Thursday, with Mr. Clinton retaining a lead of seven points among respondents saying there was more than a 50 percent chance they would vote.
 
Last-Minute, Nonstop Tour
 While such a claim serves the campaign's interest in stemming a perception that Mr. Clinton was slipping and Mr. Bush gaining in popular support, the figure cited by the Clinton campaign does jibe with many of the independent polls published in the last two days.
With Mr. Clinton's lead seemingly intact, but -- in a year marked by extreme volatility among voters -- still fragile, the campaign has decided to try the safe strategy of focusing attention on the theme of middle-class oriented economic change that has brought the Democrats this far, while still keeping a heavy fire on Mr. Bush.
Clinton campaign strategists said this lean mixture would be the essential message Mr. Clinton would carry in his last campaign tour, a nearly nonstop swing that will last through the Election Day morning, taking the candidate in repeated visits to some of the most important contested states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kentucky Iowa, Illinois and New Mexico.
Mr. Clinton delivered that message to thousands of people gathered under a light rain in a downtown square in Pittsburgh, and an evening address in this farming city.
Calling himself the "one person in this race who really comes from the great American middle class and understands the American dream," Mr. Clinton opened with a promise to provide "basic health care to all Americans," moved swiftly on to the allure of "change" and then delved into his many and varied promises of a better, richer life for the middle class.
Woven all through, like barbed wire sewn into a tapestry, were deftly cutting observations, each glinting shard designed to draw just a little blood from Mr. Clinton's adversaries.
Fighting against slippage in his lead over Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton has in recent days demonstrated a mastery of this sort of folksy thrust, in the manner of Will Rogers with a stiletto. He used it in Pittsburgh to effect a contrast with the edgy tone of Mr. Bush's most recent attacks on him, while still sticking to the all-important economic theme.
Mr. Clinton recalled, in lightly chuckling tones meant to represent amused disbelief, Mr. Bush's remark on Thursday that Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, were crazy.
"Now, let me tell you something," Mr. Clinton told the crowd in Pittsburgh. "I'll tell you what I think is crazy. I think crazy is unemployment going up and income going down. It's 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans -- Clinton and Bush Compete to Be Champion of Change;
President Paints Rival Leading U.S. Astray

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Having battered Bill Clinton with assaults on his platform and character, President Bush tried today to challenge Mr. Clinton's claim to be the candidate of change.
Speaking in Nashville early today, the President argued that the nation would change no matter who leads it. "The real question," he said, "is not who is for change, but whose changes will make your life better and your world safer." 
 On that score, Mr. Bush argued, Mr. Clinton seeks to take the nation back to a philosophy of bigger and more powerful government that American voters, and much of the developed world, have rejected in the last dozen years.
 
An 'Active Conservative'
 By contrast, the President cast himself as an "activist conservative" who believes that individuals, not government, are the best source of economic growth and innovation.
The argument is the core of Mr. Bush's plea for a second term in office, and it played well with his audience, a convention of Kentucky Fried Chicken store owners who are by nature small business owners and risk-takers.
"It doesn't make sense that restaurant owners will somehow get richer by giving more of their money to the I.R.S.," Mr. Bush said to a burst of applause. "And at a time when every other institution is decentralizing power, why turn back to a central bureaucracy in Washington?"
The speech amounted to a fresh wrapping for the message the White House has pounded relentlessly all week: that Mr. Clinton is a danger to the nation's economy and its character.
 
Trying to Change Minds
 Mr. Bush was also seeking to provide to voters what his campaign has so far lacked: affirmative reasons for wavering voters to switch from Mr. Clinton to the President. Mr. Bush's strategists are running positive commercials about the President's second-term agenda in the campaign's final days, dovetailing with negative advertising attacking Mr. Clinton.
But for the message to succeed, voters will need to put aside their feelings about the economic record of the President's first term, something many of them seem unwilling to do so far, and by midday Mr. Bush was back on the attack circuit at a sparsely attended rally in suburban St. Louis.
Bush aides continued to say today that their candidate was closing on Mr. Clinton, a view underscored by the stop in Tennessee, the home state of Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore. As Mr. Bush arrived here, a new Mason Dixon Poll concluded that the two men were in a statistical tie here: Mr. Clinton had a five-percentage-point lead, but that was within the poll's margin of sampling error.
The aides disclosed more of a campaign schedule that will take Mr. Bush in the last four days to Midwestern and Eastern states, where he trails Mr. Clinton but where Bush strategists say the President is gaining ground.
After a daylong train trip through Wisconsin on Saturday, the President will fly to at least three battleground states on Sunday: Michigan, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Mr. Bush's shifting plans call for him to barnstorm on election eve through 14 airport rallies at undisclosed sites. The campaign is scheduled to end in Houston on Monday night.
The schedule "is not something you normally do in the dying days of a campaign," Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said in an interview on Thursday. "But when you're behind and you need 270 electoral votes, you go where you think you can get the votes."
Vice President Dan Quayle touched down today in four Western and central states. In Denver, he pressed the assault on Mr. Clinton's character by recalling Democratic opposition to Senator John Tower's confirmation as Secretary of Defense in 1989.
"Sam Nunn," Mr. Quayle said, "who led the opposition to Senator Tower, said that in three cases, including 'behavior toward women, Senator Tower falls short of the standards which must be demanded of those who would bear the awesome responsibilities of this position.' " Mr. Quayle added: "Does Bill Clinton pass the Tower test?"
 Mr. Bush's gains in recent days seemed to generate a peculiar new version of the political expectations game, in which candidates try to shape expectations of victory in ways that will best motivate voters and campaign workers.
 
A Touch of Realism
 Even as they professed confidence in a last-minute surge of support, Bush aides sought to portray a sober realism about their chances, arguing that come-from-behind victories are needed in many large states.
Campaigning in recent days, Mr. Bush has used the word "change" almost as a mocking refrain against his rival's calls for higher taxes and greater Federal spending.
"Change -- Governor Clinton and Ozone, they just keep talking about change, change, change," Mr. Bush said on Thursday in Detroit, using his pet name for Mr. Gore. "That's all you will have left in your pocket if Governor Clinton becomes President."
In Nashville today, Mr. Bush treated the topic more seriously, seeking to seize the issue for himself.
"Over the past four years, we have seen change of almost Biblical proportion," he said. "Always, the shadow of the cold war lingered right outside our window. You talk change -- well, all that has changed." Since Mr. Bush took office, the Soviet Union collapsed and the East moved toward democracy and a free-market.
"But here's the irony: at the very moment when the rest of the world is moving my way, my opponent, Governor Clinton, wants us to move the old way," he said.
 
Assails Clinton AIDS Plan
 As one example, he took aim at Mr. Clinton's call on Thursday for more spending and a new Federal official to oversee the battle against AIDS. Noting that the Government already spends more on AIDS than on any other ailment, Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Clinton favors a reflexive answer to a problem with no easy solution.
"AIDS is a national tragedy, but we don't need a bureaucratic czar in our nation's capital," he said. "A President has to set priorities, because it's your money that we're talking about."
The President has come under sharp attack from AIDS activists and experts for what they say is inattention to the epidemic and a refusal to risk political problems by trying policies like sex education.
Later, in St. Louis, Mr. Bush opened a rally by accepting the endorsement of Maryland's Democratic Governor, William Donald Schaffer. Mr. Schaffer said his decision had been difficult, but that he "had to consider what is truly best for my country."
Besides, the ebullient Governor whooped at one point: "He's an honest guy! He's my friend! He cares about people!"

HEADLINE: Delay by Yeltsin In Baltic Pullout Irritates the U.S.

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 30

 BODY:
A day after President Boris N. Yeltsin suspended a pullout of Russian troops, the independent Baltic states reacted with anger and dismay today and new questions were raised in the West regarding aid to Moscow and Russia's long-term intentions in the Baltics.
A spokesman from NATO headquarters in Brussels urged Russia not to delay the pullout, despite the logistical difficulties of housing returning troops. 
 "This is a matter of concern," the spokesman said of the decree, issued on Thursday, which said withdrawals would resume only after Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania signed agreements providing "social guarantees" for Russian troops on their territory.
 
The Russian View
 At a news conference today in Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly I. Churkin denied "linkage" between the pullout and the protection of the human rights of Russians in the Baltics. But he said that Russia's view is: "the better the human rights situation, the easier it will be for us to conclude agreements."
In Washington, the State Department called the decree "disappointing" and said the delay could jeopardize American aid to Moscow.
The bill makes all aid except food and medical relief contingent on the President's being able to report to Congress that the pullout is progressing.
In the Baltics, the decree was widely seen as an attempt to appease both Russia's unhappy officer corps and a growing nationalist opposition that has made an issue of the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Baltic states, particularly Latvia and Estonia.
With a Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's highest legislative body, scheduled to convene in December, Mr. Yeltsin has been marshaling his forces, striking out against nationalists with one hand, and now, commandeering one of their pet issues with the other.
Moscow's tough new stance, which effectively suspends a recent agreement with Lithuania, is likely to raise suspicions in the West that Russia has retained some Soviet habits, including a peremptory negotiating style and a high priority for military interests.
The Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Boris Gromov, just back from a tour of installations in the Baltics, told a news conference today that the pullout could take from "seven to eight years," because of a lack of fresh recruits to help officers dismantle the Russian bases and equipment. Mr. Yeltsin had previously set a target of 1994.
The Latvian Deputy President, Andrejs Krastins, said in Riga today that the decree was a symptom of Moscow's uncertain political climate.
"It reflects the instability of power in Russia," he said. "Russia's position changes every day with every twist and turn of its own political situation."
The Estonian President, Lennart Meri, told the Interfax news agency that the question should be put before the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 
A Diplomatic Turn
 A week ago, the Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, said the pullout of troops, now said by Russian officials to number 40,000 in the Baltics, not including family members, would be suspended because of a shortage of housing in Russia for returning officers.
Lieutenant General Gromov said 67 percent of personnel and 73 percent of equipment had already been brought back from Germany, and that the withdrawal from Mongolia had been completed. Pullouts from Georgia, Moldova and Tajikistan are being planned, he said.
But Mr. Yelstin's decree cited "profound concern over numerous infringements of rights of the Russian-speaking populations in the Baltic countries." The Russian President set a three-day deadline for the Baltic states to agree to provide "social guarantees" for Russian troops and said economic agreements with Russia would be contingent on their fulfillment.
This kind of tough language suggested a new turn for Russian diplomacy, as Moscow seeks to defend its own strategic interests against the claims of other former Soviet republics.
 
The Lithuanian Exception
 The Russian Foreign Ministry has recently stepped up its protests about the treatment of ethnic Russians living in Estonia and Latvia, where they make up more than 40 percent of the population. In both countries, families of people who moved there after the Soviet takeover of 1940 must pass special language and residency requirements before being granted citizenship and the right to vote. This has proven particularly difficult for Russians, many of whom have lived in the Baltic states for years, because during the Soviet times, Russian was a kind of lingua franca, and learning Estonian or Latvian would be a formidable task.
The decree came as a particular blow to Lithuania where Russians, who make up less than 9 percent of the population, were granted automatic citizenship rights after independence last year. The decree did not differentiate among the Baltic countries.
Yet on Sept. 8, partly as result of its more liberal policies, Lithuania signed an agreement with Russia that set an Aug. 31, 1993, deadline for the departure of the last Russian soldier from Lithuanian territory.
"The treaty became valid as soon as it was signed, and the Russians started to fulfill it immediately," said Audyus Azhubanis, press secretary to the Lithuanian President, Vytautus Landsbergis. "We cannot understand why they announced they will stop this process."
 
The Signature Question
 In Moscow today, Mr. Churkin noted that an inter-state agreement had not yet been signed by Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Landsbergis -- even though both were present at the Kremlin signing ceremonies on Sept. 8. At the time, Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary said an inter-state agreement would be signed by within a month.
Furthermore, Mr. Azhubanis said that in preparation for the Sept. 8 ceremony, both sides had agreed on a document providing "social guarantees" for the departing Russian troops. But, he said, at the last minute, the Russian side had withheld its signature.
"Now it looks as though Russia created this misunderstanding, because they do not want to withdraw their troops," Mr. Azhubanis said. "They want to exploit the issue of social guarantees."
But he said the victory of former Communists in the first round of Lithuania's parliamentary elections on Sunday may have also played a role. The Democratic Labor Party, headed by Lithuania's former party leader, Algirdas Brazauskas, has said it wants to improve relations with Moscow, and some analysts say Russia may have decided that it can win more time for the pullout if Mr. Brazauskas replaces Mr. Landsbergis as head of the Parliament after run-off elections on Nov. 8.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Aid Imperiled
 WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- Russia's indefinite postponement of the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic states has placed United States economic assistance to Moscow in peril, a State Department spokesman said today.
The spokesman, Joseph Snyder, pointed out that a foreign aid bill signed into law by President Bush on Oct. 6 stipulates that before Russia may receive its portion of $417 million approved for the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union, it must make "substantial progress" toward completing a timetable for a Baltic pullout.
Mr. Snyder said the Administration had "indicated our concern" to Russia. "We are disappointed by this announcement, but hope the problems that have arisen can be resolved expeditiously and by mutual agreement," he said
He said: "We have welcomed earlier statements that Russian troops will be withdrawn from the Baltics and expect that the Government of Russia will fulfill its political commitment to do so. We want to see agreements on troop withdrawals completed as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
A Battle of the Negatives

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
As the 1992 campaign enters its final weekend, President Bush has grasped for the offensive with an attack on Gov. Bill Clinton's credibility that clearly surprised the Democrats with its ferocity and that shows no sign of abating.
Mr. Clinton, who had been calling the shots for months, suddenly found himself in a position no front-runner wants -- slightly offstride and struggling to turn the debate back to issues more favorable to him. 
 And although this tortuous race remains unsettled, this much seems likely about the final going: Rather than ending on a high note, more nastiness is in store.
Mr. Bush's behavior on the stump in recent days was vivid evidence of what Republican strategists were saying in private: The Bush camp decided that the only thing that worked was to get negative and, for the most part, they planned to stay negative despite the obvious risks of this strategy.
New polls suggest some narrowing of the race, but they also show that Mr. Bush's own unfavorable ratings have changed little, despite the boost he got this week from new signs of economic growth that the President hailed at every campaign stop.
Mr. Bush is accusing Mr. Clinton of flip-flopping, not having any principles and not helping his constituents, but the President is in political trouble because many voters have reached those same conclusions about him.
 
Questions and Risks
 The President is also hammering Mr. Clinton on what he calls a "pattern of deception" about his draft record and other issues. But the new questions raised today about Mr. Bush's involvement in the Iran-contra affair only underscored the risk that many voters will decide that he has shown the same pattern -- raising taxes after pledging not to do so and following conciliatory policies toward Iraq before the Persian Gulf war.
This battle of the negatives comes in a year in which voters got fed up with gutter politics and were examining policy papers and getting unfiltered television views of the candidates. But the dynamics of the Presidential campaign and dozens of Congressional races across the country have made it clear that attack politics still works.
"Everyone wants to say that stuff doesn't work, but the fact is that everywhere in the country I've gone on the attack, I've made progress," said Eddie Mahe, who handles Congressional campaigns for Republican candidates.
In the Presidential race Mr. Bush's campaign oratory and paid advertising have virtually abandoned any positive message about his own ideas. By this morning, after Mr. Bush called Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, "bozos," even Barbara Bush seemed a bit taken aback by the tone of the attack.
 
'In a Heated Moment'
 "That wasn't so nice," she said in a CBS News interview. "I'm surprised George said that. But maybe that was in a heated moment."
But Mrs. Bush made it clear she was not going to ask her husband to stop the offensive. "No," she said. "Are you kidding? I certainly am not."
The Clinton team moved today to brush back Mr. Bush and turn the debate away from Mr. Clinton's record and his character and back to Mr. Bush's record.
But Mr. Clinton's advisers acknowledge that the Bush attack has been damaging. The Democratic nominee, who has long battled the image of an accommodating politician and has, indeed, offered conflicting stories about his past, will also have to stay on the attack or risk having Mr. Bush's charges stick.
"We've always said you hit back and then move on with a counterpunch," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "That's what we're doing. All of our media that Bush is going to face this weekend is on the economy and his record."
 
Failed to React Quickly
 This is clearly not what the Democrats planned as recently as a week ago, when Mr. Clinton was concentrating on looking like a winner.
The Democrats distinguished themselves by their ability to forecast an opponent's moves and then react quickly. But they seem to have failed to see the attack on waffling and trust coming, or at least underestimated its power and waited too long to respond.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton seems to be having difficulty finding ways to sharpen a political message that once seemed fresh but is now familiar to many voters.
"He has to phrase the choice for the voter again and go back to the message that worked, which was an economic-based message and the performance of the President," said Brian Lunde, a Democratic political consultant.
What makes the Clinton team's performance look sluggish in the past few days is that it was no secret that Mr. Bush was going to attack in the final going. Not only had he himself said that publicly and often, but the attack actually had been going on for some time. It only escalated and seemed to take hold in recent days, helped along by news coverage of Mr. Bush's claim that the race is turning in his favor.
The campaign against Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas should have been the least surprising of all to the Democrats. The attempt to paint Arkansas as a low-wage, high-crime wasteland replays the 1988 campaign against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's "Massachusetts miracle," and Mr. Clinton's aides consider themselves the nation's leading experts on not repeating the mistakes of the 1988 campaign.
"Clinton's people should perhaps have dealt with those problems more forcefully early in the campaign," Mr. Lunde said. "But what could he do? Did he want to raise the subject of taxes and trust? Those were the two weak links in the chain."
Mr. Bush's advisers believe the President has no choice but to keep up a relentless attack, but some Republicans questioned whether the tone was too strident and the attack too diffuse.
"It's the old spaghetti theory -- take everything you have and throw it at Clinton, and whatever sticks to the wall is good," said James Innocenzi, a Republican advertising consultant. "It's got Bush to this point, but I don't know for sure that it's going to take Bush much farther."
Mr. Mahe said the President was showing signs of his habit of becoming over-excited in his campaign oratory.
"I was feeling pretty good up until I heard about yesterday's performance," Mr. Mahe said. "He's starting to be goofy again. It's too much. Hopefully, Jim Baker or Barbara took him to the back of the plane, got a hairbrush, patted him on the tailbone and told him to settle down a bit."

HEADLINE: Religious Right Intensifies Campaign for Bush

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Little noticed since the Republican Convention in Houston, the religious right is mounting a sophisticated, high-intensity battle on behalf of President Bush that it claims can provide a margin of victory if the race continues to tighten.
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, by far the most powerful force, says it is planning to send out 40 million voter guides, which compare the three Presidential candidates' positions on issues like abortion, prayer in school, and homosexual rights. The group plans to distribute them in 246,000 churches by Election Day. On Sunday alone, 30 million voter guides will be put in churches ranging from evangelical to mainline Protestant to Catholic. 
 Mr. Robertson calls the distribution "the most comprehensive effort in the history of the country." He says well-organized evangelicals can make the difference in the Presidential race.
"The entire race will come down to who turns their people out to the polls," said Ralph Reed, executive director of 350,000-member Christian Coalition, founded in 1989 from the remnants of Mr. Robertson's Presidential campaign. "It will be the union boiler rooms and the black churches versus the evangelicals, and I think we've got a very good chance of getting our people out. I think there's going to be a lot of surprised faces on election night."
Mr. Reed said the group was working on state and local races as well as the Presidential race. But at the Presidential level the issue is not just the election, but the role that conservatives and the religious right will play in the party afterward.
The tone of the activities varies widely.
A leaflet put out by another coalition of Christian conservatives, including Operation Rescue's leader, Randall Terry, begins: "Christians beware, to vote for Bill Clinton is to sin against God." A full-page newspaper advertisement by the same group in today's USA Today raises issues of abortion, homosexual rights and condom distribution in schools and concludes: "The Bible warns us not to follow another man in his sin nor help him promote sin -- lest God chasten us. How then can we vote for Bill Clinton?" The advertisement is to run in 157 more papers this weekend.
A group of Protestant, Jewish and Catholic religious leaders denounced the ad this week, terming it "a piece of spiritual arrogance and political extremism that has no place in our public discourse."
Mr. Robertson said language referring to a voting choice as sinful was "totally inappropriate." He said a vote for Mr. Clinton would be "stupid" rather than sinful. "Billy Sunday said God can forgive sin, but stupid is forever," he said referring to a famous evangelist.
 
Morals Are Questioned
 But while citing economic issues as a reason to vote for Mr. Bush, he also questioned Mr. Clinton's morality.
"This man is supposed to be the role model for America," he said. "I just don't want somebody like that in office. George Bush is an outstanding church man, father, grandfather."
The religious right is hardly alone in mobilizing for the election. And some political experts voice skepticism about how effective it is likely to be.
"They can help in the South, where the President is most competitive already," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. "But usually in the northern states they provoke more in a counter-reaction than they give you in a direct benefit. I think they've passed their peak."
But some experts say that despite the relative lack of attention the religious right has received since the Republican convention, the movement is mounting a sophisticated, mainstream effort that far surpasses what it did in 1988.
Lyman Kellstedt, a professor of political science at Wheaton College in Illinois, who studies the political impact of evangelicals, said the religious right's activity in the Presidential race is conventional grass-roots organizing, using churches as bases. He said white evangelicals in denominations including Baptists, Pentacostals, Assemblies of God and others, make up 23 percent of the adult population.
 
'Playing the Game'
 "Political parties don't play the role they used to play, so who's going to play this role in the future?" he said. "Well, here's a player, and they're playing the game the way it ought to be played.
"If you had to choose between the National Organization for Women and the Christian Coalition, just in terms of wanting to win, you'd choose the Christian Coalition."
It is clear that many conservatives, upset with the President's record and particularly his backtracking on taxes, remain uninspired about the Bush campaign. Some prominent conservatives gathered Friday in Washington in a session that was envisioned as a way to plot a future for conservatives after an expected Presidential defeat.
But religious and anti-abortion groups groups were working hard for the President long before his recent turnaround in the polls.
"George Bush defunded Planned Parenthood," said Mr. Reed of the Christian Coalition. "He robbed Planned Parenthood of anywhere between $130 to $150 million through the Title 10, the so-called gag rule veto. That was a very courageous veto."
Along with the Christian Coalition, conservative groups like the National Right-to-Life Committee, the Family Research Council, the American Freedom Coalition and others have been mobilizing members and highlighting the conservative issues in the race.
Most are prohibited by tax-exempt status from endorsing candidates. Typically, their involvement includes phone banks and literature to mobilize their constituencies. Especially popular this year are nominally non-partisan voter score cards with selected economic and social issues -- taxes, abortion, homosexual rights, condom distribution in schools, prayer in school -- intended to give a clear message about which candidate is favored.
For the religious right, a comeback by Mr. Bush would redeem not just his campaign but their role in it. Many conservatives like Pat Buchanan, who has campaigned for the President and Republican candidates for Congress, have argued that the news media distorted the impact of the conservative tilt to the Republican convention.
"The media have an interest in marginalizing us and in portraying us as an albatross around the President's neck," Mr. Reed said.
 
Role in the Future
 At stake beyond the election is how big a role conservatives and the religious right will play in the party's future. Paul Weyrich, a conservative organizer who has little enthusiasm for the Bush campaign, said he was not at all convinced conservatives would be in control of the party whether or not Mr. Bush won.
But many experts say that particularly if Mr. Bush loses, conservatives could fill a power vacuum in the party.
"Conservatives have an important influence now, and I think it will continue to grow," Mr. Robertson said. "The key is building a coalition just as it was built under Ronald Reagan."
Mr. Buchanan added: "Conservatism is at the core of the Republican Party just like liberalism is the great motivating force in the Democratic Party. To me, a liberal Republican is a contradiction in terms."
Asked if that applied to moderate Republicans, he said: "A moderate Republican is a liberal who doesn't like to call himself a liberal."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Independent;
Perot Aides Count on a 'Silent Majority'

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 30

 BODY:
As Ross Perot prepared to join his rivals for a final weekend of cross-country campaigning, his aides placed their faith today in what they maintain is a "silent majority" of newly registered voters whose views have not been reflected in public opinion polls.
Those polls continued to show Mr. Perot's support on the decline in the wake of a week of turmoil that began when he accused Republicans of dirty tricks. 
 Mr. Perot departs Saturday morning on a two-day campaign swing that includes rallies in Tampa, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo., and Long Beach and Santa Clara, Calif. He will wrap up his campaign with a rally in Reunion Arena in Dallas on Monday.
Even as Mr. Perot continued to assert not only that he could win, but also that he could win in a landslide, his campaign officials began speaking wistfully today about the legacy of the Perot movement and of the prospects for keeping it alive after Nov. 3. Their comments stood in stark contrast to those of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton and their strategists, who would never publicly acknowledge any consideration of defeat.
 
Looking Beyond Election
 "As long as this man has a breath to breathe he will be concerned about the welfare of this country and its people," said Orson G. Swindle 3d, the director of Mr. Perot's political organization, United We Stand, America. "It is beyond my imagination that after Nov. 3 he will have less enthusiasm for this cause. I would like to see him try it again if he doesn't succeed this time."
Mr. Swindle said he hoped to maintain United We Stand as an educational and advocacy group after the election, financed perhaps by membership dues instead of by Mr. Perot.
For Mr. Perot, far more than his rivals, the sliding poll numbers could have a devastating effect on voter psychology. In a political Catch-22, many undecided voters may not support him unless the polls indicate he has a chance of winning. But the polls cannot give him that chance unless voters are persuaded to take a risk on his long-shot candidacy.
"My family and friends would all vote for Perot if they thought he could win," said Thomas Walsh, a Woodbridge, N.J., man who showed up at a Perot rally last Sunday. "I had an attorney friend tell me when Perot hits 25 percent in the polls, he'll vote for Perot."
That seemed possible a week ago, when Mr. Perot was riding a wave of momentum generated by his performances in the Presidential debates and a series of groundbreaking paid television programs.
But a CBS News poll taken Tuesday through Thursday showed that only 15 percent of those questioned either supported or leaned toward Mr. Perot. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Other polls published in the last two days have yielded similar results, with all showing Mr. Perot dropping from last week's peak of about 20 percentage points.
Mr. Perot's aides tried to make the case at a morning news briefing that the polls were not registering his support among new voters.
"We feel that these newly registered voters are out there and are for the most part going to be voting for Ross Perot," said Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's press secretary. "This is the silent majority that has never been tapped before."
But a survey released this week by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, warns against "premature euphoria" over reports about increased voter registration. Using partial data, it estimates that voter registration will be only 1 percentage point higher than in 1988.
Following the lead of her candidate, who has shown a new willingness to attack his opponents in recent days, Ms. Holman ridiculed Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton for their recent round of name-calling. She said their behavior illustrated the causes of government gridlock.
"We've got 'liars' who can't work with 'bozos' and then we've got, what, the 'ozone' that's above it all," she said, using her fingers to place quotation marks around the candidates' favorite slurs against each other.
 
More Aggressive Tack
 There were indications that Mr. Perot would be more aggressive in taking on Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush in his final round of television presentations on Sunday and Monday nights.
His Sunday program, which will be broadcast simultaneously on both ABC and NBC, is titled "Chicken Feathers, Voodoo Economics and the American Dream." Aides would not describe the program. But in recent days Mr. Perot has taken to describing Mr. Clinton as the Governor of a small state whose main industry is raising chickens while mocking Mr. Bush's adherence to the "voodoo" of trickle-down economics. He likes to offer himself as evidence of the "American Dream."
Mr. Perot is also scheduled to be interviewed on MTV, the cable music-video channel, on Sunday night.
Mr. Perot has bought a total of three and a half hours of television time on the networks on Sunday and Monday nights, including an hour on NBC on Monday that was sold for a stunning $1.8 million. He has spent a total of $24.1 million on advertising on the three networks and on Ted Turner's four cable networks -- CNN, TBS, TNT and Headline News. His 30-minute and 60-minute shows accounted for $8 million of that total.
By contrast, Mr. Bush spent $18.6 million and Mr. Clinton spent $9.9 million, according to network figures.

 POLICE CHIEF ADDRESSES LOST TRUST
Faced with what he considers to be an alarming loss of credibility for the New York City Police Department, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly lashed out at a general climate of "police bashing" in the city and at public officials "whose knee-jerk response is to criticize the police at every turn." In an effort to deal with problem of lost trust, the city agreed to Mr. Mr. Kelly's request to postpone the next police entry examination by six months to give recruiters the time to lure more minority applicants to the force.

If county legislators have their way, Suffolk homeowners will get a 2.3 percent cut in their property taxes next year, instead of the 20 percent increase proposed by County Executive Robert J.

U.S. Closes First City Bancorp

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Federal banking authorities announced tonight that they had closed the First City Bancorporation of Houston, one of the largest banks in Texas, after finding that its two largest subsidiaries were insolvent.
Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said the Government's bank insurance fund would put up about $500 million to protect depositors in First City and its 20 bank subsidiaries, which had total assets of $8.8 billion, and prepare the bank for sale to private interests. 
 Regulators said the $500 million bank bailout would be the 10th-largest ever. The Government says the bailout will be financed by the bank insurance fund, which is financed by premiums paid by banks. But many experts expect that taxpayers will eventually be called on to contribute to future bailouts.
This is the second time in four years that the Government was forced to spend heavily to deal with First City's troubles. In 1988, the F.D.I.C. contributed an emergency infusion of $900 million toward a bailout plan in which a new owner took control of the bank.
 
104th Closing This Year
 The closing of First City highlights the continued problems of many banks even as the industry as a whole is enjoying record profits because of low interest rates. Tonight's move by the F.D.I.C. brought the number of banks closed so far this year to 104, with combined assets of $36.6 billion.
Federal regulators said all offices of the 20 banking subsidiaries of First City would be open on Monday, but as "bridge banks" under F.D.I.C. control. Federal regulators said they hoped to sell the subsidiaries to private owners within three months.
Analysts said that the Chemical Banking Corporation, which already owns the Houston-based Texas Commerce Bank, had expressed interest in acquiring all or part of First City.
Andrew C. Hove Jr., acting chairman of the F.D.I.C., said depositors in the 16 First City subsidiaries that had adequate capital would be fully protected, even the 5,700 accounts in excess of the $100,000 insurance limits.
But it will be a different story for depositors in First City's four subsidiaries in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio that did not have sufficient capital. While deposits of less than $100,000 will be fully protected, depositors with accounts in excess of $100,000 will receive just 80 percent of their uninsured amount. Those 5,000 accounts with a combined $260 million might receive more than that if sales of the bank's assets exceed expectations.
Stephen R. Steinbrink, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, said his office moved to close First City after an examination of the First City Bank of Houston, the holding company's largest subsidiary, found that a management-led plan to revive the bank was inadequate.
His office found that First City of Houston, with $2.6 billion in assets, needed to make additional provisions for its reserve to cover potential loan losses. But because the bank had just $15 million in capital, Federal regulators deemed the bank insolvent.
To explain why the F.D.I.C. took this delicate move now, just four days before Election Day and in President Bush's home state, Mr. Steinbrink said, "Once we clearly identify that a bank is insolvent, we must act."
He said that First City had submitted a plan to raise more capital by selling 13 subsidiaries, but added that regulators found the plan would not do enough to shore up its capital.
Also today, the Texas Banking Commissioner, Catherine A. Ghiglieri, closed First City's subsidiary in Dallas after finding it insolvent.
First City has been an object of concern among regulators for years. Four years ago, the bank received the infusion of more than $900 million from the F.D.I.C. as part of a bailout plan that made A. Robert Abboud, the former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, First City's chairman with a mandate to turn the bank's fortunes around. But the real estate slump and an aggressive foray into foreign lending continued to generate losses, and prompted criticism of the chairman's free-wheeling style.
In August, First City gave up on its search for a merger partner and announced a plan to raise new capital to meet regulatory standards without Federal intervention.
At a news conference today, Mr. Steinbrink said: "The reason it didn't work the first time was because the plan was not sufficient to restore it to clear health. The bank that was left behind continued to suffer losses."
Federal regulators said they had ousted First City's top two executives and had appointed Edward G. Harshfield, a longtime banker, to head the bank. Mr. Harshfield, a former senior officer at Citicorp, heads the executive committee of the Federal Capital Bank in Washington and is chairman of EH Thrift Management in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Japan Says Bad Bank Loans Soared by 50% in Six Months

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Government reported figures today showing that Japan's financial crisis is growing more severe, despite its efforts to rescue the ailing banking sector.
The Finance Ministry reported that bad loans at major banks had soared more than 50 percent in the last six months. It also said that the toll of failed loans, mostly to the real estate sector, would continue to rise in the near future. 
 In another important announcement, the banks presented the outline of a long-awaited plan for writing off tens of billions of dollars of failed real estate loans. The plan calls for them to sell off their bad loans to a newly formed corporation, to be financed with money from the banks themselves. The Government insisted that not a yen of taxpayer money would be used to help the banks, but analysts said that billions of dollars in tax breaks were a keystone of the rescue package.
But financial experts dismissed the plan as inadequate, saying it was too modest given the dimensions of the bad loan problem and that it relied on financial sleight of hand rather than a clear formula for lifting the banks' burden of bad loans and getting them fresh capital.
"This is too preliminary to call a plan," said Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni & Company, an independent credit rating agency. "It's just the start of the process of creating a plan. They're starting small and will enlarge the proposal as they need to."
There was widespread agreement among banking experts that today's report showed that the Finance Ministry was still underestimating the depth of Japan's banking problems. The banks have been battered by reckless lending practices and a severe drop in property and stock prices over the last three years.
Today's announcements also suggested that Japanese taxpayers would ultimately have to bear far more of the cost of rescuing the financial industry than the Government has admitted, these analysts said.
The problems could affect other countries as well. Japanese banks had been big lenders in overseas markets, from London to Los Angeles to New York. The Government here is already worried that the failure of the banks to increase their lending in Japan is worsening a sharp economic slowdown here. By cutting back further overseas, as many analysts expect, they could also reduce the flow of loans to businesses in the United States and elsewhere, although that would also make the Japanese banks less competitive with foreign banks in the overseas markets.
Although they were said to have understated the amount of bad loans, the figures released today by the Finance Ministry still showed a sharp deterioration in banks' loan portfolios.
As of Sept. 30, the Finance Ministry reported, loans on which no interest payments had been made for six months or more came to 12.3 trillion yen, or $100 billion at current exchange rates. While that represents a 54 percent increase from $65 billion at the end of March, most analysts said they thought that if loans being supported artificially were added, the figure would probably be closer to $244 billion. Of that amount, 4 trillion yen, or about $32.5 billion, is expected to be a total loss, a 56 percent increase from 2.56 trillion yen on March 31. These figures applied to the 21 largest commercial banks, long-term banks and trust banks.
Analysts said they doubted those numbers for several reasons. One is that if a borrower makes just one payment in six months, the loan is no longer considered nonperforming. Thus some loans might be classified as current even if the borrower is not making regular interest payments.
In addition, many borrowers are paying rates that are well below market levels, since banks have been forced to make significant concessions to keep borrowers from collapse.
 
 
Interest Rate Cut
 David Snoddy, the banking analyst here for Jardine Fleming Securities, pointed out that the number of loans in which banks had cut the interest rate to these low levels had been soaring. The official figures, he said, show that the amount of loans for which the interest rate is less than 3.25 percent -- which is roughly half the market rate -- jumped to 1.989 trillion yen, or $16.2 billion, in July, from 972 billion yen in March.
"The corpse is just being kept warmed over in these cases," he said.
Mr. Noguchi said he thought that of the $244 billion in loans he estimates to be nonperforming, 10 trillion yen worth are complete losses.
The Finance Ministry first announced its intention to rescue its financial system in August, after the stock market had lost more than $3 trillion in value and the economy had slid into a severe slowdown. For two years, ministry officials denied that any sort of bailout for banks was necessary. But they finally acted when the stock market plummeted to a six-year low and signs began to appear that the failure of the ailing banks to make new loans was stifling the already weak Japanese economy.
The package announced by Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata on Aug. 18 called for the bank bailout plan announced today and some accounting rule changes that permitted banks to withhold from the public certain losses they were suffering.
 
 
Plan on Real Estate
 The plan provisions for helping banks write off bad real estate loans were complex but straightforward in principle. They were prepared by the Mitsubishi Bank, whose chairman is the head of the bankers association here.
Banks will assemble their nonperforming real estate loans and sell them to the newly formed corporation. This corporation will have capital of about $50 million, which will come from the member banks.
The purchase price of these loans will be lent to the corporation by the bank selling them. If the price of the land being held as collateral for the loan rises later, the original bank will receive any increase in the value of the loan or its underlying real estate. So the bank selling the loan will effectively still retain a financial interest in it. The "sale" will merely shuffle the loan off the banks' books.
The banks will sell the loans at less than face value. The difference between the face value and the sale level will be deducted from banks' profits before taxes. That will save the banks billions of dollars in taxes. Corporate taxes in Japan run about 50 percent of earnings.
 
Market Is Paralyzed
 Normally, when banks want to write off a loan they must do so after taxes. That means the new plan, by permitting banks to sell their loans to this new company, will save them large sums.
According to the plan, the corporation will stop buying these loans after about 5 years, and will try to sell off the land holdings over about 10 years.
That still leaves the problem of determining at what price land will be bought or sold. As Government officials generally agree, the problem today is not just that property prices have fallen, but that the market is paralyzed. There are no transactions to use a comparison to determine appropriate price levels. This means that when the banks and the new corporation buy or sell property or loans backed by property they will essentially be able to set prices where they like.
"The problem is not that prices would go up or down," one senior Finance Ministry official said in a briefing for reporters. "The problem is that people don't know the price."
But perhaps the biggest problem, Professor Noguchi said, is that the plan would probably benefit only banks that are better off. It requires the banks to have large amounts of capital with which to finance the write-offs, but that is something the medium-sized and smaller banks lack, he said.
"The system as a whole can cope," he said. "The problem is the marginal banks."
Some experts said that even though the Government had previously pledged not to use taxpayer funds for the bailout, the plan outlined today would give the banks billions of dollars in tax breaks to help them absorb the costs.
"The key to the whole scheme is the tax advantages," Professor Noguchi said. "The banks have obtained a tax benefit, a huge benefit, and that is what they are relying on."
Added J. Brian Waterhouse, the banking analyst here for James Capel Pacific Ltd., "This is not going to solve the real estate problem, and it's not going to solve the bank problems."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Al Gore;
Gore and Clinton Share Language of Their Own

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 30

 BODY:
Looking a bit stiff and sleepy, Senator Al Gore sat on a stage listening to his running mate speaking from halfway across the country over a television hookup that had linked them both to dozens of union halls. Then, something made him toss his head and chuckle.
Gov. Bill Clinton was stealing his lines. 
 Mr. Gore has concluded hundreds of speeches by saying: "They've run out of time. They've run out of excuses. They've run out of ideas, and on Nov. 3, with your help we're going to run them out of office." The fact that Mr. Clinton now sometimes does the same is indicative of the unusual role Mr. Gore is playing on the Democratic ticket.
 
Clinton's Political Twin
 When the Democratic Presidential nominee picked another young, moderate Southerner to run with him in July, traditional notions of ticket balancing went out the window. In three and a half months of campaigning since then, Mr. Gore has become Mr. Clinton's political twin, intellectual sidekick and traveling buddy. Along with their wives they have turned eight bus trips into smiling double dates that projected the ticket's defining image.
At the end of the last bus trip Monday, after nearly 15 hours of joint campaigning across North Carolina, the two candidates were still locked in conversation in the back of their bus. Midnight had passed, yet for more than hour they kept their entourages waiting on the chilly tarmac of an isolated airport while they talked.
"These guys spend so much time together that they really have their own deal worked out, and everyone, even the staff, is looking at it from the outside," said Robert Squier, a political consultant for the Democrats. "They are constantly trading off ideas so that it is not only one message but it has gotten to be one language."
But, there is only one Presidency. Mr. Gore was ambitious enough to seek it in 1988, before he was 40 years old. Sometimes he still seems to be adjusting to his supporting role in this campaign. But in a recent interview Mr. Gore insisted it has not been that difficult. "Bill and I share so many basic ideas and dreams for what the country ought to do," he said, "that it is an opportunity to focus on those broader goals."
 
Fascinated by Complex Issues
 Both men are steeped in the precepts of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of office holders, most of them Southern, seeking an alternative to the liberalism that has dominated the party since the 1960's.
When Mr. Gore speaks of his running mate, he emphasizes their philosophical affinity and shared fascination with complex policy issues. Their relationship, he said, has developed through long conversations on topics like the need to devise an American version of the collaboration among Japanese universities, businesses and government agencies. Mr. Gore has fully embraced not only Mr. Clinton's message of change, but also his specific proposals.
Indeed, for the good of the overall campaign, Mr. Gore has tempered his vigorous advocacy of environmental causes, delaying a major policy address on the topics until today and delivering it here in New Hampshire, far from any of the big industrial states where it might cost votes and where the election may be decided.
The speech itself is a paradigm of moderation, for a man who trumpets imminent global dangers in his best-selling book, "Earth in the Balance." Mr. Gore dwelled on assertions that the Bush Administration has undermined environmental standards but never said how strictly a Clinton administration would enforce the standards.
While avoiding any mention of politically delicate issues like automobile fuel-efficiency standards or endangered species protection, Mr. Gore backed away from Government intervention on his major proposal to encourage the growth of environmentally sound industries. "We will use market forces wherever possible to accomplish our goals," he said.
Like most Vice-Presidential candidates, Mr. Gore has attacked the ticket's opponents, mostly through dozens of small events designed to produce local television coverage. His tone is mocking and derisive. Several times a day he draws laughs, saying, "If George Bush went to Hollywood and made a movie, they'd have to call it 'Honey, I Shrunk the Economy,' and if he made a sequel they'd have to call it, 'Honey, I Blew Up the Deficit.' "
Mr. Gore resists any suggestion that he has been relegated to the delivery of red meat lines. "I haven't done that, in the traditional way," he said.
"I would like to think that I've done it in a very substantive and thorough way that is well documented," he said, noting his heavily footnoted speeches accusing Mr. Bush of coddling President Saddam Hussein of Iraq before the Persian Gulf war.
Although he has improved the wooden delivery that dogged his 1988 candidacy, Mr. Gore remains enigmatically inconsistent on the campaign trail. On a given day he can be rousing and witty at one event, dull at another even as he delivers the same speech. While Mr. Clinton has a polished sense of cadence and uses personal reminiscences to connect with audiences, Mr. Gore can seem mechanical and distant.
His performance improves noticeably in question-and-answer sessions with ordinary voters, perhaps as a result of his having conducted some 3,000 town meetings with Tennessee voters during his 16 years as a Representative and Senator. On these occasions he explains complex issues like welfare reform by carefully defining terms and alternatives with the patience of a high school teacher.

HEADLINE: Trouble, but No Time Bomb, at Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The savings and loan mess was swept under the rug during the 1988 Presidential campaign only to explode immediately afterward. Whether the nation's commercial banks are a similar time bomb has emerged as an issue in this year's campaign.
Ross Perot says both Republicans and Democrats are trying to hide a crisis in which commercial banks may require a huge taxpayer bailout. President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton say the system is fundamentally sound, despite some problem banks. 
 As politicians wrestle over how large the problem is and who is to blame, Federal banking regulators insist they have nothing to hide. They like to recall that months ago they stated their intention to step up the pace of closing weak banks on Dec. 19, when bank regulations, required by Congress last year, take effect.
 Indeed, tonight, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation called a news conference to announce that had closed the troubled First City Bancorporation of Houston. The move came after months of speculation that the bank would fail in its efforts to strengthen its capital on its own.
The closings will certainly make the situation appear more dire. But more than a dozen banking experts in Government, industry and academia said in interviews that they did not see a crisis akin to the savings and loan bailout, which will cost taxpayers more than $200 billion.
Yes, the commercial banking industry is fragile. But it is far stronger than the hemorrhaging savings and loan industry was four years ago.
 
'Misleading' Assumption
 "To assume the commercial banking industry is the savings and loan industry in sheep's clothing is terribly misleading," said James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.
And L. William Seidman, the former chairman of the F.D.I.C., said: "The disaster scenarios we're seeing are based on a total collapse in real estate markets in the future. The real estate markets are terrible and will stay terrible, but I don't think they will get a lot worse."
Like the savings institutions, the ailing banks are usually plagued by problem loans for commercial real estate, including office buildings or shopping malls. Unlike most savings institutions, some banks are also saddled with soured loans for leveraged buyouts, oil and gas exploration and third world nations.
Still, Federal regulators insist that the worst of the commercial bank crisis is over. They project that they will shut 100 to 125 failing banks, with combined assets of $76 billion, in 1993. That compares with an average of 175 failures annually during the last four years. But the amount of assets of failed banks, at $76 billion, would be a record amount for one year.
As for the cost, the Government says it will put up about $13 billion to protect depositors in those failed banks. Regulators say that these costs will be covered by the deposit insurance premiums collected from the banking industry. These premiums go into a bank insurance fund that is already short of money.
Banking experts are leery of the Government's estimates. Regulators systematically underestimated the costs of the savings and loan bailout. Some experts say they are certain that taxpayers will be called on to make up the difference between what the bank insurance fund takes in from premiums paid by banks, and what is needed to finance the bailout of commercial bank depositors.
The F.D.I.C.'s latest estimate of the overall costs of bank closings through 1996 -- $45 billion -- could be underestimated by tens of billions of dollars, these experts say, especially if the nation falls back into recession or if real estate values continue to move downward.
"They're giving a very rosy projection, no matter how you cut it," said Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College. He predicts that the Government will need $69.7 billion to protect depositors at failing commercial banks in the next few years.
 
 
If a Giant Stumbles
 Analysts also say that all projections are out the window if one or two banking giants fail.
And that is a crucial difference between the bank situation and the savings and loan crisis. If a single huge bank fails, the Government might have to come up with $10 billion to protect depositors.
Indeed, with Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, having difficulties, some pessimistic analysts said its collapse alone could overwhelm the system. But Government officials and most analysts say Citicorp is slowly but surely on the mend, as are the few other shaky institutions among the top 100.
Despite all such assurances, suspicion lingers that there may be a December surprise.
A big reason is the gap between the number of banks that regulators said a year ago that they would have to close in 1992, and the number they have actually closed so far this year. Projected for closing were 200 institutions with combined assets of more than $80 billion; in fact, 85 banks with $29 billion in assets had been closed through Oct. 16.
Here is how Andrew C. Hove Jr., the acting chairman of the F.D.I.C., answers skeptics who say that the Government is holding back on a huge wave of closings until after Election Day: In Congressional testimony this week, he said the main reason for the lower-than-expected number of closings was not an orchestrated slowdown, but the fact that "lower interest rates have kept many doomed institutions afloat in the short run, and low rates have even saved some institutions."
Banks often pay 3 percent for deposits and lend at 7 percent or more -- considerably more on credit cards -- giving them huge profit margins that helped to beef up their capital. The more capital a bank has, the better it can withstand loan losses.
 
 
Faster Closings
 One slowdown was orchestrated, however. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 was intended to compel regulators to close troubled institutions faster, hoping this would prevent bank losses and Government bailouts from mushrooming.
Some lawmakers wanted the tough new rules to take effect in December, when the law was enacted. But other lawmakers -- and some Administration officials as well -- wanted enforcement delayed for a year. They prevailed. On Dec. 19, regulators will be required, with few exceptions, to shut down within 90 days banks that are critically undercapitalized -- that is, banks with capital of less than 2 percent of assets. Those who argued for delay feared angry executives and depositors -- and voter backlash -- if banks were closed before they were at death's door.
The nation's 12,000 federally insured banks are often divided into two groups: the 10,500 healthy ones and the 1,500 weak ones. Of the weak ones, the F.D.I.C. has identified 1,044 problem banks, with $568 billion in assets, as requiring close scrutiny.
The troubled banks are large and small, and are located disproportionately in New England as well as in New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Texas and California.
The F.D.I.C. has identified 46 banks with assets of $19 billion that will now be classified as critically undercapitalized. Veribanc Inc., a Massachusetts-based bank rating agency, says this list includes First City, the Bank of San Francisco and the Burritt Interfinancial Bancorporation of New Britain, Conn.
The Bush Administration attributes the banking industry's problems to the Democrats in Congress. They failed to pass the President's bank proposals, which he said would strengthen banks by removing barriers to their expansion across state lines and into new services, including insurance and securities.
Governor Clinton and the Democrats trace the commercial banks' woes to the go-go 1980's and the deregulation of the Reagan-Bush years.
 
Fear of Rate Increases
 Low interest rates have resulted in record profits for the banking industry this year, but this rebound does not mean all is well. "There is a concern that these operating profits obscure the fact that there are parts of the banking system that remain very weak," said Robert R. Glauber, a Treasury official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations who is a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Some lawmakers are urging far-reaching changes in the industry. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, has proposed setting up core banks that could use Government-insured deposits only for safe, traditional loans to small businesses and consumers.
"The basic problem is you have an industry that was structured for a regulated time, but now exists in a deregulated world," Mr. Schumer said. "Until that changes, the banking industry is going to be in a fundamental state of disequilibrium."

In 1988, more than 85 percent of Cuban-American voters in Florida cast their ballots for George Bush. But sensing that Mr. Bush is vulnerable this year, the Clinton campaign has stepped up its drive to win the support of the ethnic group both sides regard as a key to the state's 25 electoral votes.
With the latest polls showing the Presidential race a dead heat here, in the nation's fourth-most-populous state, even the slightest shift among Cubans, who vote Republican more consistently than any ethnic group in the nation, could be decisive. With such stakes, Gov. Bill Clinton has made two forays into the Republican stronghold of Little Havana and has used Spanish-language radio commercials and numerous appearances by surrogates to offer his anti-Castro credentials. 
 Mr. Clinton got a big lift on Tuesday when Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful Cuban-exile lobbying group, flew to Tampa to meet with him. Though he has formally endorsed Mr. Bush, Mr. Mas infuriated Republican leaders by then issuing a statement saying any fears that the Cuban-American community may have had about a Clinton Administration and its attitude toward Fidel Castro "have dissipated today."
 
Heavy Turnout Expected
 Statewide, Cuban-Americans account for fewer than 10 percent of the registered voters. But because they go to the polls at a much higher rate than the population as a whole, over 90 percent in some precincts, and have tended to vote as a block, they have often provided the margin of victory for Republican candidates in recent years.
"In a close general election in which Cuban-Americans turn out more heavily than anyone else, they can give a Republican candidate a net gain of up to six percentage points," said Robert Joffee, director of the Mason-Dixon Florida Poll, an independent opinion-research group here.
No one in the Democratic Party here expects the majority of Cuban-Americans to vote for the Democratic ticket. But party leaders and poll takers said Mr. Clinton had a chance to win between a quarter and a third of the Cuban vote. "And in a close race in Florida, that could be enough to tip the balance," said Simon Ferro, the state party chairman.
Mr. Clinton's backers say the Democratic nominee is attracting Cuban voters because of his early support for the Cuban Democracy Act, which tightens the American economic embargo of Cuba. Mr. Clinton endorsed the measure on April 23 during a speech in Little Havana, in which he criticized Mr. Bush's Cuban policy as another example of the President's failure to be tough with dictators.
 
Cheering for Clinton
 "I think this Administration has missed a big opportunity to put the hammer down on Fidel Castro and Cuba," Mr. Clinton told hundreds of cheering Cuban-Americans at a dinner that raised $125,000 for his campaign.
Days after Mr. Clinton's speech, Mr. Bush reluctantly endorsed the bill despite reservations about provisions affecting United States allies and American companies whose foreign subsidiaries do business with Cuba, and signed it last week. But Mr. Clinton's quick, enthusiastic endorsement, his supporters say, gave him instant credibility among Cuban-American voters and neutralized a traditional Republican electoral advantage.
"He can't be tagged as an agent of Communism or a liberal who is going to cozy up to Fidel, as other nominees were," said Mr. Ferro, who is Cuban-American. "Once you strip them of that weapon," he said, referring to the Republicans' image as the only anti-Castro political force, "you can deal with them on other issues, like the economy."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Taxes;
Clinton Promises to Protect Middle Class on Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Faced with attacks from President Bush and skepticism from outside experts about his spending and tax proposals, Gov. Bill Clinton has begun to emphasize that he would cut back spending for new programs rather than raise the taxes of middle-class Americans.
"If the tax proposals I have made do not fund the spending levels I have proposed," Mr. Clinton said Thursday night at a town meeting in Secaucus, N.J., "then I will scale back the spending, cut other Government spending or both. I will not lower the income levels to raise taxes for the programs I have proposed." 
 Mr. Clinton has proposed raising the top tax bracket to 36 percent from 31 percent on family incomes over $200,000 a year and single people's incomes over $150,000. He would give a small tax reduction to families he describes as middle income: those with incomes below $80,000. Families with incomes between $80,000 and $200,000 would not have their taxes changed, according to the Clinton staff.
In an interview today on the ABC program "Good Morning America," Mr. Clinton said he believed his tax estimates were "good and sound." But he said that if he was wrong and tax revenues proved insufficient, "We might have to phase in the health care program over a couple of more years; we might have to slow down the education programs."
 
Independent Experts' Views
 The new emphasis Mr. Clinton has been placing on his tax policies seemed to be a response to statements by President Bush's staff that the Clinton spending proposals could require higher taxes on Americans with incomes as low as $20,000.
Independent budget experts who have analyzed the Clinton figures find no merit in the Bush Administration's calculations, but many do question whether some of Mr. Clinton's tax measures could raise as much money as he intends and whether some of the spending cuts he has offered are practical.
Mr. Clinton refuses to make the kind of absolute pledge against raising taxes on the middle class that Mr. Bush made during the 1988 campaign.
"If the money doesn't come in, then we ought to find some other part of the budget to cut or we ought to phase in the programs over a longer period of time," he said Thursday on the NBC News program "Today."
"Now, that's not the same thing as saying 'read my lips,' in the event of an economic emergency," he continued. "What would happen if the deficit went up by $100 billion more than anybody thought? What would happen if interest rates went haywire? I mean, I can't predict everything that could happen in a very tough global economy."
 
Change in Figures
 Mr. Clinton's statements on who would be entitled to the middle-class tax cut have changed somewhat recently, but the difference seems to be more apparent than real.
On Oct. 11, in his first debate with Mr. Bush and Ross Perot, Mr. Clinton said the tax relief would go to "middle class people with families with incomes of under $60,000." Now, he is saying the figure is $80,000.
Gene Sperling, economic policy director of the Clinton campaign, said in an interview today that in the debate, Mr. Clinton was thinking in terms of taxable income, or income after deductions and exemptions are taken. Afterward, Mr. Sperling said, the staff advised Mr. Clinton to begin talking about adjusted gross income, or total income, since that is the way voters generally think of their own income.

HEADLINE: Trends Collide in 3d District Rematch

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
For the second time in two years, voters along Connecticut's middle coastline face the same choice for Congress: Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat who scraped her way to a 7,000-vote victory in 1990, or Tom Scott, a Republican and a former State Senator best known as the archfoe of the state income tax.
In this season of widespread voter discontent, Ms. DeLauro could find her incumbency a handicap, and Mr. Scott is quick to characterize her as a Washington insider because of her work with Emily's List, a political-action committee that supports women running for office, and the seven years she spent on the staff of Senator Christopher J. Dodd. 
 But it is also expected to be a good year for women, and the rage over the state income tax, enacted in 1991 after bitter debate, seems to have diminished. Those factors could undermine Mr. Scott's bid to become the Congressman from the state's Third District, which zigs north from Stratford to Wallingford, encompassing New Haven and returning to the coastline at a town called Clinton.
A poll released by Quinnipiac College found Ms. DeLauro firmly in front, with 56.8 percent of 456 voters queried between Oct. 23 and 28 saying they would support her, compared with 24.6 percent supporting Mr. Scott. However, 18.6 percent were undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 6 percent, according to the college.
The district, like much of the rest of Connecticut, is reeling under the impact of the recession. The economy is a major issue for voters here, and both Mr. Scott and Ms. DeLauro have addressed it, in different ways.
 
Different Styles
 Ms. DeLauro points to her record in Congress, listing votes for a highway jobs bill and a proposed bill that would make job creation a requirement of the Clean Water Act. Mr. Scott emphasizes reducing the Federal deficit as the first step toward reviving the economy. He also said he would try to get a seat on the House Armed Services Committee, "to fight for defense jobs in Connecticut."
On the stump, Mr. Scott has a button-down sartorial style, his hair close clipped and his delivery dry but fact filled. His opponent mixes friendliness and fire, with an elfin bob framing her intense gaze. Mr. Scott has a power base in Milford, a city of 53,000 that runs the gamut from blue-collar to well-to-do. Ms. DeLauro retains a solid base in New Haven, the largest municipality in the district, where voters chose her at a rate of more than 5 to 1 in 1990.
Another major difference is their positions on taxes. Ms. DeLauro has proposed increasing taxes on the wealthiest tier of Americans, while Mr. Scott heads the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee, an anti-tax lobby formed shortly after his loss to Ms. DeLauro.
He is opposed to abortion, except in cases of rape or danger to the mother's health. Ms. DeLauro favors abortion rights.
Mr. Scott spent part of a day recently at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Milford, where his father was chairman of the Board of Aldermen and initiated his son into the ways of politics at the age of 8, when the boy began licking stamps and handing out fliers for one of his father's campaigns. His mother was a nurse in a New Haven hospital.
At the stop, a campaign worker trailed one woman across the parking lot and supervised the installation of a bumper sticker reading "Tom Scott/Change Congress" on the back of her aging maroon Thunderbird.
"You have my vote," chortled one elderly woman, as she shook Mr. Scott's outstretched hand. "And so does Perot." Mr. Scott's mother, Dorothy, greeted people and handed out campaign fliers, wearing a T-shirt that declared that she was "Tom Scott's Mom."
On Monday, Ms. DeLauro stood in the gray chill of a New Haven parking garage, greeting nurses, secretaries and interns in surgical scrubs as they raced through a pedestrian tunnel leading from Yale-New Haven Hospital. "Oh my goodness, this is a great honor," gasped one woman in a lab coat, as she was introduced. "No," said Ms. DeLauro. "My honor."
Ms. DeLauro is the daughter of a longtime New Haven Alderwoman, Luisa DeLauro, who represents Wooster Square, a historically Italian neighborhood. Representative DeLauro is married to Stanley Greenberg, a prominent Washington political consultant who heads the firm of Greenberg/Lake and who has been working on the campaign of Democratic Presidential candidate Gov. Bill Clinton.
Reflecting her family, the campaign mixes grass-roots approaches with sophisticated techniques, like television commercials aimed at showing her as an activist representative, in touch with the needs of her constituents. Mr. Scott said he considers that message fraudulent.
"She's just deceiving the voters, and her husband, the pollster, is manipulating her every move," Mr. Scott said. "She can't credibly say she is for change. She was a lobbyist, and she was a Congressional bureaucrat. That's all she's done."
But the DeLauro campaign is being run on her record, which includes pushing for tax cuts for the middle class as part of a bill that was vetoed by President Bush.
Ms. DeLauro, whose campaign handouts describe her as a "cancer survivor" -- she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986, and has since been given a clean bill of health -- also urged increased attention for women's health issues and joined a House task force to change health care. She caught the attention of the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, and brought him late last year to Hamden, a town in her district, for a poignant discussion with middle-class residents who had lost their jobs in the recession and were faced with losing their houses, their cars and much of their way of life.
"We call her the ubiquitous Rosa," said Kathi McDonnell-Bissell, executive director of the Milford Senior Center, where Ms. DeLauro stopped recently for lunch and a country-and-western dance with elderly people. "She is a problem solver."
Both candidates have studiously avoided the kind of verbal warfare that dominated their last race. Mr. Scott seemed bemused as he described debating "an empty chair" on a radio station, because, he said, Ms. DeLauro refuses to face him. Her campaign staff said there were so many invitations to debate that they could not accept them all. But they have appeared together in two televised debates, both notable for the candidates' subdued demeanors.

HEADLINE: Dow Posts Drop of 19.99, But Has Gain for Week

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks, under pressure from unexpectedly soft economic data and a drop in bond prices, declined yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 19.99 points, closing at 3,226.28. For the week, however, the Dow gained 18.64 points. Yesterday, losers nudged out gainers on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 201.9 million shares. Traders said the sale of a large block of stock pressured the market at the close. 
 Two new opinion polls showing President Bush in a near dead heat with Gov. Bill Clinton served only to heighten pre-election anxiety.
The market had already virtually factored in a Clinton victory. While individual stocks showed reactions to specific news items, analysts noted few trends. "People don't want to make any major moves," said Steve Poling, an executive vice president at Fortis Advisers Inc.
"The market doesn't like uncertainty, and this is becoming more uncertain," Mr. Poling said.
David Bostian, chief economist at Herzog Heine Geduld, said: "Either way, I think the market will rally after the elections. No matter who wins, people will start making decisions that were put on hold."
Economic data continued to show weakness. The University of Michigan survey showed consumer confidence falling. The Chicago purchasing managers group's index fell to 49.7 in October from 59.6. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes in September dropped 1 percent.
Despite the signs of economic weakness, bond prices fell as investors bailed out of positions ahead of the election, pushing yields higher.
Shares of Curaflex Health slumped 3, to 5 1/2, in over-the-counter trading after it reported third-quarter profits below analysts' expectations. Smith Barney cut its rating, and Morgan Stanley lowered estimates.
Cooper Industries continued to fall on the New York Stock Exchange after it announced disappointing earnings on Thursday. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; Kidder, Peabody, and Lehman Brothers all cut their ratings. It lost 3/8, to 45 7/8.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 2.18, to 418.68. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.43, to 381.72.
The Big Board's composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.85, to 230.57. The average share was down 12 cents.
The Nasdaq index fell 0.65,to 605.17.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,067.783, down 12.991, or 0.32 percent.
John Blair, head trader at County NatWest, said it was possible that the prospect of a Bush victory upset some investors by raising the expectation of "four more years of gridlock" with a Democratic Congress.
Mr. Bostian said that "even though Bush may have closed in, my impression is that Clinton still has a lead in the electoral college."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Drop 1%; Consumer Confidence Is Off

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Ending a pre-election week in which a stream of economic indicators continued to point to stunted recovery, the Commerce Department said today that new-home sales fell slightly in September. In addition, nongovernment bodies found consumer confidence and Chicago-area industrial activity eroding in October.
The findings, said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, are "consistent with a very sluggish economy." 
 Today's data, like Tuesday's superficially optimistic report on national output, required close inspection.
Home sales edged down 1 percent, to an annual rate of 617,000, last month, the Commerce Department said. Increases in the Northeast and South were more than offset by declines in the Midwest and West.
 
August Drop Is Reversed
 This, however, was accompanied by a sharp upward revision for August, one that transformed what had been a 6.1 percent drop into a 1.6 percent advance. This change, based on new data, suggested to some that housing activity probably bottomed last spring, but analysts cautioned against expecting large gains.
"At best we're going to flounder at this level," said Samuel D. Kahan, economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. Mr. McKelvey added that prospects did not seem bright if current low mortgage rates did not generate more than about 600,000 sales.
The sales figures suggest annual housing starts, which include the dormant apartment sector, of little more than one million. The National Association of Home Builders has been projecting a 10 percent rise in 1993, to 1.32 million.
As for consumer attitudes over all, the University of Michigan reported its Index of Consumer Sentiment slipped to 73.3 in October, virtually unchanged from its midmonth estimate; September's figure was 75.4. This was the fourth straight monthly decline, matching the drops in the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey published last Tuesday.
Consumer assessment of current conditions dropped to 82.5 from 83.7, reflecting downbeat views of jobs and incomes. But expectations edged up to 67.5 from 66.4, according to subscribers of the proprietary report. The expectations element is part of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is intended to forecast the economy.
In a third report, Chicago purchasing managers said their October index -- a composite of several manufacturing-related factors like new orders and inventory -- tumbled to 49.7 from 59.6, the biggest decline since May 1980. This followed seven months of broad growth.
Production slowed sharply as new orders slumped and backlogs shrank, the industrial managers found.
On the other hand, many analysts had considered the August index too high and at odds with the depressed index compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
 
National Figures Due Monday
 Nationwide purchasing managers' figures for October are to be published on Monday.
Yet another survey, this one by Dun & Bradstreet, reported today that incorporations of new businesses climbed to 58,248 in June, up 12.8 percent from a year earlier. Incorporations were 6.9 percent higher for the first six months of the year.
Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet, said the rebound, after five annual declines, represented "a resurgence in entrepreneurial activity."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In Their Own Words

 BODY:

PRESIDENT BUSH -- In a speech to Kentucky Fried Chicken owners yesterday in Nashville.
"Yes, AIDS is a national tragedy. But we don't need a bureaucratic czar in our nation's capital. We need more compassion in our hometowns. 
 More education. More caring.
And a President has to set priorities, because it is your money that we're talking about. And if you look at Governor Clinton closely, you see a philosophy where bureaucrats in Washington carve out the exact same programs to try and solve problems facing people in Nashville or Nashua or anywhere.
You might call this old-fashioned idea trample-down economics. Tramples down business with these deadly new mandates and regulations. Tramples down individual initiative with higher taxes. And tramples down the dreams of people with the power of that bureaucracy, the power of bureaucrats."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON -- In a speech yesterday at a rally in Pittsburgh.
"Mr. Bush also said we were crazy yesterday. Now, let me tell you something. I tell you what. It takes one to know one.
I'll tell you what I think is crazy. I think crazy is unemployment going up and incomes going down. It's 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance. It's one in 10 Americans on food stamps. It's America going from first to 13th in the world in wages under trickle-down economics. Crazy is "read my lips" and then signing the second-biggest tax increase in history. Crazy is the candidate asking us to trust him with four more years when we now know he said to Mikhail Gorbachev, don't pay any attention to what I say trying to get re-elected.
When he's running a government where the F.B.I. is investigating the Justice Department and the Justice Department is investigating the F.B.I. They don't have any time for crooks any more. They're too busy looking into each other. They do have time to investigate my mother's passport file. Talk about crazy."
 
ROSS PEROT -- In an interview broadcast yesterday with David Frost, when asked about accusations that he is paranoid.
"No. 1, I'm not paranoid. No. 2, a great deal had been written and said about me before I started this process. Part of the political process in our country, particularly from one party, is when you have a candidate who is attractive to the people, and who can communicate with the people, is to try to redefine his character. You will never find the word "paranoid" used once in all of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of words written about me before this started. All of these new traits, I laugh, I say, I'll be, you know, I'll be glad to go back to being the person I really am, as opposed to the person they've redefined."

HEADLINE: Lufthansa's Arizona Flying School

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GOODYEAR, Ariz.

 BODY:
Barring a cloudburst or a violent sandstorm known locally as a devil duster, skies over the Sonoran desert here are dotted with planes. This is where pilots train to fly jumbo jets -- using single- and twin-engine propeller planes for practice.
And while they talk with the control tower in English, they converse after-hours in German, Japanese, Spanish and Chinese. This is not some modern version of the Lafayette Escadrille, those volunteer pilots from many nations who battled the Germans in the skies over Europe in World War I. These are budding pilots and co-pilots with Lufthansa German Airlines, All Nippon Airways of Japan, Iberia Airlines of Spain and EVA Airways of Taiwan, a year-old carrier scheduled to begin daily nonstop flights to Los Angeles and New York this year. 
 "We've been training our future pilots here almost 25 years," said Willy Kuhweide, a Lufthansa pilot and the president of Airline Training Center Arizona Inc. "The Arizona desert has some of the best weather in the world for year-round flying."
 
 
Germans Are Right at Home
 Lufthansa likes it so well in Goodyear, a city of 6,250 people 17 miles west of Phoenix, that in March it bought the 23-acre center for $12 million from the PS Group of San Diego, formerly Pacific Southwest Airlines.
For Lufthansa, the purchase is a badly needed opportunity to make money. Although it is well regarded for its technical and mechanical skills, the state-owned carrier lost $368.8 million in just the first six months of this year. To stem the red ink, the airline plans to eliminate 8,000 jobs and stopped hiring pilots.
In April, it will stop training its own pilots here and in Bremen, Germany, although Heiko Weber, executive vice president and treasurer of this center, said Lufthansa would resume its training here in 1994 to avert a shortage that is expected to result from the retirement of many pilots in 1996 and 1997.
In fact, 60 to 70 percent of airline captains worldwide are expected to retire over the next decade, according to the International Air Transport Association. Conceivably, that could mean a lot of business for Lufthansa.
But to cope with the shortages, some airlines are setting up their own training centers. All Nippon Airways, which has trained 115 pilots here and currently has 100 student-pilots enrolled, will open its own $16 million flight center near Bakersfield, Calif., in mid-November. It says it will send 130 students here in the next two years, but will do its own training after that.
"Like the other Japanese airlines, we face a critical pilot shortage, partly because the Japanese self-defense forces don't produce enough pilots," said Thomas Fredo, a spokesman for All Nippon Airways. "By the year 2,000, we estimate we will need about 2,500 pilots, up from 1,200 now."
To insure adequate flight crews for their expanding routes, Japan Air Lines and All Nippon recently hired some 300 experienced pilots and co-pilots, most of them from the United States and Europe, rather than train their own.
It is difficult to judge just how lucrative one new market will be for the center: it will begin taking United States enrollees, the first 10 of whom are expected in mid-November.
Rather than train students of their own, American carriers typically recruit experienced pilots from the military or graduates of one of the more than 100 colleges and private schools that offer flight training. While the decline in military training in this post-cold-war era would seem to give Lufthansa an opening, many carriers may hire from the vast pool of experienced pilots out of work because of the failures of Pan Am, Eastern, Braniff and Midway.
No one knows exactly how many pilots there are. But they probably do not come close to the 70,000 pilots that the Federal Aviation Agency recently estimated the large airlines and commuter lines will require over the next 12 years because of expansion, retirement and attrition.
 
From the Beginning
 Lufthansa pilot training, like that of many European carriers, is based on the method known as ab initio, Latin for "from the beginning," because none of the aspiring pilots has ever flown a plane. The trainees first spend six months in their homelands studying academic subjects and aviation theory, then eight months here, attending more classes and being trained by mostly American flight instructors, although each airline sends its own coach to help students acclimate to the United States.
Students here spend 30 hours in flight simulators and 190 hours flying. After an additional eight months' training after leaving Arizona, they are ready to begin flying as flight engineers (also known as second officer) on such smaller passenger jets as the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.
By contrast, the average United States airline pilot hired since the late 1980's had approximately 3,000 hours of flying time, according to the Future Aviation Professionals of America, an Atlanta counseling firm.
The ab initio method may appear to produce pilots who are more rigid than those trained in this country. "But the accident rate doesn't support that assumption," said John Galipault, the president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a nonprofit research group. "And neither does the more important criterion of flight safety. The whole effort with the ab initio method is to train students to do the operational, safety and common sensical things the carriers want done."
Lufthansa says it costs about $200,000 to train a pilot, including room and board, but it will not say what it charges to train pilots of other carriers.
Lufthansa has required its own student pilots to pay $54,000 of the $200,000 and more than $100,000 if they join another airline at any time. Mr. Weber said he had no statistics on how many Lufthansa graduates had done so, but said the number "is minuscule."
Since the hiring freeze, student pilots have been covered by what Lufthansa calls training agreements, with no guarantee of a job.
Now, student pilots in Bremen want the carrier to waive even the $54,000 repayment. "But in such a difficult time for us economically, we can't and we won't do that," said Peter Hobel, a spokesman for Lufthansa in Frankfurt.
United States students will pay an estimated $70,000, but for 12 months of training rather than the almost two years that includes time in Bremen. This will qualify them as commercial pilots, but not to fly jets or turbo-props, skills that will have to be acquired elsewhere -- typically, by flying sightseeing trips, ferrying aircraft, crop dusting, hauling skydivers, flying charters or working as flight instructors.
The student body is 90 percent male, their ages ranging from 22 to 28. Iberia has sent a few women and Lufthansa began training women here four years ago.
One recent afternoon, Cedric Rossdeutscher, a 22-year-old aspiring Lufthansa pilot, talked with Mr. Weber before the student-pilot's solo round-trip flight to Tucson, about 100 miles away. Standing beside the single-engine plane and gazing at the cloudless Southwestern sky, for which high winds and storms had been forecast, Mr. Rossdeutscher said, "So far it looks like good flying weather."
After Mr. Rossdeutscher climbed into the aircraft, Mr. Weber turned and said, "My dream is within 10 years to see a captain of a U.S. carrier who has been trained at A.T.C.A."

HEADLINE: Dodd Strolls as Johnson Runs Underdog's Race

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANSONIA, Conn., Oct. 30

 BODY:
Entering the final weekend of campaigning before the election, Senator Christopher J. Dodd offered handshakes and small talk through small towns today, while his opponent, Brook Johnson, met business leaders with an urgent message about turning the state's ailing economy around.
It was a day in which Mr. Dodd, a Democrat seeking a third term, chose to chat with bank tellers and local officials rather than stress his campaign theme that his experience in Washington would best protect the interests of the state.
 
Tickets to the Big Game
 His schedule included visits to Shelton, a rally at Wesleyan University with Senator Al Gore and an appearance at Willow Brook Park Stadium in New Britain for a football game between New Britain High School and Newington High School. 
 By contrast, Mr. Johnson started the day at a luncheon with business leaders in Stamford. Later, he met workers as they left the Pratt & Whitney plant in East Hartford, and then headed for the same football game as Mr. Dodd.
With a lead of almost 20 points in the most recent polls, Mr. Dodd said his strategy until Election Day was to meet as many voters as possible. "It's a small state," he said. "People want to see you, talk to you."
As he arrived in Ansonia, he said that he had traveled more than 12,000 miles in his Ford Explorer in the last three and a half weeks of campaigning. "I feel very good about the support we got," he said.
As he strolled up and down Main Street, Mr. Dodd, escorted by local officials, seemed to revel in the enthusiasm of those who walked up to greet him. Entering the Great Country Bank, he eagerly posed for a picture with tellers in Halloween outfits, among them a red devil, a striped jungle cat and a spotted ladybug.
"I love the outfits," he said, laughing. "Let's get a camera and show them how we do banking here in Connecticut."
For their part, people appeared to delight in his presence as he wandered up and down Main Street.
"The Senator has always been welcome here," said Tom Hallihan, the Mayor of Ansonia. "The Senator has always been very helpful to us. He's been very good to the area."
One bank worker, Shirley Ruzicka, said she hadn't given the election much thought. "But it's interesting to note that he came around here," she said. "He took time out from his busy schedule to meet with us."
Still, there were those who weren't won over.
 
Cleaning the Slate
 "It was fun," said Malena Eatom, a 55-year-old clerk with Great Country Bank. "But I have decided I am not going to vote for him. Senator Dodd has been in office for about 18 years. That's enough. It's time to get the slate cleaned."
That was one message that Mr. Johnson delivered to the business leaders at the Marriott Hotel in Stamford during a luncheon sponsored by the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association.
More than 100 people attended the luncheon, which featured Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, as a speaker. Mr. Johnson, a businessman who has never held public office, talked about the need to pass a balanced-budget amendment, reduce the Federal debt and set term limits for Congress.
He also stressed his business background and the need to have the state expand its industry base through foreign trade.
"We know what's happening in our country right now," he said. "Children are doing what we have told them to do. They went to school. They worked hard. They went to good colleges. Then they got out, and they had to go back and live with their mothers and fathers because there aren't jobs out there for them."

HEADLINE: An Embattled Downey Defends His Record

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMITYVILLE, L.I., Oct. 30

 BODY:
After 18 years of steadily increasing seniority and influence in Washington, Representative Thomas J. Downey's quest for a 10th term in Congress came down to this: an open invitation to voters to drop by his two-family house here, simply to prove he actually lives a few hundred miles north of the Beltway.
"I live on Long Island, I have lived here all my life," Mr. Downey said in a televised debate the other night, as his Republican opponent denounced him as a corrupt Washington big shot. "If you have any doubt, come to 155 Cedar Street, where I have lived for 13 years." 
 Once one of the youngest Congressmen ever to take office, a grass-roots outsider who routed an entrenched Republican with the help of the Watergate scandal, Mr. Downey, at the age of 43, finds himself transformed by circumstance and his opponent into a quintessential incumbent facing his toughest re-election fight in at least a decade.
 
Straws in the Wind
 At a time the public is yearning for change, when for some the word Congress is synonymous with scandal, Mr. Downey's campaign as a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Republican district is being watched by both parties as a sign of the times and the lingering effects of the House bank scandal.
"This race clearly shows the dichotomy between 'Re-elect our Congressman who is a powerful insider who can get things done,' and 'Get a newcomer who can shake things up,' " said Steven Sutton, a field representative for the National Republican Congressional Committee, who has been working feverishly in the district to defeat Mr. Downey, spending $50,000 on the effort.
Mr. Downey's Republican opponent, Rick Lazio, a 34-year-old two-term Suffolk County legislator and a member of a prominent Republican family, says his supporters see him as the same kind of fresh face with the same message of reform that Mr. Downey took to Congress years ago. They see Mr. Downey as someone "who has been corrupted."
When Mr. Downey talks about his seniority on the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Lazio prefers to discuss Mr. Downey's Congressional junket to Barbados a few years ago, including a jet-ski excursion captured by hidden cameras on ABC's "Prime Time Live." Mr. Downey says simply that the trip was a mistake.
If Mr. Downey brings up his central role in securing extensions in unemployment insurance benefits, his challenger talks about overdrafts on 151 checks totaling $83,000 at the House bank at a time when Mr. Downey's wife held a patronage job as an auditor in the House office that ran the House bank.
"While Tom Downey was writing bad checks, his wife was serving as the only auditor of the House bank," one ad reads. Mr. Downey said that the auditor title was only a job title, that his wife's work with the Sergeant-at-Arms office had nothing to do with the bank.
If Mr. Downey talks about his efforts to find money to convert Long Island's military industry to peaceful purposes, Mr. Lazio contends that Mr. Downey has all but abandoned Long Island in favor of Washington, where his wife works and his children go to school.
Asked about the considerable political baggage he brought to the campaign this year, from the House bank to his trip to Barbados, Mr. Downey smiled wanly and said, "Well, I have been there a long time."
For Mr. Downey, who was once so young and green in Washington that he was mistaken by colleagues for a Congressional page and had to show proof to order a drink at a restaurant near the Capitol, this year's election has been a watershed.
For the first time, he said, he has gone on the offensive against an opponent with a negative campaign on cable television and he has been working the district harder than he has in many years, holding 300 meetings in the district during the last term, and, spending every other day in the district this year.
Mr. Downey expects to spend more than $1 million on his re-election, about four times what his opponent says he will be able to muster by next Tuesday.
In his television campaign, he criticizes Mr. Lazio for providing a crucial Republican vote for a fiscal bailout plan for Suffolk County at a time it was running out of cash last year. The plan called for a $35.5 million tax increase.
"One day alone Rick Lazio voted to raise Long Island property taxes by $35 million," Mr. Downey's ads say. "Just imagine what he could do if we gave him two years as a Congressman."
But the plan, which included selling notes backed by a $35.5 million county property-tax increase, was drafted by Patrick G. Halpin, a Democrat who was then County Executive and who is one of Mr. Downey's close friends. Mr. Lazio said that while he voted for the plan, he eventually voted against the tax increase when it came before the Legislature.
Mr. Lazio, considered a moderate Republican, grew up in the same town, West Islip, graduated from the same high school, West Islip High School, and the same law school, at American University, as did Mr. Downey.
A former press spokesman and assistant district attorney in Suffolk County, Mr. Lazio sees himself as more low key than Mr. Downey, despite a campaign in which he has been relentlessly attacking him.
"I don't want to be a big-time Washington big shot," he said in the televised debate. "I just want to be a local guy who is going to fight for you and fight for local concerns and bring jobs back to the district."
After misgivings earlier this year, Mr. Downey said he is now confident that his message -- that he can make a difference in the lives of the people in his struggling middle-class district -- is getting across to voters, and that his past constituent services have been remembered.
"We've done our homework," he said.

HEADLINE: Bonds Off After Home-Sales Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after the Government revised its figures for new-home sales in August to show a gain and reported a drop in September home sales that was smaller than expected.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 17/32 , or $5.31 for $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.62 percent, up from 7.57 percent late Thursday. 
 Many traders were concerned by the revised report on August new-home sales, which showed this area of the economy was not as weak as previously thought. The Government, which originally said August home sales fell 6.1 percent, now says they advanced 1.6 percent, to 623,000. September home sales dropped 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 617,000.
 
Better Than Expected
 Still, the September figures were better than economists had expected, said Ray Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
In addition, many investors are reluctant to buy bonds now in advance of the Presidential election on Tuesday. The markets sold off earlier this month amid speculation that Gov. Bill Clinton might defeat President Bush and impose spending programs that could revive inflation.
Finally, investors are concerned about next week's announcement of how much in new bonds the Treasury will sell at its quarterly auction, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Trading was light before the weekend. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term issues fell by 3/32 to 15/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell by 18/32 to 25/32 , Telerate Inc. reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 5.41 points, to 1,252.24.
 
Bill Yields Rise
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.01 percent, as the discount rose 2 basis points, to 2.96 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.28 percent, as the discount rose 2 basis points, to 3.19 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.52 percent, as the discount rose 6 basis points, to 3.39 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 31/16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 93 3/4, up 6/32 . The average yield to maturity fell to 6.68 percent, from 6.70 percent late Thursday.

Backer Fills Top Position At U.S. Unit

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, announced yesterday that Kenneth R. Rogers had been named chairman of the Americas region and chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., the advertising agency's American subsidiary.
Mr. Rogers, who is 46 years old, has been president and chief operating officer of Backer Spielvogel Bates since May 1991. No successor to Mr. Rogers was named at these positions. 
 By assuming the chairmanship of the Americas, which includes Canada and Latin America as well as the United States, Mr. Rogers joins the ranks of Michael Bungey, 55, chairman of the European region, and Alex Hammill, 53, chairman of Backer Spielvogel's Asia/Pacific region.
 
Not a Horse Race
 Mr. Spielvogel, who is 62, insisted that Mr. Rogers's appointment did not set up what could be a three-way struggle for his job.
"There is no horse race," he said. "Ken is not a candidate for my succession. He first has to stabilize the U.S. company. As of today, there are three regional executives, and he is the most recent."
Mr. Bungey has been in charge of European operations for the last five years. Mr. Hammill has been in his post since September 1991.
Backer Spielvogel has 167 offices in 50 countries and is based in New York. Like the rest of Madison Avenue, it has been hit hard by the recession.
"In the last three years, media budgets have leveled off, after rising by 12 percent a year" during much of the 1980's, Mr. Spielvogel said. "It is only now that I can tell clients that they can't save their way to prosperity, that they have to put some money into investment. That message is starting to get across."
 
$1.5 Billion in Billings
 The agency that Mr. Rogers now heads generates about $1.25 billion of the $5 billion in annual worldwide billings at Backer Spielvogel.
Mr. Spielvogel said that to assist Mr. Rogers in some of his day-to-day responsibilities, Frank Assumma and Jerrold H. Gottlieb had been named managing directors.
In his new post, Mr. Assumma, 40, will be primarily responsible for the firm's Miller Brewing Company business. Mr. Gottlieb, 46, will oversee multinational accounts, with responsibility for Mars Inc., the candy company, and the Philips Consumer Electronics Company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Higher Despite Weak U.S. Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher in quiet trading on world currency markets yesterday, advancing first in European trading and continuing its rise when activity shifted to domestic markets.
Analysts said the dollar showed surprising resilience in the face of two negative economic reports. The Government said sales of new homes fell 1.0 percent in September, the first drop in five months, despite the lowest mortgage rates in nearly two decades. 
 Later in the day, the Chicago Purchasing Management Association reported its October index slid sharply.
"As the election draws closer, market uncertainty increases, leaving the dollar in a tight trading range," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
After the election, however, "weak economic fundamentals should reassert themselves," increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve might have to lower interest rates again to stimulate growth, Mr. Chandler said.
Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates in Europe prevents the dollar from falling, analysts said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.35 yen, up 0.33 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.25 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.40 yen, up from 123.28 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5625 from $1.5735 late Thursday. In New York, a pound cost $1.5565, down from $1.5730 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5420 German marks, up from 1.5375; 1.3735 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.2345 French francs, up from 5.2140; 1,322.00 Italian lire, up from 1,313.75, and 1.2385 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2387.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5435 German marks, up from 1.5390; 1.3770 Swiss francs, up from 1.3735; 5.2340 French francs, up from 5.2210; 1.7364 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7325; 1,318.25 Italian lire, up from 1,316.00, and 1.2397 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2413.

HEADLINE: It Pays to Stick to Basics in Credit Cards

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
With competition rising in the credit card business and more enticements being offered almost every week, consumers should weigh carefully whether the cards they now have are serving their needs at the lowest cost. A switch might save them money.
But it is no easy task tracking all the wrinkles of some cards. The GE Capital Corporation's Mastercard, introduced in September, offers discount coupons and rebates from 24 companies, including Kmart, Macy's and Northwest Airlines. To profit from these deals, consumers must use them to offset the higher costs of the card itself -- a $25 annual fee and an interest rate set at 12.4 percentage points above the prime rate, for a current total of 18.4 percent. 
 For some, the card may offer rewards much like a discount shoppers club. But for consumers who lack the time to organize sheaves of coupons, experts suggest sticking with the basics. Choose a card, they say, for the cost of its core services, not for fringe benefits.
"Pay yourself by saving money right away rather than later," said Robert B. McKinley, president of RAM Research in Frederick, Md., which publishes Cardtrak, a monthly listing of well priced credit cards.
 
Benefits, With Restrictions
 Some consumers may consider fringe benefits a good value, despite the extra cost. With the American Express card and many others, holders earn a free travel mile for every dollar they charge. Typically, these cards carry high annual fees and interest rates, but some consumers fly so often that they more than recoup the upfront costs. Many issuers of these cards, however, have capped the number of miles they will redeem to 10,000 a month or 50,000 a year.
The cost of providing fringe benefits has prompted some card issuers to add many restrictions. "When you get down to the fine print, they tend to lose their glitter," Mr. McKinley said.
The fledgling General Motors Mastercard, introduced last month, has relatively little fine print. It offers what many consider to be an attractive package, including no annual fee, a relatively low interest rate of prime plus 10.4 percent, and 5 percent rebates on spending that can be used to buy a new G. M. car. With additional rebates available from companies like the Marriott hotel chain, a cardholder could save more than $3,500 on a new car after seven years.
But even G. M.'s package bears a closer look. A $3,500 rebate will be worth much less in seven years than it is today. And the card uses a potentially expensive billing system known as the two-cycle method, also used by the Sears Discover card. It works this way. A $500 purchase made Jan. 1 does not have to be paid off until late February under typical grace periods. If only a minimum payment is made, most cards calculate interest for the March billing period on the unpaid charges from the February bill. Under the two-cycle method, a card issuer will go back two cycles and calculate the interest from the time the purchase was made.
This extra charge will be levied only once for people who carry balances from month to month. But for those who constantly switch from paying off to carrying a balance, this two-cycle method can be costly.
 
Hurting Credit Rating
 The G. M. card, like many others, requires no annual fee, giving consumers little reason not to add it to their collections of plastic. That feature drew many subscribers when the AT&T Universal card was introduced. But there is an indirect cost. The number of cards owned by consumers is listed on their credit reports, and those who have too many are perceived to be greater risks.
To help narrow the choices, consumers should first take stock of their spending habits. In broadest terms, there are two types of credit card users. More than two-thirds are "revolvers" who carry balances from month to month. Those who pay off their balances each month are known as convenience users. And many people move between these two camps over the course of a year.
For those who faithfully pay off their balances every month, interest rates are irrelevant. They should use a card that does not charge an annual fee and that offers a 25-day grace period before payment is required, as most cards do. With carefully timed purchases, these consumers can get about 50 days of free credit.
For revolvers, the interest rate is most important. And while research has shown that consumers are not likely to switch to save a percentage point or two, they will switch for bigger breaks. Since many people are paying close to 20 percent interest, a little effort could effectively cut interest payments by about a third.
 
Ask for a Better Deal
 The simplest move for consumers is to call the bank that issues their cards. Banks are often willing to dole out breaks on rates and fees rather than lose better customers.
Be wary of cards that offer interest rates near or below 10 percent. The approval rates for such cards are low, applicants must fill out long forms and, as a rule, they carry low credit limits and high fees.
Mr. McKinley recommends searching for cards that charge interest of 12.5 to 15.5 percent and offer an "800" number for services. Consumers with good credit can be approved for a realistic credit line and a low or nonexistent annual fee with such cards.

HEADLINE: TAXES;
Do Some Planning Now To Avoid 1993 Surprises

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
MORE taxpayers than ever before -- middle-class salaried people, as well as those who live on investment income -- need to do year-end tax planning in the next few weeks to avoid any rude surprises in April. Some will even find a few well-spent hours can pay dividends in lower '92 tax bills.
One reason for a new urgency this year is the reduction in withholding for income taxes that President Bush ordered last winter. It meant fatter paychecks, up to $345 for the year, but it did not reduce the taxes owed. As a result, many taxpayers may discover the refunds they have come to expect are disappointingly small, or, worse, that they owe money. 
 Conversely, with the plunge in interest rates over the year, many incomes have been cut deeply. Those taxpayers may want to reduce estimated tax payments or withholding on other income. The rate drop has also created a wave of mortgage refinancings, which can have important tax consequences.
David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young in Washington, said, "On April 15, a lot of people are going to find themselves caught short."
New statistics from the Tax Foundation show why they'll be caught short. Income for the median two-earner family this year is projected to be $53,984, but Federal income taxes, Social Security, indirect taxes and state and local taxes will take $21,445 for an effective tax rate of 39.7 percent, leaving the family with $32,539. On a constant 1992 dollar basis, the independent research organization says, that is $214 less than a year ago.
The people in the toughest situation, Mr. Berenson said, will be those who have unwittingly walked into the alternative minimum tax, which increasingly is snaring middle-class people in high-tax states like New York and California as well as upper-income people whose sheltered income it is meant to tax.
The goal of the alternative minimum tax is to snare people of means who have whittled away their tax liabilities under the regular tax rules. Many standard deductions for state and local taxes and accelerated depreciation are disallowed, and the income base is broadened. Taxpayers with complex finances or many deductions are supposed to calculate their taxes under both sets of rules and pay whichever tax is higher.
With a top Federal rate of 31 percent under regular rules and 24 percent under A.M.T. rules, any sizable deductions that would not be allowed for A.M.T. purposes can spring the trap. So can interest on a mortgage refinancing, unless the loan is used for home improvement.
That is why it is particularly important for people who refinanced to do calculations before the year ends, Mr. Berenson said. Depending on the results, some will want to pay the balance of any state and local taxes owed this year so they can take the deduction; others will want to postpone the payments until January, if they would lose the deduction in 1992.
Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax lawyer and author of "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies for the $40,000-Plus Household," said many people in this economic downturn had income on which no money or too little had been withheld, like unemployment compensation, severance pay and money withdrawn prematurely from I.R.A.'s.
"They should think about this before the end of the year and pay estimated taxes on it," Mr. Block said, lest they subject themselves to penalties and interest, as well as taxes.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Taxing the Pensions Of Former Residents
Q I have heard that New York State is assessing tax on withdrawals from appreciated 401(k) funds even when a resident moves to another state. Is this true, and if it is, how is the tax computed?
 
 RICHARD R. STEBBINS JR.
 Manhattan
 
A New York has long had a law authorizing taxes on retirement benefits, including 401(k) plans, of those who worked in the state and later moved. Periodic payments or funds rolled over into individual retirement accounts are not taxed, but tax must be paid on money received in a lump sum. 
 "If we didn't tax lump-sum distributions, it would be very easy to design compensation arrangements so that what would be salary is paid out after retirement," said James W. Wetzler, Commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance."
Nonresidents must first compute their tax as if they were residents, Commissioner Wetzler said. Then they use a formula to determine the amount due by multiplying the resident tax by a fraction in which the numerator is income from New York (including the retirement benefits) and the denominator is total income.
 
Appraising Property For Insurance Coverage
Q We had the contents of our apartment appraised two years ago to make sure our insurance covered current values. Is it time for another appraisal or can we wait now that inflation has eased?
 
 MARGOT SPELMAN
 Manhattan
 
A With today's low inflation rate, it does not make sense to get a more recent appraisal, said Sean F. Mooney, senior vice president and economist of the Insurance Information Institute. The value of personal property has probably not changed very much in the last two years.
"But if you have insured a painting or other valuable art object on a value basis," he added, "then you may be paying too much because many values have gone down. So you could save money by getting a new appraisal."
 
When Gifts to Charities Lead to Alternate Tax
When people give appreciated stock as a charitable contribution, at what level of income do they become liable for the alternative minimum tax?
 
 WILLIAM V. LEWIT
 Scardsdale, N.Y.
 
A The threshold for the alternate minimum tax is not the level of a taxpayer's income but the amount of the untaxed gain on appreciated stock and other so-called preference items. If the total exceeds $40,000, the taxpayer may be subject to the alternative minimum tax, said Edward Mendlowitz, a partner of Mendlowitz Weitsen, an accounting firm. The tax is calculated on Form 6251 and applies only if it is greater than the regular tax.

Jays' Cone and Carter Declare Their Freedom

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
David Cone and Joe Carter, two members of the World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays, put themselves into position yesterday to become ultra-wealthy. Dion James just made sure he had a job.
Cone and Carter were among 27 players who declared themselves free agents. Beginning Nov. 9, they will be free to sign with anyone for whatever anyone wants to pay them. In the cases of Cone and Carter, that will be a lot of money because Cone is one of the top three starting pitchers available and Carter is one of the top half-dozen hitters. 
 James, on the other hand, is a reserve outfielder who first reached the majors in 1983, but did not distinguish himself in 67 games for the Yankees this year. He batted .262, hit 3 home runs and drove in 17 runs. He turns 30 years old in 10 days, but the Yankees thought enough of his value to keep him from joining the 109 free agents.
 
Bonuses Abound
 They signed him to a one-year contract, giving him a $25,000 signing bonus and a $325,000 salary plus a possible $150,000 in bonuses. James can earn $35,000 if he is on the Yankees' roster for 30 days and $25,000 each if he is on 60 days and 90 days. He also has five levels of bonuses based on games played or plate appearances. He can earn a maximum of $65,000 if he plays 90 games or has 275 plate appearances.
James, who won a job with the Yankees last spring as a nonroster player, earned $387,500 this year, including bonuses.
The Yankees have indicated a willingness to spend big for Cone. They have coveted the former Mets right-hander so publicly that they have verged on tampering with him. Cone has said he would seriously consider returning to New York, but hasn't said that's his No. 1 preference.
The Blue Jays, who achieved their objective of winning the pennant and World Series after obtaining Cone in a trade with the Mets on Aug. 27, have told Cone they would like to have him back, though they have not made him an offer. Until Nov. 9, they are the only team that can sign him. The 27 other teams can only express their interest in him and elicit his interest in them; they cannot negotiate with him or even mention money.
Candy Maldonado joined Cone and Carter in filing yesterday, raising to 10 the number of Blue Jays who have declared themselves free. Dave Winfield and Manny Lee are eligible to declare free agency, so the Blue Jays could have an even dozen free agents.
The Oakland Athletics have a baker's dozen. Mike Moore, who was not offered arbitration, and Rick Honeycutt, who didn't have to be, raised the Athletics' roll call of free agents to 13. Rich (Goose) Goosage and Carney Lansford, who has said he is retiring, remain eligible.
The National League champion Atlanta Braves had two players file, Jeff Reardon and Mike Bielecki, both pitchers. The Mets had four players -- Willie Randolph, Daryl Boston, Barry Jones and Lee Guetterman. Paul Molitor of Milwaukee also added his name to the list.
The Cleveland Indians signed relief pitcher Ted Power to a one-year contract, giving him a $25,000 signing bonus and a $425,000 salary, one-quarter of it guaranteed.
Indians reliever Steve Olin learned yesterday that he can expect a higher salary for 1993 than he might otherwise have had. Olin is one of 15 players who will be eligible for salary arbitration as the result of the 1990 collective bargaining agreement.
Players generally need three years of major league service to be eligible, but the players and owners settled their lockout dispute by agreeing to make eligible 17 percent of the players who have between two and three years of major league service and who spent at least half of this past season in the majors.
Olin, only two days short of three years, heads the group of 15 taken from the 89 qualifying players. He had 29 saves this year.
Another player who will benefit economically is Philadelphia pitcher Curt Schilling who had a 14-11 record and a 2.35 earned run average.
Just missing this group was Albert Belle, who hit 34 home runs and drove in 112 runs for the Indians.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Pulse -- Pennsylvania;
Pennsylvania Poses the Big One: Can Bush Do It?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Is President Bush really catching up? On the final weekend of the 1992 Presidential campaign, that is the question of the hour in Pennsylvania, as it is everywhere. But here at least, there are no definitive answers yet to be discerned.
Ask some experts, and they say Mr. Bush has a real shot at Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes, a valuable pile that has made the Keystone State one of the great dueling grounds of American politics for generations. Ask others, equally well plugged-in, and they say Bill Clinton locked things up here weeks ago. 
 "I don't think Bush can possibly make it," said Rick Robb, a law partner of Drew Lewis, the former Transportation Secretary, and like Mr. Lewis, a leading Republican politician in the state.
"It comes down to two questions: Do you think George Bush is as strong a candidate in Pennsylvania as he was four years ago? Of course not. Do you think Bill Clinton is a better Democratic candidate than Michael Dukakis was? Obviously, and George Bush carried this state four years ago by only about 100,000 votes."
 
Different Views of Perot Factor
 Prof. G. Terry Madonna of Millersville State University, a political scientist who specializes in Pennsylvania elections, said that it was "hard to imagine any scenario, however outlandish, that would enable the President to win here." He added: "There's nothing very profound about this election. There's a massive pro-change vote in Pennsylvania, waiting to be cast on Tuesday, and everything indicates Clinton, not Ross Perot, will get most of it."
Yet Elsie Hillman of Pittsburgh, a longtime Republican National Committeewoman from Pennsylvania, pooh-poohed the pessimists in her party with the comment, "I think we're going to surprise everyone again and carry this state." She sees Mr. Perot, who made one of his few campaign speeches in Pittsburgh last weekend, splitting the anti-Bush vote and pulling as much as 20 percent of the total.
"In 1988, they wrote us off," she said. "President Reagan never came into the western part of the state to campaign for Bush, and we had no advertising to speak of. It was dead again this year until the last debate. Until then, people didn't think the President had any fire in his tummy, but now they sense he's caught fire."
Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, said that Mr. Clinton still "has to be favored in Pennsylvania, overwhelmingly." But he added that "something is definitely happening out there, and he's losing ground, because Bush has succeded in framing the end-game issue, not as jobs but as trust and taxes."
A major problem for Mr. Clinton, the Governor said, was the widespread suggestion earlier this month that a Clinton landslide was imminent. Talk like that, he said, "makes it hard to get your traction --
 "Talking about landslides and mandates is the political equivalent of talking to the pitcher about his no-hitter in the bottom of the ninth," Mr. Casey said. "You have to run hard until the last possible minute."
 
Poll Shows Clinton Advantage
 The most recent state poll, completed last Sunday, just before some national polls began recording a surge by President Bush, showed Mr. Clinton with a 10-point lead. The survey, taken for the Pittburgh Post-Gazette and television station WTAE, gave the Arkansas Governor 41 percent, Mr. Bush 31 percent and Mr. Perot 21 percent, with 7 percent undecided, based on interviews with 775 registered voters. The margin of sampling error was listed as plus or minus 4 percentage points.
But a smaller sample of 578 "most likely voters"showed Mr. Clinton with only a 7 point lead, 42 per cent to 35. In that case, the margin of sampling error was a bit bigger, 4.2 percent. In both polls, the Democrat's lead had been cut in half since mid-October.
Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican, appears to be winning his battle for re-election against Lynn T. Yeakel, a Democrat who has denounced him for the prosecutorial tone he adopted while cross-examining Prof. Anita F. Hill during the Senate hearings on Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court.

 But Mr. Specter said he doubted the accuracy of the polls in the Presidential race, because it had become "politically incorrect" to tell poll takers that one was supporting Mr. Bush for re-election. He criticized the President for what he termed a perilously late-starting campaign.
"A lot of us have been trying our very best for a long time," he said, "to get the President to do something about economic recovery and health care, the two biggest issues. But he had his own ideas and his own timetable."
The Senator said Mr. Bush would hugely benefit in Pennsylvania if he signed the economic recovery bill now on his desk, which includes provisions for enterprise zones and other elements favored by the White House. It also includes tax increases and tax cuts, supposedly equal in size, that may well attract a Presidential veto.
In a sense, the Bush-Clinton race here is a rerun. In 1991, Harris Wofford, a Democrat with a long record of government service but little name recognition, defeated former Gov. Dick Thornburgh, a heavily favored Republican. Mr. Thornburgh had served Mr. Bush as Attorney General and was closely identified with the Administration.
Then as now, health care and jobs were the big issues. Then as now, the chief Democratic strategist was James Carville, a wisecracking Louisiana populist.
Senator Wofford, who carried the state by 55 percent to 45, said: "I see a victory for Clinton of about the same magnitude as mine," said Senator Wofford, who carried the state by 55 percent to 45. "Perot has deepened the indictment of Bush, labor is solid, and Clinton is doing a good job in pulling back the Catholic Democrats in the Philadelphia suburbs and in other parts of the state."
Neil Oxman, a Democratic campaign consultant in Philadelphis, said, "There's nothing happened to the people of Pennsylvania in the last year or so "to make anyone who voted for Wofford vote for Bush this time."
 
Economy Dominates Concerns
 Although a few local politicians suggested that the economy has lost its acuity as an issue in this state, which has suffered less than some in the current recession, most said it continued to dominate voters' concerns. In western Pennsylvania particularly, where industrial decline has given counties like Fayette and Westmoreland unemployment rates in double digits, the President is blamed.
"No doubt character questions are starting to hurt Clinton," Professor Madonna said, "but a lot of the votes leaving him are going to Perot, because the people in the depressed areas are unwilling to risk four more years like the last four by voting for Mr. Bush."
Still, there are complicating factors for Mr. Clinton, some of them of his own making.
On Wednesday night, for example, the Governor said on the CNN program "Larry King Live" that he had "real problems" with the proposed acquisition by British Airways of a major interest in USAir. He commented: "We get no access to the British market if we do it. It's just an admission that we've allowed American companies to get in terrible financial trouble."
 
Abortion Issue a Factor
 USAir has its main hub in Pittsburgh, with more than 10,000 employees in the area, and the company has enlisted many of them in its campaign to convince Washington that it needs the deal to survive.
Antagonism over the abortion issue between Mr. Casey and his party's national ticket has also raised fears among some Democrats.
Governor Casey takes a middle position on abortion, and he signed into law a measure, upheld this year by the Supreme Court, authorizing limited restrictions. He hoped to state his case at the Democratic National Convention in New York but was refused permission to do so. Ever since, Mr. Wofford said, "he's had his Irish up, and he has done nothing to help Clinton and Gore."
Last Tuesday, Mr. Casey skipped a dinner in Scranton, his home town, at which Hillary Clinton spoke. In a statement issued at the time, he said he was staying away as a matter of principle. "The national party's embrace of abortion on demand demands too much," he said, echoing John F. Kennedy's dictum that "Sometimes, party loyalty demands too much."
Mr. Wofford and Professor Madonna said the abortion issue was only a minor factor in the Presidential contest. But Mr. Casey insisted that "on balance, it helps Bush in this state, because it's one of a bundle of issues and values that turn attention away from hard times and onto character, forcing people to look again at Bill."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
What Is Scarier Than Halloween? Tune In to Candidates' Ads and See

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Presidential candidates have embarked on the electronic-age version of a final whistlestop tour. But the view from America's living rooms is not a pretty one.
As they bombard the airwaves in the closing 100 hours with 30-second, 60-second, two-minute, half-hour and hourlong commercials that are running practically back to back, the campaigns are leaving unmistakably depressing images they hope the voters will carry to the polls. 
 The overall tone is bleak, particularly in the Republican advertisements. President Bush is treating viewers to a new spot that warns, through creepy music and dreary scenes of buzzards and barren deserts, that the country under Gov. Bill Clinton would be transformed into a virtual stage set for horror films.
Tune in to the latest Clinton advertisement and there are blurry images of Mr. Bush looking weirdly irrational four years ago as he made optimistic pronouncements about the economy.
 
Perot Joins In
 Even Ross Perot broke from his practice of not using advertisements to directly bash his opponents. He bought a half-hour on the networks Sunday night to broadcast a new commercial titled "Chicken feathers, Voo-doo Economics and the American Dream." The message here is not hard to decipher: Mr. Perot has demeaned Mr. Clinton by saying the principle industry in Arkansas is chicken plucking, and the Texas billionaire has regularly ridiculed the President for espousing "voodoo economics."
"What we're seeing is a frantic campaign by candidates to hold onto the people they've got and to make slight inroads," said Timothy E. Cook, chairman of the political science department at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. "People are going to get into the polling booths and hold their noses, and under those circumstances you can't afford to let up for a minute."
In using these final days to tear into Mr. Clinton's record as Governor of Arkansas, the Bush campaign seems to have settled on one of its most effective attacks after earlier, less successful efforts.
If the polls are any gauge, voters were not moved by the Bush campaign's attempt to taint Mr. Clinton with the time-worn "tax and spend" attacks. And the advertisements that hit him on the "trust" issue seemed to be neutralized by Mr. Clinton's commercials that used old film clips of Mr. Bush to remind voters of his President's "read my lips" pledge.
 
Effectiveness of Ridicule
 Clinton aides said an early Bush commercial that tried humor and hillbilly music to ridicule Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas was one of the Republicans' more effective advertisements, and they expressed surprise that the campaign did not keep it on the air longer.
Dean Alger, a political science professor at Moorhead State University in Minnesota, who assembled undecided voters to view several advertisements, said, "Our focus group had a pretty striking reaction to the hillbilly ad in terms of memorability."
Although she derided the Bush campaign for what she called a relentlessly negative advertising campaign, Mandy Grunwald, a Clinton media adviser, conceded that while they were hardly devastating, the attacks seemed to be hurting the Democrats in the closing days. "The combination of advertising and free media has been more sharpened," she said, adding that it has "raised our negatives."
Sig Rogich, who supervises advertising for the Bush campaign, said the Republicans would press on with their stinging denunciations of Mr. Clinton. "We're not finished," he said. "We know it's a horse race and we're not about to let up."
In seeking to combat the negative impressions left about them by their opponents, and to say some nice things about their candidates, the campaigns are each spending well over a million dollars on network advertising this weekend. In the last three days alone, the Clinton campaign has bought $2 million more in broadcast time on the networks alone; the Perot campaign, $4.2 million, and the Bush campaign, $1 million.
The campaigns have also increased their attacks even more in battleground states, where they have bought huge amounts of television time, called "saturation buys." The Bush campaign has made these purchases in 30 markets, and the Clinton campaign has done so in an estimated 17 markets.
Mindful that there is more to winning votes than frightening the electorate, the campaigns have leavened their televised images of buzzards and storm clouds with some more uplifting messages.
The Bush campaign is running two-minute commercials that show the President talking to a rapt audience about the importance of a steady commander in chief at times of crisis. It only indirectly takes a swipe at Mr. Clinton by raising the issue of trust.
In response, the Clinton side offers a 30-second advertisement it calls a "validation spot," seeking to reassure voters that Mr. Clinton has a steady hand. It features shot of a sober looking Governor sitting at his desk as names roll on the screen of experts who support his economic prescriptions.
Clinton aides said the half-hour spot they have bought to be broadcast on the networks Monday night will have an upbeat message and will include footage from the biographic film shown at the Democratic National Convention that depicted Mr. Clinton as a man of unstinting honor.
And a series of Perot advertisements seek to build the businessman's stature. In one commercial, the Texan looks into the camera and earnestly says, "We can be a country with its spirit restored."
As if these advertisement blitzes were not enough, the candidates are accepting practically every offer to appear on television programs. After months of carefully calculating what programs they would appear on, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton are agreeing to interviews with journalists their advisers had once viewed as hostile, like Sam Donaldson of ABC News.
 
About-Face by Bush
 Mr. Bush, who only weeks ago defended his refusal to appear on MTV, the music television network, saying "I'm not much of a mod MTV man," went so far as to agree to be interviewed Saturday on the network.
"If free air time is going to be given to your opposition," said Mr. Rogich of the Bush campaign, "you certainly are entitled to match it. We want people to come away with the clear difference beween Bill Clinton and George Bush; people have to realize that there are real problems in Arkansas."
Frank Greer, Mr. Rogich's counterpart on the Clinton campaign, also speaks of crystallizing the choices. "We want the final days of this election to focus on the real choices," he said. "We want people to walk into that polling place saying we can't afford four more years."
Despite all the slashing attacks and scare tactics, some voters seemed to be swayed by the old-fashioned feel-good spots. After viewing a gushy advertisement that depicted Mr. Bush as a fighter, an undecided voter in Minnesota said: "I keep hearing the same things from George. However, the advertisement nearly had me standing with my hand over my heart."

HEADLINE: Here's to Kale, Sweetest of Leafy Greens

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Milking Our Memories" (editorial, Oct. 1) discusses the possibilities raised by a group of doctors that milk might not be the childhood elixir for growing up strong and healthy, and ends by proposing other sources for calcium, such as broccoli and kale, "a green known more for hardiness than taste." You apparently have a serious kale deficiency and tastebuds dulled by a thick coating of milk. You also need cooking lessons. 
 Kale, when young and fresh, is delicious and tender, with just a few minutes of steaming. It is perhaps the sweetest of the "healthy dark leafy greens," and can be relished in a myriad of seasoning profiles: Italian-style with garlic and olive oil, Oriental stir-fried, simmered in a zesty Indian lentil soup and as a classic accompaniment to Brazilian fejoida.
Let's hope that kale will not fall to a Presidential veto, as poor broccoli did, and that our new leader will choose a diet as healthy as his promised economy.

HEADLINE: House Aged Prisoners In Converted Hospitals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report Oct. 4 on the blocked efforts in the New York State Legislature to close the almost disused Gowanda Psychiatric Center. With staff retraining and relatively minor renovations, any one of such facilities could meet the needs of a rapidly aging inmate population at less cost than a correctional institution. 
 Prisoners who have spent a lifetime in jail often see prison as home and fear freedom more than continued imprisonment. Maximum security, therefore, is not generally important. Far more critical are medical care, geriatric dormitory services, such as special diets and wheelchair access, and protection from young and violent inmates. These added services frequently triple prison costs of caring for older prisoners.
Using empty psychiatric centers as geriatric prisons would increase employment in economically dependent communities, be more cost-effective than correctional facilities and provide a more human environment for jailed octogenarians no longer a threat to society.
