HEADLINE: Preventing the Next North Korea 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's radically different responses to weapons threats from Iraq and North Korea have confused the American people. Worse, they risk sending other rogue states the perverse message that the way to receive lenient treatment from Washington is to develop nuclear weapons. One reason Pyongyang's defiant provocations are met with diplomatic overtures while Baghdad's mix of cooperation and evasion elicits threats of force is the strong suspicion that Kim Jong Il already has nuclear weapons while Saddam Hussein does not. 
 That may be a good argument for not backing North Korea into a corner. But it is not a very promising formula for avoiding future nuclear threats -- threats almost certain to materialize in the years immediately ahead. What is needed is not just crisis management but a more comprehensive approach to the spread of nuclear weapons. Failure to address this problem more intelligently could mean waking up 10 years from now to discover a half-dozen or more new states with nuclear weapons, including some in the world's most volatile and economically sensitive regions. 
 Thus far the Bush administration has seemed more interested in weakening than reinforcing the two main international agreements intended to rein in nuclear weapons building: the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Neither is perfect. But they are useful tools that could be made more effective through strong American support.
Under the nonproliferation treaty, only five countries are officially recognized nuclear weapons powers: America, Russia, Britain, France and China. But three countries that have never signed the treaty, India, Pakistan and Israel, have developed nuclear weapons outside its structures, and a fourth, North Korea, has secretly violated its obligations and is now moving to withdraw from the treaty to free its nuclear installations from international surveillance. Three other signatories, Iran, Iraq and Libya, are also believed to have secret nuclear weapons programs, and several others, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, have the technical ability to build nuclear bombs if they feel threatened by a growing number of nuclear rivals.
The challenge for the United States is to strengthen the incentives not to build nuclear weapons. America is the planet's strongest military power. But it would be much less secure in a world where treaties were allowed to become meaningless and countries believed their only reliable defense was to build nuclear arms. 
Strengthening the nonproliferation treaty requires existing nuclear powers to show good faith by radically reducing their cold war nuclear arsenals, as the Americans and the Russians have recently agreed to do. The Bush administration should also drop its provocative policy of threatening nuclear retaliation against non-nuclear threats. And far more serious pressure must be put on India, Pakistan and Israel to sign the nonproliferation treaty. Washington's credibility in insisting that North Korea not withdraw from the treaty is not helped by its reluctance to press these countries to sign.
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, rejected by the Republican-led Senate in 1999, is another neglected restraint. Its ban on all testing could act as a limited freeze on nuclear weapons development. Few countries would rely on nuclear weapons that they had never been able to test. This treaty is now in legal limbo and cannot come into force without American ratification. The Bush administration should reconsider its ill-advised opposition and press for early Senate approval. 
These treaties are not foolproof. They must be backed by stringent verification and a unified international response any time a country is caught circumventing the rules. As different as the administration's responses have been to Iraq and North Korea, one unifying thread has been the effort to mobilize international pressure for both countries' nuclear disarmament. Mr. Bush could make a far more powerful case in this and future crises if he made America once again a strong and consistent supporter of international arms control treaties.

HEADLINE: Oceans in Trouble 

 BODY:
Last week, a commission of scientists, economists, fishermen and other experts assembled by the Pew Oceans Commission published the last of seven studies based on an exhaustive two-year inquiry into the state of America's ocean waters -- its fisheries, estuaries, wetlands and beaches. It is the first top-to-bottom study of its kind since the Stratton Commission reported to Congress in 1969. While the Pew commission's final recommendations are not due for several months, it has already confirmed what most of us thought: America's coastal waters and fishing grounds are in trouble, and they are greatly in need of far more attention at the federal level than they are getting. 
 The crisis has many dimensions. Runaway residential development destroys coastal wetlands and estuaries. Increased runoff from farms and cities pollutes streams, rivers and eventually the sea. Commercially valuable fish species -- cod, haddock, flounder and salmon off the Atlantic coast, salmon in the Pacific -- continue to decline. Invasive species pose a growing threat. 
 That it took a private foundation to organize such a study says much about the government's inattentiveness to marine issues over the past 30 years. But the Pew group argues convincingly that if government helped create the problem, government can also turn things around. Most of the problems can be solved, given enough political will and sufficient resources.
Indeed, a vehicle for addressing at least one big problem, overfishing, is close at hand. It is the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the basic law governing federal fisheries policy, which is up for reauthorization in the new Congress. The act's basic purpose is to regulate fish catches so depleted fish populations can recover and healthy fish populations can continue to grow.
Unfortunately, the law divides responsibility between the Commerce Department, which is supposed to take the long view, and eight regional councils, which tend to be dominated by fishermen who are more interested in catching fish now, not later. The result has been paralysis.
In fairness to the fishermen, however, Congress has done virtually nothing to ensure them a "soft landing" -- to tide them over while fish populations rebuild. Any meaningful strategy aimed at rebuilding fish stocks will inevitably require grounding some boats and retiring others. This is a question Congress must address as it reworks the act. The reauthorization debate could also provide an opportune moment to begin thinking about ways to consolidate the many federal agencies scattered across the bureaucratic landscape that deal with ocean issues.
Updating Magnuson-Stevens is, of course, only a small part of a much larger task. Sooner or later, for example, we are going to have to confront the consequences of coastal sprawl -- ecologically destructive development patterns that seem to have turned huge stretches of our southern coastlines into one long gated community. But getting its legislative house in order is a good place for Congress to start making amends for years of neglect.

Along With a Super Bowl, the N.F.L. Needs a Farewell Bowl

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ

 BODY:
Absent the Cincinnati Bengals, the National Football League could claim to have built the perfect socialist society. The Bengals, the N.F.L.'s most consistent franchise, have stubbornly resisted embracing the league's much ballyhooed parity. They haven't had a winning season since the last time a president named Bush talked of war with Iraq, in 1990. This is a remarkable non-achievement in a league so devoted to equality.
 Regardless of the size of their home markets, all teams get an equal cut of the N.F.L.'s TV riches. Mixing a free-agency system with a stringent cap on team payrolls is another equalizing force. To each franchise according to its needs, the N.F.L. believes, so it gives weaker teams earlier picks in the college draft and softer schedules. 
 This relentless march to equality has made it impossible for enduring dynasties to rule over the league. In contrast with baseball's pronounced divide between haves and have-nots, football fans everywhere know their team can be a contender in any given season -- everywhere, that is, but Cincinnati. Despite all those top draft picks, their soft schedule and a glistening new $450 million taxpayer-financed stadium, the Bengals finished the season with a 2-14 record. 
Last week the Bengals hired a new head coach, Marvin Lewis, a defensive genius who is a sound choice. Still, there are questions about just how much the coach alone can do to turn around a franchise seemingly committed to not winning. Bengals players have long complained that the team cuts too many corners. The scouting staff is too small, the organization won't hire a top-notch general manager, and while most teams engage in creative accounting to circumvent the salary cap, the Bengals' payroll is comfortably below it. 
One of the problems here, as with all forms of socialism, is one of inadequate incentives for any team that chooses not to be competitive. Regardless of their output, the Bengals receive their same cut of the TV money. Then they are rewarded for their losing ways in the college draft. Bengals fans, besides wanting their money back on the stadium, have asked the N.F.L. to intervene somehow, maybe going so far as to place the Bengals under U.N. receivership. 
What the league must do is infuse the Bengals with competitive fire. And one way to do that, while making the season a lot more exciting in the process, is to import the system of relegation used by most soccer leagues around the world. That entails demoting the worst team (in some leagues, it's more than one) to a lesser league, while promoting the lesser league's champion. Fiorentina, one of Italy's most storied soccer clubs, suffered such a demotion last season. In Spain this year, F.C. Barcelona's mediocre season has nervous fans wondering whether relegation could be in store for that team, one of the world's wealthiest sports franchises.
Such movement of teams between leagues strikes me as an all-American form of social mobility. The only problem, of course, is that unlike baseball, the N.F.L. lacks a ready-made minor league to absorb the losers. The Arena Football League plays its games indoors on a shorter field. The Canadian Football League plays on a longer field, and in a country where sensitivities about playing second fiddle run high. 
Still, the N.F.L. ought to find a way, even if it means taking over and upgrading one of these leagues or creating a new one. Another remedy, though less attractive, would be to force the sale of the worst team each year to new owners in a new city. That could inject much-needed economic Darwinism into the sport. Failing enterprises must be allowed to die. 
For their part, aspiring farm teams should be allowed to rise. Fans have appreciated the Horatio Alger-like careers of players like Kurt Warner and Tommy Maddox, quarterbacks who triumphed in lesser leagues before becoming N.F.L. stars. Affording the same upward mobility to, say, the Arena League's Grand Rapids Rampage, the C.F.L.'s Winnipeg Blue Bombers or a whole new team would bring a new level of dynamism to the league. 
Meanwhile, on this weekend when the N.F.L.'s top teams square off in the conference championships, fans would be treated to a third compelling game. The Bengals and the Detroit Lions, the season's second-worst team, would be facing off in the annual Farewell Bowl.

Misery Finds Company, Even Among The Rich

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
On Feb. 14, if all goes as planned, Bob Guccione's 17,000-square-foot town house on East 67th Street will be auctioned off downtown in the gilt rotunda of the New York Supreme Court, under the watchful, albeit painted, gazes of Hammurabi and Moses. 
 Mr. Guccione, head of the ailing Penthouse magazine empire, is in deep financial trouble, and his town house is in foreclosure because he owes two lenders $16 million. He is in good if worried company. 
Foreclosures on residential property in some affluent Manhattan neighborhoods are on the rise. From 2000 to 2002, foreclosure actions against condominiums on the Upper East Side, between 61st and 86th Streets, from Fifth Avenue to the East River, rose to 45 from 32. On the Upper West Side, between 60th and 91st Streets, from Central Park to the Hudson River, they rose to 32 from 13, according to the Public Data Corporation of Manhattan, which has a database of real estate and lien records. 
 "We used to see a lot in Harlem and Washington Heights," said Jessica Davis, president of Profiles Publications, a foreclosure listing service in Jackson Heights, Queens. "Now we're starting to see foreclosures on the Upper East Side. We're starting to see a lot of co-ops going into foreclosure, which we hadn't seen in quite some time." 
 According to foreclosure auction listings from Profiles Publications, 10 properties (which include condominiums and town houses) and 15 co-ops in Manhattan below 100th Street, excluding the Lower East Side, have gone up for auction in the last four weeks, contrasted with seven properties and six co-ops in the same period two years ago. 
 "I think you have people in very high income brackets who overextend themselves," Ms. Davis said. "They think the good times are never going to end."
 Michael Schill, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, added that in the last 10 to 15 years, affluent homeowners have used tax breaks on home equity loans and easy money from banks to take out second and third mortgages. That is risky. 
 "If you borrow 80 or 90 percent of the value and then take out a 10 percent home equity loan," he said, "then you're 100 percent mortgaged. If property values go down a little bit, you may as well let the bank take it."
 The Corcoran Group, a New York real estate company, says sale prices for residential property in Manhattan climbed last year in all segments except at the high end. There, prices for co-ops fell 7 percent and condominiums 5 percent. 
 Job losses are also a factor. "There is less of a cushion," Mr. Schill said. "'I bought too high, and I lost my job.' I bet that is the story for a lot of people."
 Matt Bordwin, a vice president at Keen Consultants, which helps companies in financial trouble dispose of real estate assets, said: "In the last 12 months, it has become more difficult to sell very high end properties. There are less buyers out there."
 Still, things aren't as bad as they were in the late 80's and early 90's, when property values plummeted. Robert Manzari, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, who ran the foreclosure department from 1987 until 1995, said the bottom fell out of his foreclosure business in 1994, and it hasn't come back. "We used to get them in the old days if they didn't sell at auction," he said. "They don't get that far anymore." ERIKA KINETZ

One-Vehicle Gridlock: Hummer Arrives In the City

BYLINE:  By TOM VANDERBILT 

 BODY:
There are certain disadvantages to being an urban Hummer dealer.
 Take "Hummer Happenings." These, as Hummer of Manhattan's sales manager, John Bruno Jr., explains, are off-road rallies organized by dealers for customers. He hopes to play host to his first event this spring. 
 Off road in New York? Yes, there are times when driving on road here summons those favorite stretches of rutted desert ravine outside of Moab, Utah. But, Central Park aside, where could a group of vehicles accustomed to duty on the Afghan steppes find free-range r.p.m.'s in one of the densest metropolises on Earth? "It's a bit more difficult for us because we're so urban," Mr. Bruno conceded. "We're thinking South Jersey or maybe the Poconos."
 Yet Manhattan does have its own comparative advantages for the fledgling Hummer dealership, now in its fifth month of operation at 55th Street and 11th Avenue: an abundance of disposable income and a concentration of business leaders and celebrities. "As fast as I can get them, I sell them," Mr. Bruno said. "Everyone does business in New York." 
 He added that while most customers who have bought his available supply -- nearly 100 vehicles in just over four months -- are from New York, there is otherwise no typical buyer. "Everybody from movie stars to athletes to a dentist from Queens," said Mr. Bruno, who says the actors Russell Crowe and Harrison Ford are among his customers. "I just this morning delivered an H2 to a woman in her 60's in the Bronx."
 Most of Mr. Bruno's customers have bought the 2003 H2, Hummer's more civilian-oriented brand extension of the iconic H1, a vehicle originally commissioned as a replacement for the United States military Jeep. While the $100,000 H1 has a diesel engine and tires that self-inflate and deflate, the H2, half the cost of the H1, has plastic bumpers and heated seats. 
 The look of the H2 -- a high and aggressive chrome grill, flat paneling and squat, muscular silhouette -- is deceptive, Mr. Bruno said. "When you put it next to the other cars, you see it's actually smaller." The H2 is shorter than the Lexus 470, and less wide than the Lincoln Navigator. Unloaded, it weighs 6,400 pounds, but at more than 8,000 pounds fully loaded, it tops them all. The Navigator weighs just under 6,000 unloaded. 
 With its limited fuel economy, an estimated 13 miles per gallon, city, presumed off-road emphasis and sheer size, one would hardly think the H2 the ideal urban vehicle. Mr. Bruno disagrees. "It's easier to park than most vehicles, because there's not a lot of overhang over the wheels," he said. "You can pull right in without hitting other cars' bumpers."
 A brochure notes that at the Hummer Driving Academy, one can learn to overcome "obstacles both physical and psychological," including the "basics of ditch crossings, water crossings, boulder navigation, recovery techniques and other advanced maneuvers." But what about such urban obstacles as jaywalkers, bike messengers, gridlock and double-parked trucks? "You sit up high, you can see everything," Mr. Bruno said. 
 On a rainy Saturday afternoon earlier this month, there were few customers in the G.M. (parent of Hummer) showroom. One man studying the H1 was Percival Greenridge, the chief operating officer of a podiatry practice. He was drawn to the H1, not for Manhattan but for the Virgin Islands, where he spends half his time.
 While all of Mr. Bruno's customers for the H1 have been men, the H2 casts a wider net. "I've definitely sold this vehicle to more women than anything like it," he said. "They have a saying: 'It's not for the soccer mom, it's for the rugby mom." Hummer, in at least one of its ads, seeks out women: The spot shows a woman driving an H2 through an unidentified urban environment. The tagline reads: "Threaten Men in a Whole New Way."
 It's not just men who ought to feel threatened by the Hummer, says John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists. "Driving a Hummer on city streets is like flying a giant flag that says, 'I hate New York,"' he said.
 Suitability aside, Mr. Kaehny was given a possible omen of the Hummer's future in New York several months ago when he previewed the Taxi and Limousine Commission's new back-seat flat-panel television sets being tested for in-cab use. "The first commercial they had placed in their experimental models was for the Hummer," he said, "which was kind of amazing."

Montessori School With a Deficit May Be a Victim of a Y 's Deficit

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
Last month, just before winter break, parents and teachers at the Montessori Day School learned that starting this summer, the school would be dropped as a program of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, which has housed and supported it for 17 years. The news, they said, came out of nowhere.
 "We had no advance warning," said Joyce Evans, co-president of the school's P.T.A., adding that the Dec. 12 announcement came after the deadlines allowing parents to apply to other private schools had passed and too late to allow Montessori to apply for grants that would ensure its continuation. 
Ms. Evans and her co-president, Hayley Gorenberg, both of whom have children at the school, said they knew that the Y had had financial problems in recent years. But they had no idea until December that the school, which is on Third Avenue near Flatbush Avenue and which has a $1.1 million budget, was running a $200,000 deficit. Sara Smith, the education director, said she knew that school had a deficit, but didn't know the extent of it until the Y's announcement. 
 Barbara Turk, executive director of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, said the decision to drop the program had been made quickly, after auditors found the Y had been running deficits for years and owed nearly $450,000. "We're in a very serious financial crisis," Ms. Turk said, "so we were forced to make some very painful decisions." 
 The school is the only program currently losing money, Ms. Turk said, adding that renting out the 15,000 square feet the school occupies would produce needed revenue and even give the Y a modest surplus. "Certainly we told the parents and the teachers as soon as a decision was made," she said.
 But the P.T.A. presidents said they wished they had known of the discussions before the decision was made. 
 "We feel like if someone had sat down with us and gone over the numbers," Ms. Evans said, "we could have come up with a plan for a smooth transition that would maintain the integrity of the program."
 At the very least, they said, a warning would have given them time to apply for outside financing for the school, which offers day care and classes to about 100 infants, preschoolers and kindergartners, and charges up to $12,000 annual tuition. Instead, Ms. Gorenberg said, parents and teachers are in turmoil.
 Ms. Turk promised last week that the Y would give the school the right of first refusal as renters and asked the P.T.A. presidents to come up with a business plan for such a transition. Ms. Gorenberg said the school could probably pay rent on the space eventually, but not right away.
 Her aim, she said, is a plan under which the school would defer paying rent until it gets outside financing. "That way," she added, "the Y can hold on to the goodwill in the community, as opposed to having an explosion of bad will and anger in the community." TARA BAHRAMPOUR

Markets Slide on Flat Economic Prospects

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
It was the first losing week of the year for the three major stock indexes, as indifferent prospects for technology bellwethers and worries about the economy rattled the markets.
 Microsoft, I.B.M. and Intel reported stronger earnings than expected for the last quarter, but indicated that this year would be uneven at best. 
Microsoft's announcement that it would start to pay dividends had little effect on its stock price, which fell 8 percent for the week. A host of other computer, chip, and software stocks also dropped, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq market down by 71.53 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at 1,376.19 for the week. 
 Several economic reports were downbeat. Consumer sentiment declined in January, industrial production fell unexpectedly in December, and the trade deficit swelled to a record $40.1 billion in November.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 25.79 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at 901.78 for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 198.15 points, or 2.3 percent, to 8,586.74.

Too busy with work or family obligations, an increasing number of men and women are turning to the Internet to find romance. Nearly 25 million people visited dating Web sites last November alone, according to a recent study by comScore Media Metrix, which measures Internet traffic. 
 Unlike traditional matchmaking services, which can cost thousands of dollars and require a lengthy screening process, most online dating sites offer instant contact with singles for around $25 a month. 
 The surge in online dating has spurred some innovative options. Last year, a site called Match began organizing meet-and-greet events for singles in cities like New York and San Francisco. And just last week, Yahoo Personals began allowing members to post videos with their profiles. JULIA MEURLING

Carefully Chosen Invective

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
IN one string of purple invective last week, North Korea's state media threatened to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire," called Americans "infinitely greedy and beastly to the bone" and said the country's "unshakable revolutionary stand" called for answering "a hard line with the toughest line and a bullet with a shell."
 There is usually strong temptation, both in Seoul and in Washington, to tune out such overheated words. "It is very difficult to get through all the adjectives sometimes," said one Western diplomat. South Koreans, meanwhile, are so used to the language that they often seem blase about the threat, even though their capital lies just 40 miles from the world's most heavily armed frontier. 
 When people do focus, it tends to be on the weirdness of the vitriol, and important nuances are often lost. As a window on the country, North Korea's official propaganda may be tiny and fogged, but experts on the country's propaganda say it has always been used with great rigor to send messages to the outside world.
"We once had the same trouble with China, and until Nixon went there China was considered almost another planet, and when you think that way it tends to magnify and distort things," said one former American analyst. "That's where we are with North Korea. It isn't always that they are so opaque. It is that we can't stop convincing ourselves that they are aliens."
Many of North Korea's statements in recent weeks have been genuinely alarming, though. Some American analysts and close followers of North Korean statements say subtle details in the language hint strongly at a shift toward a much more hard-line stance.
For example, the experts say they detect signs that the decision has already been made to produce nuclear weapons using plutonium from the reactor at Yongbyon -- rather than, as some have suggested, to bluff in that direction as a blackmail tactic. Other statements, like talk about "saving the Korean nation," suggest North Korea is preparing to wrap its nuclear weapons in the colors of pan-Korean nationalism, in an appeal to sympathetic opinion and resentment of the United States in the South.
Particularly worrisome, these analysts say, is the resumption of mass rallies -- like the gathering of perhaps two million slogan-chanting people in Pyongyang on Jan. 11 -- outside of traditional calendar events. Such huge rallies are costly; taken together with the themes of the speeches and slogans, they suggest a switch of priorities from economic resuscitation and reform to confrontation.
"Kim Jong Il has not relied on rallies so much because of the dwindling economy," said Kongdan Oh of the Institute for Defense Analyses, an American organization. "This is not showmanship for foreigners, but a sign of real mobilization driven by the level of fear and uncertainty that they are facing since the Bush administration came to power."
Another analyst said he was reminded of the time, around 1966, when North Korea entered another era of confrontation with America, after the leadership transferred huge amounts of resources to the military from the civilian sector.
"If there really has been a shift, either in the physical makeup of the leadership or a mind shift, maybe this can't be turned around," said one longtime former American analyst of North Korea who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "They may have concluded that 'We've been through this before with the Americans already, we got security assurances before, and a new administration came in and they were worthless.' "
Analysts say some of the latest North Korean statements, though buried in sarcasm about a new Bush administration offer for dialogue, give reason to qualify such predictions. After weeks of unrelenting negativity, they speak of a solution to the crisis that would "clear both sides of their concerns."
For all of the difficulty in parsing North Korean language, the task for North Korea in understanding the United States may scarcely be easier, given how little understanding the North Koreans have of how an American government forms policy while navigating between conflicting points of view. In recent months, American media accounts and statements by senior officials have spoken of everything from putting a humanitarian squeeze on the country to, most recently, offering it a "bold initiative," meaning security guarantees and economic ties in exchange for much more stringent disarmament.
The labels have sometimes been confusing even to Americans, ranging from "hawk engagement" to "tailored containment," a name for Washington's policy that Western diplomats say Mr. Bush dismissed as wacky sounding.
In a society as closed and authoritarian as North Korea's, the leaders may be incapable of grasping why an American president cannot simply make up his mind on foreign policy and carry it out at will. "Americans have a hard enough time knowing who's on top, Rumsfeld or Powell," said a former Asia analyst for the American government. "Most of us don't understand our huge, complicated, modern society either, but we operate in a level of comfort. We assume that the cars will stay on the right side of the street. But the North Koreans worry that it might veer into the oncoming lane."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK STATE MISSES 2 DEADLINES ON SECURITY PLANS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency pledged $8.8 billion to help New York City rebuild after Sept. 11, 2001, it set aside a minimum of $418 million for the state to finance projects to bolster the metropolitan area's preparedness for any future terrorist attack.
 But in the 16 months since the attack that destroyed the World Trade Center, the state has not submitted a single project for FEMA to review, even though it has received scores of proposals from state, city and private agencies desperate to do everything from reinforcing bridges to shoring up bioterrorism efforts at local hospitals. 
 In fact, the state has missed two deadlines for submitting the proposals, and has been forced to ask for two extensions totaling six months -- requests that emergency management officials say have been rare in other disasters.
The failure so far to take advantage of hundreds of millions of available dollars when both the state and city are in fiscal crises has troubled many local elected officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, who worry that the delays and indecision will hurt the state's ability to make a case for any money in the future.
"The state needs to move on this so that people are assured that work is being done to remedy our vulnerabilities," an aide to a New York Republican lawmaker said. "People are frustrated that the state seems to be sitting on its hands." 
Some lawmakers are also angered by what they regard as the Pataki administration's unwillingness to even signal which projects it might ultimately submit.
"The state is like a sphinx," Senator Charles E. Schumer said. "No one knows why they are not spending the money yet."
State officials attributed the delays in part to the complexity of deciding how best to protect against terrorists capable of sophisticated and varied assaults. They also said that simply sifting through all the proposals, with costs totaling an estimated $6 billion, has taken an enormously long time.
"A project of this magnitude is far too important to rush," said Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki. "The terrorist attacks on America were an unprecedented disaster, and this application clearly does not fit within the confines of a typical time period to prioritize projects for these funds."
As for the appearance of secrecy surrounding the projects, Ms. Fullington said many applicants did not want their requests to be disclosed publicly "because of the sensitive nature of the projects."
And Edward F. Jacoby Jr., director of the New York State Emergency Management Office, summarized the enormousness of the task in another way. "I've had to rethink my whole way of thinking about math in terms of billions, not millions."
Of the $21.4 billion that the federal government pledged in the months after the attack to help rebuild the city, $8.8 billion was to come from FEMA. As of last month, all but $366 million had either been spent or more or less formally allocated.
One of those allocations was the $418 million available under what is known as FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
In previous disasters, mitigation money has typically been used to retrofit buildings in earthquake zones or relocate houses in flood-prone areas. The amount of financing is determined by calculating the total cost of the disaster, then asking FEMA to authorize and supply an extra 15 percent of that total. FEMA pays 75 percent of the mitigation money, and local authorities 25 percent.
But Sept. 11, of course, was no normal disaster. And mitigation was likely to include things like installing blast-resistant windows and doors in skyscrapers and protecting emergency fuel supplies.
In the months after the attacks, Mr. Pataki pledged to push FEMA and the Bush administration to add more mitigation money -- allocations that could simply be added to the $8.8 billion package. State officials say they have received little feedback to date.
Within the last two weeks, however, city and federal officials have intensified their criticism, saying that the state has been too tentative and passive. They say that the delays not only leave the city vulnerable, but also jeopardize its chances of lobbying effectively for additional 9/11-related funds for police officers, firefighters and emergency workers on the front line of domestic security.
"Clearly we are living in the No. 1 target of the terrorists," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat. "We need more help than what the administration is giving us."
As it is, many agencies are already desperately counting on mitigation financing to help with their bottom lines at this moment of dwindling resources.
For instance, the Bloomberg administration is banking on $200 million from the hazard mitigation program and other federal sources to help close the budget gap. The city has also asked that the eligibility criteria -- now restricted, for the most part, to infrastructural work and disaster planning -- be broadened to include enhanced security measures like added police and emergency response units.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has proposed an estimated $1 billion worth of projects. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has submitted numerous proposals, too, but declined to make the details public.
There seems to be confusion within the Pataki administration as to whether state officials are looking seriously at projects outside the city.
The state's own mitigation handbook for the World Trade Center disaster notes that the money is supposed to be earmarked for projects in New York City or sites outside the city considered critical to its stability, like the city's reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains. Some state officials, however, have told Congressional aides that projects around the entire state are indeed being considered.
But Ms. Fullington, the spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said that "the governor has said that all the projects designated will be in New York City."
Assurances aside, few people outside Albany seem to know what projects are on the list. FEMA does not know. Elected officials do not know. City Hall does not know. Even state officials in Washington do not know.
Pataki officials also refused to release any specifics to two reporters, citing security concerns. Some clues, though, can be gleaned from a draft document prepared by the state on "Possible Terrorism Mitigation Measures," dated Dec. 12, 2001, and handed out to potential applicants. It identifies six priorities: 1) Protect Public Infrastructure and Utilities; 2) Protect Key Government and Health Care Facilities; 3) Continuity of Government and Business Operations; 4) Awareness Initiatives; 5) High-Rise Building Safety; 6) Protect Landmarks.
And as far back as November 2001, potential applicants received a letter from the State Emergency Management Office inviting them to apply.
But the state wound up missing its first deadline for submitting proposals: Sept. 11, 2002. It then missed a second deadline on Dec. 11, and now has been given until March 11 to submit its choices to FEMA.
If the state misses that deadline, a third extension will be more difficult to get, said Brad Gair, FEMA's federal recovery officer in New York. But Mr. Gair said he thought the state would meet the deadline.
"We're confident that there's no one more concerned about hazard mitigation than New York State," Mr. Gair said.
State officials say they are doing their best to wade through the applications -- a task complicated, they say, by an abundance of ideas that seem like good ones. But friction has arisen between the city and state as they negotiate which projects to finance, according to people knowledgeable about the discussions. One official described both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki as indecisive.
Once the projects are in, Mr. Gair said, FEMA is prepared and eager to process the applications as quickly as possible.
One thing that both Mr. Gair and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested -- and indeed has been done in previous disasters -- is for the state to submit a few proposals at a time. That way, FEMA could begin processing the most vital projects.
"There is no reason why we should not be proceeding to collect those monies and put them to work right now," Mrs. Clinton said. "I'm somewhat bewildered as to why we're not moving forward on this, because failing to submit the applications that have come in might suggest to FEMA that we don't need the money."

PERSON: John M. Fox 

HEADLINE: John M. Fox, 90, Innovator In Developing Frozen Juice 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
John M. Fox, a founder and president of the Minute Maid Corporation, which developed frozen orange juice concentrate in the late 1940's and made it popular within a decade, died on Jan. 9 in Winter Park, Fla. He was 90 and lived in Winter Park.
 At the end of World War II, Mr. Fox and four other businessmen set up a small company called Florida Foods Inc., which made the first commercial batch of frozen orange concentrate using a vacuum technique he had seen employed in Boston during the war to dehydrate penicillin and food for the military. 
 The original plan was to turn orange juice into a soluble powder, but this turned out to have an unpleasant taste. So instead, they reduced fresh juice to a thick concentrate, which proved far more drinkable when water was added. In 1947, the company changed its name to the Minute Maid Corporation.
Mr. Fox hired the singer Bing Crosby as the company's first spokesman and went door to door in his neighborhood in Hingham, Mass., giving out samples. First-year sales totaled $374,501, but by 1955 sales reached $106.5 million.
The company went public the next year, and built a headquarters in Orlando, Fla. After the company was sold to Coca-Cola in 1960, the headquarters were moved to Houston.
An immigrant from Britain, Mr. Fox had a second career in the food business after the sale of Minute Maid, becoming president and chairman of the United Fruit Company from 1960 to 1970.
At United Fruit, he discontinued the practice of shipping bananas on the stem, which resulted in heavy losses from bruising. Instead he had the fruit packed in specially designed cardboard boxes on the plantations and shipped directly to the distributors.
He also expanded the idea of branding the company's bananas, already famous under the Chiquita Banana name, by putting a blue company sticker directly on the bananas and other fruit. Today the company is called Chiquita Brands International.
Mr. Fox was president and chairman of H. P. Hood, a dairy products company in the Boston area, from 1970 until his retirement in 1978.
John Michael Fox was born in Esher, England, on Dec. 26, 1912, and came to the United States in 1914, settling with his parents in Atlantic City. After graduating from Colgate University in 1934, he worked for I.B.M. and then with the National Research Corporation, a product research company in Boston that developed a vacuum technique for dehydrating substances, among many other inventions. The vacuum method became the basis of the technique Minute Maid used for turning orange juice into concentrate.
Mr. Fox is survived by his wife, Floy; a daughter, Susan Castellini of Cincinnati; two sons, Stephen, of Peterborough, N.H., and Byron, of Mill Valley, Calif.; a sister, Nancy Burgess of Madison, Conn.; and 20 grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Rio Grande Choice: Take City's Water Or Let Minnow Die 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
A three-inch-long endangered fish is standing between this city and its plans for a well-watered future.
 The fish, the silvery minnow, native to the Rio Grande, has been the subject of years of court battles. But now a federal appeals court is about to decide whether, to save the fish, Albuquerque must give up drinking water it has set aside behind a federal dam for the years ahead. 
 The case poses the most direct confrontation yet between the Endangered Species Act, which ranks the protection of threatened animals and plants above human needs, and the water rights held by cities like Albuquerque in Western states where water is becoming increasingly scarce.
Among the states that have joined with the city of Albuquerque and the State of New Mexico in asking the court to reserve the water for people are Colorado, Idaho, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Wyoming. Their actions reflect wide expectation that the ruling could have broad implications, with a potential impact on scores of federal water projects and endangered species in 17 Western states. 
The mayor of Albuquerque, Martin Chavez, says the case involves "the highest stakes imaginable" for his city, whose rights to the water stored behind the dam date back to a 1962 contract with the federal government. The city now relies wholly on water pumped from the ground at rates that cannot be sustained. But under a $200 million transition plan that would leave the city using ground water as a small part of its supply, the water behind the dam would become essential.
Environmentalists who are challenging the city, however, say the water right is not absolute and can be superseded by the need to address the threat to the fish, once the most plentiful in the river. Like the flow of the Rio Grande itself, the minnow's numbers have dwindled, to the point where experts say the fish will not survive in the wild if the river, heavily tapped by farmers and others and now stricken by drought, is allowed to go dry. The river nearly did go dry this fall along a 60-mile stretch south of Albuquerque, which is the most critical habitat for survival of the minnow.
If the drought continues, only the release of water that Albuquerque and other users have stored behind the federal dam could keep enough water in that section of the river to sustain the minnow. While agreeing that an order forcing the release would be a radical step, the environmentalists say it would bring about a reckoning that is both necessary and long overdue.
"In my view, we can either come to terms with our problems while we still have a river, or we can wait until we no longer have a river," said Aletta Belin, a Santa Fe lawyer who represents a coalition of environmental groups that are suing the city, the state and the federal government to force the water release.
The intensity of feeling on both sides of the issue recalls other bitter fights over endangered species like the snail darter and the spotted owl, as well as the current battle involving the Klamath River in Oregon and California, where a threat to the sucker fish in 2001 prompted the federal government to withhold irrigation water from hundreds of angry farmers.
But never before has the plight of an endangered species threatened to cut into a large city's supply of drinking water. In New Mexico, that specter is seen as so alarming that several of the state's political leaders, including both its Republican and its Democratic senators, have warned that they may seek to override any adverse court decision through a convening of the so-called god squad, a rarely used federal panel with the power to override the Endangered Species Act when saving a species would cause intolerable economic harm.
The Bush administration, in its court arguments, has sided firmly with Albuquerque in arguing that the plight of the fish does not give the federal government the power to abrogate the city's right. But Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary, has also made clear that she expects the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit to set a clearer line in such water disputes.
"This case will help us understand what the rules are" when it comes to accommodating human needs and protecting endangered species, Ms. Norton said in New Mexico last month.
The appeals court is reviewing a ruling by a judge in New Mexico, James Parker of Federal District Court, who sided with the environmentalists in September by ordering the release of about 10,000 acre-feet of the water, about one-fifth of Albuquerque's annual allotment.
The water, stored by the federal Bureau of Reclamation behind Heron Dam in northern New Mexico, was to have flowed down the Rio Grande past Albuquerque to guarantee a minimum flow in the stretch deemed a critical habitat for the minnow. But before it was released, the appellate court stayed the ruling, in response to protests by Albuquerque and other litigants, including an irrigation district in central New Mexico, who argued that Judge Parker had exceeded his authority.
In a stroke of good fortune for the fish, and contrary to most predictions, rainfall this autumn and winter has kept enough water in the Rio Grande for the minnow to survive, the objective that Judge Parker intended to secure through the water's release.
But snowfall in the mountains this winter has been far below normal, meaning that by early summer, the Rio Grande's flow is likely to drop again toward a critical point. 
The September ruling would have required the release of only about one-fifteenth of the water now stored in the dam, and only about half of that water is claimed by Albuquerque. In the most immediate sense, such a release would not have a direct effect on Albuquerque, because it has not yet begun to use any of the water in the reservoir. 
But city officials argue that the release will take away water that Albuquerque will need beginning in 2006. That is when the city is to reduce the water pumped from the aquifer on which it is now wholly dependent to about 20 percent of its supply and begin to rely on the water behind the dam.
And in the future, the Albuquerque officials warn, an established federal right to deliver less than the contracted amount of 48,300 acre-feet per year would leave the city no option but to turn back to the aquifer, which is already so depleted that at current rates of pumping, it is not expected to last more than another 25 years.
"The federal government would be sitting in the position of deciding whose water and how much of whose water can be used by the fish every year, and how much is left for everyone else," said John Stomp, Albuquerque's director of water resources.
"And in the long term, by its enforcement of the Endangered Species Act," Mr. Stomp said, "the federal government would be creating an environmental catastrophe, through depletion of the aquifer and land-surface subsidence."
By contrast, Mr. Chavez, the mayor, has said a favorable ruling would leave Albuquerque with enough water to sustain its population "for generations and generations and generations to come."
Albuquerque, with a population of about 450,000, lies on the Rio Grande, but the water at stake in this case originally comes from another river, the San Juan in Colorado, on the western side of the Continental Divide. Water rights from the Rio Grande, which were divided in the 1930's among Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, along with Mexico, are so oversubscribed that the city of Albuquerque has never held any. The contract for the San Juan River water was Albuquerque's effort to line up an alternative source of surface water as insurance against the time the aquifer runs out.
Through a federal diversion project whose costs are being reimbursed by Albuquerque and other users, an annual allotment of water from the San Juan River is now rechanneled across to the eastern side of the Continental Divide and into New Mexico's Chama River, where most of it is stored behind the Heron Dam. From there, Albuquerque and the minnow's critical habitat lie downriver, along the Rio Grande.
Over the years, with the aquifer supplying its municipal needs, Albuquerque has generally leased its rights to the San Juan water to others, most often farmers. But with its transition to reliance on surface water looming, the city says it no longer has any excess, either for crops or for the fish.
The Fish and Wildlife Service first listed the silvery minnow as an endangered species in 1994, and efforts to save the species in recent years have indirectly involved the use of Albuquerque's water, through an arrangement in which farmers who have had to give up Rio Grande water for the fish have made up the difference by leasing water that the city has not used.
But while Albuquerque has also joined in efforts to save the fish in special fisheries, it has not done much to rein in its own heavy water use, with rates that are among the highest in the region. The same is true of New Mexico as a whole, a state whose water resources are severely limited, but that is only now beginning to try to assess the amount of water it uses and the amount that might be available in the future.
For those reasons, some experts who are sitting out the fight over the silvery minnow are trying to turn attention to the need for more realistic long-term planning that they say the case has helped to expose.
"One of the reasons we got into this mess is that we haven't been very good about managing our water," said Consuelo Bokum of 1,000 Friends of New Mexico, an advocacy group that focuses on land use, growth and water issues but has not taken a position on the endangered species case. "I'm convinced that we've let things go too long without being very strict."

HEADLINE: Commission to Urge Freezing Some Medicare Payments 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
To slow the growth of Medicare, an influential federal advisory panel will soon recommend that Congress freeze payments to nursing homes and home care agencies and reduce the cost-of-living allowance that hospitals are scheduled to receive next year.
 Republicans in Congress and Bush administration officials welcomed the proposals, saying they would save money for taxpayers and the Medicare trust fund. But health care providers expressed alarm, saying the proposals could reduce access to care for millions of the elderly and disabled. 
 The panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, recommended a 2.5 percent increase in Medicare payments to doctors next year. Payments to doctors were cut 5.4 percent last year, and a further cut of 4.4 percent is scheduled to take effect on March 1. 
Doctors are lobbying Congress to block that reduction. The Senate is poised to approve a proposal by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to keep doctor payments at 2002 levels for the rest of this year. It is unclear whether the proposal, part of an omnibus spending bill, will ultimately become law.
In a draft of its annual report, to be sent to Congress in March, the commission said that "Medicare payments for hospital services are at least adequate" to cover the costs of efficient providers. Payments to nursing homes and home health agencies appear "more than adequate" to cover the costs of treating Medicare patients, the panel said.
Medicare payments to home health agencies were cut 4.9 percent on Oct. 1, and nursing homes say their payments were reduced an average of 10 percent at that time. Experts on the staff of the commission said that home care agencies and nursing homes had been able to control their costs without reducing the quality of care.
At a meeting this week, many of the 17 commissioners said Medicare had no obligation to make up for underpayments by other insurers, like Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people.
"We should not use Medicare dollars to offset Medicaid losses," said the commission chairman, Glenn M. Hackbarth. He added, "I don't see evidence to support the claim that our recommendations would impede access to quality care."
With growing federal deficits, Republicans are eager to slow the growth of Medicare, but they face political pressure from two sources: elderly people demanding coverage of prescription drugs and health care providers lobbying for higher Medicare payments.
Congressional aides said the commission's advice would make it easier for some lawmakers to resist the pressure from hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies.
John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, said: "The commission is a highly respected group whose recommendations usually carry great weight in Congress. Its recommendations will help Congress resist the otherwise overwhelming political pressure to raise provider payment rates."
AARP, the group formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, says Congress should not increase payments to providers without ensuring that older Americans get drug coverage.
Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, said his members were "tremendously disappointed" with the commission's proposal to reduce the annual inflation adjustment for hospitals. The commission, he said, underestimated the "enormous cost pressures" on hospitals from technology, pharmaceuticals, malpractice insurance and disaster preparedness.
One commission member, Carol Raphael, president of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, the largest nonprofit home care agency in the nation, expressed grave reservations about the proposed freeze in payment rates for home care.
At a time when chronic illness is more prevalent and the population is aging, Ms. Raphael said, fewer people are using Medicare's home health care provision. The number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving home care declined to 2.2 million in 2001, from 3.5 million in 1997.
"This is very puzzling," Ms. Raphael said. She suggested that some home care agencies may have become more selective, avoiding high-cost patients who have Alzheimer's disease, serious wounds or complicated forms of diabetes.
James C. Pyles, a lawyer for the American Association for Home Care, said: "More than 1.3 million people have been eliminated from the rolls. They include some of the sickest patients, those who really need the benefit."
The staff of the commission and the chairman proposed cuts in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals, but by a vote of 9 to 6, the panel rejected that idea.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 96 teaching hospitals, said, "The staff recommendation would have been devastating to academic health centers and teaching hospitals."
Medicare pays $5.1 billion a year to teaching hospitals for some of the extra costs they incur. The commission staff said such hospitals were overpaid because the extra costs totaled just $2.5 billion.
The commission expects a 3.5 percent increase in the cost of goods and services used by hospitals of all types next year. But it said hospitals could get by with an inflation update of 3.1 percent for inpatient care and 2.5 percent for outpatient services. Together, it said, those recommendations would save $250 million to $800 million next year and could save $1.2 billion to $6 billion over five years.
Hospitals, like doctors and nursing homes, "should be expected to improve productivity," the panel said.

HEADLINE: Somalia Talks Are Stormy, But They Still Inch Ahead 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ELDORET, Kenya, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The peace talks unfolding here aimed at ending Somalia's long civil war have turned as chaotic as the country itself. Warlords are trying to oust the mediator. Hotels are threatening to evict delegates over unpaid bills. The police were recently ordered to expel the many Somalis who arrived without invitations.
 The negotiations, now in their fourth month, were troubled from the start. 
 Hundreds of extra delegates showed up in October, prompting a brisk sale in bogus credentials. There have been walkouts, shouting matches and a protest during Ramadan by the management of a hotel holding unpaid bills that left unfed many delegates from the largely Muslim country who had been fasting all day.
"The tragedy of it all is that it's probably better positioned than any conference in the past to accomplish something," said one of the handful of Western diplomats tracking the negotiations. "I wouldn't say it's hopeless, although it certainly looks hopeless when you're there."
The country looks just as troubled. It has no national government to speak of, a form of limbo that has existed for a dozen years. Instead, heavily armed warlords rule by brute force, a throwback to medieval times. Although most Somalis are desperate for an end to more than a decade of anarchy, they still associate more with clan than country.
 On Friday, the United Nations condemned a series of killings of children and kidnappings in Somalia, where gunmen have killed several schoolchildren in attacks on buses in the last month. 
The United States ignored Somalia in the years after 1993, when 18 American soldiers were killed in an aid mission that went awry. But Somalia's importance to the West has grown with the onset of the American-led campaign against terrorism. Somalia's long coastline, porous borders and strategic location just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, not to mention its lack of a central government, make it an ideal breeding ground for militants.
The Americans have been monitoring the talks, which have offered some slivers of hope despite the confusion.
These talks have attracted more of the important Somali players than any of the dozen or so past peace conferences convened since 1991, when the dictatorship of Muhammad Siad Barre was overthrown.
The Eldoret talks also have made some tangible progress, like an agreement to cease hostilities, albeit one that has been repeatedly violated. Now, the talks are getting down to the basics of what a united Somalia would look like. Organizers say they expect a final plan to emerge later this year, although the process has been slow. "It's getting frustrating," said Muhammad Sheik Gabiou, a Somali constitutional law expert who has been involved in past efforts to bring order to the country. "Somalis like to talk and talk and talk, even when they don't know what they're talking about."
Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti, Somalia's neighbors, are sponsoring the talks through an organization known as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. The European Union, the Americans and others are providing financing, although they have withheld some funds recently as the talks have spiraled out of control.
Numerous hotels have not been paid for many of their costs. To protest, the management of the main conference site, the Sirikwa Hotel, in late November closed the buffet that Somalis descend on every evening. The Kenyan Foreign Ministry was forced to intervene to get it reopened.
Recently, some warlords tried to replace the Kenyan mediator, Elijah W. Mwangale, accusing him of repeatedly changing the official number of delegates, now set at 396.
The last semisuccessful Somali peace talks were held in 2000 in Djibouti. One result was a transitional government, including a president, Abdikassim Salad Hassan, and a 245-member assembly, although most of the warlords boycotted the talks and worked to undermine the results.
That transitional body, which has controlled pockets of Mogadishu but little else, formally dissolves in August. Two regions in the north, Somaliland and Puntland, have elected their own leaders. In the rest of the country, warlords continue to fight for turf.
Despite the broad representation at the Eldoret conference, officials from the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland have boycotted the talks, focusing instead on their own elections. Frustrated warlords also have begun to go back to Mogadishu, leaving no indication of whether they will return.
But the many Somalis who remain in Eldoret are trying to agree on a loose federalist structure that balances the country's many clans.
"We're making progress," said Awad Ahmed Ashara, a minister in the breakaway Puntland government. He and others want the rest of the world, especially the Americans, to join the give-and-take in Eldoret.
"We feel the Americans are reluctant to get involved," Mr. Ashara said. "They are worried about Somalia being a haven for terrorists, but they're not helping the process. We'd like to hear something from the White House."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 1-19-03: CLOSE READING; 
When Diamonds and Escalades Are O.K.

BYLINE:  By Rob Walker; Rob Walker is a contributing writer for Slate and Money.

 BODY:
By most appearances, the year just ended was a bad one for "bling bling." A slang term that has made its way from hip-hop culture to the mainstream, bling blinging is most easily understood as flaunting that $1 million Piaget diamond-crusted watch. It doesn't tell time any better than a plastic Casio; it does send a clear message that the wearer has money to burn. The phrase was popularized in a song by rappers from the Cash Money Millionaires stable and was in part a catalog of obnoxiously flashy possessions (a private plane, for example).
 Of course, that song dates from 1999 -- the good old days, when rap artists were hardly the only ones bingeing. Twenty-something stock tycoons, Wall Streeters and various staid old white guys in charge of huge corporations bling-blinged all through the 1990's, and nobody complained. That was partly because they seemed to be fueling an economy that was good for everybody and partly because so many people saw skyrocketing individual wealth not so much as a problem but as something to get in on. It is only natural that a couple of years of crashing stocks, rising unemployment and corporate fraud -- and, of course, the wrenching personal reprioritization that Sept. 11, 2001, inspired in many -- might turn us into a nation of Thorstein Veblens, with little tolerance for such conspicuous consumption. 
 Evidence of an anti-bling mentality is all around. The neo-grunge, thrift-store style of Avril Lavigne, for example, is shouldering aside the glittery flash of Britney Spears on the radio and in retail outlets across America. There is the form that the vogue for C.E.O. bashing has taken: Dennis Kozlowski ended up with the words "Oink Oink" over his picture on the front of The New York Post not because people were upset with -- or even understood -- what he is accused of doing wrong as the C.E.O. of Tyco but rather because it came to be known that he owned a $15,000 umbrella stand. And in her latest hit song, even Jennifer Lopez seems a little nervous. In what seems to be a stab at humility, she assures that "I love my life and my public" and encourages us not to be "fooled" by her diamond life because deep down she's "still Jenny from the block."
But wait a minute. In the video for that song, Lopez positively revels in the trappings of extreme wealth -- the diamonds, the limos, the fur coats, the boats, the Champagne. If J. Lo really thinks her public might punish her for losing touch with "the block," then why rub our noses in her flagrantly bejeweled lifestyle on MTV? Her "public" doesn't seem to mind, having pushed the slender tune near the top of the charts. How does she get away with both sickening riches and humility? Dennis Kozlowski, among others, would like to know. 
The answer is that despite appearances to the contrary, deep down Americans don't really have a problem with conspicuous consumption per se. It is all in the packaging: we're O.K. with bling bling so long as we believe it has been earned. Lopez makes for an interesting case study because her public image is simultaneously middle of the road -- as the star of the bland romantic comedy "Maid in Manhattan" -- and streetwise, as a pop singer who collaborates with rap artists and borrows liberally from hip-hop culture. It is the latter point that matters, because even now hip-hop culture remains a safe haven for ridiculous expenditure.
Bling king Sean (P. Diddy) Combs, for instance, has lately been photographed jet-skiing in his bathrobe on the French Riviera, and he has bragged about his extensive list of demands (flowers, mirrors, tequila, multiple copies of "Scarface") for being the host of a music-awards show. Snoop Dogg, styling himself a kind of Hugh Hefner, has taken to drinking from a goblet covered with rhinestones. Then there is Nelly, another rap artist selling millions. If hip-hop was once "the CNN of black America," as Chuck D memorably put it, Nelly's new single is basically an infomercial. Titled "Air Force Ones," it is an ode to shopping for a style of $80-and-up Nike shoe -- buying by the case when possible -- and includes what must be the least impressive boast in the history of rap: "Walk in the mall and they know what I'm 'bout to say." The song is a smash and has sparked such a run on the shoes that The Wall Street Journal says some Foot Locker employees have been accused of "scalping" pairs at $200 a pop. Fatigue among hip-hop fans with endless raps about Courvoisier, diamonds and Cadillac Escalades is said to have played a role in the embrace of Eminem's less-brand-oriented subject matter. But if some hip-hop fans see flashy spending as worthy of condemnation, others clearly see it as worthy of emulation. 
"Using objects to make connections between people and establish one's authority is an ancient and universal form of human behavior," Thomas Hine argues in the recent book "I Want That! How We All Became Shoppers." He notes that those who possess "key objects" -- the crown, the mantle, the Piaget watch -- "have been the rulers and wizards of their peoples." The subtext of the song "Bling Bling" was that the Cash Money Millionaires had clawed their way out of a brutal New Orleans housing project to become multiplatinum stars, and indeed some variation on that is the theme of much hip-hop. Often it is not even articulated; it goes without saying that the squandering protagonist is a rags-to-riches figure who beat overwhelming odds and has every right to the fruits of that success.
But the bad news for Dennis Kozlowski is that our tolerance for $15,000 umbrella-stand owners drops to zero if such "key objects" are not earned. Like many a hip-hop star, Kozlowski rose from humble origins, too, and according to his lawyers, he has done nothing wrong. But the overwhelming consensus is that somehow or other he and his peers cheated their way to wealth. So it is too late for Kozlowski to pose as Denny from the block. Sure, Sean Combs was once accused of hitting a record executive with a chair and a Champagne bottle, but at least he has never smacked your 401(k) around. 
This is why the new and supposedly humble incarnation of J. Lo -- who once included a 45-foot trailer with white sofas, a VCR and green seedless grapes as part of her specific demands for participating in a charity project -- should be taken with a grain of salt. When she sings "I used to have a little, now I have a lot," what she is saying is "and therefore, I deserve it all."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Marriage Penalty, Except When It Isn't

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IF politicians of almost every stripe agree so readily about an issue, it is usually worth a closer look.
 Such is the case with an important but barely debated component of President Bush's $674 billion tax-cut plan: relief from the "marriage penalty." 
 It is hard to find an idea with more mom-and-apple-pie appeal. Who wants to be against marriage? Who wants to be for higher taxes? Who would defend a tax burden that seems both unfair and capricious, a result of anomalies in the law? 
As any two-income married couple knows, the marriage penalty kicks in when the husband and wife combine their incomes on a joint tax return and suddenly find themselves in a much higher bracket. A couple who together earn $80,000 owe hundreds more than two singles who each earn $40,000.
Small wonder that Democrats, who have attacked Mr. Bush's overall plan as reckless and overwhelmingly tilted toward the rich, have said virtually nothing about plans to alleviate this problem.
But for all the complaints about the marriage penalty, the current tax code is in many ways heavily biased in favor of married couples, especially those with children. Tens of millions of families actually receive big marriage bonuses, which would become even bigger under Mr. Bush's plan.
Consider the tax loads of three different households, each with an annual taxable income of $60,000. In an analysis prepared last week by Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, a single person with no children would owe $7,943 under current law and receive a tax cut of $345 under Mr. Bush's plan.
By contrast, a married couple who have two children and file jointly would pay $3,300 under current law and $2,400 under the Bush plan. Did someone say marriage penalty?
Defenders point out that the married couple have more mouths to feed, more clothes to buy and more house to pay for. But consider the third household: a single mother with one child. She would have to shoulder child-care expenses that a married couple with a stay-at-home parent would not. Yet she would owe $1,800 more than the married couple under current law, and her tax cut would be about half that of the married couple.
The big winners under current law and the Bush plan are the Ozzie and Harriets -- married couples with only one breadwinner and two or more children.
Two-income married couples are in some respects the biggest victims of the marriage penalty, and their problems do not disappear under the Bush plan. Single people pay the highest taxes of all, under current law and the Bush plan, though a single person earning $60,000 may still end up paying less than a husband and wife who together earn the same amount.
There are technical reasons behind all this, but they seem to stem from a surprisingly intense political battle waged by influential conservative groups determined to encourage stay-at-home moms.
"The people who are treated the best are families with stay-at-home spouses, who, not surprisingly, are an important constituency for Republicans," said Edward J. McCaffery, a law professor at the University of Southern California and the author of "Taxing Women" (University of Chicago Press).
As far as two-income couples are concerned, "the more equal they are as earners, the higher the penalty will be," Mr. McCaffery added.
ONE big reason for the bigger tax burden may be the role played over the years by Phyllis Schlafly, the indefatigable foe of feminism and of anything in the tax code that encourages women to leave their children for outside work.
Ms. Schlafly has pushed for child tax credits, which are given for each child in the family and would be increased to $1,000 from $600, and opposed tax breaks for the costs of child care, which are not being expanded.
She has fought for years to ensure that marriage-penalty relief flows to families with stay-at-home moms as well as two-income households. Mr. Bush's plan would raise the standard deduction for any married couple. When he proposed a special 10 percent tax break for two-income families in his 2001 tax bill, Ms. Schlafly raised a storm and helped kill the idea.
"Giving a tax cut only to two-earner couples would send the radical feminist message that the government sees no value in a homemaker's work at home," Ms. Schlafly wrote at the time, urging her supporters to write and call important Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee.
The upshot is good news for the Harriet Nelsons of the country, unless, of course, Harriet decides to be a lawyer and make some money herself.

Readers, Like Investors, Are Tiring of C.E.O.'s

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
JUST before the market crash in October 1929, when business leaders and horse racing were both popular, a horse named Chief Executive provided his owner with one big payday. He paid $7.80 to win and picked up a $1,300 purse -- about $13,000 in today's dollars -- at the Laurel Racetrack in Maryland.
 Chief Executive kept racing for at least three years but apparently recorded no other significant paydays. 
 Horse racing in 1929 and book publishing today have a peculiar symmetry: one big payoff from a chief executive has been followed by a string of disappointments.
Jack Welch provided a big payoff for his publisher, Warner Books, part of AOL Time Warner, with "Jack: Straight from the Gut," his triumphal memoir of running General Electric. It has sold 800,000 copies since it was published on Sept. 11, 2001, according to Nielsen BookScan, which covers about 70 percent of retail sales, including those at Costco, Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com, but does not record wholesale bulk orders or sales at some other stores, like Wal-Mart. 
"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done," by Honeywell's former chief executive, Lawrence A. Bossidy, and the consultant Ram Charan, has done well for Crown Business, part of Bertelsmann, selling close to 200,000 copies. And Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the former chief executive at I.B.M., is delivering one for HarperBusiness, part of the News Corporation, which published his book, "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?" It has sold 110,000 copies since it was published last November -- 50,000 in just the four weeks ending Jan. 5.
But the winning streak ends there. With profits falling, unemployment rising and Sophoclean tales of corporate fraud and greed still fresh in people's minds, executives -- even well-known, successful ones -- are no longer unquestioningly accepted as Saviors With Solutions.
At the same time, the market is glutted with business books, many commissioned in the booming 90's but not delivered until after the market started its tumble -- or worse, after corporate scandals began to undermine the conceit of executive infallibility. And more than a few have been written by chief executives who are something less than household names, like Arthur C. Martinez, the former chief executive of Sears, Roebuck, and J. B. Fuqua, who owned the company that owned the company that makes Snapper lawn mowers. Still, the books keep coming: next month, the Free Press will publish one by Leo J. Hindery Jr., chairman of the YES Network, which broadcasts Yankees games.
"During the boom in the 90's, any crazy book with any crazy idea sold well because everything worked -- it was a bonanza," said Steven Ross, a senior vice president at Crown Publishers. Now the market for business books is undergoing what a stockbroker would call a significant correction. Some titles have sold as few as 1,000 copies 10 months after hitting the shelves.
"The average book buyer has lost a great deal of confidence in the chief executive and knocked them down from their iconic status in a lot of ways," Mr. Ross said. "What we're seeing now is that people are glorying in knocking them down."
The biographical equivalent of short-sellers -- books by outsiders that make a case against one chief executive or many -- are more likely to pay off these days.
"Martha Inc.," an unvarnished look at the domestic diva by the financial writer Christopher Byron and published by John Wiley & Sons, has sold "in the neighborhood of" 100,000 copies since its publication last spring, said Jeff Brown, vice president for professional and trade publishing at Wiley. Nielsen BookScan has recorded sales of about 70,000.
Although a steady diet of news about accounting fraud, excessive pay and the flagging economy has dulled the public's appetite for tales of corporate heroes, bad news about some executives is not necessarily bad news for the books by or about them.
If anything, sales of "Martha Inc." grew slightly stronger while the Security and Exchange Commission's insider-trading investigation into Ms. Stewart's sales of ImClone Systems stock was headline news over the summer.
Jenny Lawton, the owner of Just Books, whose location in Greenwich, Conn., makes it the hometown bookstore for dozens of aspiring chief executives, said she had sold dozens of copies of "Martha Inc." "The bad press can really bring buyers in," she said.
Similarly, the revelations of Mr. Welch's rich retirement package, which included perquisites like New York Knicks tickets and laundry service, paid for by G.E., did little to dampen his book's sales. As book industry specialists figure it, even after covering Mr. Welch's $7.1 million advance, Warner is now turning a profit on the book.
Bulk sales can be a big advantage to business-oriented books like these -- an advantage not usually enjoyed as much by trade fiction and nonfiction titles. The sales figures associated with bulk orders are not easy to isolate, but Amazon.com does break out the percentage of its sales that are made in lots of 10 or more. Such orders accounted for about 27 percent of all orders for Mr. Welch's book. Some have come from the G.E. itself. A spokesman for G.E.'s headquarters division said 400 books had been ordered by that division alone.
By contrast, only about 12 percent of the sales of Mr. Gerstner's book have come from bulk purchases, Amazon reported. A spokeswoman said I.B.M. had bought perhaps a dozen books for clients but that the company had forbidden its departments to place bulk orders and employees were not allowed to list purchases of the book as business expenses. The book describes how I.B.M. met the challenges of Microsoft and the Internet.
At the other extreme, Amazon reported that bulk sales account for 47 percent of the sales of Mr. Bossidy's book. A spokesman for his publisher said tens of thousands of copies had been sold in bulk.
Even in Greenwich, contrarian books have the most momentum. Ms. Lawton said her biggest seller in that department was "Take On the Street" by Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the S.E.C., with Paula Dwyer. Nationwide, about 40,000 copies have been sold since it was published at the beginning of October, according to Nielsen BookScan. Some people in the securities industry have criticized the book as siding with individual investors who say they were fleeced by Wall Street, Mr. Levitt said, "but a surprising number of stockbrokers said, 'I'm glad you said it.' "
Unlike many investors, Mr. Levitt did have perfect market timing -- the potential audience of burned investors has seldom been larger. "From a market point of view, I was very, very lucky," he said.
AMONG the new titles that disparage chief executives are "Why C.E.O.'s Fail" by David L. Dotlich, another Honeywell executive, and Peter C. Cairo, a book that is set for publication next April by Jossey-Bass, part of Wiley & Sons, and "Pigs at the Trough" by the political commentator Arianna Huffington, which Crown Publishers has just published.
The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. provided a promotional blurb that says Ms. Huffington's goal is "to rescue capitalism from C.E.O.'s." Larry David, the cranky writer and star of HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm," confirmed through a spokeswoman that he had bought 100 advance copies from the publisher to distribute as Christmas gifts. As Mr. David knows, these days, dyspepsia sells.
Even "Execution" is less a how-to book than a how-not-to book. It opens with the lament of an anonymous manager: "We've lost our credibility with the Street. I've probably lost my credibility with the board. I don't know what to do, and I don't know where the bottom is." It then presents episodes from the management history of other chief executives, like AT&T's recently departed C. Michael Armstrong, not as triumphs but as cautionary tales.
The future for upbeat business books is not uniformly bleak. "As we're seeing with consistent sales of 'Execution,' there is still a market for good, timeless nuts-and-bolts strategy," Mr. Ross said. As the economy grows stronger, he said, he expects the market to pick up for books extolling executives. "What we're seeing right now is that people are glorying in knocking them down," he said.
Or ignoring them. "Cable Cowboy: John Malone and the Rise of the Modern Cable Business" by Mark Robichaux, has sold about 2,600 copies from retail outlets since its publication by Wiley in October, Nielsen BookScan reported. "Rupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Media Wizard," by Neil Chenoweth, was published two months ago by Crown and it is off to a sluggish start: about 1,500 retail sales to date.
Technology executives, whose business is a reminder of the bygone bubble economy, are a doubly difficult sell between the covers of a book. "John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility," by John K. Waters, has sold less than 1,000 copies since Wiley published it 11 months ago.
"I think they missed their cultural moment," said Mr. Ross, of Crown Publishers. Obscure first novels have had stronger sales.
Mr. Brown, the Wiley vice president, cautioned that the shift in readers' taste was not likely to be long-lasting because the nature of business books is to tell people how to succeed. Even in bad times, chief executives are likely to be exemplars of success, he said.
"Obviously, everybody's under a lot of scrutiny, and rightly so," he said. "But underlying these books are very strong-minded people who have a vision and see opportunities, and all of them are excellent deal makers and tough negotiators. And there's always a market for a well-told story."

HEADLINE: A Star Is Born (If AOL Rebounds) 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
DON LOGAN, chairman of AOL Time Warner's media and communications group, is often described as an apolitical, unpretentious man with more interest in outwitting fish than corporate foes.
 Even so, he seems to have an equal affinity for both endeavors. After 10 years of running Time Inc., one of the company's smaller and more stable divisions, Mr. Logan last summer secured one of the top three positions at AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company. 
 He was one of the many executives whose vociferous complaints helped drive out Robert W. Pittman, the chief operating officer, last summer. And in the six months since Mr. Logan was handed oversight of the struggling America Online division, he has firmly established his own control over the division's future, no matter the views of its founder, Stephen M. Case. 
Last weekend, Mr. Case announced that he would step down as chairman in May, and on Thursday the company announced that Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive, would add the position of chairman to his duties.
The latest corporate moves mean that the game belongs to the old Time Warner crew now, a shocking development considering it was Time Warner that sold itself to AOL two years ago. Besides America Online and Time Inc., Mr. Logan oversees Time Warner Cable and the AOL Time Warner Book Group. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the veteran HBO executive and Mr. Logan's equal, has responsibility for the music, movie and television network divisions.
The most vexing problems facing the company, however, belong to America Online. Mr. Logan privately railed against AOL's acquisition of Time Warner. But now he appears to realize that while the architects of the merger may be gone, they have taken all the excuses with them. 
If America Online does bounce back on Mr. Logan's watch, and the other divisions he oversees continue to churn out earnings, he could join Mr. Bewkes as a potential candidate to eventually succeed Mr. Parsons as AOL Time Warner's chief executive. But if the unit's troubles continue to drag down the company's stock, or if cable, magazines or books falter, both Mr. Logan and Mr. Parsons could find their positions under attack.
Mr. Logan, 58, a former NASA programmer who was born in Mobile, Ala., is a large man who looks like just another back-office lifer as he arrives at the corporate headquarters in Manhattan many mornings with a brown bag containing coffee. Except that he gets off the elevator at a far loftier floor and makes decisions with implications in the billions.
AN Internet skeptic who once famously likened the medium to a black hole after he noticed its remarkable ability to make money disappear, Mr. Logan never dreamed that it would grow big enough to swallow the company he helped build.
His distaste for the merger with AOL seems to have fueled his willingness to make it work. He was, and is, personally offended that the value of the company's stock and its employees' retirement plans has been diminished since the deal closed two years ago. The stock closed on Friday at $14.81, off 74 percent since then. And though rumblings abound that America Online may eventually be spun off or sold, those options could never recover the merger's cost.
But turning around America Online will not be easy for Mr. Logan and Jonathan F. Miller, the division's chairman, whom Mr. Logan, Mr. Parsons and Mr. Case hired last summer. Although America Online is still profitable and its margins are better than the parent company's music and movie divisions, they are rapidly diminishing. America Online's customers are increasingly shifting to high-speed Internet access, an area in which AOL faces much lower margins and much tougher competition. Its cash flow is expected to drop to $1.4 billion in 2002, from $2.3 billion in 2001, almost wholly a result of a drastic falloff in ad revenue. American advertising and e-commerce revenue, which totaled $2.3 billion in 2001, is expected to come in at $1.2 billion in 2002. 
America Online's performance under Mr. Logan may be the last shot the division has at avoiding the kind of communications obsolescence not seen since the telephone relegated the telegraph to second-class status. AOL Time Warner executives have said AOL has a year to 18 months to show progress.
Mr. Logan's ascension in the company has reassured Wall Street, where he's known for delivering steady and growing profits at Time Inc. "Once everybody started talking about the elephant in the room, which was what a fiasco this really was and the business is in a free fall, Logan seemed like a logical choice," said John Tinker, an analyst at Blaylock & Partners. "People began to admit that maybe AOL was not a big growth company, and that is not unlike the situation he confronted when he came to Time Inc."
WHEN Mr. Logan was summoned to Time Inc. headquarters in New York in 1992 from the offices of Southern Progress in Birmingham, Ala., he took over a stagnant magazine business that some said was washed up and was in danger of being spun off. That year, the company had earnings of $328 million before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization. By 2001, the company produced $909 million in similar earnings, capping 10 years of growth. He enjoyed the success, but never was one for a victory lap in the news media.
"Don seems to believe that the stake that sticks out is the one that gets pounded in," said Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc. (True to form, Mr. Logan declined an interview.)
Before he agreed to oversee America Online, Mr. Logan had only one Internet credential on his resume. And it was not pretty: Time Inc.'s $100 million effort in the 90's to build a Web portal called Pathfinder, which became just another costly asterisk in digital history. His present effort, with a $9 billion-a-year business, could be far more expensive.
Mr. Logan and Mr. Miller are determined to maintain America Online's customer base, move into broadband and find a reasonable advertising model. But all the happy talk about a new common ground leaves a bitter taste among those who are no longer part of the effort.
"They hated us and did everything they could to make sure that we got no cooperation and made no progress, including Logan," said a former senior AOL executive. "It reminds me of the child who killed his mother and father and then threw himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan."
His genial ruthlessness in pursuit of dominion over America Online has been notable not just for its speed, but also for its effectiveness. Mr. Logan has stunned members of the America Online staff during his once-a-week visits to the division's headquarters in Dulles, Va., by occasionally pulling up a chair and joining them at lunch in the cafeteria. 
Among the division's top executives, Mr. Logan has gained a reputation for digesting information quickly and speaking only when his conclusions are solid and complete. 
"He doesn't say anything stupid," said one AOL staff member who has met with him.
Mr. Logan's laconic nature also extends to his management style. "There are very few people I know who are as beloved as Don is who don't hand out a lot of praise, or a lot of criticism for that matter," said John Huey, the editorial director of Time Inc. "He is not big on that feedback thing."
After six months in his new role, Mr. Logan has concluded that there is still plenty of talent at AOL to fix its problems.
"It is not a horribly complex business to understand, but it is a fast-moving business and it is one that was built very quickly from the ground up," Mr. Logan said two weeks ago in an interview.
The plan to fix America Online, announced in December after hurried strategic review, goes in several directions. The company has vowed to better manage its database of subscribers, charging different prices to different users and weeding out the unprofitable customers. AOL is also stepping up efforts to court the growing number of Internet users switching to high-speed connections with distinctive multimedia and news and entertainment. And the company is trying to sell subscribers a wider variety of goods and extra services, from close-out sales of leftover merchandise to e-mail that is read aloud over the phone.
The strategy has its share of complications. AOL's broadband offering competes with that of another division Mr. Logan oversees -- Time Warner Cable, which has the greatest cash flow of any unit in the company. (Though people at the company said Mr. Logan was less involved in its operations, he bears responsibility for its oversight, and in the summer it is scheduled for an initial public offering that will influence whether its parent company remains mired in the grip of excessive debts taken on after the merger.)
Internal competition is unavoidable, but investors are going to want to see discrete results at America Online. The challenge eluded Mr. Pittman and Mr. Case. 
"Don's whole history is walking into jobs that he was not qualified for," said Daniel Okrent, a former senior editorial executive at Time Inc. who worked on Pathfinder. He said that Mr. Logan entered publishing through a side door, serving as a data processing manager at Southern Progress, then a publisher of genteel lifestyle magazines. Southern Progress was later acquired by Time Inc. 
"HE would be the first to tell you that he knew nothing about publishing magazines that didn't have recipes in them when he came to Time Inc.," Mr. Okrent said. Mr. Logan was tolerated as a hayseed who had been foisted on the Time Inc. sophisticates until it became clear that he was destined to run the whole show. He showed little patience for the various duchies that had been built up over the years, dumping a centralized sales force and pushing power down to the leaders of the various magazines. That decentralized approach characterizes his dealings with the divisions under his control that are running smoothly.
The executives who report to him are still responsive to his needs. "We are still cooking up stuff for Don Logan," said Ann S. Moore, who succeeded Mr. Logan as chief of Time Inc. She mentioned that in the next few months, many of Time Inc.'s biggest magazines will be available online only through America Online.
Time Inc.'s history of using core franchises to build new businesses (like the creation of In Style and Teen People out of People magazine) and its ability to make circulation a money-making proposition (unlike most of the magazine industry) could come in handy at America Online. If AOL found a way to charge for its popular instant messaging or achieved even a small reduction in customer turnover, the economic impact could be significant.
So far, Mr. Logan has been supportive of Mr. Miller, but because of the division's problems has uncharacteristically involved himself in operations. "I think Jon is doing a great job," Mr. Logan said two weeks ago. "I am fairly close to it. He is getting a lot of advice and help, probably more than he needs." 
In spite of what his admirers say, Mr. Logan is not without personal ambition. On New Year's Eve in 1999, he and his wife, Sandy, were on a lake in Alabama with a portable television so they could watch the ball drop in Times Square while he tried to be the first man to catch a fish in the new millennium. He was skunked. Fortunately for him, there is still an opening to be the first man in this millennium to land a big victory on the Internet.

Secret Diplomacy: Rules of the Road

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SECRET diplomacy between enemies, a tactic as old as the Peloponnesian War, is back in fashion as the United States searches for the right signal to resolve the confrontation over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
 The Russians, Chinese and South Koreans are all probing the intentions of the North Koreans to see if there is anything in their threat to create a "sea of fire" if the United States tries to increase military or economic pressure to get its way. The Bush administration says it wants a diplomatic solution, but also insists there is nothing to negotiate until North Korea does what Washington wants -- commit to dismantling its armaments. 
 All this leaves the United States in the peculiar situation of seeking negotiations without appearing to do so, sending messages publicly and through back channels. Veterans of clandestine diplomacy say that experience offers a number of rules the Bush administration would do well to consider. 
1) Find the right intermediary.
According to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, people often offer to serve as a go-between -- or agree to, as Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former representative at the United Nations under President Bill Clinton, did with the North Koreans in Santa Fe a week ago.
"Back channels offer a chance for a lot of people to get into the act," Mr. Shultz said. "You don't want the people you're negotiating with to pick the negotiator. You also don't want your negotiator to be a semi-independent wild card."
President Ronald Reagan, he noted, used his private sessions with Russia's ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, to send messages to Moscow, though many in the administration feared that Mr. Reagan's messages needed to be vetted.
The Bush administration has so far spurned Mr. Richardson's offer to continue as a mediator, though they approved his initial talks, in part because of his ties to Mr. Clinton. 
2) Look for signals and then pick the one you prefer.
The most famous case of secret diplomacy, President Richard M. Nixon's contacts with China, had trouble getting off the ground because of missed signals. Early in his term, Mr. Nixon began looking for avenues to reach Mao Zedong. Because Washington had no relations with Beijing, inquiries were made through Poland, Pakistan and other nations. Mao, at the same time, was trying to reach out to Mr. Nixon by giving an interview to Edgar Snow, the China expert, for Life magazine, then a widely read publication. 
But, Richard Reeves, author of a book about Nixon, said nobody in the White House or the State Department at that time read Life. "The Chinese and the Americans were going on parallel tracks, unaware of each other's attempts," Mr. Reeves said.
As for picking the right signal, this was illustrated by the Cuban missile crisis, when President John F. Kennedy used a secret go-between to the Russian leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev. When conflicting messages about Moscow's intentions came into the White House, Kennedy simply responded to the most conciliatory one. Some experts say that if President Bush were to follow this model, he would only heed the message of a willingness to talk that came through Mr. Richardson, not the public threats.
3) Excessive secrecy may no longer be necessary, and it may even backfire.
"It is less necessary to use back channels," said John Lewis Gaddis, the Yale historian. "People have gotten used to the idea of secret diplomacy."
While engaging in confidential negotiations for President Nixon, the secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, was so anxious about keeping his contacts secret that he instructed the Russians not to disclose some of their agreements to the State Department. 
"That was probably carrying the back channel to an extreme," Mr. Gaddis said.
The public now might even believe that secret diplomacy is going on when it is not -- including reports of Arab countries making contact with Saddam Hussein to tell him come clean on his weapons programs to avoid being ousted. American officials fear such contacts might give Mr. Hussein a false impression that Washington wants a compromise deal.
4) Make sure what is said in public resembles what is said in private.
During the secret contacts with North Vietnam that led to talks to end the Vietnam War, American officials often asked the North Vietnamese government to corroborate something said in private with a public signal via Radio Hanoi. "You need to ask the other side to respond publicly so you know it's authoritative," said Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Pentagon and State Department official. He said signals often were buried in statements issued by Radio Hanoi.
If signals are not issued, private negotiations might founder on the public record, many experts say. For example, the public record is that Saudi Arabia and Turkey oppose an invasion of Iraq led by Washington. Though officials may be receptive in private, it might be hard to go back on that public record, which has been broadcast throughout the Arab world. Similarly, it may be hard for President Bush to negotiate with President Kim Jong Il of North Korea because Mr. Bush has said he loathes him.
5) When other avenues fail, try the second track.
The so-called second track has become increasingly popular, Mr. Gelb says, whereby former diplomats and interested parties outside of government meet with counterparts on the other side in a private dialogue that eventually leads to the governments' exchanging messages.
The Israeli-Palestinian talks under the aegis of Norwegian mediators in Oslo began with such contacts.
But in the end, all these rules are secondary to luck, timing and instinct. 
"There are windows of opportunity that open and close very quickly," said Robert S. Strauss, a longtime adviser to presidents and Middle East envoy for President Jimmy Carter. "Somebody has to have the authority to move when the window opens and to know what they want."

HEADLINE: Correspondence/The Cult of Popularity; 
Fear Has Its Own Language in Iraq

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
ASKED his thoughts about replacing Iraq's government by force, Sheik Talel al-Khalidi, a member of parliament and tribal leader from Mosul, launches into one of those all-too-common sermons about President Saddam Hussein winning 100 percent of the vote in a referendum last October. 
 He demands to know how the Bush administration can possibly ignore such overwhelming support, prompting a visitor to note that Americans tend to respect election results when voters actually have a choice. 
 "But there was a choice!" the sheik protests. "People could vote yes or no." 
Any interview in Iraq runs the risk of capsizing beneath the flood of Orwellian language that courses through all public discussions, rendering true thoughts and sentiments extremely elusive. Occasionally someone angry or reckless enough voices harsh criticism of the Iraqi government, but such encounters are both furtive and extremely rare. 
Since most interviews between Iraqis and the Western press are organized and monitored by minders from the Ministry of Information, many Iraqis take the prudent step of garnishing their remarks with some praise for their president. This is an old-school totalitarian regime, after all, where criticizing the president is illegal, and parents have been known to disappear after their children parroted anti-Hussein remarks heard at home.
Foreigners with long experience here believe this is a matter of conditioning, of fear and self-censorship that have become innate. Iraqis are raised from childhood to sing -- often literally -- the president's praises. 
They are also taught to mistrust foreigners. So when they find themselves talking to a foreigner, they respond as if by rote, often with safe, stock phrases.
T HE most telling example of this conditioning in recent weeks has been the attempt by arms inspectors to interview scientists confidentially about Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. In the few cases publicized, the scientists involved refused to be interviewed outside Iraq, and even requested the presence of a government representative.
"It is hard to be sure that the person being questioned can tell the truth," said a Western envoy here. "Iraqis have already internalized how they are supposed to act, what they are supposed to say, how they are supposed to think." 
Often it's a question of degree. Some Iraqis make a few passing laudatory remarks and get on with the subject at hand, making the interview interesting and worthwhile. Others manage to weave the president's name into virtually every sentence, overwhelming the possibility that they will say anything a reporter could mistake for an independent, thoughtful judgment.
Take the question of how the young generation, the students now in college, view the world after having grown up living through both the Iran-Iraq war and the 12 years of international economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
A request to the Ministry of Information, mandatory to talk to a few learned sources on this subject, led to an interview with Nahida Abdel-Karim Hafez, a sociology professor at Baghdad University. Others in different academic fields had already said that young Iraqis live in a world of limited horizons, but her responses reverted to one rote phrase.
"The Iraqi personality is strong because of our culture, our heritage and the wisdom of the leader," said the middle-aged professor, her head veiled in a white scarf. "Such a personality, depending as it does on our culture, our history and the wisdom of the leader, faces any future with strength."
After 20 minutes of riffs along this theme, it seemed wise to end the interview. 
THE southern port of Basra suffered more than most Iraqi cities for more than two decades because of its proximity to both Iran and Kuwait. It was battered by artillery or bombs in both conflicts, and nearby residents suffer seemingly higher rates of cancer that might be linked to depleted uranium shells. A request to the Ministry of Information to meet an Iraqi professional to gauge how the standard of living diminished alarmingly over this period led to the home of Abbas al-Rikabi, 53, an English professor at the University of Basra. 
Since graduating from the University of Wales in 1983, he and his wife have raised their four children in a battered, water-stained, three-bedroom modular home that they rent from the university. The 100 such homes in what is basically a trailer park were put up in 1975 as temporary housing. The family spent much of the 1980's making daily runs to a bomb shelter -- their water and electricity knocked out by Iranian shelling. The professor, a member of the Baath Party, earns the equivalent of roughly $100 a month and does not own a car.
To a question about how he perceives the weapons inspections, he segues quickly from President Hussein's claim that there are none, to unsolicited thoughts about the man: "We love Saddam Hussein, not only love him, we adore him, he is the symbol of our unity. Without Saddam Hussein we will die, believe me."
And what does he think will happen to Basra should there be another war?
"I want you to convey my feelings to President Bush, my feelings as an educated man. Please, Mr. Bush, leave us alone because we love Saddam Hussein."
His oldest child is in her last year studying biology at Basra University, where one son just entered agricultural school. The two other children are in high school. 
How, he was asked, do his children perceive their future?
"They are sad, they are melancholy, but we have a glimpse of hope, which is Saddam Hussein."
It was clearly time to abandon this interview.
SOMETIMES Iraqis themselves cut off any discussion after making the necessary remarks about Mr. Hussein, evidently concerned about edging onto thin ice. 
At a military parade intended to flaunt a budding civil defense network, the chaperone of one group of adolescent girls who marched ordered them to stop speaking after they made a few worshipful remarks about the leader. 
When a couple of foreign reporters objected, she shooed her charges away, saying dismissively: "We all say 'Yes, yes, Saddam Hussein.' What else could you possibly need to know?"
Another group of zealous trainees jumped in, eagerly detailing how they had learned to shoot and administer first aid. But the discussion did not last long without a reference to Mr. Hussein, with the praise popping up seemingly from nowhere. 
"All of us can hit it, not only her," chimed in one woman about target practice. "All of us can hit it, there is no leader except Saddam Hussein."
Many public spectacles are staged here, and the visiting press corps is dutifully hauled to them, only to find that much of the entertainment consists of praise for Mr. Hussein. The most recent example was the inauguration of a recreational lake in Baghdad on the occasion of Army Day. (No points for guessing that it is called Saddam Lake.)
A few poets stood up before the crowd to spout spontaneous verse, the official translators struggling to keep up with what amounted to Arab rap. 
"We will stimulate ourselves by saying your name, Saddam Hussein, when we say Saddam Hussein, we stimulate ourselves," a translator said in a rush.

HEADLINE: The Crisis Last Time 

BYLINE:  By William J. Perry and Ashton B. Carter; William J. Perry and Ashton B. Carter, co-directors of the Preventive Defense Project at Stanford and Harvard universities, served as, respectively, secretary of defense and assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration.

 BODY:
Fifty years ago the Korean War ended not with a treaty but with a truce. Just how precarious that truce can be is being demonstrated on the Korean Peninsula -- much as it was demonstrated in June 1994, when the United States came to the brink of war with North Korea.
 That crisis is forever ingrained in our memories because we were personally involved in preparations for a possible military strike on North Korea's nuclear reactor complex at Yongbyon with conventional weapons, and for the war that could well have followed -- a war that would have been disastrous for all sides. Today's crisis is eerily similar to that of 1994. But what happened four years later may be just as pertinent as the Bush administration thinks through its options now. 
 In August 1998, North Korea conducted an unannounced test firing of a missile, which passed over Japan before crashing into the Pacific. This test led to heated calls in both Washington and Tokyo to abandon the Agreed Framework, the deal that ended the 1994 crisis, under which North Korea had suspended production of weapons-capable plutonium at Yongbyon in exchange for oil shipments. 
Between the nuclear crisis of 1994 and the missile crisis of 1998, the United States had turned its attention to other crises in Bosnia and Haiti. But North Korea's ambitions to obtain weapons of mass destruction had not abated. While the freeze at Yongbyon was verified by on-site inspectors, our intelligence community continued to have suspicions about nuclear-related activities elsewhere in the North, suspicions that later proved correct.
Presented with these developments, President Bill Clinton asked us for a comprehensive review of United States policy toward North Korea.
We considered several strategies. One was to attempt to undermine the North Korean government. There was scant evidence, however, of dissent within the Stalinist regime -- certainly nothing like the factions in Iraq, let alone Afghanistan. Moreover, we did not have much time. Our concern about weapons of mass destruction was urgent. Finally, our allies would not have supported this option. 
Another option was to base our strategy on the prospect of reform within North Korea. Perhaps Kim Jong Il would take the path of China's Deng Xiaoping, opening up his country economically and trying to be a member of the international community. But hope is not a policy. We needed a strategy for the near term. Summing up the first two options, our report stated, "U.S. policy must deal with the North Korean government as it is, not as we might wish it to be."
Equally unacceptable was buying our objectives with economic assistance. Our report said the United States would not offer North Korea "tangible 'rewards' for appropriate security behavior; doing so would both transgress principles the United States values and open us up to further blackmail."
In the end, we recommended that the United States, South Korea and Japan all proceed to talk to North Korea -- but with a coordinated message and negotiating strategy.
The verifiable elimination of the nuclear and missile programs was the paramount objective. Our decision not to undermine the regime could be used as a negotiating lever: much as we objected to its conduct, we could tell the North that we did not plan to go to war to change it. We could live in peace. But that peace would not be possible if North Korea pursued nuclear weapons. Far from guaranteeing security, building such weapons would force a confrontation.
We could also argue that since North Korea had enough conventional firepower to make war a distinctly unpleasant prospect to us, it didn't need weapons of mass destruction to safeguard its security. This relative stability, in turn, could provide the time and conditions for a relaxation of tension and, eventually, improved relations if North Korea transformed its relations with the rest of the world.
After many trips to Seoul, Tokyo and also Beijing to coordinate our approaches, in May 1999 we went to Pyongyang. We presented North Korea with two alternatives.
On the upward path, North Korea would verifiably eliminate its nuclear and missile programs. In return, the United States would take political steps to relieve its security concerns -- the most important of which to affirm that we had no hostile intent toward North Korea. We would also help it dismantle its weapons facilities. Working with us and through their own negotiations, South Korea and Japan would expand their contacts and economic links. 
On the downward path, the three allies would resort to all means of pressure, including those that risked war, to achieve our objectives.
We concluded the policy review and stepped down from our advisory roles in the summer of 2000. Over the next two years, North Korea took some small steps on the upward path. It agreed to a moratorium on tests of long-range missiles. It continued the freeze at Yongbyon. It embarked on talks with South Korea that led to the 2000 summit meeting of the leaders of North and South. 
The North also began the process of healing its strained relations with Japan, making the astonishing admission that it had kidnapped Japanese citizens in the 1970's and 80's. And it allowed United States inspectors to visit a mountain that we suspected was a site of further nuclear-weapons work, a precursor of the intrusive inspections needed for confident verification. Whether North Korea would have taken further steps on this path is history that will never be written.
Now President Bush faces a situation similar to the one President Clinton confronted in 1994. However he chooses to proceed, he should bear in mind three central principles derived from our experience.
The first is that North Korea must not be allowed to produce a series of nuclear bombs. Nuclear weapons might embolden it to believe it could scare away the United States from defending the South, making war more likely. The North's nuclear program could set off a domino effect of proliferation in Asia and around the world. Or some of its bombs might be sold to the highest bidders, including terrorists, or get loose if North Korea's government collapses.
The second tenet is that United States strategy toward North Korea can succeed only with the support of our allies in the region, South Korea and Japan. Their national interests and ours are not identical, but they overlap strongly. South Korea can provide vital assistance in persuading North Korea's leaders to change course -- or it can undermine our position if it is not persuaded we are right. Above all, the South Korean army must stand shoulder to shoulder with our troops to deter North Korean aggression. Keeping our militaries united and prepared is the best assurance that they will not have to be used.
Finally, any strategy must recognize the urgency of the situation. Within a matter of weeks, North Korea could create enough weapons-grade plutonium from the fuel rods at Yongbyon to build about five bombs. Once the plutonium is extracted it could be moved anywhere, making it much more difficult to find and eliminate. That could take us back to the summer of 1994 and the prospect of war.
Yes, this is a serious crisis. But it can be managed. The solution must come from equal parts credibility and courage: the first to make clear our determination to remove the nuclear threat even if it risks war, and the second to pursue creative diplomatic alternatives to war.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
In the Debate Over Tax Cuts, Both Parties See a Chance to Score Points

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The aisles were packed at Politics and Prose, a bookstore in one of America's more affluent neighborhoods, when a billionaire's father arrived to promote his book calling for higher taxes on the rich. The customers there to buy copies of "Wealth and Our Commonwealth" loudly applauded William H. Gates as he denounced greedy plutocrats and declared the estate tax to be "the finest tax conceived by man."
 A quick survey of these book buyers from the Chevy Chase and Forest Hills sections of Washington found precisely zero percent in favor of the White House's proposed tax cuts. Echoing Democrats in Congress, they called it "unfair," "a giveaway to the rich," "a disaster." The closest encouraging word for the Bush plan came a few doors up Connecticut Avenue at Besta Pizza, a tiny carryout shop owned by an Egyptian immigrant, Tarek Zahow, who commutes to his 70-hour-a-week job from a much less upscale neighborhood 15 miles out of town. 
 "Of course I'm for tax cuts," Mr. Zahow said. He said he supported the White House's proposal, even though he realized the affluent would receive most of the money, and favored eliminating the estate tax even if it applied only to millionaires.
"I'm nowhere near a million in assets, but I might be someday," he said. "I don't think it's fair to have a tax for just a few people. Charge everyone the same."
However irrational he may seem to Democrats, Mr. Zahow is just the sort of voter President Bush was addressing when he accused the critics of his tax plan of engaging in "class warfare." Populist appeals can work during tough economic times, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt demonstrated, but Republicans are betting that Mr. Zahow is more representative of today's voters than Mr. Gates's fans are.
"Any time you have a tax cut, the majority of people will say it favors the rich, but so what?" said Matthew Dowd, a pollster who advises the White House and the Republican National Committee. "This issue just doesn't resonate with most Americans the way it does with the Democratic Party's activists and core constituencies."
Republicans point to various surveys showing acceptance of tax breaks for the affluent. In a New York Times/CBS poll two years ago, 71 percent of the respondents opposed an estate tax even after being told it would apply only to estates above $1 million. Even when the threshold was raised to $3.5 million, in a poll last year, the tax was still opposed by 41 percent of Americans (with 54 percent in favor).
Like Mr. Zahow, many voters say they can imagine this tax applying to them. While only 1 percent of Americans classified themselves as wealthy in a 1999 Newsweek poll, another 41 percent said it was "very likely" or "somewhat likely" that they would become wealthy. Other surveys show that Americans are much less prone to class envy than Europeans are, and more optimistic that they or their children will join the ranks of the affluent.
"We have class wannabe but not class envy," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "The Democrats are using arguments that would work in Europe, because it's more of a status quo society, but we're still the Wild West of economies." 
Well-educated liberals in places like Chevy Chase often resent the fortunes made by their less-bright classmates, Mr. Luntz said, but the rest of America is less resentful.
"Democrats keep expecting the working classes to rise up against the wealthy, but the Republicans are actually gaining in places like Kentucky and West Virginia while the Democrats are gaining in Beverly Hills and Greenwich, Connecticut," Mr. Luntz said. "If these new tax cuts were just for the rich, people would be upset, but as long as everyone gets some piece of the pie, working-class Americans won't begrudge the benefits going to others."
Democratic pollsters acknowledge the perils of a populist appeal, but they insist it can work sometimes. Stanley Greenberg, a pollster for the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, said populist themes worked for Mr. Clinton in 1992 and helped Mr. Gore go from an 11-point deficit to a 5-point lead (and eventually a slim popular-vote majority) in the 2000 campaign. 
"The Bush tax plan is a particularly narrow proposal that's easily caricatured," Mr. Greenberg said. "The Democrats ought to engage it in class terms, but that does not mean they are going to offer an angry populism."
Guy Molyneux, a Democratic pollster who has been conducting a national poll for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. the past several days, said he had found only lukewarm support for he president's tax cuts. 
"This tax proposal reinforces the concern that he's the rich man's president," Mr. Molyneux said. "If the country is persuaded that the dividend tax cut will dramatically improve the stock market, that would be an important source of support for the plan, but I don't think that's going to happen."
Even before his latest proposal, Mr. Bush was perceived by 51 percent of Americans as favoring the rich, according to a Gallup poll for CNN and USA Today completed Jan. 5. Forty-one percent said he was fair to all, an improvement over his father's 27 percent rating when the same question was asked during the elder Bush's losing presidential campaign of 1992.
"This president has established a different reputation than his father, and class warfare won't play as well against him," said Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, and a co-author of the 1998 book "Attitudes Toward Income Inequality."
"I've looked at four decades of polls, and I see no erosion in the belief that opportunity is present for those who are willing to work," she said. "Class warfare has the possibility to resonate when times are really tough, but I don't sense it has that much intensity right now. "
The White House has been arguing that its plan would give less affluent workers some of the largest income-tax cuts when measured as a percentage of each worker's pay instead of in absolute dollars. But polls have traditionally shown that most Americans instinctively assume tax cuts go to the rich instead of to them. Even when many low-income workers were taken off the federal income tax tax rolls altogether in the 1980's, they still told pollsters that they would not benefit personally.
Public opinion on the tax cuts will ultimately be decided by the economy, said Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center, a polling institute. "In the 1980's people felt that Reagan's economic policy favored the rich, but it paid dividends for everyone, so the Democrats' criticism didn't cut it," Mr. Kohut said. "Today the public has reservations about the fairness of Bush's proposal, but if in the end it works to improve the economy, those reservations will be forgotten. If it doesn't, Bush will pay a price."

HEADLINE: Chavez Set Back on Expanding Mediation Group 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela failed today to win backing from President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil to include Russia, France and other "friendly" nations in a United States-sponsored mediation effort to restore peace to Venezuela.
 Mr. Chavez, who is facing growing demands from opponents at home to resign as Venezuela's economy buckles under a seven-week-long strike, said here today that he was "grateful for the good faith and will to help" shown by other nations. But he insisted that the mediation group formed by the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Portugal and Chile be broadened. 
 "We see this group as a preconfiguration," he said on arrival at a military base here for talks with his major regional ally. 
But after two hours of talks with Mr. da Silva, he told reporters that he had "agreed to give my vote of confidence to the group so it can function properly and contribute toward a solution." He said the group could be broadened at a later date.
The Brazilian foreign minister, Celso Amorim, said the Brazilians had emphasized to Mr. Chavez that "the balance found in the group is a delicate balance" that "represents various points of view."
"He probably still has his personal doubts," Mr. Amorim said, but adding, "I think he understood."
Mr. Chavez said earlier that Russia had shown interest in joining the group and that Venezuela had approached France. He also said Fidel Castro of Cuba and Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson of Jamaica should not be left out.
A State Department official said on Friday that the United States and other nations involved in the initiative were satisfied that the mediation group had already been formed.
Using his usual fiery rhetoric, Mr. Chavez said he believed that Brazil and other countries "will not simply align themselves with any old position" proposed by the United States. "What's at stake in Venezuela is the construction of an alternative to neo-liberalism," he said. Neo-liberalism is the term he and other leftist leaders use to describe a gamut of United States-inspired free-market policies that many contend have failed to deliver economic growth with social justice in the developing world.

HEADLINE: Latin America's Political Compass Veers Toward the Left 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Latin America's four most visible left-leaning heads of state came together for the first time this week at the inauguration of one of them as president of Ecuador.
 Ecuador's new leader, Lucio Gutierrez, is a former army colonel and coup plotter who has promised to fight the "corrupt oligarchy" in his country. The others are Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former union leader elected to the Brazilian presidency in October; Fidel Castro of Cuba, the grand old man of the Latin American left; and Venezuela's embattled president, Hugo Chavez. 
 The four basked in applause at Ecuador's cavernous Congress on Wednesday and held meetings to discuss the future of a troubled region.
To some in Washington, particularly conservatives on Capitol Hill, the convergence of leftist leaders -- all of whom, at some point, have used antagonistic words in criticizing United States policy -- has raised concerns about a new pan-Latin American movement with socialist overtones. 
Indeed, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois and the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, warned late last year that Brazil's new president might join Mr. Chavez and Mr. Castro in a Latin "axis of evil." Mr. Hyde also characterized Mr. da Silva as a dangerous "pro-Castro radical who for electoral purposes had posed as a moderate."
It is true that all four leaders share similarities: opposition to the unfettered market reforms that have failed so far to bring prosperity to Latin America, concern about the burdensome foreign debts that stagger many nations in the region and wariness about the United States meddling in their affairs.
Invigorated by Mr. da Silva's victory in Brazil -- the first election of a leftist president in the largest Latin American country -- the four leaders see an opportunity to shape events in the region, rather than leave it to the United States to set the agenda.
Brazil has already exerted its influence, with Mr. da Silva becoming the driving force behind a "group of friendly nations," including the United States, that is offering to help Venezuela negotiate an end to a seven-week-old national strike aimed at forcing Mr. Chavez from power. The Venezuelan leader has welcomed the initiative, flying on Friday to meet in Brazil with Mr. da Silva to discuss ways to resolve the crisis.
"There's no question that these four nations are going to form an axis of populism, or an axis of popular rhetoric," said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based policy analysis group.
But Mr. Birns and other analysts who track political trends in Latin America said that while the four leaders might, on the surface, show a united front, they were four very different men who would pursue different agendas with markedly different approaches.
Mr. da Silva, 57, who grew up in poverty, became a factory worker and helped found the Workers Party, won a loyal following as a leftist firebrand who railed against everything from international lending policies to the incompetence and corruption of Brazil's elite class.
But after losing three presidential elections, he moderated his tone, promising that Brazil would pay its foreign debt while still trying to enact social policies to alleviate poverty and hunger.
While still raising concerns about such important issues as the hemisphere-wide trade zone proposed by Washington, Mr. da Silva has worked to build ties with the Bush administration. "I can count on President Bush as an ally," he has said.
Miguel Diaz, director of the South America Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said of Mr. da Silva, "He wants the U.S. to be a part of the solution, and doesn't see the U.S. as part of the problem."
That is not to say that Mr. da Silva plans to abandon his campaign against poverty and hunger. His Workers Party, an amalgam of divergent leftist movements, expects Mr. da Silva to address seriously Brazil's grinding inequality. Mr. da Silva has promised to improve the lives of his countrymen, pledging that all Brazilians would receive three meals a day.
But the pursuit of his social agenda will be difficult in a country saddled with a huge foreign debt and international commitments to foreign lenders. It is a challenge both he and Mr. Gutierrez face: carrying out the far-reaching social programs they promised on the campaign trail last year while dealing with serious financial constraints in difficult economic times.
Mr. da Silva appears acutely aware of how important it is for him to provide successful guidance for Brazil, a country of 175 million that has one of the world's largest economies and is a budding power broker.
Mr. Gutierrez, 45, a former colonel and son of a riverboat captain, shares many of Mr. da Silva's qualities, according to international analysts who have met the new Ecuadorian leader. 
Though his background is dissimilar -- he helped lead a coup that toppled President Jamil Mahuad three years ago -- he is seen as a pragmatist who has already sharply shifted on earlier positions like scrapping the country's dollar currency and not paying the foreign debt. 
Mr. Chavez and Mr. Castro, leader of the hemisphere's only Communist country, have taken more defiant stances.
Mr. Chavez, 48, a former coup plotter, was elected to office in 1998 after promising to upend the old social order and to improve the lives of the poor. But his incendiary speeches have divided the country and alienated business leaders, labor groups and others who now seek to force him from office.
The Venezuelan leader has harshly criticized Washington's policy in the Americas, built a strong friendship with Mr. Castro and has promised a peaceful revolution to remake his country. While analysts do not view his policies as particularly radical, his government is seen as inept, with the country's economy suffering the consequences and slowly disintegrating over the last two years.
Mr. Castro, 76 and the leader of Cuba for 44 years, is clearly delighted about Latin America's shift to the left, though he is now more a symbol than a protagonist with influence.
Mr. Chavez may believe he has new close friends to help extricate him from the turmoil roiling his country. But Mr. da Silva and Mr. Gutierrez are expected to steer clear of forming strong alliances with the Cuban and Venezuelan leaders, though Mr. da Silva is strongly committed to finding a negotiated resolution to Venezuela's problems.
The Bush administration has, at least publicly, offered support for the new leaders, with the American ambassador in Brazil praising Mr. da Silva and the State Department wholeheartedly supporting the group of friends of Venezuela despite initial misgivings.
Michael Shifter, who has closely followed the political changes for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group, said the United States must now show flexibility to give the leaders "more room to maneuver and undertake new social and economic policies."
"The worst scenario would be if the United States begins to lump all of these leaders together, in other words sees Lula and Gutierrez the same way they see Chavez, and talks of an axis of evil," Mr. Shifter said. "Then the risk is it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."

U.N. Envoy Says North Korea Is Short of Food

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
With a United Nations envoy saying today that millions of people in North Korea were short of food, a Russian official arrived today in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, in search of a solution to the confrontation with the United States. 
 The United States has delayed food aid to North Korea, citing the lapses of monitoring and the absence of a budget appropriation by Congress. The United States is also engaged in a confrontation resulting from North Korea's admission last year that it had resumed its nuclear arms program in violation of a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration to freeze nuclear activity in exchange for foreign aid. 
 The United Nations envoy, Maurice Strong, returned to Beijing from Pyongyang today and said six million to eight million people were threatened by a short supply of food in North Korea, which has suffered from severe shortages in recent years. 
"Humanitarian aid, as President Bush himself has confirmed, is tied to the politics of this crisis," he said. The United States offered this week to revive a stalled initiative to give North Korea food and energy aid if it abandoned its pursuit of a nuclear arsenal. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov of Russia flew from Beijing to Pyongyang after talks with Chinese officials about how to proceed. "It is necessary to use strengths from all sides in order to help promote dialogue between the United States and North Korea," he said. 
Mr. Strong, a Canadian, said today that "you cannot make the children, the ill people, the old people victims of a political crisis which they have nothing to do with." 
He added, "There's no question that this assistance is a life or death matter for many people." 
Despite statements by the United States that it wants a diplomatic solution to the confrontation, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, was quoted by state news organizations today as praising his air force's defenses in the face of what he called moves toward war by the enemy. 
North Korea's ambassador to China, Choe Jin Su, interviewed today by Japan's Kyodo news agency in Beijing, said the diplomatic standoff could be solved through dialogue if the United States made a commitment not to invade North Korea. Kyodo quoted the ambassador as also saying that the United States should recognize North Korea's sovereignty and should not impede his country's economic development. 
James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, is to visit Japan on Sunday for talks about North Korea. The United States has been urging its allies in the region to present a united front, pressing the North to end its nuclear arms efforts. 
Asked whether Japan was putting enough pressure on North Korea, a senior American official there said, "I think both the United States and the Japanese fear this might be a long, drawn-out process, and we will need to retain some arrows in our quivers as we go forward." 
The confrontation began in October when Washington said North Korea had admitted to running a secret nuclear weapons program and escalated after the North expelled International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, pulled out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and threatened to resume missile tests. 
Three Australian envoys left North Korea today after a three-day visit. They declined comment once they arrived in Beijing. 
South Korea's defense minister, Lee Jun, said this week that the South was prepared for the "worst-case scenario" of war between North Korea and the United States, but the South Korean president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, later played down that concern. 
 On Saturday, Mr. Roh told a panel of university professors on Korean television that "at the time of the elections, some U.S. officials, who held considerable responsibility in the administration, talked about the possibility of attacking North Korea," The Associated Press reported. A White House spokeswoman denied on Saturday that the United States planned to attack the North. 
State news organizations in North Korea kept up a drumbeat of belligerent statements, accusing the United States of trickery. North Korea "is fully ready for both dialogue and confrontation," said the official Korean Central News Agency.
North Korea has said the crisis can be solved only through direct talks with the United States. President Bush said his administration was willing to talk, but would not be blackmailed.

HEADLINE: Embargo on Cuba 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Adam Cohen speaks glowingly of drinking mojitos at the Hotel Nacional in Havana ("Two Things Linger in Cuba: Fidel and a Pointless Embargo," Editorial Observer, Jan. 12). 
He doesn't mention that the average Cuban is barred from resort hotels, a practice known as "tourist apartheid." He also doesn't note that there is rampant racial discrimination in hiring in Cuba's tourist industry. 
 Poverty in Cuba is not, as he says, a result of the embargo. It is because of Fidel Castro's adherence to a failed Marxist economic model.
Freedom will come to Cuba through the efforts of the brave men and women who are standing up to the regime to demand their human rights, not as a byproduct of tourists drinking mojitos at the Nacional.

HEADLINE: The City I Once Loved 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lucky Christopher Hawthorne ("City for Rent," Op-Ed, Jan. 14) missed some of San Francisco's worst years -- the traffic nightmares, the parking headaches, the conspicuous consumption -- and got home just in time to land an affordable apartment. 
 But exorbitant rental costs weren't the only effect of the dot-com boom. The things I used to love about that city -- the diversity, the freaks, the passion -- were for the most part displaced by the economic expansion, and a dip in rents won't be enough to bring them back. Over the last two years, I've seen friend after friend leave the city, many of them longtime residents. Some want affordable housing; more want a home with more diversity and vibrancy than San Francisco now provides. 
 I hope that the city Mr. Hawthorne and his wife can now afford comes to resemble the city I once loved. But gaining a few cheaper flats for unemployed marketing vice presidents isn't going to do the trick.

Re "French Risking Prestige as Talks Open in Ivory Coast War" (news article, Jan. 16):
 The risks are far higher than a loss of prestige if the warring parties in Ivory Coast are not able to establish a definitive peace among themselves. 
Regrettably, it is only the French who have realized this. Has the international community learned nothing from the continued policies of benign neglect we have shown Africa in the last decade: Rwanda, Somalia, Congo? 
 The vastness of the human and economic suffering these conflicts have inflicted, and continue to inflict, might have been at least partly mitigated had a concerned sponsor risked some prestige early on. Bravo to France for taking a stand.

Some Text Messages Just Disappear, a Study Finds

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
It turns out that the question "Did you get my message?" may not be merely a polite way of saying "Did you read the message I sent you?" -- not, at least, when it comes to text messages sent between wireless phones.
 A study conducted the first two weeks of December found that 7.5 percent of the text messages sent from cellphones were not received within 120 seconds and that 5 percent were never received at all. 
 The messages at issue are known in the industry as S.M.S., for short message service, and are slowly growing in popularity in this country, especially among teenagers. The study was conducted by Keynote Systems, a San Mateo, Calif., company that tests the performance of Internet technologies and sells monitoring services to clients. During the two-week survey, Keynote sent 25,000 text messages between various carriers: AT&T Wireless, Cingular Wireless, Nextel Communications, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile. (Sprint PCS was not included because it uses a proprietary wireless messaging service.) 
Chuck Mount, general manager for wireless services at Keynote, said the financial implications of the survey findings were double-edged: in some cases, wireless carriers are losing revenue on messages that do not reach their destination, while in others customers are being charged for messages that are lost in the ether.
Prices for text messaging services vary, but wireless users are typically charged for both outgoing and incoming messages, and whether a fee is assessed depends on where along the network a message is lost.
The survey results also raise questions about the reliability of these services, particularly since users often do not know whether their messages arrived at their destination. "The network usually comes back with a message that tells you it was sent, but that doesn't guarantee it was received or track the message in any way," Mr. Mount said. "You don't necessarily get an error message saying, 'We can't deliver your message.' "
Howard Waterman, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless, pointed out that the Keynote study was based on tests in three cities -- New York, Dallas and Seattle -- and said, "I'm not sure how scientifically or statistically significant the results are."
Danielle Perry, a spokeswoman for AT&T Wireless, said that the Keynote study "only reiterates what we already know about how our network is performing."
"We monitor our network and we know our performance issues," Ms. Perry said, adding that although the percentage of lost messages was relatively small, "obviously, all carriers have a little bit of room to make improvements." SUSAN STELLIN

HEADLINE: Some Best-Seller Old Reliables Have String of Unreliable Sales 

BYLINE:  By BILL GOLDSTEIN 

 BODY:
Some of America's most popular authors are finding that being big isn't what it used to be.
 Tom Clancy, Stephen King, Mary Higgins Clark and Sue Grafton, usually among the most bankable of best-selling writers, sold far fewer copies of their books than expected this past year. The disappointing sales numbers, possibly the result of too many books from the same authors or the book-buying public's changing tastes, contributed to a dismal holiday season for book retailers, particularly chain stores like Barnes & Noble and Borders. 
 Not all star authors suffered drop-offs in their sales numbers: Michael Crichton, James Patterson, Nora Roberts and Janet Evanovich continued their predictable and profitable ways. But the decline of such stalwarts as Mr. Clancy and Ms. Clark could presage a trend that would play havoc with publishers' bottom lines, and even the advances handed out to big-name authors. 
The commercial necessity of publishing a lucrative roster of brand-name novelists, who can be counted on to write a book a year, was underscored last week by the ouster of Ann Godoff as president of the Random House Trade Group and the merger of the imprint with Ballantine Books.
The trade group had more adult hardcover best sellers in 2002, including books by Tom Brokaw, Anna Quindlen and Maya Angelou, than any other Random House division. But its recent lists have lacked the prolific best-selling novelists that are vital to the book divisions of large media conglomerates like Bertelsmann, which owns Random House, AOL Time Warner and Viacom, which owns Simon & Schuster. Random House no longer has a James Michener or Robert Ludlum to pour cash into its coffers consistently and help smooth out the inevitable peaks and valleys of publishing new authors.
Ballantine, primarily a paperback imprint, publishes crime novelists like Jonathan Kellerman and Richard North Patterson in hardcover. 
"Brand-name authors still dominate the best-seller lists. They are still the bread and butter of the industry," said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chief executive of the AOL Time Warner Book Group, the publisher of James Patterson. But a change is afoot, he said. "There is no longer a quintessential best seller. The market is diluted to some extent by the incredible number of brand-name authors out at the same time."
And some retailers and publishing industry executives blame publishers for giving readers too much of the same thing by individual authors. Mr. King released two horror books in 2002, and Ms. Clark, the suspense novelist, published three.
While sales of Mr. King's first book of 2002, "Everything's Eventual," a story collection, nearly matched those of his 2001 novel, "Dreamcatcher," his second book, the novel "From a Buick 8," fell short. "From a Buick 8" has sold 367,000 copies, about a 20 percent decline, according to Nielsen Bookscan, which gathers sales data from outlets that represent about 70 percent of total sales.
Ms. Clark's June 2002 novel, "Mount Vernon Love Story," has sold 108,000 copies, far fewer than the 427,000 copies that sold after her "Daddy's Little Girl" went on the shelves in April, according to Nielsen Bookscan. (Her other book in 2002, a memoir, sold about 60,000 copies.)
Executives at the companies that publish Mr. Clancy, Mr. King, Ms. Grafton and Ms. Clark acknowledge their weaker sales in 2002, but contend that the sales drops are the consequence of a weak retail economy that has hit booksellers especially hard. During the nine-week holiday season ending Jan. 4, sales at Barnes & Noble stores open at least a year were down 3 percent from the previous year. And Borders's fourth-quarter comparable-store sales at its superstores were down 2.5 percent, while sales at Waldenbooks were off 6.3 percent. 
Susan Petersen Kennedy, the president of the Penguin Group (USA), confirmed that Mr. Clancy's "Red Rabbit," a spy thriller published under its Putnam imprint, had not sold as well as expected. But, she said, it still reached No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list. "Tom's audience is still out there," she said. "If blue jeans are down for a month, does that mean Americans aren't going to keep buying blue jeans?" 
"It's been a year of different buying patterns," Ms. Kennedy said. "They're not the patterns we predicted." She pointed to the Penguin Group's success with new books by Jan Karon, Maeve Binchy, Nora Roberts and Patricia Cornwell.
Some retailers speculate that younger readers are turning elsewhere for commercial fiction. "We're all old enough to know these writers who've been writing a long time," said Daniel Goldin, a trade buyer at Harry Schwartz Booksellers in Milwaukee. "When I first started in publishing, people like Arthur Hailey were still selling. And then they stopped." 
One retailing executive insisted that the downturn was not because of the economy. "Too many authors are cranking out at least a book a year," the executive said. "Readers can't keep up. It's the bottom-line pressure to be on schedule, to deliver at least a book a year. You have 10 percent of people saying, I can wait for the paperback or wait until I hear more about it. And then they may not buy." 
But the definition of overproduction is relative. Hardcover sales for James Patterson are up, though he published three novels, including collaborations, in 2002. Warner expects to sell more than a million hardcover copies of his latest thriller, "Four Blind Mice," released in November, an 8 to 10 percent increase over his previous book's sales, according to Mr. Kirshbaum. Warner will sell more than seven million copies of Mr. Patterson's books in hardcover and paperback this year, up from about two million copies five years ago. 
"There's no question we're seeing a softness at retail, which is impacting sales on the brand-name authors," said Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Simon & Schuster, the publisher of Ms. Clark and, under its Scribner imprint, Mr. King. "But we won't really know how well these books have done until they're published in paperback a year from now. We won't make up the hardcover dollars, but ultimately readers will come to them." 
While sales have slipped for Mr. Clancy and Mr. King, the authors are not in danger of going the way of Irving Wallace and Arthur Hailey just yet. Sales of their earlier books in paperback have remained remarkably consistent, even as their latest hardcover sales dip. Mr. King's "Carrie," for example, his first novel, originally published in 1974, sold about 23,000 copies in both 2001 and 2002, according to Nielsen Bookscan.
Paperback sales for previous titles by Ms. Clark and Ms. Grafton have stayed similarly consistent. "As each of these authors has a new novel, they may dilute" their own hardcover sales, Mr. Kirshbaum said. "But when you take all their books together, they may actually be growing." Ms. Grafton, he said, may be selling less of her latest mystery, "Q is for Quarry," in hardcover, "but she's still selling A through P."
Nonetheless, the steep sales decline could have a long-term impact on future author advances. "I am more nervous about paying large sums," Ms. Kennedy said, because "a sense of solid trending" is more difficult to achieve today than several years ago. 
Mr. Kirshbaum said: "Publishers will be more careful when courting major authors. There will be some tempering of advances going forward. There are limits to what can be sold, and if agents realize there has to be some reality in terms of advances, that would be valuable. It's a nice thought."

HEADLINE: Sega Chooses A New Chief At Its U.S. Unit 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The Sega Corporation, maker of "Sonic the Hedgehog" video games, has chosen Tetsu Kayama, a top officer at the Tokyo-based company, to become head of its American business, succeeding Peter Moore, who quit after four years.
 Mr. Moore, the president and chief operating officer of Sega of America Inc., resigned to take a job with another company, Jennifer Simonsen, a United States spokeswoman for Sega, said on Friday. 
 Mr. Kayama, chief operating officer of the parent company since 2001, became president and chief executive of the United States business, effective immediately.
Mr. Kayama was among the employees who developed Sega's plan to stop making the money-losing Dreamcast video-game console last March to focus on making software for other companies' machines. Sega develops, publishes and distributes game software to be played on personal computers, wireless devices and game consoles made by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.
The United States video-game industry has become increasingly hit-driven as hundreds of games compete for shelf space and the attention of consumers, analysts say, hurting companies that fail to generate top-selling games. Electronic Arts Inc. sold eight times as many copies of "Madden NFL 2003" in August than the rival game released by Sega the same day.
Sega has not had a game among the best sellers in the United States since the first quarter of 2002, according to data from NPD Group Inc., which tracks video games. Its rivals Activision Inc. and THQ Inc. have both scaled back their results forecasts after some games released for the holidays failed to attract buyers.
Sega is expected to post its first annual profit in six years for the year ending in March, aided by increased sales of its arcade games. Sega has estimated that it will reap about 14 percent of its total sales from the United States in the year ending in March.

HEADLINE: In a Slow Start, Ford Opens an Auto Factory in China 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: CHONGQING, China, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company officially opened its first car factory in China today, striving to catch up in what has become the world's fastest-growing market for automobiles.
 Ford, which already builds full-size Transit vans in China, has begun assembling here its Fiesta compact sedan, a model that is popular in Europe and slightly smaller than the Ford Focus sold in the United States. David W. Thursfield, Ford's executive vice president for international operations, said that the Chinese auto market was likely to overtake Germany's in size and perhaps even Japan's in the next three to five years. 
 "It could be No. 2 or No. 3 in the world in the not too distant future -- as the No. 2 manufacturer in the world, we can't afford to overlook that," he said. 
But Ford lags far behind the leader in China, Volkswagen, with 41 percent of the market, and behind Ford's American rival, General Motors, which has 10 percent of the market here. Volkswagen, G.M., Toyota, Nissan and Honda are all working on their second, third or even fourth assembly plants in China as Ford opens its first.
The Ford factory here is small. In an industry where a factory can often produce 250,000 cars a year, the Ford operation will be able to turn out 50,000 cars next year, although the site has room to expand to 150,000 to 170,000 cars a year, Mr. Thursfield said.
Ford plans to open 26 dealerships by June scattered across 18 cities, each with the population of San Francisco or larger. Mr. Thursfield strongly hinted that once production of the Fiesta was under way, Ford would begin making the slightly larger Mondeo sedan as well, a model that Ford imports for the Chinese market.
Graeme Maxton, the managing director of Autopolis Asia, a consulting firm in Singapore, said that it would be hard for Ford to establish its brand when it was spread so thinly in a country of 1.3 billion people and a market of more than 3 million cars and trucks annually.
"They're late in the market, and they've got unambitious targets," Mr. Maxton said, "although those might prove sensible in the long run because China is a difficult market to understand."
Managers working on the Fiesta's introduction are more optimistic. "It is not hard to come in late in China when the market is not well developed," said Tom Doctoroff, the area director for Northeast Asia at J. Walter Thompson, which is developing an advertising campaign for the Fiesta.
Priced from $10,725 to $15,435, depending on the engine and transmission, the Fiesta is being marketed here to people 25 to 35 years old who have benefited from the growth that has accompanied China's transition to a market economy. The ad slogan is, "Let's go to the party," using Chinese characters for the first words followed by the English word for "party," a word that is widely understood here to mean a social gathering and has nothing to do with the Communist Party.
In a country where government population policies still discourage families from having more than one child, Ford has chosen to offer only a sedan and not a hatchback or wagon that might have more room. "There's no such thing as a soccer mom here," Mr. Doctoroff said.
The Fiesta cars are actually being assembled here by Changan Ford, a venture that is 50 percent owned by Ford, 24 percent owned by the state-owned Changan Group and 26 percent owned by Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, a publicly traded subsidiary of the Changan Group.
Located 700 miles west of Hong Kong along a bend of the Yangtze River, Chongqing claims a population of 30 million people since it annexed several nearby villages and cities. Having failed in the 1990's to reach agreememt on ventures with China's Big Three automakers, which are on the coast in Shanghai and Changchun, Ford negotiated a deal here two years ago with the smaller Changan Group, China's fourth-largest automaker.
The Chinese government has been encouraging investment in its impoverished western provinces, making it easier for multinationals to win approval for joint ventures in cities like this one. Assembling cars in China's interior is complex, however, because many of the parts are either imported or are manufactured in coastal cities and must be brought up the Yangtze by barge.
In a ceremony before Ford executives and Chinese dignitaries, Changan Ford employees drove off the end of the assembly line today what was described as the first car to be produced here. But Ford executives said that, as is commonly the case with official factory openings in the auto industry, 100 test cars had already been made in the last several months and that more were scheduled to be built before mass production starts in March.

HEADLINE: Job-Rich Silicon Valley Has Turned Fallow, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley lost 127,000 jobs, or about 9 percent of its employment, from the first quarter of 2001 to the second quarter of 2002, according to a report to be published Monday by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit group formed to promote the area.
 Job losses in the period equaled more than half the total job gains for the valley from 1998 to 2000. Losses were particularly acute among those industries the survey defined as "driving" clusters -- software, semiconductors and computer and communications hardware -- which lost 22 percent of their jobs from the second quarter of 2001 to the second quarter of 2002. 
 At the same time, average pay in Silicon Valley declined 6 percent, to $62,500 a year, after accounting for inflation. This was the second year of decline from the peak of $79,800 in 2000. The Silicon Valley average remains above the 1998 level, and is still sharply higher than the nation's average pay of $38,400. 
"The bottom line is, clearly we've been through a boom-bust cycle, and you can see that in all the trend data," said Doug Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a research company in Mountain View, Calif., which conducted the study. "There has been one number driving the Valley, and that was business investment in information technology, and until businesses start buying I. T. again, you won't see that turn around."
But beyond this business cycle, Silicon Valley faces long-term issues that are more profound, Mr. Henton said. Through the 1990's, the Valley saw a major shift from hardware to software production.
"That's a natural shift, but it has a couple of interesting impacts," Mr. Henton said. "The average-size software company is 20 people; the average hardware company is 200. So you're talking about a lot of little companies. What will be the future of these software companies as they compete globally?"
Silicon Valley has endured major slumps before, and in each case has embraced a new innovation that stimulated a fresh growth cycle. As military spending slowed in the early 1970's, the semiconductor industry took off; as Japanese competition threatened chip makers in the 1980's, the industry shifted to microprocessors and personal computers; as the PC became a commodity in the 1990's, the Internet provided new growth.
Mr. Henton said it was not clear what the next source of economic growth would be, although he suspects it will be the biomedical industry, by combining software with biotechnology and advanced instruments to improve health care. Silicon Valley already has the highest concentration of biomedical companies in the United States, with 37,000 people employed.
But the next big innovation could as easily be something entirely different, and it could as easily come from Finland or Singapore as from Sunnyvale.
"The region faces a really different global competitive environment than it has historically," said AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor of regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley. "In the 80's, there was tremendous concern about Japanese competition driving down memory chip prices. Now there's competition and new centers of innovation emerging in many different places. Silicon Valley doesn't really monopolize high-tech innovation in the way it did earlier."
One striking finding of the study was the rapid shift in Silicon Valley's demographics and its increasing ethnic diversity.
In 1970, 83 percent of the valley's residents were white. Today, 45 percent are white and non-Hispanic; 26 percent are Asian or Pacific Islanders; 21 percent are Hispanic; and 3 percent are black. Among residents under 18 years old, whites account for just one-third, roughly equal to the total of Hispanics and Asians.
"What's interesting is Silicon Valley has attracted immigrants from both ends of the economic spectrum; not only wealthy Asians, but Asians and Latinos at the lower end, who come for service jobs," said Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
"Behind every software engineer is a nanny or a food-service worker," he said. "There's a tremendous amount of economic energy there. The question is, how do you harness it. That's a challenge for the valley."

HEADLINE: 30 Years After Abortion Ruling, New Trends but the Old Debate 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
J'Vante Anderson is 16, the age her mother was when she had her first child. Growing up in one of Atlanta's poorest neighborhoods, she has seen the cycle: teenage girl has baby, drops out of school, goes on welfare and raises a child who in turn becomes a teenage mother.
 "I want to break that cycle," she said, her turtleneck perfectly coordinated with her pink velvet jeans. "I have a life, and I do plan on living it." She does not believe in abortion, so she is choosing abstinence. 
 Newly 22 and newly married, Allison C. has just had her second abortion in a year, at a clinic near Tacoma, Wash. She does not think of herself as "one of those people" who use abortion as birth control. "But if it is, who cares?" she said. 
Thirty years after Roe v. Wade, the rate of abortions has come almost full circle, declining to its lowest level since 1974.
The decline is largely because of a steady decrease among teenagers like J'Vante, who are avoiding pregnancy through birth control or abstinence. Increasingly, the common denominator for women having abortions is poverty. And, like Allison, they are using birth control unevenly at best.
Abortion is taken so much for granted in America today that most women surveyed by a group of clinics in Washington State did not know that it had ever been illegal. The rate of repeat abortions has risen slowly, so that nearly half the women who terminated pregnancies in 2000 had done so at least once before.
Yet abortion today is neither "abortion on demand," as opponents call it, nor as inaccessible as some supporters of abortion rights insist. Both sides in the debate often say that if the Supreme Court overturned Roe, the 1973 ruling that established a woman's right to end her pregnancy, abortion would be shaped by a patchwork of state laws. But in fact, that has already happened. 
Now, as before Roe, a woman's access to abortion depends on an ever-shifting equation of geography, money, politics and personal sympathies. Women in Texas raise money from concerts and yard sales to help poor women in Kansas and North Carolina pay for abortions. Mothers from Mississippi, where two parents must consent before a girl under 18 can get an abortion, take their daughters to Alabama, where only one parent must agree. Doctors, too, work around hurdles, ad-libbing a defense of abortion rights into the scripts that many states require them to read to any woman seeking to end a pregnancy.
Meanwhile, public opinion is as fractured as ever. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that about 40 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal, 20 percent say it should not, and another 40 percent say it should be legal with stricter limits. Those numbers have barely budged in polls since 1989.
With Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, advocates on both sides of the debate are expecting an intense round of new anti-abortion legislation at the state and federal levels. In particular, abortion opponents want to press for a ban on what they call partial-birth abortion and for a law making it a crime to cross state lines to avoid parental notification requirements.
Both sides also see the anniversary of Roe v. Wade on Wednesday as a symbolic moment to press their arguments, and neither is interested in softening its position.
"If you look at public opinion, most people want abortion to be legal, and they would like some restrictions," said Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice. "The court and public opinion are in sync with each other, and those of us who are advocates on either side of the question don't like the compromise. For our side, it's that it will be regulated; for them, the compromise is that it's legal."

A Ruling, a Rise, Then a Drop
The Supreme Court announced its decision in Roe v. Wade on Jan. 22, 1973, ruling 7-2 that a Texas statute banning abortion except when a woman's life was in danger violated a constitutional right to privacy. 
In the decades before, a woman who wanted an abortion had to leave the country or choose an underground, often dangerous one.
Some women, particularly the rich, found doctors who relied on sympathetic psychiatrists to declare to a hospital committee that the woman would kill herself if forced to give birth. By 1970, stories of poor women dying from self-induced abortions had persuaded several states, including New York and Washington, to legalize abortion. 
In the years immediately after Roe, the abortion rate rose sharply, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which is considered by anti-abortion and abortion rights groups to be the most accurate source. It peaked at 29.3 per 1,000 women between 15 and 44 in 1981, began a big drop in 1992, and now stands at 21.3. 
Both sides take credit for the drop.
"At one time, we were aborting one of every three pregnancies in this country," said David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, the largest of the anti-abortion groups. "Whatever side you're on politically, if you step back and consider this, that the richest people that have ever lived on the face of this earth have somehow engaged in killing one of every three of their own offspring, you have to think something is bad, bad wrong there. Now we're at one out of every four. That's not a good thing, but this is much better."
Gloria Feldt, the president of Planned Parenthood, pushes abortion's opponents to do more: "If they really wanted to reduce the number of abortions, they would work with us to make sure everyone has real access to family planning and real sex education. It is about more than abortion. It really comes down to whether women will have an equal place at life's table, whether we value children enough that we want them to be planned and wanted and cared for."

The Teenage Perspective
No group has seen a bigger drop in abortions in recent years than teenagers. The rate among women ages 15 to 19 dropped 20 percent from 1987 to 1994, and another 27 percent from 1994 to 2000, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
It is not that more young women are keeping their babies, but that fewer are getting pregnant. The pregnancy rate in this country is still far higher than in most -- data for the city of Hartford, for example, show that for the last several years more teenagers have given birth than have graduated from high school. But teenage pregnancies have fallen since peaking in 1990.
Opponents debate whether this is the result of more abstinence or better birth control. Those who work with teenagers say the answer is both, as does most research.
In surveys of high schoolers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage saying they had ever had sex declined to 46 percent in 2001 from 54 percent in 1991.
But teenage girls -- and boys -- are also becoming savvier about contraception. In Atlanta, a group of girls gathered after school at a community center casually talk about how everyone has "the shot." 
"Nobody takes pills anymore," said Latonja Swint 17.
The shot is Depo-Provera, a three-month contraceptive that doctors say has been effective among teenage girls, who tend to be fickle about taking birth control pills. Yet the teenage pregnancy rate began to fall before Depo was introduced, and more closely matched a rise in condom use -- and fear of AIDS.

A Matter of Money
Most of the women who got the 1.31 million abortions in this country in 2000 were in their 20's and never married. Most of them had given birth at least once, described themselves as Protestant or Catholic, and lived in cities. They were disproportionately black or Hispanic.
And more and more, the women getting legal abortions are the very poor -- a mirror image of the picture before Roe.
After years of heading down, abortion rates for poor women rose sharply between 1994 and 2000, according to Guttmacher numbers. The rate for women below the federal poverty level -- $8,350 for a single woman and $14,150 for a family of three in 2000 -- rose 25 percent. The rate for women earning up to twice that went up 23 percent. Meanwhile, the rate among the most well-off of those surveyed fell 39 percent.
An abortion comes relatively cheap -- $372 on average, the Guttmacher Institute found, about half what it did, adjusted for inflation, in 1973. But across the country, a network of nearly 100 private funds set up to help poor women pay for abortions says it is hearing from more women who cannot pay even that.
About 608,000 of the women who had abortions in 2000 had not used contraception, according to estimates from the Guttmacher survey. Another 610,000 used contraception but not correctly. Just 95,000 had been using birth control properly.
In 2001, officials in Washington State began offering a year of free birth control to any woman or man earning up to twice the poverty level. Officials say it is too early to say whether the program has reduced the abortion rate, but with 76,000 people enrolled so far -- almost the number of births a year in the state -- they are confident it will.
RU-486, which induces abortion, was supposed to be the miracle drug. It accounted for 37,000 abortions nationwide in the first six months of 2001, although it was approved only in September 2000. But some clinic workers say they have spotted a worrisome trend: women having repeat abortions with the drug.

The Battle Over Access
The Army of God, a militant anti-abortion group, will mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade by celebrating a killing: that of Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider in Buffalo, in 1998. The group's Web site encourages supporters to attend a march outside Dr. Slepian's former clinic to support the man accused of killing him, James Kopp.
Yet Operation Rescue, once feared as the Army of God's angry twin, besieging abortion clinics in the 1980's and early 1990's, is now bankrupt and defunct. And over all, clinic violence is down from the rash of clinic shootings in the 1990's.
Now, the most frequent reports of harassment are about picketers, and their numbers have thinned, often to just one or two people standing shouting distance away and offering pamphlets. Clinic workers talk about dealing with them the way they might a batty aunt at Thanksgiving: smile, acknowledge, ignore.
Abortion rights advocates and opponents both say the access battle is increasingly in state legislatures.
Nationwide, restrictions on abortion started as early as 1976, when Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibited Medicaid from paying for the procedure except in rare cases. It seems to have worked: the abortion rate is far higher in the 17 states that pay for abortions for women on Medicaid.
The biggest shift came after the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that states could impose restrictions but not a "substantial obstacle."
States rushed in. Thirty-two now require girls under 18 to get a parent's consent, or to tell their parents, before an abortion; two require consent of both birth parents, though all allow girls to seek a waiver from a judge.
Eighteen states require a waiting period, generally 24 hours, between mandatory counseling and an abortion. Seven more require that women get the counseling, in which a doctor reads a script detailing the risks of abortion and the alternative of adoption, and also require that women be given a pamphlet showing pictures of a fetus at two-week intervals. 
Four states allow private insurers to pay for abortions only if the woman pays an additional premium. Almost all say that only a physician can perform the procedure. 
Many restrictions are more political than practical: the so-called partial-birth abortion ban that has been pushed in Congress, for example, would have meant 2,200 fewer abortions in 2000 -- or 0.17 percent. The Louisiana Legislature, meanwhile, has passed a ban on all abortions except to save a woman's life. It would take effect the moment the Supreme Court overturned Roe.
So, as in the pre-Roe days, women and doctors work around the restrictions. Many restrictions send women across state lines for abortions, or money: one abortion fund in Seattle sends 20 percent of its money to women in Idaho, which restricts private insurance for abortions. It helps fly women to Seattle from Alaska, where clinics are rare. The Planned Parenthood clinic in Appleton, Wis., flies in a doctor from Oregon. 
Abortion opponents say the restrictions have worked in reducing the number of abortions. Those on the other side say that as in the days before Roe, women who want abortions will get them somehow.

HEADLINE: Buying on Credit Is the Latest Rage in Russia 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
New advertisements are appearing on Moscow's streets and subways. Comic-book-style stories portray the new quandaries of the Russian middle class.
 "If we buy the car, we can't afford to remodel the apartment," says a woman with a knitted brow, in one ad. Then comes the happy ending. Her husband replies, smiling: "We can do both! If we don't have enough, we'll take a loan!" 
 In a country that has yet to discover the personal check, where people still pay for apartments and cars with suitcases of cash, Russian consumers are beginning to borrow. This is a new step for Russia's economy, which until now had neither credit cards nor mortgages, and required life's largest purchases to be paid for up front. 
For years it was banks, companies and the Russian government that binged on borrowing, careering from one default to the next. But now the government has its financial house in order, and average Russians are beginning to enjoy a basic aspect of a capitalist system. "Consumer credit is about to explode," said Greg Thain, chairman of a Moscow marketing firm called Integrated Marketing Service, which recently conducted a study of 5,000 Russian families' budgets.
Economists offer a range of explanations. As Russia comes out of its fourth year of economic growth, its banking system is beginning to recover from a financial collapse in 1998. After sobering up from the wild currency and bond speculation during the 1990's, banks are regaining the trust of depositors, and are getting down to the more mundane business of lending to consumers.
At the same time, wages are on the rise, and the economy is flush with rubles, partly the effect of an oil boom. Wages are now increasingly paid above the table. Tax changes have drawn more incomes out of the shadows, leaving people more willing to disclose personal details about their financial abilities.
Interest rates, which can range from 15 percent for 10-year mortgages to double that for cars and appliances, would be considered usurious in the United States. But they are attractive in Russia, where the novelty of buying on credit is still so exciting to consumers that most don't even consider how much they are really paying over time when interest is factored into the total.
"The primary driver is increasingly legal incomes," said Aleksei Zabotkine, head economist at United Financial Group, an investment bank in Moscow. "Banks have excess cash and are willing to take on the risky business of lending to the public, and the public is willing to give information."
But eager-to-lend banks do not ask many questions. Nina A. Andreyeva, 41, a manicurist in a fur coat and hat, was filling out her second loan application in a giant home appliance store in northern Moscow on Saturday to help pay for a washing machine and television. She checked boxes indicating her line of work (health worker) and the location of her apartment (on the edge of town). After breezing through the application, she needed only to present her identification card -- no proof of employment or verification of income.
"It's very convenient," she said, pen in hand. "We can start using these things right away, and it's not so hard on our budget."
The borrowing is happening in purchases of home appliances, apartments, cars -- even clothes. Mr. Thain said mortgages ranked first in total amount of loans, followed by home appliances and cars. The borrowing, so far, is mostly to consumers in the Moscow area, and has yet to spread to poorer provinces.
While the figures are minuscule compared with developed economies like the United States, they are growing. Russian Standard Bank, one of the largest lenders in the car and home appliance sectors, nearly tripled its client base last year from the previous year, with 550,000 loans at the end of December. The figure was up 63-fold from 1999, the bank's first year in operation. As of November, ruble-denominated loans to consumers in Russia totaled $3.7 billion. 
"They told us it was a stupid idea and that we would be put out of business," said Dmitri V. Rudenko, deputy chairman of the bank in his office in northern Moscow. "But we thought, if it worked in Brazil and India, why not in Russia?"
The bank's customers are primarily what Mr. Rudenko described as blue collar. They earn about $250 a month. Few own cars. Still fewer have ever used a credit card. Even so, the default rate is low, 3.5 percent, he said, adding that for many Russians, repaying is a point of pride. 
There are, of course, hustles. In one case, a group of vagrant men with passports went individually to each store that offered appliances on credit. They approached bank salesmen, who are based in the stores, asking for loans. Several bank employees noticed the men had traveled together in the same expensive, foreign-made car, and concluded they were being paid by a con artist.
The hustlers "didn't understand the credits all came from the same place -- from us," said Dmitri V. Pilnikov, a Russian Standard manager, based at M-Video, the store where Ms. Andreyeva bought her television. 
Jaded by a decade of pyramid schemes, Russians were initially wary of the loan offers. Mr. Pilnikov said he struggled at first to get people to take leaflets. Early attempts at advertising were relatively ineffective. Attitudes changed when a relative or neighbor tried it out and liked it.
"When we started, people looked at us like we were robbers," said Mr. Pilnikov. "They were very aggressive. But then their neighbors told them it wasn't a rip-off scheme. Now the thinking has turned around."
Loans are of shorter duration than they are in more developed economies. Russian Standard, for example, charges an annual rate of 29 percent for a standard consumer loan, and says its average span for a loan is between six months and a year. But most borrowers are concerned solely with the size of the monthly payments, and stores have responded. At M-Video, red tags highlight down payments and urge shoppers to buy on credit.
And demand has soared. Mr. Pilnikov said the store had to hire extra security guards to help regulate the rowdy line of loan seekers that, ahead of the Christmas holidays, stretched from his office almost 40 feet to the doors of the store entrance. An age requirement -- applicants must be 23 to 65 years old -- has forced him to turn away many of the bank's most eager customers: Russian grandmothers.
"They show me their medals of honor as hero workers from World War II," he said, shaking his head. "They say they have good pensions."
Mr. Zabotkine expects that the credit binge will end in crisis. Russians have no experience in the culture of borrowing, and in the current euphoria, few seem to be imagining the consequences of default. A still weak legal system means banks will have difficulties pursuing deadbeats in court. Dasha Malinova, 20, said she and her husband applied for a loan just to see what it was all about.
"It's cool," said Ms. Malinova, flipping her fur-trimmed wrist. "Everyone is taking them."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WEAPONS MONITORING; 
Russia Helped U.S. On Nuclear Spying Inside North Korea

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Russian intelligence officers secretly placed sophisticated nuclear detection equipment inside North Korea at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1990's, to assist the United States in tracking the North Korean nuclear weapons program, intelligence officials say. 
 The Russians placed nuclear monitors provided by the C.I.A. inside the Russian Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to try to detect telltale signs of activity from the North Korean nuclear weapons program. The C.I.A. trained officers from the S.V.R., the Russian intelligence agency, in the operation of the American equipment, and the Russians then shared their findings with the Americans. 
 The joint operation has since ended, and it is unclear how long it lasted or whether it provided useful intelligence on the state of the North Korean nuclear weapons program. Nor would officials say whether the Russians placed detection equipment in other locations in North Korea besides their embassy in Pyongyang. 
But the disclosure of the clandestine operation against the North Koreans reveals a remarkable level of intelligence cooperation between Moscow and Washington on one of the most important security issues in the post-cold-war era -- the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The decision by the C.I.A. to turn to the Russians for help also demonstrates how the United States has been forced to rely on assistance from other nations to collect information from inside North Korea, one of the most closed societies in the world.
Current and former American officials say the fact that the United States does not have an embassy in North Korea has made it difficult for C.I.A. officers to obtain direct access to the country. Overseas C.I.A. stations are usually inside American embassies, and undercover C.I.A. officers typically have diplomatic immunity and pose as employees of the State Department or other government agencies. As a result, the agency faces major hurdles in gathering intelligence in countries where the United States does not have permanent diplomatic representation. 
"It is a very tough country to get data from," said one person familiar with American intelligence operations concerning North Korea. "We have tried every which way we can to get information." 
The C.I.A. turned to its former adversaries in Russian intelligence for assistance to take advantage of Moscow's longstanding relationship with the North Korean government. The Soviet Union supported North Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950's and throughout the remainder of the cold war, until the Soviet collapse in 1991. North Korean nuclear scientists are believed to have received training in the Soviet Union. More recently, Russia has tried once again to improve its ties to North Korea, at least in part to enhance its economic links to South Korea and the larger Pacific marketplace. 
Russia has also been trying to play an important diplomatic role in the current standoff between North Korea and the United States over the North's nuclear weapons program, which is no longer controlled by an agreement that suspended nuclear work, provided aid to North Korea and allowed international inspections. Over the weekend, in fact, a top Russian diplomat met with North Korean officials to propose a new plan to resolve the crisis.
The secret agreement between the C.I.A. and Russian intelligence came sometime in the early 1990's, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and at about the same time that the North Korean nuclear weapons program first emerged as a major international issue. 
The joint operation represented a major test of efforts by the C.I.A. and S.V.R. to forge a new relationship in the post-cold-war period. Even though the C.I.A. had asked for the help, it did not completely trust the Russians to tell the truth about what the nuclear monitoring equipment detected, although there was apparently no evidence that the data received from the Russians had been altered or tampered with. 
As the clandestine American-Russian operation was getting under way, the North Korean nuclear program was quickly becoming one of Washington's biggest post-cold-war concerns. North Korea had pledged not to develop nuclear weapons and had agreed to monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but by the early 1990's, there was growing evidence that North Korea was secretly flouting its agreements. As signs of North Korea's determination to build nuclear weapons mounted, the Clinton administration intervened, and hammered out a new agreement in 1994 aimed at freezing the North Korean nuclear program, particularly plutonium reprocessing at a facility in Yongbyon. Despite the agreement, American intelligence concluded that North Korea had generated enough fissile material to produce one or two nuclear bombs. 
The latest crisis over the North Korean nuclear program erupted last year, when United States intelligence obtained strong evidence that North Korea had secretly developed a uranium enrichment program, which would represent a second track toward the development and production of nuclear weapons. American officials said there was fragmentary evidence of a uranium enrichment effort as far back as the late 1990's, but much more compelling evidence of such a program came last year, officials said. Now American officials fear that North Korea may be poised to break out with full-scale nuclear weapons production. 
Plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment are the two routes to making fuel for nuclear bombs, and experts say detecting the different nuclear fuel production methods calls for different types of intelligence collection. American officials say North Korea has become adept at deception tactics to mask its weapons program, but there are certain signs intelligence experts look for. 
Traditionally, uranium enrichment facilities have required large amounts of electricity and water, making it possible to identify them by spy satellite photographs of power grids and other industrial infrastructure. 
Plutonium reprocessing, on the other hand, is a chemical process requiring less power and water, and so such plants can be situated in more remote locations, like Yongbyon, which is about 60 miles north of Pyongyang. 
But plutonium reprocessing gives off distinctive emissions that can be tracked and measured, even in very small amounts. Experts familiar with the joint operation between the C.I.A. and Russian intelligence said plutonium reprocessing emits an isotope of krypton in gaseous form that is relatively easy to detect. The Russians were apparently given American sensing equipment to help analysts determine whether reprocessing was under way at Yongbyon, which after 1994 would have been a violation of the agreement reached under the Clinton administration, known as the Agreed Framework. The equipment could also help the C.I.A. determine whether plutonium reprocessing had secretly been moved to another site in North Korea.
"Krypton is a very good technical indicator that is hard to hide," said one person familiar with the intelligence efforts. "If you are able to situate the sniffers in the right places, then you could have confidence that you can find out whether plutonium reprocessing is going on or not." 
In addition to the detection equipment the C.I.A. gave to Russian intelligence, the United States could use sensors on aircraft flying near North Korea, as well as ground-based sensors in nearby countries.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Faults City Dealings On Pension 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service has found that New York City violated federal tax laws by withdrawing $177 million over seven years from municipal pension systems and using it to pay its own operating expenses, according to a tentative settlement agreement reached this month between the city and the I.R.S.
 The affected unions approved the withdrawals starting in 1988 in exchange for additional benefits for retired police officers, firefighters and other city workers. Nonetheless, the I.R.S. concluded that the transfers of money had violated the federal tax code, which says pension funds must be operated solely for the benefit of participants. 
 Any withdrawal of funds, other than to pay pensions or the pension system's operating expenses, is illegal and can cause a pension plan to lose its tax exemption or subject it to significant penalties.
But the I.R.S., citing the city's financial crisis since 9/11, has waived all sanctions against the city. The city also will not have to repay to the fund the $177 million that the I.R.S. contends it improperly received. Instead, past pension contributions that the city routinely made into the funds over the past decade to ensure they were fully funded will be credited as repayments of the $177 million, city officials said. 
Several pension experts criticized the I.R.S.'s treatment of the city, saying it would undermine the agency's efforts to display consistent, evenhanded enforcement toward those who violate federal pension laws.
"This is an extremely serious matter," said Harvey Katz, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in pension law. "Because it is the City of New York, they got a sweetheart deal. A private party would have been required to pay back the money immediately with interest and, under the I.R.S. guidelines, the sanctions would have been in the tens of millions of dollars."
The I.R.S., which drafted the agreement but has yet to sign it, declined to comment. 
The city is also being required to seek state legislation to bring the pension plans into compliance with federal law.
The proposed settlement, which the city has already signed, grew out of more than three years of discussions between the I.R.S. and the city. The talks intensified in April 2001 when a group of New York City retirees filed a state lawsuit that maintained that several city pension systems violated the federal tax code. Their suit is still pending and they are challenging the settlement.
The $177 million was withdrawn in six payments between 1988 and 1995, from the police, fire and New York City Employees Retirement System pension plans, officials said. In exchange for the money, the city agreed, starting in 1988, to pay some retired police officers and firefighters an annual lump sum, above and beyond their traditional pensions. The payments come from what is known as the variable supplement funds. This year the retirees will receive $10,000.
Although they agreed to the terms of the settlement, city officials disputed the contention that the receipt of the $177 million was improper. They said the city was authorized to receive the funds, not only by the affected unions, but also by state law.
"We didn't remove it," said James J. Dwyer, a lawyer who directs the pension division for the city's Law Department. "The Legislature said we could take it."
City officials said the I.R.S. had also recognized that the money received by the city, unlike funds diverted by a private employer, had been spent for public purposes. 
Yet if the city wanted to make similar deals with unions in the future, Mr. Dwyer said, "I don't believe that we would recommend that any similar agreements be structured along similar lines."
Financing arrangements like the ones that created the variable supplement funds are rare among municipal pension systems. They were first created by the city three decades ago. At the time, the city was seeking labor's permission to invest pension funds in the stock market, to take advantage of the potentially greater returns in the market compared with more conservative investments. In exchange for permitting the riskier investments, the police and fire unions were promised that their retirees would receive lump-sum payments each year, in addition to their pension checks.
The payments would be financed by the anticipated higher earnings of the stocks and would be based on how the investment portfolio had performed each year. To finance the payments, the city funneled the excess earnings of the pension plans into the variable supplement funds.
In 1988, the city changed the payment schedule. Instead of a variable amount each year, it promised a set amount that would be paid regardless of the stock market's performance. In exchange for such a guarantee, the city, which was in financial straits, got the police union to turn over $75 million from the union's variable supplement fund.
In later years, as unions representing firefighters and other workers sought the same guaranteed benefit, the city asked them to turn over similar amounts from their pension funds.
All told, the city received $177 million in this manner. That is the money that the I.R.S. contends should never have been withdrawn.
"All trustees authorized it," said Joseph Maccone, a pension consultant for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. "It wasn't as if the city did this without asking everybody's permission."
Today, more than 20,000 retired police officers, firefighters and others receive the lump-sum payments. Tens of thousands of other city retirees do not receive the benefit because the city says the cost would be too great. The disparity has led to long arguments. Retirees who do not receive the benefit, who include disabled firefighters and police officers who retired before it was created, have filed more than two dozen lawsuits challenging the benefit as discriminatory. All have failed. 
Two years ago, however, a group of retired correction officers took an entirely different tack. They claimed in their suit that the original funneling of excess pension earnings into the separate variable supplement funds represented an illegal diversion of funds that, in itself, violated the federal tax code. In addition, the plaintiffs cited the city's withdrawal of money from the supplement funds over the years as improper.
The lawsuit led to a more rigorous I.R.S. review, city officials said, and, ultimately, the proposed agreement. During the review, the I.R.S. found that the withdrawal of money by the city was, indeed, a violation of the tax laws. At the same, it decided that the original diversion of excess pension earnings into the variable supplement funds was allowable.
City lawyers said the agreement resolved the basic question posed by the lawsuit in their favor: the supplement funds in themselves do not violate the federal tax code.
If the federal tax agency had stripped the pension plans of their tax-exempt status, the pension beneficiaries could have been required to pay immediate taxes on the current value of their holdings in the plans, experts said.
David Cohen, a lawyer who specializes in pension plans, said he found the I.R.S. position reasonable. "The I.R.S., instead of trying to break the city, is showing itself to be the kinder, gentler I.R.S., one that is more interested in compliance than punishment," he said.
But the lawyer for the retired correction officers said he would try to block the I.R.S. from finalizing the agreement. The lawyer, Kevin P. Fitzpatrick of Marschhausen & Fitzpatrick, said the I.R.S. had failed to enforce its own regulations.
"Is this the same I.R.S.," he asked in a Jan. 8 letter to the agency, "that routinely punishes private sector plans, corporations and even goes so far as to punish spouses who merely sign joint returns with a tax-evading spouse?"

HEADLINE: On Media Giantism 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
You won't find a movie nominated for an Oscar with the heroine fighting to expose the dominance of media conglomerates in the distribution of entertainment -- crushed by the giant corporation that controls film financing, distribution and media criticism. 
 You won't find television magazine programs fearlessly exposing the broadcast lobby's pressure on Congress and the courts to allow station owners to gobble up more stations and cross-own local newspapers, thereby to determine what information residents of a local market receive. 
 Nor will you find many newspaper chains assigning reporters to reveal the effect of media giantism on local coverage or cover the way publishers induce coverage-hungry politicians to loosen antitrust restraints. 
Should we totally deregulate the public airwaves and permit the dwindling of major media down to a precious few? Should we reduce choices available to cantankerous individualists who do not want their information and entertainment limited by increasingly massive mass media? 
"Luddite nonsense," answer many merging movie mogul and media magnates, as they point to the seemingly fierce competition from the Internet and the proliferation of cable channels. 
Tell that to the purchasers of political advertising: the big bucks go into broadcast TV, with its unmatchable cost per thousand viewers. And stop to examine the highly hyped "competition" that consolidating media profess to fear: the leading 20 Internet sites and biggest cable channels are already owned by the expansive likes of G.E.-NBC, Disney, Fox, Gannett, AOL Time Warner, Hearst, Microsoft, Cox, Dow Jones, The Washington Post and The New York Times. (Is there anyone I haven't offended?) 
Ah, counter the trust-trusters, but most people want the conglomerates they trust to provide the content they watch and read. As for diversity -- don't 16,000 local radio stations provide much of the vaunted diversity of views and tastes that Americans want? 
Take a listen to what's happened to local radio in one short wave of deregulation: the great cacophony of different sounds and voices is being amalgamated and homogenized. (The following figures were published by Gannett's USA Today, which kind of blunts my point about big-media squeamishness, but its account of the F.C.C.'s ruination of independent radio is damning.) 
Back in 1996, the two largest radio chains owned 115 stations; today, those two own more than 1,400. A handful of leading owners used to generate only a fifth of industry revenue; now these top five rake in 55 percent of all money spent on local radio. The number of station owners has plummeted by a third. Yesterday's programming diversity on the public's airwaves has degenerated to the Top 40, as today's consolidating commodores borrowing public property say "the public interest be damned."
Granted, Rush Limbaugh's views differ from those heard on liberal NPR, just as an indie movie producer can make money for a cookie-cutter conglomerate with a film going against the grain. But while political paranoids accuse each other of vast conspiracies, the truth is that media mergers have narrowed the range of information and entertainment available to people of all ideologies. 
Does this make me (gasp!) pro-regulation? Michael Powell, appointed by Bush to be F.C.C. chairman, likes to say "the market is my religion." My conservative economic religion is founded on the rock of competition, which -- since Teddy Roosevelt's day -- has protected small business and consumers against predatory pricing leading to market monopolization. 
One of the Democrats on the F.C.C., Michael Copps, is concerned that "we're relying on institutions to cover this debate which have interests in the outcome of the debate." That inherent conflict of interest is why I have long been banging my spoon against the highchair.
Republicans in the House, intimidated by the powerful broadcast lobby, don't admit that some regulation can be pro-business; neither does the D.C. Court of Appeals, which wants further "granulating of evidence" that endless merging harms competition. In the Senate, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, grasps this. Perhaps Commerce Chairman John McCain will see T.R.'s trust-busting light and start heavy granulating in hearings -- before merger mania afflicts TV and film the way it is debilitating local radio.

Study Urges More Action to Cut Risks From Weapons Stockpiles

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The United States, Russia and Europe should do far more to reduce the urgent and "grave proliferation risks" from their remaining stockpiles of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, concludes a new report endorsed by a consortium of influential private research centers.
 Specifically, the report concludes, the United States and its European allies must begin treating Russia as a partner in such efforts rather than as a strategic charity case. 
 For its part, the report says, Russia must become more open and remove obstacles to cooperation to prevent the world's most lethal arms and technology from spreading to rogue states and terrorist groups.
The four-volume report was conceived as one of the most comprehensive public assessments of a decade of American and allied efforts to help Russia secure its strategic arms stockpiles and to reduce the dangers posed by its cold war legacies of vast unconventional arms stockpiles and personnel. 
The three-year study, "Protecting Against the Spread of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons," has been endorsed by a group of 15 research organizations in the United States, Europe, Russia and Japan. It was financed by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Washington foundation started by Ted Turner and Sam Nunn, a former Democratic senator from Georgia.
The first volume was written by Robert J. Einhorn and Michele A. Flournoy, former senior Clinton administration arms control and defense specialists now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. It is to be released today in London at a conference about efforts to secure and reduce stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. A copy was provided to The New York Times in advance.
At a summit meeting in Canada last June, the major industrial powers and Russia -- the Group of 8 -- agreed to spend $20 billion over the next 10 years to help Russia reduce the threat posed by its stockpiles.
The report notes that given the danger that these materials might be acquired by rogue states of terrorists, these nations should consider $20 billion a "floor" rather than a ceiling. It also recommends that nations "may wish to waive debt payments" in exchange for additional spending by Russia on such projects.
The study highlights progress made with a $7 billion investment in these efforts by the United States, much of it under Cooperative Threat Reduction programs started by legislation in the early 1990's sponsored by Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, now Foreign Relations Committee chairman, and Mr. Nunn.
In the past decade, the report notes, nuclear materials have been removed from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The world's largest anthrax production facility at Stepnogorsk, Kazakhstan, was dismantled.
The first prototype chemical weapons destruction plant in Russia is ready to operate, and more than 50,000 scientists who once worked in nuclear, biological and chemical weapons facilities have received aid. 
Despite such steps, the report asserts that more ambitious measures are needed. The study found, for instance, that basic security upgrades had been completed at "facilities containing only 46 percent of the approximately 603 metric tons of Russia's weapons-usable nuclear materials" identified by the United States Department of Energy.
"Virtually none" of Russia's plutonium and "less than one-seventh" of its highly enriched uranium has been rendered unusable for nuclear weapons, the report says. "The same is true for the United States," it says.
The report emphasizes the continuing threat posed by Russia's biological stockpiles, about 20 major former Soviet facilities and at least two dozen smaller institutions. 
"Thousands of weapons scientists and workers are still unemployed or underemployed," the report says, and susceptible to lucrative offers of work from countries that could have secret germ weapons programs.
Many Bush administration officials say Russia should not benefit from American assistance, given its reluctance to open facilities suspected of illicit arms research. Officials have also protested Russian aid to Iran's nuclear program. But the report concludes that helping Russia secure and eliminate unconventional weapons stockpiles is too important to be held hostage to such concerns.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KOREAN PENINSULA; 
U.S. Expands Aid Offer, and North Korea Wants to Talk

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea inched closer today toward a resolution of a crisis over nuclear weapons development with American offers of economic cooperation and North Korean calls for dialogue.
 American support for a more conciliatory approach to the crisis has grown more explicit in recent days, since President Bush spoke on Tuesday of reviving a so-called bold initiative toward North Korea, which would have the United States offer food and energy aid, along with political and security guarantees. 
 In exchange, North Korea would be required to show it had eliminated its nuclear weapons programs, something which, given the country's violation of past weapons control agreements, would probably involve highly intrusive inspections.
This weekend there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity around the crisis with North Korea, along with several new and somewhat more explicit restatements of Mr. Bush's offer. 
"If they satisfy our concerns about the nuclear programs, we are prepared to consider a broad approach that would entail, in the final analysis, some economic cooperation, perhaps in the power field," the American ambassador to South Korea, Thomas C. Hubbard, said in a television interview here today. "We are prepared to go beyond food aid."
Until this week, North Korea had shown little sign of faith in a negotiated solution to the crisis, and it appeared to be racing toward the development of nuclear weapons. In recent days, however, there have been increasing calls for a diplomatic settlement from North Korea. 
"Genuine dialogue is a fair and equal discussion in which both parties' concerns are simultaneously addressed," said North Korea's ambassador to China, Choe Jin Su, in an interview with Japan's Kyodo news agency. "The United States is leading world opinion in a mistaken direction, as if it were interested in dialogue, but there is no change in its stance of 'first abandon the nuclear program and then we'll hold talks.' "
The current crisis with North Korea began last October, when the United States presented it with evidence of a secret program to produce highly enriched uranium, whose only practical use is for nuclear weapons. Since then, Washington has cut off fuel shipments to the country. In response, North Korea expelled international monitors at its mothballed nuclear power plants and has signaled its intention to restart the plants, which could quickly give it more bomb-making material.
Washington's increasingly supple approach comes in response to heavy diplomatic pressure from close allies and rival regional powers alike to work directly with North Korea toward a settlement. 
Western diplomats acknowledge, furthermore, that military options against North Korea are both limited and unpalatable, especially on the eve of a possible war in Iraq.
James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who was completing a tour of the region for consultations on the North Korean crisis, met in Tokyo today with Japan's foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, who reportedly expressed support for a comprehensive deal with North Korea, which would include a written pledge by the United States not to attack North Korea.
Throughout the crisis, delicate relations with South Korea, which, along with Japan, is an important American ally in Asia, have loomed large. South Korea's president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, has been outspoken in demanding a peaceful resolution of the crisis with North Korea. On Saturday, speaking on a national television program, Mr. Roh said he had been horrified to learn last month of what he asserted were American plans for a strike against North Korea's nuclear facilities. 
"At the time of the elections, some U.S. officials, who held considerable responsibility in the administration, talked about the possibility of attacking North Korea," Mr. Roh said. 
"Fortunately," he added, "opinion in the United States started to change to resolving the matter peacefully."
A White House spokeswoman, responding to Mr. Roh's comments, denied any hostile intent. 
"We are not going to invade North Korea," Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage said in an interview with Japanese journalists in Washington, which was published today. "If we respect their sovereignty, and their economic activity, then there is a basis to move forward." Mr. Armitage ruled out a formal nonaggression treaty with North Korea, which has been one of its longstanding demands, saying that Congress would not support it. 
Mr. Armitage said, however, that Washington and North Korea could exchange letters of intent or official statements ruling out an attack by one country against the other.
In other diplomatic activity today, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr Losyukov, presented a plan to North Korean leaders in Pyongyang, the capital, that would provide security guarantees and a resumption of economic assistance if North Korea shut down its nuclear programs, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. Russian officials said they expected a response on Monday.

 BODY:
The Pakistanis pictured here were deported by the United States in the last year for entering the country illegally or overstaying their visas. All said they had been trying to legalize their immigration status. None were charged with terror-related offenses.

SYED WASIM ABBAS
 The 33-year-old gas station owner from York, Pa., said he attended Brooklyn College for three years after entering the United States on a student visa in 1992. He speaks English with a Brooklyn accent. He is a former football linebacker and still jokes about how Americans often mistake him for The Rock, the professional wrestler. He happily recalls playing pickup basketball with "Spanish, blacks, Pakistanis and Indians" in Brooklyn. "I couldn't score," he said. "They called me a hack." 
 After hearing a rumor that it was possible to receive a green card if one applied in Chicago, he flew there and filed an application with a false Chicago address in 1998, he said. But he said he decided to skip his court hearing in Chicago after hearing that other people were arrested for doing the same thing. In 2000, he applied for residency after marrying an American citizen, a Pakistani American woman he met at a college party.
Arrested by I.N.S. agents last May, he said he was questioned for 30 minutes. He said he had spent a month in the Bergen County jail and was deported on the day he was to see a judge. He said he was unaware of any deportation order against him. He and other Pakistanis were handcuffed throughout a 16-hour I.N.S. deportation flight to Pakistan, he said, and his wife remains in the United States.
He estimates he lost $40,000 he invested in his gas station, which was seized by creditors after his arrest. "It's pretty obvious," he said. "They are cracking down on Muslims."

NAEEM JANJUA
The 30-year-old former owner of a small business said he sneaked into the United States in 1990 in the back of a tractor-trailer from Mexico. He said he had applied for asylum and worked in various jobs. By September 2001, he said, he had opened his own trucking business, married a fellow immigrant from Fiji, had two daughters and bought a home in Heyward, Calif. Each year, he said, he applied to the I.N.S. for a work permit and received one.
Last April, he said, I.N.S. agents arrested him for filing a second asylum application in 1996 under a false name. He admitted making the filing, but said he had grown desperate after hearing nothing about his first application for six years. After spending four months in jail, he said, he was deported in August without seeing a judge.
He estimates that he has lost $100,000 on his home, which has been sold, and his business, which is closed. He says his wife does not want to move to Pakistan. "I lost my business, my home, everything," he said. "And I'm about to lose my family, too."

KHURRAM ALTAF
The 34-year-old father of three said he had managed a Pilot Oil Corporation truck stop on Interstate 78 in Bloomsbury, N.J. "I was the only Pakistani Muslim in the company," he said proudly. He said he entered the United States in 1985 on a tourist visa at the age of 18 and had overstayed it. A lawyer he had paid $10,000 botched a 1996 residency application, he said. An appeal of that decision, and an application for citizenship sponsored by his sister, an American citizen, were still pending when he was deported, he said. He said he had applied for and received annual work permits from the I.N.S.
He recounted being arrested by I.N.S. agents at his home in South Amboy, N.J., last April, and being briefly questioned about whether he was involved with Al Qaeda, had relatives in Afghanistan and could fly a plane. He was held in the Bergen County jail for two months and deported last summer without seeing a judge, he said. His three children, who are American citizens, and his wife remain in New Jersey, he said. He does not want to bring his daughter to Pakistan because she has a hearing disability and he believes that she would struggle in school. Unemployed in Pakistan, he has no idea what he is going to do. "Without family, life is nothing," he said. "I'm like a dead person."

NAEEM SHAIKH
The 31-year-old Queens taxi driver said he illegally entered the United States in 1994. Smuggled from Pakistan through three countries, he used a fake green card to pass through immigration at Kennedy Airport. On Sept. 11, he was in Battery Park when there was an explosion in the north tower of the World Trade Center. He then watched a second plane slam into the south tower, abandoned his taxi and fled for his life.
After the attacks, he wanted to normalize his legal status. In March, he answered an ad from a Florida lawyer who offered to sponsor immigrants for citizenship. A week later, F.B.I. and I.N.S. agents arrested him. The ad, he believes, was a ruse. He said F.B.I. agents had asked him if he knew Osama bin Laden, if he had been to Afghanistan or Kashmir and if he could fly a plane. They offered him citizenship in exchange for information.
His wife, who is also Pakistani, was pregnant when he was arrested. He estimates that he has lost $18,000 in clothing and furniture left in his apartment. But he praised several American friends who helped support his wife during the month he spent in jail before being deported without seeing a judge.
His wife and his new son, an American citizen he has not seen, are in Montreal. He hopes to join them, if he can get a Canadian visa. "It's not just us," he said, referring to Pakistanis. "Muslims all over the will be against the U.S. if they keep doing this." 

SYED BASHIR SHAH
The 55-year-old former video store owner and security guard at Los Angeles International Airport said he entered the United States on a tourist visa in 1991 and applied for asylum, citing threats from a violent Karachi political party. He said that he passed a security check of all airport employees last winter and that a valid work permit was sent to his house even after he was deported. "In 1997, I applied to renew my case," he said. "The lawyer charged $10,000." He said he never knew about his court hearing because his lawyer moved to Australia.
He recounted being arrested at his home in June by an agent who told him that his asylum application had been denied. He was deported in August after spending four months in jail without seeing a judge. He is now in Pakistan living with his wife and three children he had not seen for over a decade. Of the men interviewed, he expressed the least anger at the United States. But he accused the I.N.S. officers and judges of being biased against Pakistanis, a charge immigration officials deny. "There are hearings for Chinese, Mexicans," he said. "They have chance. For Pakistanis, no hearing, no nothing, that's it."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 23, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A series of profiles on Monday of Pakistanis who were recently deported from the United States for having entered the country illegally or having overstayed visas misspelled the surname of a lawyer for one man. The lawyer, who represents Anser Mehmood, a 42-year-old truck driver and father of four who lived in Bayonne, N.J., is Martin R. Stolar, not Stoller.

HEADLINE: The Faithful's Wayward Path 

BYLINE:  By Juan Williams; Juan Williams, senior correspondent for NPR and political analyst for Fox News Channel, is co-author of "This Far by Faith: Stories From the African-American Religious Experience."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Forty years ago, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous "Letter from a Birmingham Jail." This classic of protest literature is celebrated for its powerful call for immediate and widespread action to end racial segregation through nonviolent marches, sit-in demonstrations and boycotts. But through the fog of history it is often forgotten that Dr. King's letter was not addressed to civil rights advocates. Nor did Dr. King send it to the segregationists who had jailed him. The letter was written to church leaders.
 Dr. King's jeremiad came after days of protests and appeals to Birmingham's segregationist politicians had hit a dead end. Thousands of protesters had been arrested. The police commissioner, the infamous Bull Connor, had used police dogs and punishing blasts from fire hoses to terrorize demonstrators. 
 At that point clergymen, black and white, asked Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference to get out so that local leadership could negotiate quietly with the city's more moderate politicians. A local judge ordered Dr. King not to lead any protest. He marched anyway and ended up in solitary confinement. While he was behind bars a coalition of white ministers wrote to a local paper that he was a radical rabble-rouser. They called for reasonable people of all colors to integrate downtown Birmingham slowly, through patient, private conversations. 
Writing from jail, Dr. King responded: "You are quite right in calling for negotiations. Indeed this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue."
"We know through painful experience," he continued, "that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed." 
Today, Dr. King's letter to Birmingham's white clergy needs to be addressed to the leaders of those religious groups that collectively form the black church.
A distracted clergy watches idly as the black community is engaged in new fights just as vital as the one against segregation of 40 years ago. The spread of AIDS, the high number of broken families, the crisis in public education, jails disproportionately filled with black men, and the high rate of children living in poverty constitute today's challenge in the life of the black church.
But the leadership of many black churches is focused primarily on economic development, ranging from real estate ventures to establishing black megachurches and TV ministries. In too many black churches, the social and cultural issues are either at the edges or have fallen off the screen altogether.
In some black churches, Dr. King's desire to create a crisis, build tension and command public attention for advancing social change is a forgotten lesson. In the case of AIDS, many black churches are still paralyzed by a refusal to accept homosexuality as part of the life of some in their congregations. That mindset has remained in place even as AIDS has become an affliction of heterosexuals. In many black churches the presence of drug addicts is still treated as a point of shame; it is seen as something to be covered up rather than a critical issue for the well-being of the black community.
The lone entry point to social action for the black church today is the money coming from the government and major foundations. President Bush's faith-based initiative program, with the offer of federal financing, has revived interest in dealing with the homeless and the elderly and providing day care. Major foundations fighting the ravages of AIDS in the minority community have also tried to buy the black church's involvement, but to little avail.
The black church is right to pay attention to economic issues. Disparities in wealth between blacks and whites are arguably the principal racial divide in America. As the major landowners in black America and the top recipients of charitable giving from black Americans, the black churches have to be faithful stewards and look at how they can leverage their wealth to create more economic opportunities. The growing number of black megachurches in well-to-do suburbs creates even more opportunities for economic development.
But the narrow focus on money is debilitating to the spirit of today's black churches. The Rev. Henry Lyons, the former leader of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., focused on money so intently that it led him to be convicted of corruption. Churches have to be smart about money, but they are not banks. They are not clearinghouses where names and addresses are collected for direct-mail advertisers. They are not studios for TV ministry productions. They are not dating services, and they are not real estate offices.
In the long arc of black America's movement to achieve equal justice, the black church has been a living fortress for people doing God's work, acting by faith to fight social and political wrongs. When the modern civil rights movement was taking flight in the 50's, the Rev. Joseph H. Jackson, then the head of the Baptist convention, argued that the church's purpose was saving souls and not stirring social change. Dr. King and other Baptist ministers disagreed. They are legends for their effort while he is largely forgotten. 
In fact, throughout history the black church has been at its best as a leading force for social change. In 1822 Denmark Vesey led a slave revolt built through a network of black churches and houses of African tribal worship around Charleston, S.C. In the 1840's, Sojourner Truth built her crusade to abolish slavery on Christian appeals for reform and redemption. 
The black church also led all social agencies in helping blacks from the agrarian South adjust to life in the industrial North during the great migration of the 30's and 40's. And, of course, black houses of worship, including mosques, provided the secure base of support, both economically and politically, for mid-20th-century black preachers like Dr. King, Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks and even Malcolm X. The black churches have also been key to the growth of black political power in everything from registering voters to getting people to the polls. 
That is why the black church remains the mainstay of any organizing effort in black America. But now it is increasingly standing on the sidelines while compelling social issues need to be addressed. 
Some ministers respond to critics by saying the churches have been poor for too long. To their way of thinking, the social agenda can wait until their economic success gives them deeper pockets. That kind of thinking can blind a church to anything but its bank statement. The greatest wealth of the church has always been its abiding faith that God will provide as leaders of the church marched into the darkest pit of injustice.
When Birmingham's white ministers asked Dr. King to wait in the face of Bull Connor's rabid segregationist violence, Dr. King said waiting was impossible: "For years now I have heard the word 'Wait!' It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This 'wait' has almost always meant 'never.' We must come to see . . . that 'justice too long delayed is justice denied.' "
Dr. King's words, so powerful in that violent and momentous era, should have no less resonance for the black clergy today.

Riding Polls Downhill On a $600 Bike

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
A TOUGH crowd, the people of New York. In the last election a newly minted Republican sold himself as the anti-politician, the smart businessman who would make the tough decisions because he owed no one. He got elected, began making those tough decisions, and what happened? Rejection.
 A New York Times poll out last week found that the approval rating of Michael R. Bloomberg has fallen to an unusually low 31 percent, and that he has earned precious little recognition for his accomplishments. A bad economy always hurts mayoral popularity, and the impact of the recession and Sept. 11 on the city may be among the worst yet, leading the mayor to raise taxes and to warn of more manifestations of gloom and doom. 
 But the results also revealed a nebulous dislike of the mayor and discomfort with his wealth, even though it was hardly a secret; without it he would never have been elected.
What is going on? Call it the fitful education of a reluctant student. The new mayor is learning that his experiment in doing things his way -- in being a direct, purposeful, almost deliberately uninspiring manager in the city of La Guardia, Koch, Giuliani and Jimmy Walker -- is not enough. New York wants its mayors to be big and bold. It demands that they shout to be heard over the din. Mike Bloomberg barely whispers.
Maybe politics should not demand that its practitioners be entertainers, but it does, especially in bad times, when politicians have to bring people along.
"People expect certain things of their mayor," said Philip J. Friedman, a political consultant. "They expect this larger-than-life guy who shows up in their neighborhoods, connects to their lives. If you don't have that, it's harder to do good things and to get credit for the things you do."
Mr. Bloomberg has shown no talent or patience for the "share your pain" aspect of his newly adopted career. "There is no way he can avoid some damage from the fiscal crisis he is managing, but he could navigate it better if he had better political skills and instincts," said Alan Brinkley, a Columbia University historian. "He almost seems not to care very much about what people think of him, which in a way is admirable. But I'm struck by how little effort he seems to be making to sell what he's doing."
The mayor's accomplishments in just a year are, by any standard, substantial. Crime remains down, racial tensions have ebbed, the First Amendment has moved back into City Hall. The mayor has announced a sweeping housing plan and, succeeding where predecessors have failed, gained control of the school system, all without finding scapegoats or alienating vested interests. That would seem to be more than enough to compensate for Mr. Bloomberg's bouts of willfulness, like his continuing objection to disclosing his weekend whereabouts.
But the poll found that the public appears neither appreciative of his accomplishments nor aware of all of them. In a surely inadvertent reflection of what people seem to be sensing about him, the mayor seems remarkably diffident, even dismissive. "I think the poll reflects the reality that you have to balance the budget," he said, adding: "Maybe people don't like me. I don't know."
MORE likely they do not know him. New Yorkers want to feel they have a personal relationship with their mayors, want to love him or hate him. The stubborn Mr. Bloomberg has kept his distance. And when he has tried symbolism, he has revealed a tin ear, as with his bicycle caper; when the city was facing the threat of a transit strike, he spent more than $600 on a bike and related trinkets. "It should've been $50," said Edward I. Koch.
The episode was reminiscent of the first President Bush's visit to a supermarket in 1992, when some thought he must never before have seen a checkout scanner. The incident reinforced the impression that he was out of touch with ordinary people.
"Symbols mean something," said Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president. "I can't tell you how many people said to me, 'A $600 bicycle? That's what I pay in rent.' "
The mayor's advisers say he will not change, contending his good works will ultimately prevail. He will surely be able to spend millions of his own dollars to advertise his record, if he runs for a second term. But there are three years to go.
"This is who the voters elected," said his communications director, William T. Cunningham. That they did. They should study up on who he is and the things he is doing. Too bad he balks at helping them along.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Axis of Evil: First Birthday for a Famous Phrase

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Will he or won't he?
 Nobody ever remembers much from State of the Union speeches, but one thing they do remember is the "axis of evil" formulation that President Bush brandished in last year's address to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Like Ronald Reagan's description of the former Soviet Union as an "evil empire," the axis of evil is a leitmotif that will follow Mr. Bush beyond his presidency. 
 So now that the White House is coming up on the first anniversary of the axis -- Mr. Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech is to be given Jan. 28 -- the question arises: will the president repeat the combustible phrase that administration critics say caused a year of troubles? Or on the eve of what could be military action against Iraq, will he offer up a new, perhaps hotter formulation? 
"Tune in," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.
Administration officials say that Iraq will be a significant part of the speech, and that the president is likely to make a strong case for action against it. The day before, United Nations weapons inspectors are to present a report to the Security Council. One senior administration official said this weekend that the White House expects the inspectors to ask for more time, perhaps many months, to complete their work.
In that case, the official said, Mr. Bush would probably use the State of the Union to rebut the inspectors in a "broad, geo-strategic speech." It would leave many of the details for later, either in another presidential speech or in an extensive case that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell would present to the Security Council. Mr. Bush, officials said, will also devout a large portion of his State of the Union speech to promoting his economic plan and his $670 billion in tax cuts.
One thing is certain: A year later, White House officials say they have no regrets about the axis of evil formulation. "Zilch," said Mr. Fleischer. "Just as Ronald Reagan was accurate in calling the Soviet Union the evil empire, it's important to people inside those three countries who want to be free to know that the United States has not forgotten their cause."
Critics say the White House is deluding itself, and that the axis of evil phrase has pushed the administration inexorably into the confrontation with Iraq, incited the crisis with North Korea and undercut reformers in Iran, not to mention aggravated the allies, particularly Europeans.
"I think they realize the axis of evil phrase has gotten them into a lot of trouble with a lot of different people," said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow of the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution and a former C.I.A. military analyst who supports a war in Iraq. "It's made their diplomacy a lot harder, and it's reinforced the sentiment that these are a bunch of cowboys who don't pay a whole lot of attention to nuances."
James R. Lilley, a former United States ambassador to South Korea who supports the administration's foreign policy, said that while "the president spoke the truth," he personally did not like the focus on the phrase, particularly after it was followed by Mr. Bush's statement that he loathed Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader.
"If you want to get something done in North Korea, that's really not the way to approach it," Mr. Lilley said. Reprising the axis of evil in this year's State of the Union speech, Mr. Lilley added, "would probably be counterproductive."
One person who really likes axis of evil is David Frum, the former White House speechwriter who coined the first half of the phrase. (Mr. Frum came up with "axis of hatred," which Michael Gerson, the chief White House speechwriter, changed to the more theological "axis of evil.") 
Not quite a year after leaving the White House, Mr. Frum now has a book out, "The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush," which includes an extensive account of the birth of the axis of evil as well as a look at the president's speech-editing style. "One of my first efforts for him included the phrase, 'I've seen with my own eyes,' "'Mr. Frum writes. "The words 'with my own eyes' were circled and a sarcastic 'DUH' scrawled beside them." 
Mr. Bush also insisted on strict linear logic: "If a sentence strayed from its proper sequence, it would be corralled with a furious inky lariat and directed back to its place with a big black arrow and a heavy explanation: EDUCATION goes HERE. TAX RELIEF over HERE. And DEFENSE SPENDING should all go THERE."
Mr. Bush readily embraced the axis of evil phrase, Mr. Frum writes, and responded to the outcry afterward by defiantly repeating it. 
Mr. Frum said yesterday that the phrase now seemed "prophetic" and that "one of the reasons it was right was that it reflected the man."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS PRESSURING INDUSTRIES TO CUT GREENHOUSE GASES 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In an aggressive effort to show that President Bush's voluntary climate strategy can work, senior administration officials are traveling the country collecting written promises from industries to curb emissions of gases linked to global warming.
 White House officials, insisting on concrete commitments measured in tons of gases, have rejected written offers from some industry groups to take nonspecific actions, several industry officials said. The administration and industry leaders plan to unveil a broad array of pledges at the White House on Feb. 6. 
 This is the administration's latest and most intensive effort to demonstrate that voluntarily controlling emissions can make mandatory reductions unnecessary. Mr. Bush has said such reductions will harm the economy. The effort has no teeth, officials and company representatives say, other than the growing realization in industry that without measurable success from voluntary reductions, it will become ever harder in coming years to stave off legislation requiring companies to act. Senators of both parties introduced such legislation in Congress this month, and states are acting on their own as well. 
The administration's intent, once all the industries' commitments are tallied, is to meet Mr. Bush's stated goal: an 18 percent reduction, by 2012, in emissions of greenhouse gases for each unit of gross domestic product. Overall emissions would continue to grow, but more slowly.
Some company officials and other opponents of regulation have criticized the administration's effort as a mandatory program disguised as a voluntary one.
"This is meant to give the impression that the administration is doing something to control CO2 emissions," said Myron Ebell, a climate policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which promotes free markets and limited government. "The danger is that they could easily get pushed from that position into actually regulating emissions, which would be very expensive, pointless."
At the same time, many scientists, environmental groups and political foes of Mr. Bush have said his target is so modest that no matter what industries do to achieve it, it will not help stem climate change. Most other industrialized countries have chosen to pursue binding reductions in emissions through the Kyoto Protocol, the climate treaty Mr. Bush rejected shortly after taking office.
"Over a decade ago, the United States committed to voluntary greenhouse gas reductions, and emissions have continued to rise," said Elizabeth Cook, an expert on corporate environmental policies at the World Resources Institute.
Citing an expanding body of research pointing to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a cause of global warming, she and other critics said more action was needed.
White House officials said the new effort was just the beginning of a protracted campaign for voluntary reductions. "We're not declaring victory here and going home," an administration official said. "It'll be an ongoing thing from here."
Many big companies, expecting that regulation of greenhouse gases is inevitable, have already moved independently to set up voluntary caps and trading schemes in which companies that aggressively cut their emissions acquire pollution credits they can sell to other companies. The list of such companies includes most of the country's biggest energy, mineral and industrial concerns, including DuPont, Motorola, Waste Management Inc. and American Electric Power, a Midwestern utility that is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the Western Hemisphere.
The newest effort began on Thursday, with the start of the Chicago Climate Exchange, under which big manufacturers and energy companies agreed to cut emissions and trade credits with one another.
As they considered the administration's initiative, industries at first resisted committing themselves to specific targets.
The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's principal trade group, initially offered the White House a proposal for efforts on emissions, but without a specific timetable or targets. It cited the difficulty of getting all its members to agree on a single plan -- and of measuring emissions from every facet of far-flung operations.
That was rejected, but after several rounds of discussions with the administration, the institute -- like other industry groups -- agreed to emissions changes that would mesh with Mr. Bush's 2012 goal.
"Oil, gas and other industries have all had significant discussions in trying to achieve the types of commitments the administration is desiring," said Robert L. Greco III, a senior manager at the institute. "Industry is committed to supporting this type of approach and is willing to step up to further the objective of the president's program."
Trade groups for companies pumping oil, mining coal, making cars, synthesizing plastics, smelting metals and manufacturing microchips have been recruited and have scrambled to settle on various targets for reducing or in some cases eliminating emissions.
These include some of the most influential voices for industry in Washington, the American Chemistry Council, National Mining Association, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Edison Electric Institute, which represents power-plant owners.
Talks are still under way, and agreements could change, but some details are starting to emerge.
Under the program, magnesium producers have agreed to eliminate releases of a potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, by 2010. The gas is very rare, but each molecule has 23,600 times as much heat-trapping potential as a molecule of carbon dioxide.
Chip makers have said that by 2010 they will cut emissions of perfluorocarbons, another potent warming gas, 10 percent below 1995 levels.
Among other actions, all the major oil companies have agreed to scour pipelines and oil fields for leaking methane, another powerful heat-trapping gas. Coal companies have promised to expand efforts to capture methane and other greenhouse gases escaping from mines.
Individual companies are being asked to set more general goals.
Under a simultaneous initiative, also to begin on Feb. 6, the Business Roundtable, which represents 140 of the country's biggest companies, is working with the White House to obtain commitments from its members to start assessing their activities and considering ways to reduce their impact on climate.
Although that effort is theoretically voluntary, the Business Roundtable has already promised to deliver 100 percent of its members.
Some industry officials have quietly objected to the heavy pressure to sign on.
On Jan. 8, James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, addressed a private gathering of leaders of electric utilities at the Ritz Carlton in Naples, Fla. Several executives who were there said his insistence on substantive commitments prompted some of them to label the effort the "mandatory voluntary climate program."
The administration's push has intensified as criticisms of its cautious climate policies have increased, and more aggressive alternatives have been proposed.
On the day Mr. Connaughton spoke in Florida, influential senators from both parties unveiled a bill that would require restrictions on emissions. California and New York are moving toward restricting greenhouse gases from vehicles.
Administration officials acknowledge that they are trying to tread a fine line. They do not want to alienate voters in states like West Virginia, where the economy revolves around coal, a major source of carbon dioxide, but they do want to appease moderates, particularly women, for whom global warming is a growing concern.
But in seeking that path, many experts and lobbyists for different factions said, the administration could end up satisfying no one and doing little to solve the problem.
Many people involved in the White House effort, including government officials and executives from industries, say it is unlikely to lead to improvements much beyond those already taking place as the economy shifts from old-style manufacturing and businesses grow less wasteful.
And the effort, aimed mainly at manufacturing, encompasses only a small portion of America's greenhouse-gas emissions.
For example, while the auto industry is agreeing to curb gases from its assembly lines, it has not been asked -- nor has it promised -- to reduce gases from the tailpipes of the cars and trucks it builds.
Nevertheless, Ms. Cook, at the World Resources Institute, said there was some value in finally pushing a broad array of industries to start looking for ways to reduce their impact on climate. Once they have committed to change, she said, it will be hard for them to reverse course.

HEADLINE: A Stirring in the Nation 

 BODY:
A largely missing ingredient in the nascent debate about invading Iraq showed up on the streets of major cities over the weekend as crowds of peaceable protesters marched in a demand to be heard. They represented what appears to be a large segment of the American public that remains unconvinced that the Iraqi threat warrants the use of military force at this juncture. 
 Denouncing the war plan as an administration idee fixe that will undermine America's standing in the world, stir unrest in the Mideast and damage the American economy, the protesters in Washington massed on Saturday for what police described as the largest antiwar rally at the Capitol since the Vietnam era. It was impressive for the obvious mainstream roots of the marchers -- from young college students to grayheads with vivid protest memories of the 60's. They gathered from near and far by the tens of thousands, galvanized by the possibility that President Bush will soon order American forces to attack Iraq even without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. 
 Mr. Bush and his war cabinet would be wise to see the demonstrators as a clear sign that noticeable numbers of Americans no longer feel obliged to salute the administration's plans because of the shock of Sept. 11 and that many harbor serious doubts about his march toward war. The protesters are raising some nuanced questions in the name of patriotism about the premises, cost and aftermath of the war the president is contemplating. Millions of Americans who did not march share the concerns and have yet to hear Mr. Bush make a persuasive case that combat operations are the only way to respond to Saddam Hussein. 
Other protests will be emphasizing civil disobedience in the name of Martin Luther King Jr. But any graphic moments to come of confrontation and arrest should be seen in the far broader context of the Capitol scene: peaceable throngs of mainstream Americans came forward demanding more of a dialogue from political leaders. Mr. Bush and his aides, to their credit, welcomed the demonstrations as a healthy manifestation of American democracy at work. We hope that spirit will endure in the weeks ahead if differences deepen and a noisier antiwar movement develops. These protests are the tip of a far broader sense of concern and lack of confidence in the path to war that seems to lie ahead.

U.S. Could Allow Safe Haven for Hussein
Even as they rejected calls for delay before confronting Saddam Hussein militarily, three officials of the Bush administration hinted that they would consider allowing him to find a safe haven if that would avoid a war. A1

Iraq told the top two United Nations arms inspectors that it had found four more empty chemical weapons warheads similar to the 12 discovered last week. The disclosure came in a meeting between Iraqi officials and the inspectors, who returned to Baghdad to urge the government to intensify cooperation with inspection teams. A12

In Israel, More Conflicts
An Israeli court set a trial date for a Palestinian leader on charges of involvement in attacks that killed 26 people, though he contends it does not have the right to try him. In Hebron, the funeral of a settler who was killed in an attack by Palestinian gunmen turned into a conflict over where to bury him and then a full-scale riot. A7

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel accused European states of bias in favor of the Palestinians, criticizing their role in an American-backed plan for Middle East peace. A6

Iran Cleric Backs Dissident
A high-ranking reformist cleric denounced the house arrest of a dissident who has challenged the authority of Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and called on other high-ranking clerics to press for his release. A8

Libya Set to Win Rights Post
Libya, long accused by human rights activists of major abuses, is set to win the chairmanship of the United Nations' top rights body despite strong opposition from the United States. A4

The two highest-ranking African-Americans in the Bush administration took differing positions on the affirmative action case before the Supreme Court. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, praised the president's stance against the University of Michigan's use of race in its admissions program. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell refused to do so. A17

Democrats Show Confidence
There is a growing sense among Democrats and some Republicans that President Bush's re-election is not certain. A15

Ships to Carry Bulk of Supplies
More than 95 percent of the fuel, ammunition and materiel that would be used in an attack against Iraq, would flow into the Persian Gulf region by ship, military experts say. And the cargo fleet is more prepared to move quickly than in the past. A12

HEADLINE: Democratic Showings Of Confidence in Iowa 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LISBON, Iowa, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush is riding high as he prepares for his e-election campaign. He is a popular Republican president in an increasingly Republican country, as powerful as any chief executive in recent times, and on the cusp of becoming a wartime president.
 Yet Iowa is teeming with Democratic presidential activity this weekend. Three of six likely Democratic presidential contenders campaigned at dinners, at diners and in living rooms across the state from Friday night right through this afternoon. They were, without exception, speaking confidently about their 2004 prospects to undoubting audiences, including the raucous, sold-out Linn County Democratic Party banquet near here on Saturday. 
 One year before Democrats here gather for the Iowa caucuses, which start the presidential nomination process, there is a growing sense among Democrats and some Republicans that Mr. Bush's re-election is -- if still likely -- not at all certain. 
That sense of possibility has contributed to an unexpectedly crowded lineup of Democrats (six and counting) who want to challenge the president and to the large number of Iowans who turned out in frigid weather this weekend to see some of them. More than 500 people packed a hall early Saturday to hear Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
"Most people are unhappy with the direction of the country, and two-thirds of the people think the economy has problems," said Mark J. Penn, who was President Bill Clinton's pollster and has signed on this time with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. "Politics is unpredictable. But these two numbers do suggest increasing vulnerability as time goes on."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said of President Bush after speaking to state Democratic leaders in Des Moines: "I have not talked to a person who doesn't think that he can't be beat. They really believe that."
White House aides sought to counter even those measured expressions of optimism. They noted Mr. Bush's high approval rating, close to 60 percent in some polls, and the likelihood that he might be leading the nation through a war at the very time that Democrats would be seeking to persuade Americans not to support him.
"Every president whose job approval going into the election was 50 or above won," said Matthew Dowd, the Republican strategist in charge of White House polling. "His job approval has to drop significantly in some way, so there has got to be some event or some situation that would cause the public to believe it was time for a change. The only thing I could think was if the economy continued to sputter."
Still, even some of Mr. Bush's allies expressed concern about a re-election campaign in such volatile times. The hopes for the Democrats are based almost entirely on dire turns of events beyond their control -- continued economic deterioration, complications with a war in Iraq, another domestic terrorist attack -- that are, as several Republicans said, anything but far-fetched. 
"I get the sinking feeling he's wading into the swamp these days," said one Republican presidential strategist. "Approval trending lower, lower numbers on winning against terrorism, market still stinks, highest unemployment in eight years. The Democratic nomination is certainly worth having." 
Hardly a day goes by before other Democrats -- like former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois -- announce that they too might run, turning this into the most crowded field since at least 1988. The candidates' aides in Washington, as well as Iowans here this weekend, were quick to note the lessons of 1992, when many potentially strong Democrats sat out a race against Mr. Bush's father because polls showed that he was extraordinarily popular after the Persian Gulf war. No one wants to make that mistake again.
But could a president as broadly popular as Mr. Bush really find himself facing a difficult re-election bid two years from now?
As Mr. Penn noted, polls show that Americans are concerned that the nation is heading in the wrong direction and are anxious about the economy, two trends that have proved to be early warning systems for incumbents in trouble. Two polls last week, one by USA Today and another by Time/CNN, found that voter approval of Mr. Bush, while still high, had slipped in the last few months.
Many of the Democrats seeking to challenge him are unknown to the White House and to much of the public. But if early appearances are any indication, a few of them -- Mr. Kerry and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina are the names mentioned most by Democrats -- could prove to be formidable challengers.
The president, some Democrats argued, may have made it easier for them to pull away moderates because of steps he has taken to solidify his standing with conservatives, like opposing the affirmative action programs at the University of Michigan and calling to end the dividend tax, which stirred celebration among some Democratic campaign aides.
"Everybody thinks Bush isn't beatable today," said David Loebsack, a professor of political science at Cornell College in Iowa and an organizer of the event on Saturday. "Wait two years. They are all jumping into this because they see an opportunity."
Mr. Bush's recent activities gave the Democrats plenty to talk about. 
"If you want someone to take care of your money, you better vote for a Democrat because a Republican can't manage money," Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, told about 50 people at Gwen's Coffee Shop. Dr. Dean received standing ovations in Linn County on Saturday as he attacked Mr. Bush on affirmative action and Iraq. 
All three candidates called for rollbacks of the Bush tax cut. Dr. Dean, followed by Mr. Gephardt, said the money should be used to provide universal health care coverage, while Mr. Kerry mockingly invoked the broken pledge against raising taxes made by Mr. Bush's father when he ran for president in 1988.
"I say, no new Bush tax cuts," said Mr. Kerry, who also drew repeated standing ovations in Linn County. "The country cannot afford it."
Even Republicans say the economy is an obvious potential concern for the White House, though they say two years is plenty of time for it to turn around.
"If I were on the domestic side of the White House, I would focus 100 percent on growth," said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. "The growth rate will decide who rules the country next year. The growth rate right now is marginal."
If history is any indication, Mr. Bush would certainly find his position strengthened should the nation go to war in Iraq. However, some Democrats argued that Mr. Bush could be hurt by a war if it did not go well, particularly given the signs of opposition to it at home.
An in-depth survey known as a deliberative poll, which questions people before and after they are given information on an issue, conducted nationwide last weekend found definite concerns about an Iraq war. James S. Fishkin, the poll director at the Center for Deliberative Polling at the University of Texas at Austin, said three out of four respondents opposed going into Iraq without United Nations support.
"If he goes in unilaterally, this will create very serious issues," he said.
And in Iowa, Bridget Janus, a retired newspaper librarian, said, "I have a feeling that when you start seeing body bags come home, people are not going to be 60 percent for the war anymore."
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said the Democrats had a difficult task ahead of them. But he recalled that in 1991, at the direction of Democratic leaders, he drafted a presidential campaign plan and presented it at a retreat of nearly every big-name Democrat considering a challenge to the President Bush.
"I gave this, if I do say so myself, very compelling case of why George Bush could be beaten," he said. But of all the Democrats present, only one decided to take on what seemed a nearly impossible challenge.
That was, of course, Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Sunday in Harlem: A Mayor With a Vision Speaks From the Pulpits 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg visited four churches in Harlem yesterday to sell his plan to overhaul the city's public school system, as well as to honor the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to speak directly to New Yorkers about his policies days after a poll showed that his approval rating had dropped sharply.
 The mayor received warm welcomes yesterday from pastors and congregants. At pulpit after pulpit, as Mr. Bloomberg detailed his plan to change public education in New York City, he was interrupted by encouraging shouts and prolonged applause. He received several standing ovations. 
 "I can't tell you how pleased I am with the reception," Mr. Bloomberg told the cheering congregation of Kelly Temple Church of God in Christ on East 130th Street. "If you read the newspapers, you think everybody hates you and you're doing everything wrong. But you come here and you say, it can't be that bad."
Mr. Bloomberg traveled from church to church, outlining the details of his plan to reorganize the school system around a centralized bureaucracy answering to him, to impose a uniform curriculum at all but the top-performing schools, and to appoint school-based ombudsmen at every school to answer the concerns of parents.
His main message was that education is a civil right -- a message he underscored on Wednesday, when he unveiled the education proposal during a symposium honoring Dr. King on his birthday, which is observed today. 
"The right to a good education is just as much a fundamental right as the right to vote and the right to be treated equally," Mr. Bloomberg said at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church on West 119th Street.
The back-to-back church visits were highly unusual for a mayor who spends many Sundays out of the public eye and rarely speaks at churches. The visits seemed intended to promote his education plan, which his administration sees as one of its most important mandates. And they were a prelude to his plans to celebrate Martin Luther King Day with a breakfast at City Hall and events across the city.
His appearances also came two days after publication of the results of a New York Times poll that found that 53 percent of New Yorkers disapprove of Mr. Bloomberg's handling of his job, while 31 percent approve. Those findings led some political consultants to suggest that the mayor needed to work harder at selling his policies, and himself, to average New Yorkers. 
Yesterday Mr. Bloomberg spoke with unusual passion and heat, punctuating his speeches with staccato bursts and letting his voice rise in near anger from time to time. "People say, well, you know, the economy isn't good, Mike, and the budget's got a big shortfall, our tax revenues aren't there," he said at Kelly Temple Church of God in Christ, in a brief speech that was interrupted by applause 10 times. "And, yes, we have to solve the budget problem. The law requires it, and it's my job to figure out ways to get more money coming in and to spend that money more wisely, keep crime coming down, and put shelter over the heads of the homeless, and all of those things." 
"But when people say 'Defer focusing on education,' that's what we've done every time in the past," he continued. "There's never been a good time to focus on our kids. I am telling you, that time is now. We cannot wait any longer. You should expect the mayor to do a good job, you should hold the mayor accountable, he is going to hold those down the chain accountable."
Two of his most popular proposals, judging by applause, were among the most basic: his pledge to make sure school books are delivered in time for the beginning of the school year, and his pledge to remove disruptive students from the classroom.
Later, at the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church on West 135th Street, the pastor, Rev. James E. F. Lawrence, told congregants: "It's my opinion that he's doing an outstanding job during difficult times. Scripturally, we would say he's trying to make brick without straw."

HEADLINE: PERSONAL HEALTH; 
Fact of Life: Condoms Can Keep Disease at Bay

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
Safe sex -- the proper and consistent use of condoms to protect against sexually transmitted diseases as well as unwanted pregnancies -- still seems to elude a large percentage of sexually active young adults.
 A newly published survey of 779 sexually active unmarried women 18 to 24 who were recent condom users revealed that in the previous three months 44 percent had waited too long for the condom to be applied. 
 The delay may have exposed them to viable sperm and infectious organisms, including H.I.V. And 19 percent reported that the condom slipped or broke in intercourse, placing them at risk of disease and pregnancy.
The study, conducted by Dr. Diane Civic, an epidemiologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, and her colleagues at the University of Washington and Duke University, involved women enrolled in two health maintenance centers run by Group Health. 
Carelessness in condom use was greatest among those for whom condoms were the main method of contraception, Dr. Civic said. An astonishing 59 percent of those women waited until after initial penetration to have the condom applied, exposing them to sperm and viruses in the pre-ejaculate fluids.
"Other studies suggest this is a common practice," Dr. Civic said in an interview. "We don't know if women don't understand the risk involved, or they're willing to take the risk."
Impediments to effective use of condoms abound, including embarrassment, not knowing how to approach the subject, lack of preparedness, unanticipated sexual involvement and concerns about insulting or alienating a partner.

Maximum Protection
Other studies also suggest that the problem of obtaining maximum protection from condom use is often compounded by inadequate knowledge about the way to apply and remove condoms properly and ways to minimize the risk of breakage and slippage.
Although boxes of condoms come with instructions (printed on the inside of the box for the economy pack of Trojans, for example), the individual packets do not and, anyway, few users are likely to read them in the heat of the moment.
Used properly and consistently, condoms are 97 percent to 98 percent effective in preventing pregnancy and provide the best possible protection, short of total abstinence from sexual activity, against sexually transmitted infections, including H.I.V. and the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer.
There are no guarantees, of course. But a study of 124 couples with only one H.I.V.-positive partner found that none of the uninfected partners acquired H.I.V. after using condoms correctly and consistently for an average of 20 months for vaginal or anal intercourse.
But in 10 percent of 121 couples who used condoms inconsistently and 15 percent who did not use them at all, the healthy partner became infected.
According to a report in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases, people who neglect to use condoms face risks of H.I.V. transmission that are 10,000 times as great as those who use latex condoms.
Yet many men and women still decline to use condoms when engaged in vaginal, anal or oral sex with partners who may have infections that even they are not aware of.
Latex condoms are most effective against disease. Those made from lambskin ("natural skin" or "natural membrane") have pores that can permit the passage of harmful viruses, including H.I.V. For people allergic to latex, there are condoms made from polyurethane that are thinner but stronger and less constricting. These condoms, however, have not yet been fully tested for preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
Siecus, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, cautions that to reduce the risk of damage even before condoms are used, be sure to store them in cool places out of direct sunlight (wallets and glove compartments are not good), and do not use condoms that have become brittle, discolored or sticky (check the expiration date).
Proper use starts, as the Trojan package states, prior to foreplay, "before the penis gets anywhere near any body opening." The condom package should be opened carefully and the condom handled gently. The condom should not be unrolled before applying it to the erect penis.
For men who are uncircumcised, the foreskin should be retracted before applying the condom. With the tip of the condom squeezed gently to prevent air from being trapped in the part that will catch the ejaculate, the condom is unrolled along the full length of the shaft of the penis.
If the condom does not unroll, it is on wrong. Throw it away and start again with a new one.
Condoms are already lubricated, but if additional lubrication is desired, it is essential to use only a water-based lubricant like saliva, K-Y Jelly or contraceptive jelly or cream.
Oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly, body lotion, baby oil, cooking oil and mineral oil cause rapid deterioration of latex condoms and greatly increase the risk of breakage. Mineral oil, a common ingredient of hand lotions and other lubricants, can cause a 90 percent decline in condom strength in as little as 60 seconds, laboratory tests have shown. Oil-based lubricants are safe only with polyurethane condoms.
Also, never use a male condom with a female condom; if the two rub together, the male condom may be pulled off the penis or the female condom pushed into the vagina. Although condom users concerned about preventing pregnancy and infection have been advised to use them along with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9, two recent studies have challenged this practice.
One study suggested that use of the spermicide might increase the risk of H.I.V. infection. The other showed no additional protection against sexually transmitted bacteria than is obtained from condoms alone.
To prevent leakage after ejaculation, the penis must be withdrawn immediately, while it is still erect. The rim of the condom should be held against the penis during withdrawal. The used condom should then be removed and discarded.
If a condom breaks during intercourse, the penis should be withdrawn immediately and a new condom put on. If a condom should break or leak in vaginal intercourse or withdrawal, the immediate application of a spermicide into the vagina can reduce the risk of pregnancy.
Condoms should never be reused. Each condom is good for only one ejaculation. If sexual activity is resumed, a new condom should be used.

What to Say
Couples intent on preventing sexually transmitted disease should not assume that even a committed or trusted partner is necessarily a safe partner. Yet, many have difficulty communicating their desire for condom protection. Research done as part of the Partners Project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked 90 young heterosexual couples what they would say. Most suggested discussing the matter beforehand and agreeing that "it is best for both of us" to use condoms.
Some would say that a friend had caught a disease, and they feared the same would happen to them. Others expressed a fear of pregnancy. But the most persuasive technique simply involved withholding sex unless a condom was used. As one young woman put it, "I would say, 'If you're not going to wear a condom, then we're not going to do it.' "

HEADLINE: Retooling Machine and Man For Next Big Chess Faceoff 

BYLINE:  By PAUL HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
In 1809 in Vienna, Napoleon played chess at Schonbrunn Castle against the Turk, a turbaned mannequin that was heralded as the world's first chess-playing automaton.
 Napoleon suspected that a human chess master was hidden inside, and he reportedly tried to interfere with the master's view of the board by wrapping a shawl around the Turk's head and torso. 
 But the blindfolded Turk still moved the chessmen quickly, in a jerky, mechanical fashion. Napoleon lost the game and angrily knocked the pieces to the floor. It took him several months to regain his concentration at the chessboard, and he continued to insist that the automaton was a fraud. (Indeed, it turned out to conceal a human.) 
In 1997, Garry Kasparov, the Russian grandmaster who was then the world champion, played a highly publicized match, billed "as the last stand of the brain," against the I.B.M. supercomputer Deep Blue. The 1.4-ton refrigerator-size machine was a calculating monster. Its 418 processors routinely chewed through 200 million chess positions a second.
Mr. Kasparov lost the six-game encounter by a single game, and although he never swept the chessmen from the board, he did let his emotions get the better of him. 
"The pressure got to me early," Mr. Kasparov recalled. "By the last game, I was in no condition to play chess or do much else." 
Like Napoleon, he suspected foul play. He contended that Deep Blue might have cheated, an assertion that I.B.M. denied, by obtaining advice from human experts during the games. Mr. Kasparov demanded a rematch, but I.B.M. refused and mothballed the machine.
Pundits joked that Deep Blue had turned Deep Yellow.
Now almost six years later, Mr. Kasparov, who is 39, has found an appropriate silicon stand-in for the I.B.M. machine.
On Sunday, he begins a six-game $1 million match against an Israeli program, Deep Junior, the three-time world computer chess champion.
The match is sponsored by the World Chess Federation.
"I'm delighted," Mr. Kasparov said, "that the important scientific experiment of pitting man's imagination and creativity against a machine's calculating power can continue under fair conditions."
The pioneers of computing thought that creating a machine that played top-flight chess would be simple. They regarded chess as a game of calculation, and calculation, of course, is what computers are good at.
In 1957, the mathematical economist and Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon predicted that a machine would become the world chess champion in a decade, and he was just the first in a long line of illustrious scientists whose forecasts about computer chess were notoriously wrong.
Cognitive psychologists discovered that grandmaster chess was more of a game of pattern recognition than calculation. But no programmer succeeded in codifying that more elusive ability into a set of rules that a machine could follow. 
The situation today is that both humans and machines can play world-class chess, but they approach the game completely differently.
Deep Junior typically examines three million positions per second. But even at that speed, it cannot generally see that far ahead.
That is because the number of possible chess positions is staggering. There are some 85 billion ways of playing just the first four moves for each side.
The strength of world-class human players lies in their ability to decide who stands better in a given position, and that ability -- general chess knowledge, if you will -- is hard to build into a machine. 
Mr. Kasparov concedes that he examines only one to three moves a second, but he suspects that they are the strongest ones. 
Humans are best at long-range strategic planning, where subtle, methodically executed maneuvers ultimately carry the day. Deep Junior excels in hand-to-hand combat, tactical dogfights in which brute computational strength prevails. 
"In the upcoming match, the contrasting styles promise exciting games," said Bruce Pandolfini, a chess master in New York.
The match will be played at the New York Athletic Club, and the games will be shown in real time on the Web at www.x3dworld.com and www.chessbase.com.
The play will start at 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 26, 28, and 30, and on Feb. 2, 5, and 7. Each game will last at most seven hours.
"Garry is the greatest human player ever," Mr. Pandolfini said. "He wants to restore man's supremacy in chess by thrashing the computer. And he wants to upstage Vladimir."
He was referring to Vladimir Kramnik, 27, his countryman and a former protege who ended Mr. Kasparov's 15-year reign as world champion in 2000.
Even though Mr. Kramnik now has the world crown, Mr. Kasparov is still ranked No. 1 on the chess federation rating list. He will not have a shot at winning the title back until November, at the earliest. 
"In the meantime, Garry will have to be content with trying to better Vladimir's accomplishments," said Alexander Baburin, editor of a daily Internet publication, Chess Today, at www.chesstoday.net/.
Three months ago, Mr. Kramnik split six games in a $1 million match of his own against a cousin of Deep Junior, Deep Fritz, a German program.
The match rules were drawn up to eliminate some of the perceived inequities of Mr. Kasparov's struggle with Deep Blue. Mr. Kasparov went into that contest without ever having seen a game played by his opponent (although he himself had beaten a slower and weaker incarnation of the computer in 1996). Deep Blue, on the other hand, was able to analyze hundreds of Mr. Kasparov's games.
Before Mr. Kramnik's match, Deep Fritz's handlers had to provide the world champion with a copy of the software and promise not to change it later. Experts say that requirement put the machine at a disadvantage. Human players, after all, are free to adjust their playing style any time they want. 
"It was a terrible thing," said Frederic Friedel, a co-founder of ChessBase in Hamburg, the manufacturer of Deep Fritz. "Kramnik had Fritz's brain in a bottle. He could figure out what Fritz would play in a given position."
Even so, although Mr. Kramnik won two games from the computer, he was unable to win the match. 
The organizers of Mr. Kasparov's contest with Deep Junior are trying to strike a balance between the computer-friendly conditions of the Deep Blue competition and the pro-human rules of the Deep Fritz match. 
"I've received a relatively fresh copy of the software," Mr. Kasparov said. "Although the programmers are allowed to tinker with it all they want, except when we are actually playing."
Who is favored to win? Mr. Friedel thinks that Mr. Kasparov will triumph as long as he keeps his cockiness in check. 
"Junior is a street brawler," Mr. Friedel said. "You remember 'West Side Story'? It's the Jets. It will be constantly taunting Garry. 'Do you want to fight with knives? Whips? Pistols? Machine guns? You choose the weapon.' If he knows what's best for him, he'll say, 'Let's stay in the ring and keep these big soft gloves on.'
"But it's not his nature to duck a challenge. My advice to Garry is to stay focused and get a lot of rest. The machine will never tire or fret over a loss." 
One issue that the match will not resolve is whether Deep Junior plays better chess than Deep Blue.
"Deep Blue's victory over Kasparov was a milestone in artificial intelligence," Mr. Friedel said. "But it's a crime that I.B.M. didn't let it play again. It's like going to the moon and returning home without looking around." 
Although Deep Junior, which is planned to run on eight processors, is much slower than the I.B.M. computer, experts said it had more chess knowledge built into it. It apparently considers more elements in judging a position.
"Junior is very humanlike," Mr. Kasparov said. "It's a computer version of me. It plays forcefully, imaginatively and takes risks."
Deep Junior is a program, rather than a custom-made chess-playing machine like Deep Blue. A single-processor version of it can be purchased for less than $50 and run on a PC. 
"The match will be close, but I'm determined to win," Mr. Kasparov said. "One thing I know is that humans' days at the top of the chess world are limited. I give us just a few years." 
"The only sure way to defeat a computer," Mr. Baburin said, "will be to cut its power source."

F6) Chart/Diagrams: "When the Computer Is a Chess Master"Humans and machines alike can play world-class chess, but they approach the game differently. Below, some strategies employed in matches with Deep Fritz, a German computer program. PAUL HOFFMAN ADVANTAGE: SILICONComputers excel in tactical dogfights, and are unlikely to make mistakes. Vladimir Kramnik, the current world champion, was playing Black in the fifth game of his match with Deep Fritz, and after the computer's 33rd move found his knight under attack from White's queen. The human grandmaster responded by moving his queen to attack White's knight and queen. He reasoned that if White's queen then captured his knight, he could retaliate by taking the machine's knight. But this counterattack was the worst blunder of his career. Mr. Kramnik had failed to consider a crushing intermezzo, or in-between move: before Deep Fritz captures Black's knight, the machine spirits its own knight to safety by checking Black's king. Mr. Kramnik immediately resigned. A computer would never overlook a one-move combination. ADVANTAGE: HUMANHuman players are much better than machines at long-range planning. Mr. Kramnik had White against Deep Fritz in the second game of their match. After 35 moves, his rook was dominantly placed; it was threatening the central pawn as well as tying Black's rook to the passive defense of the flank pawn. How should Black respond? Deep Fritz defended his central pawn -- the wrong decision. Strong human players know, even without calculating, that such a passive defense usually loses in the end. Instead, Fritz's best try for survival was to leave the central pawn undefended and immediately activate the rook from the corner. Then, if White's rook captures one of the pawns, Black can put up more of a fight by shifting his own rook to the second rank in the heart of White's position. OUTTHINKING THE COMPUTERHuman players have learned how to fight against machines. One idea is to orchestrate a quick exchange of queens, depriving the computer of its strongest attacking piece. In Mr. Kramnik's second game against Deep Fritz, he was pleased to get the ladies off the board as early as his ninth move as White. Another strategy is to use one's pawns to close the machine's possible lines of attack. Boris Alterman, an Israeli grandmaster, carried this strategy to an extreme in a game against Deep Fritz. He was White, and he built up a picturesque wall of pawns on the fourth rank. (pg. F6)

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
A Few Airlines Remain Finicky About Food

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
SIX miles above the frozen Great Plains, at about 1 p.m. on Sunday, I began to admire the Braided Pretzels as I fetched them hungrily one at a time from their half-ounce foil packet.
 I mean really admire them in their buttery, crunchy, salty magnificence. This was on a Northwest Airlines flight, on the second leg of a trip to Phoenix with connections in Detroit and Minneapolis. Since I got up at 6 a.m. to rush to the airport, I hadn't had anything to eat but the wonderful half-ounce bag of pretzels. Obviously, delirium was setting in. 
 Backwards reeled the mind. Could it have been only a few days earlier that I was standing appraisingly at a long white-clothed banquet table tastefully arranged with china-dish displays of the fanciest airline food: chilled malossol caviar, medallions of marinated lobster, beef filet mignon with buttered carrots, herb-crusted Chilean sea bass, roasted lamb in tapenade jus?
That lavish repast -- for inspection, not wholesale consumption -- was set out in a utilitarian dining room beside the bustling kitchens of the Flying Food Group, which prepares meals for Singapore Airlines at a plant in the congested industrial service district bordering the marshes beside Kennedy International Airport in New York.
In surveys of business-traveler preferences, Singapore usually ranks at or near the top in assessments of its food on international flights. Not for nothing, then, is Singapore emphasizing its commitment to in-flight dining, at a time when many domestic airlines have eliminated or sharply curtailed food service or, in a growing trend, have started having their flight attendants actually peddle packaged meals off a cart in the aisle.
In a white lab coat, Hermann Freidanck, Singapore's manager of food and beverage services, was moving deliberately from dish to dish, inspecting the caterer's presentation of various menu items being planned for Singapore's spring schedule of flights between New York and Frankfurt. 
He rolled his eyes in disdain at the idea of selling sandwiches off a cart. Decent food, Mr. Freidanck swore, ought to be carefully maintained as a component of air travel, especially on long flights, which is where airlines are engaged in their most intense competition for business passengers who pay the highest fares.
"There is not much difference in price between a bad roll and a good roll," he said. "In my opinion, food is still one of the main ways to differentiate between airlines that otherwise all get you from Point A to Point B. Food remains one of the major potential sources of customer dissatisfaction, too. No one complains about the brand of fuel you're using, but with food, everybody's got an opinion."
Let's stipulate here, by the way, that haute cuisine in the air comes at a price, and it is both unfair and pointless to condemn domestic airlines -- which are losing money with every plane they send up, with fares that are on average the lowest they've been in a generation -- for not serving meals the way they did in the good old days. Last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City set an apropos tone to this topic when he told business and cultural leaders that New York isn't a cheap ticket but rather a luxury product that delivers quality at a price.
But all of the publicity in the last year about domestic airlines' deteriorating food service, even in first- and business-class cabins, has opened up marketing opportunities for competitors. So a good number of foreign airlines -- Japan Air Lines, British Air, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Swiss Air, Air Jamaica and others are examples besides Singapore -- have lately been overtly stressing that idea in their pitches for the higher end of the international business travel market emanating from the United States.
Singapore, which has increased its overall capacity by about 15 percent in the last two months as growth in Asian destinations lifts a small rebound in international travel, is determined to hold the line on food, Mr. Freidanck insisted as he critically inspected and tasted dozens of dishes for first-, business- and economy- class menu dishes while the caterer's chefs and production chiefs scribbled notes on clipboards.
"We are now actually spending more on food than we did before 9/11," Mr. Freidanck said.
Singapore food executives make these inspections and menu selections quarterly at airline caterers around the world. "Once Hermann passes on the dish, we take a picture of it so that our production crews and ultimately the onboard flight attendants will see exactly how it's supposed to look," said Bob Y. Sun, vice president for sales at Flying Food.
Mr. Freidanck worked his way along the tables, dipping a spoon into some broth and stopping to scowl at the way some food was arranged on a plate. Flying Food chefs scurried back into the kitchen to fix the presentation to the inspector's liking. The whole process typically takes four hours or more before all of the dishes are evaluated. No one eats anything until the inspection is done. David Burke, the executive chef at the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group and a consultant for Singapore who devises the menus worldwide, confided that he was feeling a little peckish as he surreptitiously swiped a chocolate bon-bon off a dessert plate.
"Hey, I once flew about 20 hours straight for a meeting in Singapore," Mr. Burke said. "After a certain point, all you have to look forward to is food."

On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail:jsharkey@nytimes.com.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: TERROR SUSPECTS; 
Mosque Raid in London Results in 7 Arrests in Connection With Discovery of Poison

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The police today stormed a London mosque that has been widely depicted as a recruiting ground for violent Islamic radicals, and arrested seven people on charges related to the discovery of the deadly poison ricin in a London house earlier this month.
 Acting a day after the government promised a toughened antiterror policy in light of the killing of a police officer in Manchester, 150 policemen in riot gear broke into the Finsbury Park mosque with battering rams and ladders in a surprise 2 a.m. raid while helicopters circled, bathing the building in floodlight. 
 The police said the arrests were linked to the arrests of four Algerians two weeks ago on chemical weapons and terror charges after the North London apartment where they were captured was found to contain small amounts of ricin.
No chemicals were found on the premises today, the police said, and they removed a stun gun, an imitation revolver and a canister of tear gas along with a large quantity of computer files and documents including passports, identity cards and credit cards. 
The police identified the arrested men only as six North Africans ages 48, 40, 38, 31, 28 and 23, and one Eastern European who is 22. They were living in residences within the main building and in two adjacent ones, and the police said officers did not enter any spaces devoted to worship.
"The Metropolitan Police Service is aware of the sensitivity of such an operation, but evidence gathered during recent counterterrorist investigations in London and elsewhere has uncovered links between the premises and suspected terrorist activity," said Andy Trotter, the deputy assistant commissioner.
He said at a Scotland Yard news conference that officers had been advised in the planning of this morning's action by Muslim members of the force. They wore nylon covers on their shoes and avoided going into parts of the mosque used for prayer, he said. "We only entered office space and accommodation areas," he said.
The mosque is the base of Britain's most outspoken radical cleric, Abu Hamza al-Masri, 45, an Egyptian-born imam who has one eye and wears a hook where a hand was blown off by a land mine in Afghanistan 20 years ago.
Mr. Masri, who is wanted in Yemen on terrorism charges, supports Osama bin Laden, praises the Sept. 11 hijackers as martyrs, calls Prime Minister Tony Blair a "legitimate target" for Muslim warriors and encourages unemployed young Muslims in London to join in what he calls the holy war against the West.
He was not among the arrested and said he learned of the raid only when he switched on his cellphone at 7 a.m., five hours after the police entered the mosque. He said the raid was part of the "Rambo-like" tactics that the police were using in Mr. Blair's "war on Islam."
Among the people who worshiped at the mosque were Zacarias Moussaoui, the French citizen of Moroccan descent who was arrested in Minneapolis and faces conspiracy charges in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, and Richard C. Reid, the Briton who pleaded guilty in Octoberin Boston to having tried to blow up a Miami-bound jetliner en route from Paris in December 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes. 
Muslim groups, even those who had deplored Mr. Masri and his use of the Finsbury Park mosque to promote violence and hatred of the West, spoke out today against the police action. Muhammad Sekkoum, a spokesman for the Algerian Refugee Council, said he had stopped attending the mosque because "I don't agree with all the hatred and the war." But he added, "It is a mistake to trespass in a mosque."
Omar Bakri Mohamed, Syrian-born leader of the radical London-based group Al Muhajiroun, said the raid would serve to increase recruitment. "If they arrest us," he said, "we will become martyrs."
The authorities have stepped up their warnings that Britain is a likely target of terrorism, and Sir John Stevens, head of the Metropolitan Police, said over the weekend that operatives in Britain of established groups from North Africa were linked to Al Qaeda. Britain has arrested more than 200 suspects under new antiterror laws since the Sept. 11 attacks. Most of the suspects have North African and particularly Algerian heritage.
Britain has proved to be fertile ground for Islamic militants because of its diverse population and relatively tolerant admissions policy, as well as London's place as a global transportation hub and Europe's biggest financial center.
Home Secretary David Blunkett said the mosque raid today had his full support, adding, "We must take firm action to investigate, and, if necessary, deal with any potential threat to public safety without fear or favor."
A spokesman for Mr. Blair denied the "war on Islam" accusation, saying, "The Islamic religion has been hijacked by a small group of fanatics who seek to distort it and twist it for their own terrorist ends."
Asked why the police moved now, when the reputation of the mosque as a center of radical activities had been known for so long, Mr. Trotter said they were acting on new information arising out of the ricin arrests on Jan. 5 and the raid in Manchester last Tuesday that resulted in the stabbing death of Stephen Oake, a police officer.
Kamel Bourgass, 27, a North African, was charged in a London court on Friday with Mr. Oake's murder, and today a Libyan who was arrested in the Manchester apartment, Khalid Alwerfeli, was ordered held until a new hearing next week on two counts of possessing materials connected with the preparation, commission or instigation of terrorist acts.
Mr. Trotter said, "It was also necessary to go in this morning to secure information and documents to make sure we didn't lose any evidence or lose any individuals by waiting." He said that the officers who entered the building were wearing body armor but that the only armed police officers were those held back in reserve.

2 Carriers Expand Code-Sharing Alliance
 Starting this week, US Airways customers get access to 188 United Airlines flight segments through Denver to destinations in the West and Southwest under the latest phase of the code-sharing marketing pact between US Air and United, both of which are in bankruptcy reorganization proceedings. United passengers get access to 79 new flight segments on US Air's schedule, mostly in the East. More code-share flights are planned, the airlines said. 
 Code-share alliances allow airlines to write tickets on each other's flights and to give customers the option of accruing frequent-flier miles on any member carrier.
United and US Air are going beyond the traditional boundaries of such alliances in recognizing each other's elite-status fliers for upgrades. Starting March 1, the two carriers said, United Mileage Plus Premier members and US Airways Dividend Miles Preferred members will have their elite status recognized when flying on either of the two carriers. Beginning April 1, members of each program will have the ability to redeem awards on itineraries that are partly or totally operated by the other airline.

Struggling Airlines Worry About War
 Airlines are deeply worried about even more financial devastation at the onset of a possible war in Iraq, with an anticipated severe drop in air travel and soaring fuel prices.
"We've been pretty vocal saying that our government needs to have a transportation plan if they do go to war," the chief executive of Continental Airlines, Gordon Bethune, told Wall Street analysts in a conference call last week.
In a "protracted war," suggested Mr. Bethune, "rather than cancel service, to try to maintain our livelihood we would try to coordinate amongst ourselves: who would go to what cities, try to make some sense out of it instead of just deserting cities or needlessly beating each other up in the same cities."

New Measures On Boarding Passes
 Many business travelers like to get through security and obtain their boarding passes in airline lounges or at the gate, but this is becoming more difficult to do under new federal security guidelines. As of last week, the Transportation Security Administration said, passengers at 84 airports are required to obtain boarding passes before going through security checkpoints. Ticket counters, self-service kiosks and skycap check-in counters all issue boarding passes, and some airlines also allow passengers to print them off their Web sites before coming to the airport. All airports are expected to be included sometime this year in the new measures. The agency Web site, www.tsa.gov, has a list of the airports currently included.

Convention Business Continues to Slump
 The corporate meetings and convention business, a $102 billion annual business worldwide, was hit hard by the terrorist attacks and a sour economy. And it isn't poised for a solid rebound yet, according to an industry survey to be released tomorrow by Meeting Professionals International, a trade group, and American Express.
Corporate meeting planners in North America and Europe project an average 1.1 percent decrease in spending on such events this year over 2002, though the actual number of such events will increase slightly, the survey shows. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: OPEC's Odd Position: Complaining of High Oil Prices 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER, International Herald Tribune 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The surge in oil prices caused by a loss of production at a leading exporter and the possibility of an American-led attack on another has created a rare spectacle: the president of OPEC, a cartel once feared for its ability to control prices, publicly complaining that current levels are too high.
 Those were the straits into which Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was forced last week as oil prices hovered at two-year highs. 
 Only days before, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna had agreed to step up production in an unsuccessful effort to keep prices from rising further, after antigovernment strikes in Venezuela had virtually halted exports from that country and the threat of war in Iraq had raised the prospect of shortages.
Though the 10 OPEC members -- 11 counting Iraq, whose production is monitored by the United Nations -- still pump a third of the world's oil, their power is a far cry from the 1970's, when an oil embargo sent the global economy into recession. After oil prices fell into single digits in 1998 and 1999, OPEC managed to engineer an increase, but only when it acted in concert with several nonmember countries. Getting prices to fall has proved more difficult. 
In part that is because other producers have stepped up output and exports, reducing OPEC's market share. The group still has a virtual monopoly on spare capacity. While demand for oil has risen slowly during a global economic downturn, that capacity is not enough to deal with the unexpected overlap of production losses in Venezuela and, possibly, Iraq. OPEC's response in Vienna, colored by internal politics, failed to send the clear message that the market needed to bring a cap on prices.
"The oil business is feast or famine," said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consultancy in New York. "They are trying to wrestle with a beast that's very hard to get your arms around."
Mr. Ross said OPEC deserved credit for keeping prices within a range of $22 to $28 a barrel for about two-thirds of the time since March 2000, when ministers decided that level would balance their needs for revenue with those of a global economy hungry for affordable oil. OPEC was concerned that if the price strayed stubbornly above that range, it could affect long-term demand, as importers would turn to non-OPEC producers, invest in developing their own supplies and seek alternative energy sources.
As strikes against the government of President Hugo Chavez turned off the taps on Venezuela's nearly three million barrels a day of oil output in December, analysts say Saudi Arabia, in particular, has been keen to show its good intentions. Stung by anti-Saudi sentiment in the United States in the wake of the terrorist attacks, Saudi Arabia has sought to reassure the market that it stands ready to make up the shortfall.
"They have made a virtue out of necessity," said Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum trading desk at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. "If they put more oil on the market they can wrap themselves in the mantle of global citizen."
But the agreement reached in Vienna, in an emergency meeting called at the request of the Saudis, left unclear how much oil would actually reach the market, and when. Instead of simply announcing a temporary increase in production quotas for those countries most capable of closing the gap -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- OPEC came up with a political solution. 
In an effort to ease Venezuela's fears of losing market share, the group raised the quotas for all members on a proportional basis, including Venezuela, which is pumping only a fraction of the oil allowed under its old, smaller allotment of 2.65 million barrels a day.
"The actual amount of what you are getting from the OPEC decision is so much less than what they are saying," Mr. Ross said. OPEC raised its overall production quota to 24.5 million barrels a day, from 23 million, as of Feb. 1, but analysts say production will probably fall short by at least one million barrels.
Since the meeting, Saudi Arabia has said it will produce as much as nine million barrels a day by February, a million more than even the new quota prescribes, in an effort to keep the markets supplied. But that oil takes six weeks to reach American ports, rather than the one-week trip for Venezuelan shipments.
As talk of war in Iraq heats up, oil buyers are eager to lock in supplies, even at the current high prices. In London on Monday, the price of Brent crude for March delivery rose 11 cents, to $30.65 a barrel.
"Oil prices at the moment are not determined by fundamental supply and demand but by psychology," said Axel Bush at the Energy Intelligence Group in London.

Foreign Markets Decline on Concern Over Iraq and Economy

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Markets overseas slid lower yesterday as fears about war and downbeat corporate outlooks for companies like Royal Dutch/Shell raised investor concerns about a stumbling economy in the months ahead.
 Analysts said technology stocks in particular were hurt after Wall Street's sharp decline on Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 111 points on cautious outlooks from Microsoft and I.B.M. 
 In Toronto, financial stocks led other shares down yesterday amid a lackluster session as the New York exchanges were closed for the Martin Luther King's Birthday holiday. 
Markets in the United States will reopen today.
The Toronto Stock Exchange composite index declined 15.55 points to close at 6,740.37.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei stock average fell 131.43 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 8,558.82. That came after the Nikkei rose 81.08 points, or 0.94 percent, on Friday. Analysts said Asian traders took their cue from Wall Street's pessimism, driving down technology companies like Hitachi, NEC and Fujitsu. Shares of Sony and Japan's largest mobile telephone company, NTT DoCoMo, also declined. 
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 62.57 points, or 0.7 percent, finishing at 9,552.02. Singapore shares closed lower after heavy selling in technology stocks. The Straits Times index fell 3.64 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,363.19. 
In Europe, stocks fell after J. P. Morgan lowered its earnings estimate for Royal Dutch/Shell. A weak outlook from Infineon, one of Europe's biggest chip makers, also helped push shares lower. 
Analysts said investors were avoiding major commitments to stocks, particularly before Jan. 27, when United Nations officials are scheduled to report the status of arms inspections in Iraq. The assessment will probably play a major role in determining whether tensions are resolved peacefully.
"Markets will need plenty of good earnings news this week if equities are to hold current levels," a Nomura Securities analyst, Anais Faraj, said in a note published yesterday. 
The FTSE 100 index in Britain dropped 42 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,778.60. 
In Paris, the CAC 40 index fell 36.86 points, or 1.2 percent, to 3,020.07, on concerns about the threat of war in Iraq. In Germany, the Xetra DAX declined 25.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,893.55, pushed lower by banking and insurance stocks.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: UNITED NATIONS; 
Diplomacy Should Resolve Korean Crisis, Powell Says

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, stepping up American pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, called on the International Atomic Energy Agency today to refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council to decide "what it wishes to do."
 But Bush administration officials said the United States was still not contemplating any request to impose sanctions of any kind against North Korea. 
 After a morning of meetings with foreign ministers from the nations in the Security Council, where the main topic of discussion was Iraq and terrorism, Mr. Powell repeated the administration's position that the crisis over North Korea's nuclear programs must be resolved peacefully. 
His comments were consistent with the view expressed by many administration officials that with the situation in Iraq facing the United Nations as an urgent priority, this is not a time for Washington to press for action against North Korea. North Korea has threatened war if sanctions are imposed.
"We are pursuing diplomatic approaches to the solution of this problem," Mr. Powell told reporters after the morning meetings here, adding that "some interesting elements" had emerged recently in the effort to engage with North Korea.
He did not specify what those elements might be, but diplomats have noted that in the last few days there has been some tempering of threatening language from North Korea as American officials have more explicitly stated that economic cooperation would be forthcoming if a diplomatic resolution was reached to end the North's nuclear programs.
The most recent conciliatory comment from the North came over the weekend from its ambassador to China, Choe Jin Su, who told a Japanese news agency that his country favored a "genuine dialogue," in which "both parties' concerns are simultaneously addressed."
He criticized the American approach until now as a position of "first abandon the nuclear program and then we'll hold talks."
Mr. Powell's statement about going to the Security Council was the most recent permutation of positions by the Bush administration since the current confrontation began in October with the disclosure that North Korea had a program to enrich uranium for possible use in the production of nuclear weapons.
In the first weeks, the United States took a hard line, persuading its allies to cut off oil shipments to North Korea that were part of the 1994 accord in which it agreed to shut down activity at a nuclear plant in Yongbyon that was producing bomb-grade plutonium.
Then Washington, under pressure from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan, said no further penalties would be proposed.
Last month administration officials said they wanted to refer the matter to the Security Council. But when the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency met in Vienna earlier in January and declined to refer it to the Council, the administration retreated from that position and praised the agency for giving North Korea one more chance.
The United States said this week that the issue should go to the Security Council, but administration officials said they were ruling out sanctions. An administration official said over the weekend that United States would proceed "methodically and deliberately" to get the issue before the Council.
There was no sign that the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors would make a decision anytime soon. An agency spokesman said here today that no date had been set for the board's next meeting.
China has been the main country opposing the effort to take North Korea's nuclear program to the Security Council, fearing that doing so could lead inexorably to the imposition of sanctions. China strongly opposes increased pressure, arguing that attempts to isolate the North's government can only backfire and stiffen its resistance.
Today China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, repeated his country's call for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and for "direct dialogue" between North Korea and the United States to resolve the matter peacefully. 
"This is a very precious experience we have drawn from our past dealings with the situation in the past decades -- several decades," Mr. Tang said.
Mr. Powell, in his meeting with reporters, repeated the American position that "we have no intention of invading or attacking" North Korea, but he made what seemed to be a slip when he said there was no intention of "invading or attacking Iraq." 
The official transcript made it clear which country he was referring to, though there was little doubt -- the United States has been threatening Iraq with force for months.

HEADLINE: A Touch Of Class 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A liberal and a conservative were sitting in a bar. Then Bill Gates walked in. "Hey, we're rich!" shouted the conservative. "The average person in this bar is now worth more than a billion!" "That's silly," replied the liberal. "Bill Gates raises the average, but that doesn't make you or me any richer." "Hah!" said the conservative, "I see you're still practicing the discredited politics of class warfare."
 Am I caricaturing the debate? Alas, not at all. Whenever anyone points out the systematic tilt of the Bush administration toward the rich, the administration and its defenders immediately raise the cry of "class warfare." Yet when you look at the arguments the administration actually makes on behalf of its policy, they are as silly as that of the conservative in the bar. The difference is that the administration knows exactly what it's doing. 
 For example: On Saturday, in his weekly radio address, George W. Bush declared that "the tax relief I propose will give 23 million small-business owners an average tax cut of $2,042 this year." That remark is intended to give the impression that the typical small-business owner will get $2,000. But as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, most small businesses will get a tax break of less than $500; about 5 million of those 23 million small businesses will get no break at all. The average is more than $2,000 only because a small number of very wealthy businessmen will get huge tax cuts.
So the latest round of Bush tax cuts, like the previous round, mainly provides benefits to the very, very well off -- and once again the administration is shamelessly misrepresenting the content of its own policies. But aside from the honor and integrity thing, should we care? 
There's been a concerted effort to convince us that we shouldn't -- that anyone who even pays attention to who gets what must be motivated by envy. Consider a recent cover of Business Week. Under the headline "Class Warfare," it asked: "Suppose Bush's tax plan works: It raises long-term growth, reduces unemployment, boosts workers' wages, and eventually cuts a rising deficit. . . . Now suppose the rich get richer, and income inequality gets worse. Time to vote."
As Superman used to say, "What th'?" Does Business Week really think that's the argument -- that opponents of the Bush plan agree that it will do great things for the economy, that the increase in inequality it will cause is their only objection? In fact, those who oppose the Bush plan think it will work no better than the 2001 tax cut: that it will do little for growth or employment, and will sharply raise the deficit. (These guys now have a track record, and it's not encouraging. In the year and a half since that tax cut, which was sold as the perfect economic stimulus, the economy has lost 1.4 million jobs.)
Meanwhile, let's look at what the administration isn't doing. It's not allocating enough money to meet its own goals for homeland security, or to provide adequate funding for Medicare. It has scaled back promised pay increases for the military. It's not providing a penny in aid to desperate state governments -- it isn't even helping them meet the new burden of homeland security spending mandated from Washington. (Remember those promises, after Sept. 11, of aid to fire departments and police? That was then.)
And bear in mind that the budget deficits of state and local governments are forcing cuts in medical care for the poor and public services for everyone. Many states, even those with Republican governors, will be forced to raise taxes too -- but the burden of those increases will fall on the middle class, not the rich.
The only beneficiaries of the latest Bush plan will be those who receive tax cuts big enough to offset all these negatives. Those beneficiaries are the usual suspects -- the same small, wealthy minority that got the big benefits from the last tax cut. Does pointing this out constitute class warfare?
The administration and its defenders will, of course, insist that it does -- because that charge helps confuse the public about what's really going on. But for the record: When people like me stress how few Americans will gain from the Bush plan, we're not talking about envy; we're talking about priorities.

HEADLINE: China Arrests North Koreans Headed for the South and Japan 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The Chinese police arrested more than 60 North Koreans in China on Friday and Saturday as they were preparing to board two fishing boats purchased to smuggle them to freedom in Japan and South Korea, human rights workers and activists said today.
 The boats were to have been used in the first in a series of illegal boat crossings organized and financed by human rights activists, who want to help North Koreans escape their impoverished homeland. 
 The activists see the refugee crossings as dramatic events that can vividly illustrate what they call the repression and suffering in North Korea.
In the past the activists have helped groups of North Koreans storm into foreign embassies in Beijing, where they have obtained political asylum. Inevitably those dramas play out with television cameras rolling. 
"We are trying to create more solidarity with these people," said the Rev. Douglas Shin, a Los Angeles-based pastor who has worked with North Korean refugees for years. "And we almost succeeded. Nothing really bad happened. Next time will know how to do it better."
The two 20-ton Chinese fishing vessels were purchased and outfitted for $5,000 each by a consortium of seven foreign private organizations, representing four countries, Mr. Shin said. 
They were to have departed on Saturday from the Chinese port of Yantai; by Friday, 48 North Koreans were assembled at safe houses there in preparation.
One boat was to have set a course for Cheju, an island belonging to South Korea, where Chinese fishing boats frequently drop anchor without proper documentation, Mr. Shin said. The second was to have headed for Sasebo, a Japanese island that is home to a large United States military base -- a destination Mr. Shin called "a symbolic gesture to make this an international issue."
Northeastern China has a large ethnic Korean population, allowing North Koreans who have illegally sneaked over the border into China to blend in with relative ease. Indeed, the entire group took the public ferries to Yantai in the days before.
But on Friday night, the Chinese police began raiding the safe houses and arresting the North Koreans, apparently tipped off by a Chinese informant who had helped the group, Mr. Shin said.
As of today there were 48 North Koreans in detention in Yantai, including families with women and children, according to Doctors Without Borders-Korea, one of the organizations that assisted the refugees. 
It said three foreigners who were accompanying the North Koreans were also arrested, including Jae Hyun Seok, a South Korean freelance photographer who regularly works for The New York Times.
Reached by telephone, an official from the Yantai Public Security Bureau denied any knowledge of the arrests.
"The case of this group of 48 North Koreans is most revealing," said a statement released today by Doctors Without Borders. "It unveils the distress of the North Korean refugee population in China and the urgent need to provide them assistance."
Mr. Shin said a further 13 North Koreans who had planned to be on the boats had been arrested before they got to Yantai, in the border province of Jilin. 
He said that at least some of them had been turned over to the North Korean authorities.
In the last five years, hundreds of thousands of North Koreans have fled illegally over the border into China. They come to escape the severe food shortages that have plagued their homeland for nearly a decade, but increasingly they come for a taste of relative freedom as well. 
While some stay just long enough to collect provisions, others live in China for years, performing low-wage jobs, learning Chinese and blending into the large ethnic Korean population in the border area.
But as their numbers have risen, many refugees have come to live in fear of Chinese police raids aimed at ferreting them out and repatriating them. 
Such raids have increased since last year, when groups of North Koreans started storming foreign embassies in Beijing, embarrassing the Chinese.
The number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has nearly doubled annually in recent years, to about 1,000 in 2002. More than 100 of those arrived via embassies in China, but a larger number were smuggled in, some by stowing away on boats or by paying smugglers.
China says the North Korean are economic migrants who should be sent home. 
But rights groups insist that they are political refugees who deserve asylum, since they are often interrogated and arrested once they are back in North Korea. Those who have fled repeatedly or have had contact with foreigners may face severe punishment, even death, the rights groups say.

HEADLINE: Ex-President Of Serbia Surrenders To Tribunal 

BYLINE:  By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The former Serbian President, Milan Milutinovic, surrendered today to the United Nations tribunal, which has charged him with crimes against humanity related to the 1999 conflict in Kosovo.
 He was the last ally of Slobodan Milosevic to hold high office and had enjoyed immunity from prosecution until he stepped down in December. 
 Mr. Milutinovic, who became Serbia's president in 1997, arrived here on a special plane provided by the Yugoslav government. Belgrade has been lobbying on his behalf for special concessions, like release on bail until his trial begins. 
He was meeting today with the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, but no details were immediately forthcoming on the conditions of his surrender. When Mr. Milutinovic appears in court on Wednesday, tribunal judges will probably decide if he can return to Belgrade pending trial. His health may be a factor: the Serbian politician has already had heart surgery and is said to require medical supervision.
For now, Mr. Milutinovic, 60, is being held at the same United Nations prison here as his one-time patron, Mr. Milosevic, the former Yugoslavian president. 
Mr. Milosevic also has a heart condition, and tribunal officials said today that his trial remained suspended while he fought another bout of flu. Mr. Milosevic's high blood pressure and heart disease make him prone to infections and fatigue, according to one of his legal assistants. Hearings last year were repeatedly interrupted by Mr. Milosevic's health problems, prolonging already lengthy proceedings.
It was not clear whether Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Milutinovic are allowed to meet in the three-story United Nations jail here, where Serbs, Croats and Bosnians often mingle. Although Mr. Milutinovic was a member of the Milosevic inner circle, he was widely regarded as a figurehead who attended meetings but seldom involved himself in decision making or operations. 
As the head of the Serbian delegation to talks with the Kosovar Albanians at Rambouillet in February 1999, before NATO bombed Yugoslavia, Mr. Milutinovic bore the brunt of Western efforts to force Mr. Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. But he was unwilling, and probably unable, to persuade Mr. Milosevic to back down. He ended his speech at the summit with the words: "Que sera sera."
He hopes to fashion his defense around his reputation for disengagement in government affairs, and has denied the prosecution's charges of crimes against humanity, including deportation, murder and persecution. During the Serbian crackdown of the late 1990's, which Belgrade said was necessary to maintain control over its province of Kosovo, some 800,000 ethnic Albanians fled Serbian police and military violence and hundreds were killed.
This week, the Belgrade government has made much of its cooperation with the tribunal by helping ensure the arrival of Mr. Milutinovic here. But this may be as much a signal to Washington as it is a good-will gesture. The United States has said Yugoslavia risks losing economic assistance after March 31 if it does not arrest war crimes suspects and cooperate with the tribunal. But Belgrade has not yet detained others indicted by the tribunal, including the former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic, who is often seen in Belgrade. The former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, has also been seen in Yugoslavia, but he reportedly spends most of his time in hiding in eastern Bosnia.

Fiat, Trying to Cut Debt, Weighs Spinoff of Car Unit
The chairman of Fiat, Paolo Fresco, left, said that the company was considering plans to split off its automobile division and raise the cash needed to restore it to profitability. Mr. Fresco said the goal of the spinoff would be to "recapitalize our core businesses, starting with Fiat Auto, but not only Fiat Auto."
 Mr. Fresco has been trying to sell assets to ease Fiat's financial troubles. Recent divestitures enabled Fiat to pay down its net debt below $3.2 billion. Sharp reductions in debt were a condition set by creditors. Page C2.

Lawmakers Pressure Bank of Japan
The failure of the Bank of Japan to halt deflation -- after having kept short-term interest rates effectively at zero for more than four years -- has turned into a political battleground. Japanese lawmakers are prodding the central bank to find a way to do even more to stimulate the sagging economy. C11.

Ontario Halts Sale of Utility Stake
All but putting an end to a deregulated electricity market in Canada's industrial heartland, the government of Ontario said that it would not sell a stake in Hydro One. Less than a year ago, the government said that it intended to spin off the utility. C10.

Pemex Faces Troubles of Its Own
For more than 60 years, Pemex has been Mexico's economic lifeblood. It controls every gas pump in Mexico, and it sells nearly as much oil to the United States as Saudi Arabia does. Today, with some oil producers like Iraq and Venezuela facing crises, Mexico looks like a steady source of oil that the United States may be tempted to rely on even more. But the oil company is in danger of breaking down. A1.

The surge in oil prices caused by a loss of production in Venezuela and the possibility of an American-led attack on Iraq has created a rare spectacle: the president of OPEC complaining that oil prices are too high. C13.

Oil Terminal in Latvia Lacks Oil
What little oil has been reaching Ventspils, Latvia, from Russia in recent weeks has come by rail. Transneft, the sole supplier of oil, says it has stopped delivering to Ventspils because it is now supplying oil to its own new terminal at Primorsk, on the Gulf of Finland. C4.

NEC Uses Move to Firm Up Strategy
Using an unexpected vacancy in its senior management ranks to cement a change in strategic direction, the NEC Corporation named Akinobu Kanasugi as its president.

HEADLINE: Schools Resegregate, Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Sanetra Jant still wonders where all the white kids went. Only last spring, they made up a quarter of her class, not to mention her friends. And then, poof, they were gone.
 "I don't know why they left," said Sanetra, a fourth grader at Reid Park Elementary School. 
 Last year, before a federal appeals court ended three decades of judicial-supervised desegregation by the district, Sanetra's school was 68 percent black. Now it is almost entirely black, and the many white pupils who once rode in on yellow buses number one in a hundred. 
"Maybe they didn't like it here," Sanetra said, knitting her brow in thought. 
If there is any one place to witness the changing racial composition of the nation's public schools, perhaps it is here, in the city for which the Supreme Court first endorsed the use of busing to desegregate.
Dozens of Charlotte schools have basically changed color in the months since the appeals court lifted the desegregation order, and though few other places have seen swings so rapid, the city offers a time-lapse view of the steady transformation of the nation's schools.
According to a new study by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, black and Latino students are now more isolated from their white counterparts than they were three decades ago, before many of the overhauls from the civil rights movement had even begun to take hold.
Nationally, the shift is a result of several factors: big increases in enrollment by black, Latino and Asian students; continuing white flight from the nation's urban centers; and the persistence of housing patterns that isolate racial and ethnic groups. But another big factor, the Harvard study found, has been the termination of dozens of court-ordered desegregation plans.
Spurred by Supreme Court decisions at the start of the 1990's, lower courts have lifted desegregation orders in at least three dozen school districts in the last 10 years. Little Rock, San Diego, Denver and Miami have all come out from under court supervision, and next month a federal judge will reconsider the integration plan in Chicago, the nation's third-largest school district.
A chief principle in the voiding of these orders is one established by the Supreme Court a decade ago: that school districts can be considered successfully desegregated even if student racial imbalances due entirely to demographic factors, like where children live, continue to exist.
Largely as a result, black students now typically go to schools where fewer than 31 percent of their classmates are white, the new Harvard study found. That is less contact than in 1970, a year before the Supreme Court authorized the busing that became a primary way of integrating schools.
Latino students, who have rarely been a focus of desegregation efforts, now attend schools where whites account for only 29 percent of all students, compared with 45 percent three decades ago, according to the study, which draws on Education Department data through the 2000-1 school year.
And while white children increasingly come into contact with minority students, mainly because of the tremendous population growth among races that had only marginal representation decades ago, they are still America's most segregated group, the study found. On average, white students, who make up about 61 percent of the nation's public-school population, go to schools where 80 percent of their classmates are white.
The consequence is a nation in which every racial group that is big enough to be described as segregated generally is: Blacks, though only 17 percent of public-school children, typically attend schools where they are in a majority. The same is true of Latinos, who are about 16 percent of the student population. Even American Indians, a mere 1 percent of public-school children, go to schools where nearly a third of all students are Native American. 
Asians, the study says, are the most integrated group, attending schools where the races are somewhat more commensurate with their national representation. But they, too, are disproportionately grouped together, for though they are only about 4 percent of public-school children, they typically go to schools that are 22 percent Asian. 
"We call our schools racially isolated, but it's really just a euphemism for being segregated," said Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. "It has to be regarded as unhealthy. At a time when the society is becoming increasingly diverse, it bodes ill to have increasingly segregated schools."
Many researchers cite sweeping demographic changes, not public policy, as the leading force behind racial separation in the schools. The percentage of students who are members of minority groups has almost doubled in the last 30 years, and, whether as a legacy of enforced segregation, a function of economics or an expression of personal choice, they live largely apart from whites, and often from one another. 
Not only did the exodus of white families from cities continue throughout the 1990's, but new suburban enclaves of minorities, particularly African-Americans, also formed, expanding the ring of largely segregated communities beyond the urban core. 
But demographics alone cannot account for the rapid segregation of schools, according to the study. As elsewhere, the growth in population among minority students in Southern states has outpaced that of white students for years, and yet the region remained among the nation's most integrated throughout the 1980's, the researchers found. Only in the last decade or so, as courts have declared the schools integrated enough to dissolve desegregation orders, has the segregation between black and white students begun to grow.
"You can't talk about the changes that have happened without talking about the effects of the court orders, particularly in the South," said Erica D. Frankenberg, one of the authors. "The correlation is too strong." 
Quite apart from the argument that the school districts are not responsible for correcting neighborhood segregation, some white parents have challenged desegregation plans for considering race at all. Here in Charlotte, white parents filed suit in 1997 contending that their children were being discriminated against because they could not go to schools of their choice. A federal appeals court ruled in their favor in 2001, lifting the district's plan. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case last year, making this fall the first in three decades in which the system did not use race to help determine where children went to school. 
The effect was immediate, as schools quickly began to mirror their largely segregated neighborhoods. But while Janice L. Lewis, the principal at Reid Park Elementary here, would welcome the day when she presides over a diverse student body once again, she has few worries that lacking one hurts the caliber of her shiny, almost-new school.
Sprawled out over 18 acres of frost-nipped lawns and untouched trees, Reid Park defies the image of an "inner-city school," as it is often called. Its spacious hallways echo a kind of focused calm that many private schools would envy.
Yet it does have a characteristic common to racially segregated schools: poverty. On average, blacks and Latinos attend schools where roughly 45 percent of the students are poor, compared with 19 percent among whites, a reflection of racial discrepancies in income, the study found. At Reid Park, the number is even higher, with more than 8 in 10 students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
While few openly question the social importance of integrated schools, as a catalyst for breaking down stereotypes and encouraging tolerance, the debate over academic benefits of integration is a fiery one, often infused with as much ideology as evidence. Some researchers, liberals and conservatives alike, argue that breaking up concentrations of same-race children tends to improve academic performance, especially among black students. Others reject the notion, contending that mixing student populations guarantees little but longer bus rides. 
A conviction that predominantly minority schools suffer from scant resources remains one reason why civil rights lawyers are determined to keep desegregation orders in place where they can.
"The bottom line is that all of our experience with desegregation came not from serendipity but through deliberate efforts to change what had been put in place," said Theodore M. Shaw, associate director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. "In that respect, it's also true that if we're going to do anything about racial segregation in the 21st century, it's not going to happen serendipitously."

HEADLINE: Bush Proposal May Cut Tax On S.U.V.'s For Business 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's economic plan would increase by 50 percent or more the deductions that small-business owners can take right away on the biggest sport utility vehicles and pickups.
 The plan would mean small businesses could immediately deduct the entire price of S.U.V.'s like the Hummer H2, the Lincoln Navigator and the Toyota Land Cruiser, even if the vehicles were loaded with every available option. Or a business owner, taking full advantage, could buy a BMW X5 sport utility vehicle for a few hundred dollars more than a Pontiac Bonneville sedan, after the immediate tax deductions were factored in. 
 Tax experts and environmentalists say the plan would provide incentives for businesses to choose the biggest gas-guzzling trucks because it takes several years to depreciate the cost of passenger cars and smaller sport utility vehicles. The ramifications of the Bush plan on S.U.V. buyers were reported today in The Detroit News. 
The potential lift for sales of big S.U.V.'s comes amid rising tension in the Middle East and increasing criticism of S.U.V.'s from environmentalists and regulators. 
But a top budget official said today that the administration might be open to changes in the tax code that would bring cars more in line with big trucks. 
"We have an open mind about whether the deduction for cars needs to be refined," said Dr. John Graham, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget.
The tax code now caps deductions for most automobiles. But the largest vehicles -- those that weigh more than 6,000 pounds fully loaded -- are exempt because the relevant portion of the code was written in the 1980's, before the rise of the sport utility vehicle, and was intended to exempt big pickups needed on work sites. Now the tax incentives also give business owners not involved in hauling -- doctors, real estate agents, accountants -- more incentive to buy the biggest S.U.V.'s instead of smaller ones, or cars. 
The proposal "makes a glitch in the tax code much worse and it benefits rich businessmen who want to buy massive S.U.V.'s," said Aileen Roder, program director for Taxpayers for Common Sense. "In essence we're buying these vehicles for these businesses."
But the administration says that greater business deductions will be a potent economic stimulant.
"Many small businesses have genuine needs for large vans, pickups and S.U.V.'s, whether it be for a farm, sales or industrial application," Dr. Graham said. "An updated tax deduction for small businesses is certainly needed."
Consider the Hummer H1 as an example of the new deduction. It is one of the largest and most expensive S.U.V.'s, with a base sticker price of $102,581, including destination charge. Under the Bush plan, small-business owners could use all of an annual $75,000 capital equipment deduction toward the purchase; the current equipment deduction allowance is just $25,000. 
That is in addition to thousands of dollars in other deductions. Under existing rules, a business could deduct 30 percent from the base price left after the capital equipment deduction, a benefit put in place as part of a post-Sept. 11 stimulus package. In the case of the H1, that would be a further deduction of $8,274.
Finally, 20 percent could be deducted from what is left, part of the business deductions available for automobiles. For the H1, that would be $3,861 more in deductions. 
The total would be more than $87,000 in deductions, or about $33,500 in savings in federal taxes alone for buyers in the highest bracket. Under current rules, just less than $60,000 could be deducted. 
Deals for cars and small sport utility vehicles are much less appealing. Currently, a business can deduct no more than $7,660 for a car in its first year of service, $4,900 in the second year and less in the succeeding years. The Toyota Prius, which uses a fuel-efficient blend of gasoline and electric power, is eligible for an additional $2,000 clean vehicle deduction. That means a business owner could deduct under half of the $20,500 sticker price of the Prius in the first year of purchase, for about $3,700 worth of federal tax savings for those in the highest tax bracket. 
David Friedman, an engineer and analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group, said the increased deduction for big vehicles was "yet another loophole that the government is keeping open that is increasing our oil dependence." 
"Before, it was large enough to drive a small S.U.V. through," he added. "Now it's large enough to drive a Hummer through."
Without altering the treatment of cars in the tax code, the Bush plan could run counter to the administration's recent decision to force automakers to improve the fuel economy of S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans by 7 percent by middecade. 
That is probably why the administration is open minded when it comes to reviewing the tax treatment of different kinds of vehicles.
Dr. Graham reiterated today that the administration was also considering further fuel economy measures. S.U.V.'s and pickups that weigh more than 8,500 pounds fully loaded have been exempt from federal fuel regulations. But the administration "is currently investigating whether those rules should be extended to larger light trucks" weighing as much as 10,000 pounds, he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Bigger Breaks"The current tax code already gives small-business buyers of giant S.U.V.'s a big tax break, but a Bush administration proposal, if adopted, would create even a bigger break.

HEADLINE: A Casino in the Catskills May be Good for the Economy but Bad for the Traffic 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: GOSHEN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
As Sullivan County inches closer to its long-held dream of welcoming casinos, people in Orange County, its neighbor here to the southeast, are starting to ponder what gambling in the Catskills will mean for them. In a word, traffic.
 Sullivan County hopes to attract lines of gamblers disgorging coins and dollars and breathing new life into its anemic economy. Orange County expects to reap only lines of cars along Route 17, its main east-west artery, clogging connecting roads and fouling the air. 
 The problem is that Route 17, or the Quickway, as locals call it, is already filled with cars on weekends, as people from New York City travel to and from the Catskills. "It's literally bumper-to-bumper, particularly in warm weather," said the Orange County planning commissioner, David E. Church. 
Orange County registered its concern with a strongly worded letter last fall to the Sullivan County town of Thompson, which recently accepted the environmental findings for the planned Mohawk casino and resort. The casino is being developed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and Park Place Entertainment Corporation, one of the largest casino operators. 
According to Mr. Church, the environmental statement did not consider the effects of traffic in the wider region. It also failed to show how much traffic would be increased by other developments on the drawing board, including a proposed arts center and another possible casino in the same Sullivan County town, he said. 
Orange County officials estimate that the Mohawk casino will bring 12,000 more car trips through the county each day. They base that on the developer's assertion that the majority of traffic to the casino will be from the east along Route 17.
"Yet," Mr. Church wrote in his letter, "the impact to travel and safety on Orange County highways -- the gateways to Sullivan County -- are ignored" in the statement.
The supervisor of Thompson, Anthony P. Cellini, said the town would try to be "good neighbors" and "mitigate whatever the concerns are" in Orange County.
Because Orange County has no authority over the casinos, Mr. Church fears that his county eventually may have to "grin and bear" the traffic. Yet, he and others are suggesting ways to keep the traffic moving, from incentives for using buses to a light rail system.
A spokesman for Park Place Entertainment, Robert Stewart, said the $500 million Mohawk casino, which is to include a 750-room hotel and 165,000 square feet of casino space, would not significantly alter traffic on Route 17.
"The issues of traffic congestion on Route 17 extend far beyond any incremental traffic that's going to be created by the construction of the Mohawk casino," Mr. Stewart said. "There is traffic that clogs Route 17 already south of Sullivan, and we think a comprehensive examination is really what's called for."
He added, "We certainly would support working with the state of New York on those issues." 
The clicking of the first roulette wheel may not be heard for some time, perhaps years. Casinos need approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the projects still face legal challenges from gambling opponents.
Still, the consensus among many residents of both counties is that casinos are coming. After moving in fits and starts since the mid-1990's, progress toward a Mohawk casino in particular has accelerated. Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, called it the "only serious proposal out there right now."
In 2001, the State Legislature approved six Indian casinos in New York, including up to three in the Catskills. That year the St. Regis Mohawk tribe signed an agreement with Park Place Entertainment to build and run a casino at Kutsher's Country Club, one of the few remaining resorts in the Catskills. 
To be sure, many Orange County residents are supportive of the economic benefits casinos would bring to Sullivan. For years resorts in the Catskills, and Sullivan County, formed what was called the borscht belt because of the many Jewish New Yorkers who vacationed there. One by one, most of the county's hotels and resorts have closed.
Now, some business owners in Orange County are hoping for some gains from the Sullivan developments. "It will bring more people to the area for jobs, which will mean more homes and more shoppers," said Jennifer DiMarco, who owns an upscale stationery store in the county seat here.
That is exactly what others dread, though. Three towns in Orange County now have building moratoriums in place after experiencing years of runaway home construction, Mr. Church said. In recent years, the county has attracted many home buyers priced out of Manhattan, Westchester County and northern New Jersey.
"The Catskills have gotten more popular, and 9/11 made people look for the safety and security of a more remote location," Mr. Church said. "We can't build houses fast enough to meet the demand. It's just tremendous. And the bulk of it is single-family housing, which is very car-dependent."
In the quaint downtown here, where the turn-of-the-century look of the streets could be part of a Frank Capra film, people on their lunch breaks said they were bracing for traffic tie-ups on Route 17 once the casinos are built.
"From 3 o'clock Thursday afternoon until Sunday evening, it's horrendous now for the locals, just horrendous," said William Smith, a computer technician who lives in Harriman. "You can't even get on. The casinos are going to make it a lot worse." 
But Mr. Cellini, the supervisor of Thompson, pointed out that Sullivan County residents had to wade through Orange County's traffic "when we drive back from New York City." And "they didn't consult us" on their housing boom, he added.
"Success," he added, "is a traffic jam."

HEADLINE: Years of Chaos, Piled in Newark Child Care Office 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and LESLIE KAUFMAN 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Inside the cramped offices of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services in Newark, the signs of chaos are not subtle.
 Caseworkers assigned to investigate allegations of child abuse sit before broken computer terminals and beside file cabinets crammed with infant formula, baby shampoo and economy-size tubs of diaper-rash ointment. In a daily rush, runaways, counselors, troubled parents, social workers, abused children, nurses and bureaucrats all hurry through hallways where case folders are stacked openly in haphazard piles against the wall. 
 Pillars throughout the office display the kind of handwritten notices commonly seen on telephone poles announcing a rummage sale or lost pet. "Missing file," the signs read, then list the names and case numbers of people whose problems the state has lost track of amid the relentless crush of new crises. 
The disarray plaguing New Jersey's child welfare system, and its potential consequences, became tragically apparent earlier this month, when a 7-year-old, Faheem Williams, was found dead in the same basement of a home in north Newark where two of his bothers had been locked in, starving and beaten.
A caseworker had closed a child abuse allegation into the family last February without ever visiting the children, and the furor over that decision prompted Gov. James E. McGreevey to order an overhaul of a state child welfare system that has floundered through decades of mismanagement and neglect. But an examination of the Newark office, so overloaded with difficult cases and miserable working conditions that some caseworkers call it the "belly of the beast," offers an indication of the enormousness of that task.
The failures in the Williams case occurred within a unit that state officials and caseworkers concede is so poorly equipped, badly managed and understaffed that breakdowns are accepted as daily routine.
When state officials arrived last week to assess the office, only 2 of the 18 computer terminals worked, and the computer system was not working for 80 percent of the workday. Even when the computer system is operating, it is too outdated to track thousands of open cases, forcing one supervisor to manage her employees by maneuvering 250 Post-it notes on the wall of her office cubicle.
There are only 22 beds for teenage runaways in Newark, frequently forcing caseworkers to waste days driving to shelters as far away as Atlantic City or Bridgewater.
Until last week, the electronic office keys issued to caseworkers were programmed to forbid them access to the building on weekends, and those workers who remained after 5 p.m. could not unlock the bathrooms.
As the system staggers on, the Newark office gets an average of nine new child abuse allegations a day, compounding the problems.
Supervisors concede that cases often languish four or five months before being reviewed. Caseworkers say they are so overwhelmed that they have little choice but to perform slipshod investigations.
"What you have here," said Kevin Ryan, whom Mr. McGreevey assigned to take over the Newark office last week, "is an infrastructure completely overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of problems thrown at it every day."
Child welfare agencies in cities and states across the nation wrestle with sporadic financing and onerous caseloads, but New Jersey's has proven particularly resistant to reform over the past two decades. Despite panels and periodic attempts to overhaul the system, New Jersey still assigns caseloads far higher than recommended by experts and remains one of a handful of states not to use federal financing for a computerized case-tracking system.
Because Newark is New Jersey's largest city, and home to some of its most complex social problems, the social service offices here stand as a vivid example of the way those systemic flaws bog down supervisors and staff members. Newark's three DYFS offices received 3,104 abuse and neglect complaints in 2001, and 1,004 of those were substantiated.
A review of the division across the state last month found 1,358 case files in which the state had not yet verified whether an abuse or neglect allegation was true, and 431 of those were from the Newark office.
Mr. Ryan has made his temporary headquarters in District Office No. 2, where the Williams case had been handled, and said he was stunned to find so many lingering problems whose solutions seemed so obvious.
Mr. Ryan cited staff cars as an example. A shortage of cars was so acute that caseworkers were forced to place their names on a long request list, then wait for a dispatcher to call when a vehicle became available, said Reggie Jones, a Newark caseworker.
"You can't get up to go to the bathroom or look out the window because if they call you back they only give you three minutes," Mr. Jones said, adding that it was common to see caseworkers barreling down the stairs at breakneck speed to get a car before it was reassigned.
Mr. Ryan quickly ordered new cars, so the 420 employees who work out of the various Newark offices had easier access to the families they were supposed to supervise. The state also sent in 222 new cellphones, to enable caseworkers to confer with supervisors when handling a complicated situation in the field. Building security managers were ordered to reprogram the key cards, allowing caseworkers into the office -- and the bathrooms -- on demand. There are plans for new computers.
Mr. Ryan also began revamping the case assignment system, which had doled out new complaints at random, and is devising a method to steer cases to different caseworkers depending on their strengths, weaknesses and existing caseloads.
"So much of the problem here was just management," he said, "that it actually makes me optimistic that we can turn things around here."
But there is little to suggest that others in the office share that optimism. As Mr. Ryan formulated his plans in the district director's office on Thursday, a therapist hired by the employees' union was in a conference room down the hall, counseling four beleaguered caseworkers.
Their voices crackling with frustration and resignation, they recounted workdays of petty humiliations: school counselors who call in abuse complaints after sending the children into the homes where they were allegedly mistreated; a family court system so overburdened that caseworkers often waste days waiting to testify; a shortage of shelter space; hostile families and dangerous neighborhoods.
One caseworker said that last summer she was assigned to remove a child from a family in a neighborhood so violent that a police officer refused to accompany her unless he received backup. Another caseworker, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published, looked on and shook her head in disgust.
"If it's dangerous, I just don't go," she said, defiantly. "I've got kids. If I get killed out there, who's going to take care of them?"
Caseworkers and supervisors say that the system's troubles have outlasted so many attempts at reform that few believe Mr. McGreevey has the endurance necessary to deliver on his promise to fix it once and for all. Elected officials are quick to impose new regulations for handling child abuse complaints, caseworkers say, but rarely send resources.
The difficult nature of the work, and modest pay, have resulted in a turnover rate of nearly 20 percent, state officials say, which only worsens the problem. With a shortage of experienced caseworkers, the constant parade of trainees has led to a uneven distribution of workload. Some workers handle 10 cases, while others, the state admits, must contend with more than 100.
But the most persistent complaint is the pressure to close cases.
Many workers say caseloads are brought up at annual evaluations and cited as factors in determining whether a raise or promotion is granted. These workers argue that the pressure to close is a bureaucratic counting game that focuses on the total numbers rather than the complexity of the cases or thoroughness of investigations.
Late last year, when a snowstorm forced the state to close all government offices early, the manager of the Newark office said that caseworkers with more than 50 cases must remain. Employees complained to their union, and all the caseworkers were allowed to leave, but the message was clear.
"The pressure to close cases is outrageous," said Dominick Antonicello, who spent 20 years working in the Newark office and was recently transferred to Bloomfield.
Workers say that family services officials in Trenton were so intent on lowering caseloads that they issued a memo in July 2002, instructing caseworkers that in some circumstances, they were permitted to close old cases even if they had not personally visited the families in months. Although the memo was issued after the Williams case had been closed, caseworkers say it indicates the kind of atmosphere that has existed in the Newark office for years.
Mr. Ryan said that on his first day in Newark, he met with staff members and informed them that they should immediately consider thorough investigations their primary obligation, rather than reducing caseloads. But Mr. Ryan conceded that the agency had pressured caseworkers in so many ways that it would take a sustained effort to truly change the focus of the office.
"This is not McDonald's," he said. "If you want to close a case, you have to visit the families, period. We're still trying to understand all the different factors that led them to feel pressured. And I will not leave here until that message gets through."

HEADLINE: Conservative Positions by Bush Could Cost Votes From Center, Moderates Warn 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush's decision to take strong conservative positions on an array of foreign, economic and social policy issues is drawing warnings from moderates within his party that he could alienate the centrist voters he needs for his re-election.
 As he prepares for the second half of his term -- he was sworn in two years ago today -- Mr. Bush hardly lets a day go by without pleasing his supporters on the Republican right. He has maintained a hard line against Iraq even as much of the rest of the world urges him to slow down. He has proposed a new round of tax cuts that pleasantly surprised even ardent supply-siders. He has denounced quotas in affirmative action programs. On Wednesday, the 30th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, he plans to make a supportive statement to demonstrators rallying against abortion. 
 By most measures, Mr. Bush's political standing remains enviable as he and his Democratic challengers begin to gear up for the 2004 race. He has continued to reach out to moderates on a few issues like education and health care while avoiding the festering discontent among conservatives that helped doom his father's bid for re-election in 1992. Moreover, Mr. Bush's advisers said, his leadership and ambitious initiatives will resonate more with voters of all stripes than will criticism about where a policy sits on the ideological spectrum. 
But with each conservative principle he emphasizes, Mr. Bush risks alienating crucial constituencies in the center, like working women, suburbanites and Hispanics, that he needs if he is to maintain a governing coalition for his party and firm up his own electoral prospects, analysts and activists in both parties said.
"We believe our party is on a collision course with the electorate, and as Republicans that concerns us greatly," said Jennifer Blei Stockman, national co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, a group that favors abortion rights. "While the party is feeling very strong after the 2002 elections, that could be the last gasp before the reality of what they've been doing with the right wing of the party really hits."
Internal splits over ideology and particular issues are nothing new in either major party, and it is by no means certain that the moderates who backed Mr. Bush in 2000 would abandon him in 2004. Still, any signs of diminished support from moderates, independents and conservative Democrats could make it harder for Mr. Bush to push through his legislative agenda and lead a united party into the presidential campaign.
In the Senate, moderate Republicans like Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who could hold the balance of power in the narrowly divided chamber, are already working across the aisle to scale back Mr. Bush's proposed $670 billion tax cut.
At the grass-roots level, Republicans involved in domestic issues like the environment said Mr. Bush was turning out to be more conservative than they had hoped.
"The administration is playing to a base of hard-core ideologues who have this bizarre notion that conservation and environmental protection are left-wing plots against the American way of life," said Jim DiPeso, policy director of Republicans for Environmental Protection, an advocacy group.
As he has since the 2000 campaign, Mr. Bush is working to avoid being stuck with simplistic portrayals of himself as an ideologue. He has tried to soften the edges of conservative decisions by, for example, sidestepping in his critique last week of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program the compelling question of whether race should remain a consideration in college admissions. 
At the same time, he has continued to emphasize a willingness to reach bipartisan compromises on issues like education and health care, and to show a concern for lower income people by holding events like one this month that brought to the White House women who had moved off welfare and into the work force.
As a result, it is hard to find any more consensus now than there was on Inauguration Day as to whether his "compassionate conservatism" is a new way of approaching the issues or, as liberals would have it, the same old right-wing package in deceptive new wrapping.
For all his strengths, Mr. Bush faces some worrisome signs. His overall approval ratings, though still high, have been falling, as have figures on his handling of the economy, a politically potent issue even in wartime.
Indeed, with so much of his reputation riding on his role as commander in chief, a war in Iraq that is bloodier, longer or less conclusive than expected could have considerable political consequences, especially if the economy does not strengthen soon.
"If you operate on the premise that administrations have to grab hold of the center, then you have to wonder what George Bush is doing," said Leon E. Panetta, who was chief of staff in the Clinton White House, which was often ruefully credited by Republicans with successfully blurring ideological lines.
In some ways, Mr. Bush is trying to redefine or neutralize traditionally Democratic issues like education and health care in the same way that Bill Clinton tried to co-opt Republicans on crime, welfare and fiscal responsibility. But there is a big difference between the ideological pressures on the current administration halfway into its term and those facing Mr. Clinton at the same point in his presidency.
After the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, Mr. Clinton was forced to the center as a matter of political survival, a development that almost certainly helped him in 1996. After the Republican victories in the House and Senate in 2002, Mr. Bush faces the task of keeping conservatives in general and the House Republican leadership in particular from pulling him and his party away from the vote-rich center.
"Bush's base is further to the right than where many Americans are outside the South," said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. "That makes it difficult to seek votes from Hispanics, African-Americans, single women, yet Republicans need to do that in order to grow."
The president's supporters said his ideological straddle reflected not so much political calculus as genuinely eclectic thinking. They said Mr. Bush's approach was rooted in conservative orthodoxy but influenced by a belief that there is a legitimate role for government in addressing society's needs and an imperative for the Republican Party to stand for tolerance.
Mr. Bush, they said, sees no contradiction in delivering a politically fatal blow to Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi for statements that appeared to embrace the segregationist appeals of Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign, then renominating a judge who has been a lightning rod for criticism from civil rights groups. He has no trouble proposing a big tax cut at a time of rapidly rising budget deficits and then proclaiming himself an advocate of fiscal responsibility.
This is not a president, they said, at risk of being paralyzed by cognitive dissonance.
"I have had the sense with Bush that this compassionate conservative thing is not so much a deliberate strategy as it is the complicated mix of his own personal beliefs," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who is now a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, has frequently described Mr. Bush as a "different kind of Republican." The obvious follow-up question has always been: Different from what?
"Different from a stereotypical Republican," Mr. Fleischer said, "particularly the image of Republicans that Bill Clinton tried to create, which was heartless and not focused on the human condition."
Far from tacking right and left in search of political gain, Mr. Fleischer said, the president has shown consistency.
"Look at the ruling on Michigan," he said, referring to Mr. Bush's Supreme Court brief last week on the affirmative action case. "All you needed to do was to look at his record as governor of Texas: diversity without quotas."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Vivendi's Chief And Partner Spar Over Asset Sale

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The honeymoon may be waning for Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chief executive of Vivendi Universal, and Barry Diller, the media mogul in charge of the company's entertainment businesses.
 When Mr. Fourtou announced his new strategy for Vivendi in September, he joked that he was on the best of terms with Mr. Diller, whose relationships with other business partners have often been tempestuous, saying: "I love him. He loves me. We repeat this to each other twice a day." 
 While the executives say they are still on good terms, tensions have erupted more recently over an effort to renegotiate a partnership agreement that gives Mr. Diller the ability to make the sale of Vivendi's entertainment assets -- namely the Universal movie studios, theme parks and cable channels -- prohibitively expensive.
In the event of a sale, Vivendi would owe Mr. Diller a disputed amount to cover tax liabilities. Mr. Diller has put the figure at $2 billion, people involved in the negotiations said, but Mr. Fourtou says the amount is closer to $1 billion. Moreover, a loophole in the contract might absolve Vivendi of any payments if the sale were structured in a certain way -- as a single package, for instance, rather than as separate entities, people close to Vivendi said. That interpretation, however, is at odds with Mr. Diller's reading of the agreement.
And that is not the only disagreement. Another one centers on $620 million that Mr. Diller says Vivendi owes his company, USA Interactive, which was created when USA Networks merged its cable, film and studios with Vivendi's entertainment businesses. 
Spokesmen for Vivendi Universal and USA Interactive declined to comment on the negotiations.
Mr. Fourtou is in New York this week for regularly scheduled meetings with Vivendi executives, including Mr. Diller, people close to the company said. Though not specifically on the agenda, the future of Vivendi's entertainment businesses and the unwinding of the partnership agreement are expected to be chief topics, these people continued.
Reworking the partnership agreement as a prelude to a sale of the entertainment businesses, either to a rival or to shareholders through a public stock offering, is a top priority at Vivendi now that the company has reduced its debt to a more manageable level. Net debt is expected to fall to 16.2 billion euros ($17.3 billion) this year, down from 22.4 billion euros ($23.9 billion) as of July 2002, according to Sanford C. Bernstein. Those figures include the 4 billion euros that Vivendi will have to spend to take control of Cegetel, a French phone company, from the Vodafone Group.
Several potential suitors have approached Vivendi about buying its entertainment businesses, either in pieces or as a whole package, including Marvin Davis, a wealthy oil entrepreneur who once owned the Fox movie studio; NBC, a unit of General Electric; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; and Liberty Media, the cable company controlled by John C. Malone.
But whether any of them will make a credible proposal remains unclear. Though Mr. Davis initially offered to buy all of Vivendi's entertainment businesses for $15 billion plus the assumption of $5 billion in debt, he has not yet secured financial backing. And lining up that kind of money in the current economic climate is no easy task.
Other suitors are interested in acquiring the best parts of Vivendi's entertainment businesses, not the more problematic divisions like the Universal Music Group, making any deal less palatable. NBC, for instance, has expressed an interest in Vivendi's cable channels, while MGM has focused on the film studios, a person close to Vivendi said.
Liberty Media, which is interested in merging its Starz Encore cable network with Vivendi's entertainment businesses, is a more serious contender and may have the support of Mr. Diller, who could wind up with an expanded role at the combined companies.
But because of Mr. Diller's reputation as a shrewd negotiator, Vivendi executives are nervous about coming out on the short end of any deal. And so they are keeping their options open, in part to exert some pressure on Mr. Diller and also as a way to place a value on the businesses should they ever be spun off in a stock offering.
Mr. Davis is expected to return to Paris at the end of the month for another round of talks, before a Vivendi board meeting. "It never hurts to have someone waiting in the wings," one person close to Vivendi said.
Even if a credible offer did materialize, any sale would have to wait until Vivendi straightens out its partnership agreement with Mr. Diller. And so far those negotiations are producing more questions than answers, people involved in the discussions said. One issue is whether Vivendi would be required to pay the taxes Mr. Diller would incur on the gain from any sale of the entertainment businesses.
In one interpretation of the contract favored by Vivendi executives, Vivendi would not be liable for those taxes if it sold the entertainment businesses as a single package. Mr. Diller's reading of the contract is that a payment would be due regardless of how the assets are sold, a person close to him said.
Vivendi does acknowledge that it would owe Mr. Diller some money if the businesses were broken up and sold piecemeal, but the amount of that payment is another sticking point. Mr. Diller puts the figure at $2 billion. But people close to Vivendi say the amount is closer to $1 billion, given that the value of those businesses has declined since the partnership agreement was signed in December 2001.
At least one discrepancy over the reading of the partnership pact has bubbled over into the public domain. In a December filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, USA Interactive accused Vivendi of withholding payments valued at $620 million, part of the taxable income of the entertainment assets that are supposed to be distributed to the partners at the end of each year. Vivendi disputes that assertion.

HEADLINE: The Axis of Oil 

 BODY:
With all due respect to President Bush and Congressional Democrats, this month's most notable stimulus plan for the American economy did not emanate from Washington but from Vienna. The recent decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to provide an additional 1.5 million barrels a day to world markets should help make up for the shutdown of Venezuela's oil industry, the source of 13 percent of America's imports. The move also signals Saudi Arabia's willingness to ensure the flow of affordable crude in the event of war with Iraq. 
 Beyond its immediate benefits, the Saudi decision is a further reminder of how closely our fortunes are tied to the good offices of the big producers three decades after the oil shocks of the 1970's. That the Saudis and other Middle East producers have had to come to America's rescue in the wake of Venezuela's political crisis is rich in irony. Venezuela was counted on as a buffer against disruptions in deliveries from the Persian Gulf. 
 America's current predicament -- it confronts the possibility of losing both Venezuelan and Iraqi oil at the same time -- is thus instructive on two counts. It provides another powerful incentive, if any more were needed, to tighten fuel efficiency standards and to push more aggressively for the long-term development of alternative fuels. Since the United States has less than 3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, the only sure road to greater self-sufficiency is through reduced consumption and new technology.
The other lesson is that the importance to the global economy of the big Persian Gulf suppliers, especially the Saudis, has not been diminished, however much we like to regard ourselves as "buffered" by Mexico, Venezuela or even Russia and the other former Soviet republics. Like it or not, the Saudis retain as much leverage as they ever have over global energy markets. Their share of current output may have declined, but the Persian Gulf area still claims two-thirds of the world's known reserves. And because it commands the bulk of the world's spare capacity in the near term, Saudi Arabia acts as a central banker when it comes to oil, determining the market's liquidity. 
For now, at least, OPEC is helpfully trying to keep prices between $22 and $28 a barrel. It knows that allowing prices to hover above the $30 mark hampers global economic growth. But given America's thirst, even the cartel cannot fully ensure our economic recovery in light of the great uncertainty Venezuela and the Iraqi crisis create for energy markets. Fuel costs affect vast swaths of the economy, so at a time when it's anyone's guess whether oil will cost $20 or $60 a barrel six months from now, too many businesses are simply putting off any spending decisions. 
If war is averted, oil prices are sure to decline, perhaps dramatically once Venezuela's crisis is resolved. A quick war that knocks Iraq's two million daily barrels off the market for a time could result in a short-term spike in prices, followed by a steep decline as Iraq, home to the world's second-largest reserves, increases production afterward. A protracted conflict in which Iraq attacks its neighbors' oilfields would be likely to trigger another economic recession, with oil prices exceeding $50 a barrel. 
This isn't solely of concern to the West. China, with its mounting need for Middle East oil to fuel its economic growth, stands to lose as much as anyone. The fact that this once self-sufficient energy consumer will soon become the world's second-largest oil importer is creating an affinity of interests between Washington and Beijing, much as it does between Moscow and Beijing. 
One positive aspect of the current uncertainty is that it reinforces the need for Washington and its cold-war adversaries -- Russia and China -- to work closely together on energy policy. At home, it should also prod the Bush administration to address sensible measures to encourage efficiency.

HEADLINE: Mayor Girds For Showdown With Unions 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Kicking off a round of labor negotiations that is expected to be the toughest since the 1970's fiscal crisis, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has angered the city's unions by insisting that he will not grant raises unless they are financed by increased productivity.
 Mr. Bloomberg's demands have the city's nearly 300,000 workers also worried that he wants a wage freeze, and that has made some union leaders reluctant to cooperate with his efforts to cut the $3 billion budget deficit. Some labor leaders are also resisting the mayor's call for unions to grant $600 million in concessions as their part of the shared sacrifice to eliminate the deficit. 
 "The unions cannot continue to give back to the city," said Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association and one of Mr. Bloomberg's first and most prominent supporters among labor leaders. "Every time the city gives us something, they want to take it back two years later. And every time they take it back, it just causes us to fall further behind the cost of living." 
The threats that the Bloomberg administration made two weeks ago to lay off police officers, since withdrawn, have also soured the mood of the negotiations. Threatening to further complicate the talks, the presidents of several unions say it is time to jettison the tradition of pattern bargaining, in which the city gives every union more or less the same deal.
And in another unusual twist, the municipal unions, which usually work arm in arm in confronting the city, are suddenly elbowing one another as they seek to claim their share of the shrinking budget. For example, District Council 37, the largest municipal union, has said that hundreds of Police Department desk jobs should be held by civilian workers rather than by the police, but that has the main police union worried that District Council 37's proposals are jeopardizing police jobs.
Despite the unions' anger at Mr. Bloomberg's proposals, Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, said, "People often forget that the unions have come through countless times in crises."
If the bargaining focuses on any one issue, city officials and union leaders agree, it will be the mayor's demand that there be no raise without an increase in productivity to offset it. In the financial plan that Mr. Bloomberg announced in November, he floated the idea of finding money to pay for raises by lengthening the 35-hour workweek of municipal employees and by reducing the city's pension contributions.
The city's labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, said, "The mayor has been quite clear that there will be no collective bargaining increases unless they have been funded through productivity."
City officials have proposed some ideas for increased efficiency -- reducing the number of firefighters on some trucks to four, from five, and giving the police a slightly shorter workday in exchange for 10 extra shifts a year. The police and firefighters have resisted these proposals.
Budget experts say it is hard to square the city's tradition of pattern bargaining with Mr. Bloomberg's push for productivity increases, which need to be tailored individually for each union.
Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said this round of negotiations could greatly weaken pattern bargaining, which she said was already undercut in the previous round. 
"Pattern bargaining is different from productivity bargaining," she said. "I think we're all moving beyond the pattern bargaining approach to one that stresses productivity instead. That would be a smart strategy for the city."
In the city's previous bargaining round, the teachers, the police, firefighters and librarians obtained larger raises than other unions. But their contracts contained numerous caveats -- such as requiring teachers to work more hours in exchange for more pay -- that enabled the city to argue that those agreements remained true to a basic wage pattern.
The teachers' and police unions are eager to see pattern bargaining abandoned because they recognize that the practice makes it harder for the city to afford to give teachers and the police the large raises they say they need to catch up with their suburban counterparts. 
"I've always thought that pattern bargaining was the wrong way for a municipality to proceed," said Ms. Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. "I think there would be so much more innovation in how everyone works if there was more flexibility away from the pattern." 
But she added, "Anyone who rushes around and says pattern bargaining is dead for everyone is deluding himself." 
For city officials, pattern bargaining makes negotiating easier because once they reach the first settlement with a union, they can pressure other unions that it is only fair that they take a similar deal. That is easier than starting from scratch in negotiating with each union.
Mr. Bloomberg has taken a tougher stance than many of his predecessors by insisting that the city will not pay any raises retroactively. In the past, the city has often negotiated agreements two years after the old contracts expired. If the city gave raises in the first two years of the new contracts, the city then paid those raises retroactively.
But Mr. Bloomberg is saying that even though the contracts for District Council 37 and for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association expired on June 30, the unions will receive no raises for the months since then. 
That, union leaders say, is tantamount to a wage freeze. The Bloomberg administration has sought to justify that position by saying that since productivity gains cannot be achieved retroactively, then raises should not be paid retroactively.
The mayor's suggestions of a wage freeze have upset union leaders, especially because city workers accepted a two-year wage freeze in the mid-1990's under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"Obviously the city faces some tough economic conditions," said Arthur Cheliotes, president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers Union, which represents 8,000 supervisors and middle managers. "Our concern is that if city workers don't get raises that at least cover inflation, they're being hit twice. They're being hit on wages and then on higher property taxes, higher college tuition and everything else."
Voicing the views of many labor leaders, he said: "You want to talk about productivity increases? First you have to deal with across-the-board wage increases to make sure our salaries are not eroded, and then let's talk about productivity."
Taking a different approach from other leaders, Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, has issued several "white papers" recommending ways for the city to save money. 
Noting that the city pays some computer consultants more than $1,200 a day, she said the city could save $25 million a year by having her union members do the work. She said the city's schools could save another $10 million by using municipal employees rather than outside contractors for pest control. 
"The city has to take a hard look at all this contracting out, because it wastes a lot of money," Ms. Roberts said. "The savings achieved by having city workers do this work could help finance the raises our members need."
Mr. Hanley said, "Of course, we'll take a close look at any proposals to save money."
Among District Council 37's money-saving proposals are to replace 300 teachers who work as attendance officers with lower-paid district council members. That has teachers' union officials protesting that District Council 37 is trying to steal jobs.
This is one of many signs of tension within the municipal house of labor. Indeed, several union leaders said that after the teachers and several other unions sought to go their own way in the last bargaining round, there is less cooperation this time.
District Council 37, which often negotiates the first settlement, gave its proposal to the city on Dec. 4. The city is expected to present its counteroffer when the two sides meet on Feb. 5. Separately, the city and the Municipal Labor Coalition are scheduled to meet on Jan. 28 to discuss the city's call for concessions.
Several union leaders said little had happened in the talks because everyone was looking to see what happened in the transit workers' settlement. That union accepted a first-year wage freeze, a $1,000 lump-sum payment, and raises of 3 percent in each of the second and third years. 
Like Mr. Bloomberg, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said all raises would be linked to increased productivity. But the authority obtained just one measure to improve efficiency -- the merging of the bus system for the Bronx and Manhattan with the authority's system for the other boroughs.
Mr. Bloomberg is clearly looking for greater productivity gains. But the city's unions will no doubt argue that since the transit workers gave little on productivity to receive raises, they, too, should not have to grant major concessions.

HEADLINE: Georgia's New Governor Is Pressed to Make Good on His Pledge About Flag 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Sonny Perdue is in a pickle.
 The new governor of Georgia has all these big ideas: a fully wired state with high-speed Internet access for all; mentors for students taking the SAT; a saber-toothed ethics commission; more money for legal defense of the indigent. 
 But all the attention keeps coming back to same, single, stubborn issue: the state flag.
Since this is partly a pickle of his own making, Governor Perdue has been uncomfortable talking about it. 
During his underdog campaign, he energized rural white voters by promising a referendum on the state flag, which the Legislature stripped of its large Confederate battle cross two years ago.
After he was elected, Mr. Perdue, the state's first Republican governor in 130 years, went silent on the issue.
But last week, the day after he was inaugurated, he broached the referendum idea again. And now, in a recent interview, Mr. Perdue said a flag vote "is the only way Georgia can move on," though he would not discuss specifics.
"It's like a family secret," Mr. Perdue said. "The only way to heal this is with the sunshine of coming together and dealing with it in a very forthright approach. That's why I committed to a referendum."
Many analysts say that if the question is put to voters, the Confederate cross will probably return -- and so will the boycotts, the tension and the backwater image Georgia has tried so hard to bury.
"If there had been a referendum in Georgia in 1860 on slavery, I'd still be picking cotton," said State Senator Vincent D. Fort, a leader of the black caucus. "The idea that a referendum will heal the divide is ludicrous."
If the Confederate battle flag rises again above Georgia, it will be the first time since the civil rights movement that a Southern state has resurrected a symbol so painful to many. Some here say it could also crush the already-wobbly economy of Atlanta, the South's most prosperous city.
"We can't afford any more economic losses," said Denise Majette, a newly elected Democratic congresswoman from Atlanta, who is staunchly against a referendum. "We can't have this fester."
Southern heritage groups say the flag represents valor. Most blacks say it stands for slavery.
Mr. Perdue, who grew up on a farm in central Georgia, will not say what he thinks. "I'm not going there," he said. "I don't want to impugn the referendum process."
Yet he is well aware of the emotional impact. At his inauguration ceremony last week, he banned Confederate flags.
But he could not block the airspace. All morning and afternoon, three biplanes circled the sparkling golden dome of the Georgia Capitol, towing banners in favor of the Confederate flag. "Let us vote," read one. "You promised!"
Who sponsored the banners is a mystery. Two leading groups seeking a referendum, the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Heritage Preservation Association, said they did not have the money to pay for flyovers, which can cost $100 a pass. The planes flew for hours that day and returned the next.
Charles Lunceford of the Heritage Preservation Association said his group was fully behind Mr. Perdue -- and mobilizing against potential enemies.
"Any politician who decides to go against Southern heritage is a target," Mr. Lunceford said. "People chose to move to this area. When they move to the South, they abandon where they came from. Would it be right for me to move to California and demand that they take the bear off their flag?"
The flag emerged as a key issue in Mr. Perdue's upset of the incumbent governor, Roy Barnes, a Democrat.
Two years ago, when Mr. Barnes sought a new flag design, Georgia was one of the last states displaying a large Confederate cross as part of its flag. Mr. Barnes proposed shrinking the symbol to a small box at the bottom. The Legislature agreed, with Mr. Barnes hailed as a skillful politician, a leading light in the Democratic Party and a possible vice-presidential candidate.
Meanwhile, Georgia's rural white voters seethed. "You can't imagine the anger," said Dan Coleman, spokesman for the Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
In the campaign, Mr. Perdue, 56, a veterinarian and former state senator, promised to allow voters the choice of which flag they wanted. Rural voters turned out in record numbers and sent Mr. Barnes away.
But then Mr. Perdue seemed to cool to the idea. "The flag," Mr. Perdue said, a few weeks after victory, "is not really the issue of the day."
Last week, though, while posing for pictures, he abruptly shared his plans for a referendum.
"I think the people of Georgia need to heal this," he said. "The best venue to do that is in a referendum."
Will the old state flag be an option? Who will come up with the designs? When will it go to a vote? The governor would not say.
"The importance is in those details," said Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. "At some point, Perdue will have to weigh in."
A recent poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution indicated that two-thirds of Georgia residents wanted a referendum. More than 50 percent of the respondents said they thought the Confederate battle flag was a symbol of "heritage and history," while a third said it was a reminder of "oppression and racial division."
Two years ago, Mississippi voters overwhelmingly supported their Confederate-themed banner in a referendum. Three years ago, leaders in South Carolina insisted that the Confederate battle flag continue to fly from the Capitol dome until protests grew to such a din that legislators decided to move it.
The Atlanta business community is dreading any similar scenes. Many groups, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association, have said they will not hold a major event in a state flying the battle flag.
"A referendum would be detrimental," said Bill Howard, a spokesman for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Last year, Atlanta lost more jobs, 62,000, than any other city in the United States. The city, which relies on tourism, transportation and technology, was punished by the bubble burst in the high-technology sector and the downturn in travel that followed the Sept. 11 attacks.
"There are more important things we have to worry about right now," said Mayor Shirley Franklin of Atlanta, than "turning the state into a battleground over the Confederacy."
Governor Perdue is leaning toward a nonbinding referendum, which would still need the approval of the Legislature. Republicans control the Senate, Democrats the House, but there are white Democrats from rural areas who support bringing the old flag back. And some suburban Republicans who do not.
Mr. Perdue said the fact Georgia ranks last of the 50 states in SAT scores is "embarrassing" -- and an issue he would like to focus on.
"But you know who keeps bringing up the flag?" he said. "The press. At every stage of the game."
Mr. Perdue also said he did not know who chartered the three biplanes on Inauguration Day.

HEADLINE: Doubling Up Of Taxation Isn't Limited To Dividends 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
"Double taxation," President Bush said in introducing his proposal to end the personal tax on dividends, "is bad for our economy. Double taxation is wrong."
 Corporate dividends, however, are not the only kind of income that is taxed twice. Other taxes create a double, triple or even quintuple burden. And unlike the double taxation of dividends, which mainly affects the wealthy, the burden of other forms of multiple taxation -- sales taxes, import taxes, payroll taxes, among others -- often falls most heavily on poorer Americans. 
 These taxes may not be associated with inefficiencies in the capital markets, but can still take a hefty bite out of paychecks and reduce the incentive to work. Democrats and a few Republicans outside the White House have proposed cutting at least one of those taxes, but no one is talking about eliminating them altogether. 
The double tax on dividends is really a double tax on corporate profits. The federal government taxes companies' profits and then taxes the money again when it passes to shareholders as dividends. The double tax affects about 54 million Americans. Economists agree that it also gives companies an incentive to issue debt -- with the interest counting as a pretax cost -- rather than equity.
Multiple taxes also affect the other 236 million Americans who would see no immediate benefits from elimination of the tax on dividends. For example, import tariffs, sales taxes and federal and state excise taxes can add to the price of a product.
Nearly all such taxes are extremely regressive, said John S. Barry, the chief economist of the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit educational group. Low earners spend a larger share of their income on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, as well as inexpensive imported textiles and manufactured goods, than high earners do.
President Bush has said he is attacking the double tax on dividends in an attempt to help economic growth in the long term. Yet sales and excise taxes can also create distortions in the economy, said David F. Bradford, a professor of economics at Princeton. Even though these taxes are on purchases, not income, they can have the same effect as income taxes. "These are proportional taxes," Professor Bradford said. "If you do spend your money over your lifetime on taxed goods, then it's got to be a wage tax."
Because taxes on goods and services can have the same effects as a tax on wages, they may reduce the incentive to work. Taxes on saving and wealth should also affect people's willingness to work, Professor Bradford said. "Suppose I have to pay a tax on my interest. That should affect how much I work today. I earn my wages, and then I save my money, and then I pay again."
Those distortions can add up, even for low-income Americans. The Consumer Expenditure Survey, prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offers a window onto the tax burdens of families at different incomes. The total burden from nearly all forms of taxation -- income, sales, property and excise taxes, and the Social Security payroll tax -- was strikingly similar across the entire spectrum of incomes in 2001.
For individuals and families in the lowest fifth, with an average income of $7,946 (including just $25 in dividends), the cumulative tax rate was 18 percent. For the top fifth, with an average income of $116,666 (including $1,188 in dividends), the rate was 19 percent.
Property taxes, in addition to sales and excise taxes, make the overall system less progressive. "It's pretty well agreed upon that property taxes are passed through to renters," Mr. Barry said. "It is a disproportionate effect on low-income folks."
Property taxes are also a form of double taxation. They affect assets bought with income that has already been taxed. The estate tax, whose burden falls mostly on the very rich, belongs in the same category of double taxation. The tax cut law passed by Congress in 2001 phases out the estate tax over a decade but then fully restores it in 2011. Republicans are expected to push to abolish it permanently, but doing so would widen the budget deficit.
Social Security can also add a layer of multiple taxation. If workers do not perceive a concrete link between their contributions to the system and the benefits they will someday receive, then the payroll tax will decrease their incentive to work, just like any other income tax. Even those who do believe in the connection, as Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard and Andrew Samwick of Dartmouth wrote in 1992, can face high tax rates at the margin, because they may receive less than a dollar at retirement for every dollar they contributed. It depends on how much they earn, whether they are married and how old they are.
The figures from the Consumer Expenditure Survey provide a rough estimate of tax burdens, since people do not always report incomes accurately. The survey also does not add the value of some entitlements, like Medicaid, to incomes. The figures also focus on just one year, which can be misleading, since people may have high incomes while they work and low incomes after they retire.
A recent study by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University, and his co-authors took these criticisms to heart. They calculated average tax rates for entire lifetimes. To encompass the government's role completely, they factored in virtually all entitlement programs, like Medicare and food stamps, in addition to taxes.
For a couple who earn the minimum wage, Professor Kotlikoff calculated a lifetime negative tax rate, or subsidy, of 32 percent. The rate becomes positive quickly, though, rising to a tax of 30 percent for couples earning just three times the minimum wage. For the families with the highest incomes, the tax rate reaches about 50 percent. 
"It doesn't take a lot of income to start paying a lot of taxes," Professor Kotlikoff said. Over their lifetimes, "the superpoor don't pay taxes, but the poor do, and certainly the middle class does."
The rates for the working poor and the rich are fairly close together, Professor Kotlikoff said, in part because of the disproportionate effect of multiple taxation on low-income families. "You can have quintuple or octuple layers of taxation quite easily." Nonetheless, "the real issue is not the number of layers, it's the high effective tax rates at the margin."
At the margin, Professor Kotlikoff added, the poor suffer from yet another form of double taxation. Entitlement programs can create tax-like effects, since a worker may lose eligibility for them by earning more money. The implicit tax -- in addition to any explicit income taxes -- also detracts from the incentive to work.
In fact, the tax rates for the poor and well-to-do may be even closer than the study found. Professor Kotlikoff and his co-authors did not include some tax breaks, like those for 401(k) and I.R.A. saving plans, employer-provided health insurance and capital gains on home sales, which upper-income taxpayers are far more likely to take advantage of.
Just 43 percent of the lowest fifth of earners were homeowners, according to the expenditure survey, compared with 88 percent of the highest fifth. In last year's annual survey by the Census Bureau, 83 percent of people earning $75,000 or more reported having health insurance offered by their employers, compared with 26 percent of those earning $25,000 or less.
Because they cannot take advantage of the tax breaks, the poor can end up paying what amounts to another extra tax. "If you have these exclusions that benefit certain behavior," Mr. Barry said, "that forces up the rate on all income."
Though Democrats and a small number of Republicans in Congress have repeatedly suggested a reduction in the payroll tax that pays for Social Security as an economic stimulus, the idea has not gathered much steam. But two other types of measures, which are gaining political support, could reduce multiple tax burdens for virtually all households. 
Last month, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-wing policy group, proposed a subsidy of 3.5 percent to the first $15,000 of all workers' wages, and $75 billion worth of grants to the states, which would allow them to avoid harsh tax increases and spending cuts. Since then, Democrats in Congress and the Democratic Governors' Association have announced plans with similar measures of varying sizes.
Yet the White House is unlikely to attack forms of double taxation besides the dividend tax, said Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance. "This is the one we want to go after now, so this is it," he said in an interview last week. Adding other "bells and whistles" to balance the proposal, he said, would "invite a level of complexity back at you that you don't necessarily want."

To the Editor:
 Re "President Asks Congress for Measures Against Frivolous Suits" (news article, Jan. 17): 
 Out-of-control jury awards against doctors and pharmaceutical companies are responsible not only for higher insurance costs for doctors, but also for the cost to consumers. Many families have found it difficult to pay for insurance in times of unemployment or underemployment. President Bush's call for limits on medical liability is welcome.

HEADLINE: Corruption and Waste Bleed Mexico's Oil Lifeline 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CADEREYTA, Mexico 

 BODY:
Tony Cantu grew up with the giant oil refinery that Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, runs here in his hometown. He helped build it and operate it, rising from construction worker to computer programmer to chemical engineer. 
 Mr. Cantu gave Pemex a decade of his working life. But he will never work there again. He can explain why in one word. 
 "Corruption," he said, gazing at the refinery, 20 miles outside Monterrey in northern Mexico. "People being stepped on, forced to be corrupt -- I hated that. There were a lot of things you had to shut up about. The bosses would kill to protect themselves. People were subjugated by fear." 
For more than 60 years, Pemex, the world's fifth-largest oil company, has been Mexico's economic lifeblood. A $50 billion-a-year enterprise, it controls every gas pump in Mexico, and it sells nearly as much oil to the United States as Saudi Arabia does. 
Today, with some oil producers like Iraq and Venezuela facing nation-shaking crises, Mexico looks like a sure and steady source of oil. The United States may be tempted to rely on it even more. 
But Pemex is in danger of breaking down. "Financially, we are falling," its director, Raul Munoz Leos, said in an interview. Nearly every peso of Pemex's profits goes to run the government of Mexico. The company, after paying taxes and royalties, actually lost $3.5 billion in in 2001. Without major restructuring or tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, Mr. Munoz Leos warned recently, "We would face, in the short term, a collapse."
One reason is a rottenness at Pemex's core. The company loses at least $1 billion a year to corruption, its executives say, in a continuous corrosion of the machine that keeps Mexico solvent. 
Fixing Pemex is as crucial to Mexico's future as it is to American oil supplies. When Vicente Fox became president two years ago after defeating the political machine that ran Mexico for 71 years -- the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI -- he vowed to make his country more open and democratic and to make Pemex run like a 21st-century corporation. 
To change Mexico, Mr. Fox must first change Pemex. It has been a cash machine for the government, a slush fund for politicians and a patronage mill for party loyalists since the party created Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, in 1938. 
After nationalizing American and British oil interests, the party promptly changed the Constitution to bar foreign investment in underground oil and gas. It was a declaration of independence: "Expropriation Day" is still celebrated each year. 
Even today, the PRI, which still holds a plurality in Congress, is fighting changes to the Constitution and at the oil giant it created, in part on grounds of patriotism. President Fox's attempts at reform have been hamstrung by PRI resistance -- and Pemex's history of corruption. 
Pemex's last director, Rogelio Montemayor, a former PRI governor, and its union boss, Carlos Romero Deschamps, a PRI senator, each stand accused of stealing tens of millions of dollars from Pemex for the PRI's 2000 presidential campaign against Mr. Fox. 
Both men deny the charges. Mr. Romero Deschamps is battling an attempt in Congress to strip him of the legal immunity he enjoys as a sitting senator. Mr. Montemayor fled Mexico last year and is fighting extradition from Houston. The PRI, struggling to defend them -- and itself, is also resisting every effort to transform Pemex. 
"The political will needed to reform Pemex has just not coalesced," said Eduardo Cepeda, the head of J. P. Morgan Chase's Mexico office. 
Edward L. Morse, executive adviser at Hess Energy Trading Co. and former publisher of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, said by telephone from New York that "the effort to reform the beast" had failed. President Fox, he said, does not "understand how thoroughly ingrained in the national political culture the monopoly of Pemex is." 
Pemex remains one of the world's few national oil companies with no competition from within or without. Its resulting inefficiencies are stark.
Othon Canales Trevino is Pemex's director for competitiveness and innovation -- the man in charge of creating the "new" Pemex. He once ran a company that supplied Pemex with chemicals, and he was often solicited for bribes, he said. Today he sits on a commission on corruption at Pemex, composed of 14 directors.
"There is corruption," he said. "But I think the inefficiency is worse. There is brutal inefficiency." 
For example, Mr. Canales said, he recently asked how much Pemex paid each year for goods and services -- everything for ice packs to helicopters rented to fly engineers to offshore rigs. 
No one knew. It took four months to come up with the answer -- $7 billion.
"We want to act like a company," he said. "Pemex isn't a company. It isn't Pemex Inc. We're not a government ministry either. We are -- something weird. Our behavior changes depending on whom we are dealing with. To the Finance Ministry, we're their biggest taxpayer. To Congress, we're something else. To our customers, sometimes we're an opportunity and sometimes we're a threat." 
Pemex had sales of $46.5 billion in 2001 and paid $28.8 billion in taxes -- almost 40 percent of all government revenues. With the government taking such a large share of revenue, not enough is left to pay for exploring new sources of oil, repairing aging refineries or tapping vast pockets of natural gas. 
If Mr. Fox could free the government of its addiction to Pemex's money -- by collecting taxes from millions of people who evade them, for example -- then Pemex could invest in producing more oil and gas, and in time generate more revenue. 
But today, with foreign investment banned, and corruption and inefficiency sapping its cash flow, Pemex's ability to produce energy is bound to decrease, Pemex executives and industry experts say. 
Pemex is in "a very complex fix," said Mr. Munoz Leos, the director and a former chief of DuPont's Mexican operations. 
But unless President Fox finds a way to clean up Pemex's operations and, above all, change the Constitution to permit foreign investment -- a path the PRI has blocked -- the company's production will start to plunge. 
Mexico's ability to produce oil will peak by 2010, according to Pemex officials and the International Energy Agency, a coalition of 24 oil-producing nations. Then it will decline, they forecast. 
By 2030, perhaps sooner, Mexico will have to import oil. It will not be able to sell a single barrel to the United States. 
"If we're going to export oil in the future, we need more investment now," said Jose Herlindo Alvarez, a chemical engineer for 26 years at Pemex's Tula refinery, 60 miles north of Mexico City. 
Pemex has six oil refineries working nearly at capacity in Mexico. But they cannot now meet the nation's needs. Mexico, sitting on huge pools of untapped oil, has to import nearly a quarter of its gasoline from the United States. 
It has not built a new refinery since the late 1970's. One reason, said several oil industry analysts, is that to authorize a billion-dollar project at Pemex is to invite grand theft. 
That corruption is something Tony Cantu said he had witnessed first hand -- what he described as organized crime, systematic shakedowns and needless deaths due to mismanagement. He wept briefly as he talked, during a return visit to the Cadereyta refinery in December. 
"It's sickening to see how something that could be so beautiful is such a mess," he said. "To advance at Pemex, it didn't matter how good you were, your knowledge or intentions, but whether you participated in the good-old-boys' system."
Pemex's chief back then, Jorge Diaz Serrano, later served five years in prison for embezzling $34 million. Its longtime union boss, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, was released from prison in 1999 after serving seven years for amassing enough weapons to run a private army. Ten years before, Carlos Salinas, then president of Mexico, had sent government troops to arrest him in a political confrontation over the union's power -- which remains vast today. 
Even now, Pemex loses more than $1 billion a year to fraud, theft, tax-evasion schemes and clandestine fuel sales by its workers and distributors, according to two senior Pemex directors. 
The plunder includes thousands of gallons of jet fuel sold under the table to drug dealers for flights of cocaine into the United States. Those thefts, which create small fortunes for Pemex managers and union officials, continue apace despite a crackdown. 
So do no-show jobs, a staple of Pemex operations for decades. "People who didn't work at the refinery still came in to pick up their money every two weeks," Mr. Cantu said. "You had to give a cut to the union boss -- 30 percent. I saw this with my own eyes." 
Though the union does not acknowledge it, no-show jobs still exist, according to Pemex officials, and those who hold them are known as "aviators" or "parachute artists." Pemex's work force has grown to 139,000, compared with 121,000 in 1996. More than 90,000 are union members. 
Mr. Cantu said he had seen six untrained workers die building the Cadereyta refinery. They were sons and brothers of union workers, hired despite having no experience. 
Pemex's safety record down the years has been grim. Two major explosions, in 1984 and 1992, killed at least 800 people in residential neighborhoods in Mexico City and Guadalajara. Industrial accidents have killed hundreds more. 
After nine years of working for Pemex, and after earning his degree as a chemical engineer, Mr. Cantu had had enough. He moved to Houston and started his own company and a new life. 
But in 2000, he agreed to return to work at Pemex on two projects, one to upgrade Cadereyta's emergency-control room, another for natural gas processing plants in Villahermosa. 
He said the Pemex engineer in charge of the Villahermosa project had "a private bank account" that he expected outside contractors to fill. On the Cadereyta project, he said, Pemex engineers never showed up to approve his work. 
Mr. Munoz Leos said a recent $1.3 billion remodeling at the Cadereyta refinery was botched, and efforts to fix it were costing Pemex $15 million a month. 
"I thought things might have changed" after Mr. Fox's election in 2000, Mr. Cantu said. "But Pemex hasn't changed. You cannot change so deeply embedded a mentality in a few years." 
One of the strongest forces for change may be dissident union workers, who see their task as no less than rescuing the union from its own leaders. 
"People inside the union hate this situation -- the embezzlement of millions, not only from the oil revenues, but from the union itself," said Oscar Edgar Hernandez Garcia, president of the group, the Oil Workers' Coalition. "We know what's going on, but we can only fight from within," he said. "We have to end the cushy no-show jobs, to end the coziness with the PRI, to protect our workers from harm, and to improve Pemex's productivity." 
The struggle to change Pemex from the top, by managers like Mr. Canales, and from within the union, by workers like Mr. Hernandez Garcia, may save the oil giant from the slow decline that many foresee. 
But Mr. Cantu predicts an end to the power and pride of Pemex only on the day when the machine collapses. 
"Then they would be forced to let Shell, Conoco and Exxon come in," he said. "But who would want to come in now? If Shell had a billion to invest, would they invest it in a system that is rotten to the bone?"

HEADLINE: Ladies and Gentlemen, It's Show Time 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
THE woks needed adjusting. There was a problem with the four fish tanks. The busboys were struggling to wrap their kung fu pants so they would stay up. 
 Jean-Georges Vongerichten was in the kitchen, happily taking his chopsticks to hunks of freshly fried chicken. 
 Time was running out. 
What is at stake for Mr. Vongerichten, who has produced Jo Jo, Vong, Mercer Kitchen and Jean Georges -- restaurants that have scaled culinary heights -- is his latest project: a Chinese restaurant designed by Richard Meier that seeks to add surprise and dazzle to New York dining and to provide a new spin on a favorite New York cuisine. This latest excursion, a seven-figure venture, will test Mr. Vongerichten's talent for innovation and his culinary magnetism in a part of town that is still undergoing wrenching change. 
Mr. Vongerichten kept eating. He seemed oblivious, or in denial, of the chaos around him.
He expects to open the doors of 66, at 66 Leonard Street, in TriBeCa, next week -- just a crack. It will be a "soft" opening, mainly for friends, but it will be an opening all the same. People will eat his food, then discuss it with friends. Good fortune, or ill, will follow. "I have to be open by Chinese New Year," Mr. Vongerichten said. "For good luck."
Chinese New Year starts Feb. 1 and lasts about a week. The restaurant will start taking reservations next week for early February, as the phone message at (212) 925-0202 informs. Mr. Vongerichten has given himself some wiggle room.
Six years ago, he opened Jean Georges in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a repeatedly postponed event that reflected perfectly his obsession with detail and his tremendous skills as both a chef and a restaurateur. Nothing was left to chance, and it took off immediately. Can Peking duck fly as high?
"Expectations are tremendous because he's one of the top," said Michael Tong, the owner of Shun Lee West and Shun Lee Palace. The economy is stumbling; diners are easily rattled by culinary experimentation, in which Mr. Vongerichten excels, and serious prices, which he also knows something about. An average dinner for two at 66 will cost at least $100, without drinks. 
"It could be very successful," Mr. Tong continued, "or a disaster that will send people a few blocks over to Ping's in Chinatown for a third of the price. Jean-Georges has to put his signature on it so the food has a twist."
That is exactly Mr. Vongerichten's intention. "I imagine people will come here the way they go to Vong," he said, referring to his Thai-influenced Midtown restaurant, which has spawned offshoots in Chicago, London and Hong Kong. "It will be because it's my restaurant and not because they want Thai or Chinese food." Vong is Thai in flavor but French in technique. "But 66 will be more authentic," he continued. "We're using Chinese techniques here even though we're breaking some rules."
The question of authenticity has never been an issue at Vong, despite the French flourishes. Mr. Vongerichten worked in Bangkok for many years, sopping up Thai culture and cuisine. But Chinese food is new to him, an idea he only seized upon a year ago, after a quick trip to Shanghai.
And so he has brought in a Chinese chef, Lam Lun, from Man Wah restaurant in Hong Kong to train the staff and reveal his recipes. He has hired five dim sum experts from a Chinatown restaurant "on Elizabeth Street" that neither Mr. Vongerichten nor the cooks will name, and an eight-man wok team, also from Chinatown, who also prefer not to talk about their previous employment. Running this team as executive chef is Josh Eden, 32, a New Yorker who has worked with him for eight years. 
Lee Tak Sum, the executive chef at Vong in Hong Kong, is also on board. He translates for the non-English-speaking cooks. Ken Lai, who has worked with Mr. Vongerichten for 17 years, is in the kitchen, too. And several chefs on loan from Jean Georges are helping out, tasting and adding their two cents.
The menu still needs to be finalized.
The crew members have all spent the last 10 days in the main kitchen on the ground floor and in the basement prep kitchen, cooking exhaustively, experimenting and tinkering. About a week before the opening, Mr. Vongerichten was tasting some dishes for the first time. Leaving aside the problems with the woks and the fish tanks, he sat with his acolytes, as he is doing every day now, at a big banquet table in one corner of the dining room as cooks brought out waves of dishes, a dozen or more, for sampling.
"This is the most fun," he said. Mr. Vongerichten could not stop talking about the fried chicken he had tasted in the kitchen; it had been marinated, dried, marinated again, dried overnight and then deep-fried in a wok by Mr. Lam. The bronzed, glassy-skinned yet astonishingly moist-fleshed chicken will be known as the best in the city, he promised. 
But he was also nudging Mr. Lam and the other Chinese chefs to see some things his way. Mr. Vongerichten was not at all sure about a plate of sweet-and-sour pork served in a garish vermilion sauce made with bottled tomato coloring and melted Chinese candy. The dish may not make the final cut.
"He has an advantage," Mr. Tong said. Because of his reputation, "he does not have to have some of the expected Chinese dishes, like orange beef, on his menu." General Tso has been decommissioned. To say nothing of that sweet-and-sour pork. Mr. Eden, meanwhile, lobbied for innovative and refreshing cold vegetable dishes, perhaps more Japanese than Chinese, like spinach with fried ginger.
"If you're a good enough chef there's plenty of room to do this sort of thing with Chinese food," said Ed Schoenfeld, a restaurant consultant who has specialized in Chinese food and restaurants. "The question will be whether Jean-Georges can get Chinese chefs to do what he wants."
At 66 one afternoon last week, it seemed to be happening.
Then Gregory Brainin, executive chef at Jean Georges, piped up. He had spent the morning making wafer-thin scallion pancakes, which must be rolled several times, almost like puff pastry, then fried in a wok and served within minutes.
"I can imagine six, even 10 orders for these coming in at once," Mr. Brainin said. "How many in an order? Five? And how many woks can you tie up to produce them?"
Silence rolled over the table like fog.
Originally, Mr. Vongerichten did not expect to be faced with decisions like these. Two years ago, just after he bought an apartment in the building, at the corner of Leonard and Church Streets, he was tempted by the retail space on the ground floor. He and Phil Suarez, his business partner, leased it. Mr. Vongerichten planned to open a vegetarian restaurant. Then he considered seafood. But the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, put the project on hold.
Early last year, when Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Suarez traveled to Shanghai, where they are planning to open a French restaurant, they tasted the local fare. 
"Our eyes popped," Mr. Suarez said. Mr. Vongerichten became wild for Chinese food, just Shanghai style at first, then everything, as he ventured daily to Chinatown and elsewhere. Mr. Tong of Shun Lee estimated that he had seen the chef in his restaurant every Sunday for the last six months. New ideas began percolating.
"Why can't a steak in a Chinese restaurant be medium-rare?" Mr. Vongerichten asked. "Why can't the meat on a Peking duck be more like confit? Why do they use so much pork fat in the fillings for dumplings, even shrimp dumplings? I don't see why we can't steam cod, even though it's not a fish they use. Chinese is a great cuisine but they haven't changed some of this stuff in 3,000 years. It's about time."
The chefs now cook the ducks differently, use butter instead of pork fat in the dumplings and sear the porterhouse to medium-rare. Cod steamed with ginger, it turns out, is excellent. "Every day Mr. Lam rethinks some of the dishes, and he seems very pleased with the results," Mr. Eden said.
Mr. Vongerichten has created new recipes for dumpling fillings (foie gras, for instance, or chopped diver scallops and freshwater chestnuts). And he has weaned the Chinatown chefs from their usual canned baby corn and straw mushrooms. Meaty chicken wings from Murray's, top-quality baby back ribs and prime beef have also entered the equation. And there is bound to be fleur de sel sprinkled somewhere. Why not on the steak? A jar of it was sitting in the kitchen, next to some chili oil. 
What he is up to is not without precedent. Twenty years ago, another French-trained chef, Wolfgang Puck, opened Chinois-on-Main in Santa Monica, Calif. Mr. Puck was less compulsive. "I never wanted a strictly Chinese restaurant," he said.
Last-minute missteps aside, Mr. Vongerichten and his crew have come a long way since early December, when a few preliminary holiday parties were held in the still-unfinished restaurant, with chefs cooking on little Coleman burners instead of in giant woks. "Chinese camping" is how Mr. Vongerichten put it.
With scarcely more than a week to go, as the chefs tasted, some waiters were trying to master the computer ordering system as others were in the dining room being fitted with gray mandarin-collar Vivienne Tam uniforms. There was that tricky kung fu get-up for the busboys. The pants on the cocktail waitresses needed to be tighter. Daniel Del Vecchio, Mr. Vongerichten's ombudsman, raced about, troubleshooting, untangling glitches.
Now the pastry chef, Pichet Ong, who had been a fish cook at Jean Georges and was doing desserts at RM and the Jefferson, joined the tasting crew. He started work on what Mr. Vongerichten said would be an assortment of light desserts: a dozen or more sorbets, for example, served on Chinese soup spoons.
In the Chinese style, all the appetizers and main dishes at 66 will be served family style, for sharing. They will be taken to the tables as they are cooked, rather than in a set order. But except for the lazy susans on some of the tables, those Chinese-style uniforms and the festive red banners over the high counter, which seats 40 for noodles at lunch and drinks in the evening, there is nothing obviously Chinese about the restaurant's design.
"It's a modern setting but the red banners and the fish tanks give it a sense of place," Mr. Meier, the architect, said, awarding credit for the fish tanks, whose inhabitants are turned into dinner, to Mr. Vongerichten. Everything else about the sleek white room, softened with frosted glass panels, resin tables and Eames chairs, is pure Meier, including the choice of dinnerware, chopsticks and the carryout containers. Mr. Meier even painted the watercolors on one wall. He has gotten himself Chinese food for life. 
What 66 most calls to mind is Pearl's, on West 48th Street, which opened in 1970, also a stark white Chinese restaurant designed by a famous architect, Charles Gwathmey, at a time when an upscale Chinese restaurant in New York was known by the liberal use of red and black lacquer and gold.
"The original Pearl's was a block away and done in orange and white," Mr. Gwathmey said. "Pearl and Jimmy Wong lost their lease and moved the restaurant and all they said to me was to make it a great room. It was pretty revolutionary at the time." 
Today's aesthetic, both from a culinary and a design point of view, is vastly different. There is, for instance, the issue of feng shui. The superstitious Mr. Vongerichten insisted that it had been factored into Mr. Meier's design, particularly in the placement of a circular divider at the restaurant's entrance.
Mr. Meier scoffed at this notion. The architect, who has won the Pritzker Prize and who designed the Getty Center in Los Angeles, said, "I got the Getty right without it, didn't I?"
Feng shui is not really the issue, though. Nor is luck, despite the restaurant's name and address (66 is a lucky number in China). The big question is how to turn out enough of those scallion pancakes, and whether they will be as hot and crisp as when the chefs tasted them. 
New Yorkers are demanding. And they do not like to wait.

HEADLINE: An Orange Whose Season Has Come 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KARP 

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, Calif. 

 BODY:
FIFTY miles east of Los Angeles stands the most revered and historic fruit tree in the United States. This centenarian might pass for any old orange tree, were it not for the unusual grafted roots that sustain it, like arterial bypasses, and the entourage of heaters ready to coddle it during freezes.
 The tree, one of two from which all Washington navel oranges in California descended, is guarded by a locked fence and commemorated by a bronze plaque. It was propagated from trees imported from Brazil in 1870. 
 The Washington, a large, easily peeled, seedless orange, caused a sensation when it was exhibited at a citrus fair 124 years ago. The new variety, with its built-in trademark -- a rudimentary second fruit in its blossom end -- helped create an orange empire that once stretched from Pasadena to Redlands. The navel orange came to be regarded as a sacred tree in Southern California. 
A few weeks ago, a custodian unlocked the fence around the parent tree, and I was privileged to pick a fruit from its branches. Fragrant, with a smooth, deep-orange rind and intense, sweet-tart flavor, it reaffirmed the navel's reputation as the noblest of citrus.
The old tree's progeny are at their peak in January and February, with high levels of sugar and acidity, a proper balance between the two, and rich aromatics. The Washington, still the best of several dozen varieties of navel orange, dominates this midseason, but most of its spinoffs, varieties like the pink-fleshed Cara Cara, taste pretty good right now, too.
But that bite of the original tree's fruit also invited the question: why do store-bought navels so often disappoint?
One answer, of course, is freshness. "An orange at the end of the packing line doesn't taste like fruit fresh off the tree," said Roger Smith, general manager of the TreeSource Citrus Nursery in Exeter, Calif., a few weeks ago. "If you're willing to spend the money it takes for mail order, you can get an orange that'll knock your socks off."
But there are other reasons. California navel orange growers, who raise 86 percent of the nation's crop, are more productive and technically advanced than ever. New varieties, farming practices and off-season imports have expanded the season from three months to practically year-round. Not surprisingly, however, the very factors that enable the fruit's ubiquity often degrade its quality.
Navels thrive in the interior valleys of Southern and Central California, where hot, dry summers add sweetness and cool winters deepen color and retain adequate acidity. By comparison, Florida-grown navels, available from November to January, are larger, paler and thinner skinned, with juicier but relatively insipid pulp.
There's a more subtle but still significant difference between fruit from Southern California and from the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, where 96 percent of the state's crop now grows. Fruit ripens early in the San Joaquin heat, but cool Pacific breezes in Southern California delay maturity by four to six weeks. Partly as a result, Southern Californian navels have smoother, thinner rinds; sweeter, juicier pulp; and arguably, richer flavor.
However, urbanization in the southern district has rendered the longtime rivalry between the two areas almost moot. Since 1945, Southern California navel orange acreage has plunged 87 percent, to around 7,500 acres, while plantings in the San Joaquin Valley have quadrupled, to 120,000 acres.
Meanwhile, navel growers face a fiercely competitive market. Spanish clementines and Chilean peaches and grapes give consumers more choices in the navel's prime winter season. Giant supermarket chains use their clout to demand lower prices. In response, growers have sought more profitable niches in new varieties and seasons.
Although navels can't be bred through conventional hybridization since the trees produce virtually no seeds, they are extraordinarily unstable genetically, and often bear outlandish mutations with stripes or Mohawks. Such freaks are commercially useless, of course, but growers sometimes notice desirable traits.
In early December, Lisle Babcock, a farmer in Terra Bella, 40 miles north of Bakersfield, sampled a promising new variety he had found five years earlier on one of his trees. Picking a bright orange fruit, he cut off a section, squeezed a few drops of juice on a refractometer, a device for measuring sweetness, and held it up to the light to read the screen.
"It's blowing me away," he said. The fruit registered 16 Brix, a very high reading, and tasted almost preternaturally sugary.
Another navel that began its career as a mutation is the red-fleshed Cara Cara, which has been widely planted in the last five years. Marketed separately from other navels, it has a distinctive tutti-frutti flavor and is worth looking for.
Particularly in the warmest areas near Bakersfield, farmers have focused on early-maturing strains, hoping to hit the market when supplies are low and prices are high. Unfortunately, many start picking in October, well before the fruit reach acceptable flavor.
Packing houses typically "sweat" these early fruit with heat, humidity and ethylene gas, which deepens color but can impart off flavors. Since retailers almost never identify varieties or whether fruit have been gassed, the best bet is to avoid navels before Thanksgiving, and taste before buying in December.
Time was when the navel season would have ended in February. But because farmers now spray trees with gibberellic acid and another compound called 2,4-D to delay maturity, the San Joaquin season stretches into April. "Gibbed" fruit is paler in color, firmer in texture and harder to peel, but on balance the technology represents a plus for orange lovers, because it extends the season at a time when most fruit tastes terrific. In spring, navels generally get softer and sweeter, often to the point of insipidity. 
In the last decade, California farmers have planted considerable acreage of ultra-late Australian strains. Fruit quality so far has been inconsistent, and none are as flavorful as the Washington. Buy late-spring or summer navels warily (this also goes for imports), or choose Valencia oranges, which ripen in summer.
Even Washingtons in peak season vary considerably in quality. Soil, weather and fertilization all play a part. Worth a special mention, however, are two factors, rootstock and tree age, that exercise an almost mystical resonance in navel lore.
All commercial citrus trees are grafted onto rootstock, which farmers select for adaptation to the soil, resistance to disease and influence on fruit quality. On a chilly morning last February, Robert M. Baker, who farms 650 acres of navels around Ivanhoe, in the heart of the San Joaquin citrus belt, picked a Washington from a 50-year-old tree growing on sour orange rootstock, once the industry standard. He cut a slice, which tasted wonderfully rich and tangy-sweet.
"The navel on sour orange has the best sugar/acid ratio and solids, but it fell out of favor after 1955 because it's susceptible to tristeza," he said, referring to a viral disease.
In another sector of the grove, oranges on the standard tristeza-resistant rootstock, trifoliate, tasted almost as good, but fruit on Carrizo citrange, one of several modern hybrid rootstocks, had coarse skin and pulp, and weak flavor.
That may have been because they came from a young tree, Mr. Baker said. Up to about age seven, navel orange trees yield fruit with coarse rind and mediocre flavor. Healthy navel trees can live a century or more, and growers with older groves prefer their fruit, much as connoisseurs prize wines from aged vines.
The only way to learn an orange's pedigree is to talk to the farmer, but one key factor in quality that is easy to look for at the market is fruit size. Grapefruit-size behemoths tend to be dry and bland, especially late in the season. Small fruit are cheapest, and many growers believe that they are the sweetest and juiciest, but they are also harder to peel. The consensus is that medium-size navels, about two and five-eighths to three inches in diameter, offer the best combination of flavor and convenience.
Producers and buyers generally pay more attention to cosmetics than to taste. In the fruit trade, an orange is an orange. However, one distinctive brand, attractive fruit marketed with stems and leaves as "heirloom navel oranges," started showing up last winter at New York stores. They tasted superb, so on my next trip to the San Joaquin Valley, I stopped by the orchard of the grower and shipper, Eric Christensen of Rising C Ranches in Reedley. As I suspected, the fruit were regular Washington navels, creatively renamed.
"I'm surely not out to deceive anybody," said Mr. Christensen at his small, low-tech packing facility. "Out of the 40 acres of navels that I grow, only the best eight are sold as heirloom -- just Washington on good rootstock like sour and trifoliate. I pack the same day I pick, so the stems and leaves are a barometer of freshness."
The only element missing was the magic of the best Southern California groves and oranges, but there are fewer of these every year. In 1993, Riverside even opened a California Citrus State Historic Park, to "show future generations what orange groves looked like," as a guide said the other day.
The last bastion of the Southern California navel may be Redlands, 15 miles northeast of the parent tree. In the middle of the last century, the area had 48 packing houses. Redlands now has two.
Edmund Patterson Jr., a grower in his mid-90's, probably knows more of the glory and misadventures of Southern California navels than any man alive. On a warm March day last year, as he watched the harvest in a grove dating to 1886, he treated the threat of hard times for growers and urbanization with the same crusty bravado that he shows in his other life as a big game hunter.
"This business is like an elevator, up and down," he said. "It's hard to figure out who's working the lever."
Iridescent parrots flew by and perched in a row of palm trees, squawking. Nearby stood an immaculate white Victorian house, one of many built by wealthy businessmen and professionals lured west by the romance of growing navel oranges a century ago.
The sweet scent of orange blossoms and the buzzing of bees filled the air. The venerable trees, with trunks 16 inches in diameter, looked resplendent in their finery of green, white and gold, like a regiment drawn up at attention, heedless that the flanks were turned, and all connecting files withdrawn or liquidated. Some day, no doubt, the bulldozers will breach the last barriers, and the Napa Valley of navels will find its highest economic use, as shopping centers and subdivisions.
"For now, the really good groves are still here," Mr. Patterson said, his eyes genial but steely. "Groves are like racehorses; some are a heck of a lot better than others."

Citrus Primer
ORANGES occur in two main species, sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, and sour orange, C. aurantium. Scientists say that both originated thousands of years ago in southern China or northwest India as a natural hybrid of pomelo, a giant ancestor of grapefruit, and mandarin, a tangerine-like fruit. 
Sour oranges, also called bitter oranges, are grown in Spain and, in small quantities, in Florida, California and Arizona. Seville is the most common type of sour orange and is mainly used in marmalade. 
Sweet oranges, the world's most familiar citrus, come in four basic types. 
The common orange, a large and diverse group, includes Valencia (used for juice and fresh fruit) and Florida juice oranges like Hamlin and Pineapple. 
Navel oranges have small, rudimentary fruits embedded in the bottom end and are usually seedless.
Blood oranges are pigmented with anthocyanin, which gives them a distinctive red color and a berry flavor.
Acidless oranges, which have insipid flavor, are quite rare in the United States but are common in the Middle East, where they are beloved by children and the elderly because they are easy to digest. 
Another species, the mandarin (C. reticulata), which typically has a thin, easily peeled rind, is sometimes called "mandarin orange." The word tangerine, a common term with no botanical meaning, usually refers to flattish, highly colored mandarins. DAVID KARP

Cutting Out the Middleman
CALIFORNIA farmers do relatively little mail-order business compared with Florida groves, because distances and shipping costs to Eastern customers are greater. But fruit that is shipped directly will be fresher than what is available in stores. Below are sources for top-quality California navels. 
To make sure your oranges don't spend the weekend sitting in a warehouse, have them shipped early in the week. If frigid weather looms, consider paying extra for air delivery.

HEADLINE: Old Brawler Won't Grapple With History; 
Norman Mailer Ruminates On Literature and Life

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

DATELINE: PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Not five minutes into the interview, Norman Mailer put in his hearing aid. "I'm a little deaf," he said. "If I'm at all vague in my replies, it means I didn't hear you. I'm usually not vague."
 Vague, no; loquacious, yes; and cannily charming, as he proceeded to ruminate and postulate, looking very much the lion in winter, while evoking the tomcat of his youth and middle age. His eyes cannot stand the glare from the sun that pours through the window of his beachfront house here, about a mile from the center of town, and his arthritic legs require the support of canes, but the mind remains frisky. 
 That was evident in Mr. Mailer's vivid and elaborate theorizing on writing, aging, technology and politics; on why, as he put it, "if we don't go to war with Iraq, George W. Bush is going to feel ill." 
Turning 80 on Jan. 31, Mr. Mailer has comfortably assumed the pose of grand old man of American letters, assessing his place in the literary pantheon with little of the braggadocio that has become his trademark.
"I'll last or I won't last," he said regarding future evaluation of his body of work, which began in 1948 with his novel "The Naked and the Dead" and includes two Pulitzer Prizes. "It's the one thing you really can't predict, because history takes turns. There are certain writers who are so great you can never throw them off. I'm not in that category. I may last or I may not last."
For this birthday he and his wife, Norris Church, are planning a small party for friends at their house in Brooklyn, now chiefly occupied by various Mailer offspring. Mr. Mailer and Ms. Church have lived primarily in Provincetown, at the tip of Cape Cod, for several years. This intimate gathering is a big contrast to the gala at the Rainbow Room given by his publisher, Random House, for his 75th birthday, also celebrating publication of his anthology "The Time of Our Time." 
While he is not sentimental about round-numbered birthdays, Mr. Mailer said, he does like having the publication of "The Spooky Art," his new book, coincide with his 80th. 
"It occurred to me it's a wicked notion," he explained, his blue eyes twinkling, making him look dangerously like the kind of sweet old coot he says he disdains. "I would classify myself and half the people I know as wicked. Gamblers. People just upping the ante."
The digression had an endpoint, which is Mr. Mailer's fascination with the relationship between authors and reviewers. "There are so many reviewers who have been good to me over the years and so many who have been bad over the years," he said, adding that it would be fun to see if his 80th birthday would soften those who did not like him.
Now he appears to be the amiable paterfamilias, surrounded by paintings by Ms. Church, an artist, and his daughter Maggie Mailer, and tables crowded with photos of children (nine) and grandchildren (eight). But this is the same Mailer who used to stagger onto lecture stages infirm from liquor not arthritis, hurling curses at his audiences.
He famously carved his displeasure into one of his five previous wives with a knife and routinely avoided writer's block by indulging in drugs. Even in his prime he wasn't a big man, though lack of size did not stop him from brawling, or from grandiose ambition, manifested, for example, in his hapless New York mayoral campaign in 1969.
He recalled the legends that he helped to create around himself, with journalists' compliance. "The newspapers built it up enormously," he said, referring to the bad-boy image. "I half liked it and half disliked it. I half liked it because it made me sound tougher than I really was. I half disliked it because it meant the ante was upped. It isn't that something would happen every time you went to a bar, but maybe one in 20. It becomes a little like Russian roulette: one bullet, six chambers. If you pull the trigger, the odds are five to one in your favor, but you feel as if it's even money."
Yet he plows ahead, writing several hours a day, even as he expresses fear for the survival of the serious novel. "If you grew up as I did going to college in 1939 and 1940, you had the feeling that writers are the marrow of a nation, the nutrient," he said, "if you start with Tolstoy and Dostoevski and add to that the great English novelists of the 19th century (Dickens and Thackeray) and certainly add the French (Zola, Balzac, Proust) and look at the effect Joyce had on Ireland. In the course of my life I've seen everything else take over. The novel now rides in a sidecar."
Which does not mean he thinks there are no good novelists anymore. In the interview and in his book he praised Jonathan Franzen as a writer, while bemoaning the limitations of ambition in "The Corrections," his much praised and best-selling novel. "With talent like that, he should have tried for much more," said Mr. Mailer, who was never accused of not trying for everything. "I think it's almost paradigmatic of what's going on with the talented writers right now. They're probably more talented now than they ever were in America, but they're doing less and less."
Still, he cannot resist the public life, taking time last year from the novel he's been laboring on for years -- and isn't sure he will ever finish -- to give a series of interviews on the political situation after Sept. 11. He has been refining his hypothesis of American empire, namely that by the end of the cold war certain forces in the United States felt that America should be the dominant military power in the universe. Because of its oil and its location, Iraq is the linchpin in that plan. In this simple thought, he comes close to the views of his old rival and sparring partner Gore Vidal.
"It doesn't matter what they're up to in Iraq," he said. "It doesn't matter if they have nuclear bombs or not or whether they're ready to do chemical warfare. They're not a danger, but they are absolutely a position in the world we need militarily. Dominate Iraq, dominate the Near East, and then get China in a position to make China the Greece to our Rome."
"Sept. 11 was the 'open sesame' to the path to world empire," he said. "It doesn't matter for Bush if things turn out well or badly in Iraq. If they turn out well, they can start to think of the next step. If they turn out badly, that's still good for him because of American patriotism. Who's going to be against George W. Bush when he's mourning the deaths of our boys? Either way he won't have to face the increasing problems here with the American economy and the scandals, with the breakdown in belief in two huge systems: corporate leadership and the priesthood."
Mr. Mailer's writing has never been better than when he acted as journalist, in his account, for example, of the protests against the Vietnam War, in "Armies of the Night." Who better to analyze why protest now is comparatively muted, at least in the United States? 
"Two things numb a protest movement," he said. "One is 9/11. That moved Americans to thinking that something has to be done about this. The second thing is Saddam Hussein himself. You have to go back to melodramas in the 1850's where a villain with a great big mustache leaped onto the stage to defile the maiden before you get someone as good as Saddam Hussein as an enemy. Ho Chi Minh had that wonderful saintly look that made life much easier for a good protest movement."
But Mr. Mailer does not expect to be writing about this war, he said; he has a novel to finish, whose subject he won't divulge and whose completion he would not take bets on. "If I can bring it off -- the IF by now is in capital letters -- it will be the biggest thing I've ever done. But at my age you can't approach it with the confidence you once had. Illness can deter you, affliction can stop you, breakdowns can occur."
He invokes a favorite metaphor, of the athlete. "An older one who's been around for years almost always measures his chances against his physical stamina. A quarterback, if he has any choice on calling plays, may think, No, I'm not going to go for that long pass because I've gotten whacked the last two times. As a professional, he's always measuring possibilities. The same is true in writing, you measure what you can and you can't do."
Mr. Mailer also spoke about the change in publishing that discourages risk. "People are always complaining in sports about how much money these athletes get," he said. "At least those athletes can answer, 'I'm getting that money because I'm the best in my field.' In literature it's exactly the opposite. It's the mediocrities who make the mega-sums. That was always true to a degree, but it's intensified considerably."
While good-humored and not past offering the occasional unprintable sexual reference, Mr. Mailer spoke with a palpable sense of resignation if not disappointment. He's clearly had to shrink expectations to a size far more human than the larger-than-life scale by which he once measured his ambition.
"The notion that what you put into a book is going to have powerful effect is a notion that's harder and harder to maintain," he said. "Part of the ability to keep writing over the years comes down to living with the expectation of disappointment. It's the exactly opposite of capitalism. In capitalism you want your business to succeed, and to the degree it does your energy increases, and you go out and buy an even bigger business. In writing it's almost the exact opposite. You just want to keep the store going. You're not going to do as well this year as last year probably, but nonetheless let's keep the store going."
Then, a fine Mailer moment, that neatly packaged his strength and weakness as a writer. "I don't like this image much," he said, waving his hand as if to vanquish the earnest shopkeeper he had conjured. "It doesn't offer as much as I thought when I embarked on it. The only fun in working images is that, as you elaborate on them, they always turn out either better or worse than you'd hoped. The alternative is to say the same thing you've been saying over and over."

HEADLINE: The Right to Agree 

BYLINE:  By Cristina Page and Amanda Peterman; Cristina Page is program director at the New York affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Amanda Peterman is the life media director of Right to Life of Michigan.

 BODY:
Today is the 30th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. We are two women who were born in the early 1970's and, like other Americans our age, were raised with the divisions the decision has wrought. 
 Like our peers, we, too, are divided: We are activists on opposite sides of the abortion issue. While we are both committed to carrying on the work of our predecessors, we also recognize the need to re-examine their tactics. The slogans are old, the battle is tired. Those older than us have said that Americans born after Roe v. Wade cannot truly comprehend what is at stake. Maybe that is so. But we think we have a fresh understanding of how to achieve real progress. 
 Instead of just focusing on our differences, we need to acknowledge the surprising number of important issues on which we agree. We all believe we should work to reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion. We should recognize, too, that our efforts are succeeding. Over the last seven years the rate of abortions performed in the United States has dropped by 11 percent, according to a 2002 study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research group. 
Whether that has come through better education on contraception or through programs that discourage premarital sex, pro-life and pro-choice advocates should celebrate such an achievement together and acknowledge each other's role in it. 
 There are times when both movements have missed common-ground opportunities. This past year, advocates should have come together to fight the Florida Adoption Act. The act requires a woman who wants to place a child for adoption to publish newspaper advertisements to try to find the father. In the ads, the woman must disclose her name, as well as her sexual history, including a description of every potential father and the dates they had sex. In short, the law is an attack on women and discourages adoption. Collaboration by the two sides of the abortion movement could have benefited all women in Florida.
There will be other chances to work together and still be true to our missions. For example, many unintended pregnancies could be prevented by ensuring that women have health insurance coverage for the most effective contraception methods. In recent years, pro-life and pro-choice legislators, like those in New York, have worked together to make contraception more accessible to women of all economic backgrounds.
 Making the workplace more accommodating to the demands of parenthood is also a common goal. Why does affordable, high-quality child care remain out of reach for the majority of American families? If the pro-choice and pro-life movements work together to support legislation to expand the social safety net for low-income mothers, and to lobby for more family-friendly policies for working parents, their power would be formidable. These are goals that we both share. But, sadly, they are issues that often get lost in the larger debate.
 The only way we will have the chance to explore these mutual areas is if we feel comfortable doing so. Both sides must unite publicly against the use of violent measures in the movement and must isolate extremists who employ them. The language we use to argue our positions must change, too. We can no longer tolerate inflammatory terms that serve only to divide us further and create conflict. Doctors who offer safe abortion services are not murderers or butchers. People who engage in peaceful protests against abortion are not fanatics. 
We accept that we will never find a solution to the most fundamental disagreements we hold on abortion. And we should never compromise our strongly held beliefs. Outside of them, though, we can find a path to escape this endless cycle of division. We hope the next generation of activists will join us in seeking areas of common ground and merge the power of both movements to serve Americans in a meaningful way.

HEADLINE: December Housing Rose 5%, Ending the BestYear Since '86 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan 21 

 BODY:
Starts of construction on new homes and apartments rose 5 percent in December, the Commerce Department reported today, ending the best year for new housing since 1986. 
 The report said that builders broke ground on 1.84 million new homes and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual pace in December compared with a 1.75 million pace in November. 
 For the year, work was started on 1.70 million homes and apartments, up 6.4 percent from 2001. 
All the building was bolstered by the lowest mortgage rates since the 1960's. 
Housing was a bright spot in the economy last year amid an often lukewarm recovery from recession. The unemployment rate at year's end stood at 6 percent, and many analysts think it could go higher in coming months as concerns intensify about the effects of an Iraq war on the economy. 
The report on housing starts showed that at a seasonally adjusted annual pace, builders began construction on 1.47 million single-family homes in December, up 4.9 percent from the November pace. This was the best monthly building pace for single-family homes since November 1978. 
The pace of apartment construction rose 3.9 percent in December from November, to a seasonally adjusted annual 321,000 units, the strongest pace since August.
Building was up in all regions, led by an 18.2 percent increase in the Northeast, where construction climbed to an annual pace of 169,000 units. In the West, it rose 9.7 percent to an annual 471,000 units. The Midwest had an increase of 4 percent, to 390,000, and the South recorded the smallest gain in construction activity, a December increase of 0.6 percent, which pushed building activity to an annual pace of 805,000 units. 
For the year, construction activity on 1.70 million new homes and apartments, compared with 1.60 million in 2001, was the best showing since 1.81 million homes and apartments were built in 1986.

HEADLINE: REGIONAL MARKET -- NEW JERSEY; 
Visions of Polluted Site Made Cargo Hub

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
To many people, the contaminated lands known as brownfields are best forgotten as the refuse of an industrial past. But to at least one group of planners, they are a "portfolio of hidden economic assets" that can help solve the growing problem of congestion around seaports and airports, and provide much needed employment for those with limited skills. 
 The unused brownfields close to northern New Jersey seaports and to Newark Liberty International Airport should be the sites of warehouses and distribution centers that could process the increasing quantities of imported goods entering the greater New York market, a transportation study of the area backed by the federal government has concluded. 
 Although officially confined to the northern New Jersey area, the principles are applicable to the rest of the metropolitan area and other transportation hubs, the authors say. The report, titled "Brownfield Economic Redevelopment," was written by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
It is part of an effort to "revitalize disabled property by bringing new economic activity based on port growth expectation for decades," said John Hummer, a leader of the study. He said that the plan was also aimed at reducing the long-distance truck shipping of goods that enter the port and will eventually be sold in the metropolitan area.
An increasing share of merchandise used in this country is imported. Most of it arrives on ships, in metal containers the size of a trailer on a tractor-trailer truck. The increase in such imports has continued despite the recession and the attacks of September 2001, according to the report.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimates that the number of standard container units passing through the port, which increased to 3.3 million in 2001 from 2.5 million in 1995, could reach as high as 17 million by 2040. To help prepare for this, the Port Authority and the Army Corps of Engineers are preparing to dredge the channels and berths to a depth of 50 feet to accommodate a new generation of container ships.
Because the port is situated in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., highways and railroads will also have to be improved to move the containers as they arrive at the docks.
One problem is that overseas shippers do not pay much attention to highway standards in the United States, and many shipments arrive too heavy to be put directly on flatbed trailers to be driven to their destination. New Jersey is building Portway, a 17-mile roadway capable of handling these heavier loads that will link the seaport and airport with railroad junctions.
This development presents an opportunity to put warehouses and distribution centers adjacent to Portway, where incoming goods could be staged, sorted and prepared for sale to businesses and customers. Developments there could provide jobs for thousands of urban residents would could get to and from work by public transportation, the study says.
But most of the available sites in the area were formerly used for industrial purposes, and are contaminated by industrial residues. One such site, of 185 acres, is along the Hackensack River in Kearny and was occupied by Koppers Coke and other chemical companies that left it heavily contaminated.
Although it is technically possible to cap and contain contamination at sites like these, many see the risks as too high.
In recent years, private developers have avoided these sites in favor of greenfields, like the former farmland near Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike, about 50 miles southwest of the port. Developers have been putting large distribution centers there to serve the Northeast, and some have been built farther away in eastern Pennsylvania. 
This poses the danger, the planners said, that goods will come in through the port, be shipped on crowded highways to these remote locations, be processed there and then be shipped back to the main metropolitan area for final sale, once again adding to traffic congestion. 
To give developers incentives to deal with problems at sites like Koppers Coke's -- which has the advantage that it could receive and send shipments by barge -- the report urges the state to encourage reuse by issuing development permits faster than for greenfield sites and by improving links to the transportation network.
The report also urges preserving the existing railroad right of way on the older sites, even if shipping by rail is not practical now. The rights of way could be used for roads if needed.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Islands inthe Mall: Pushcarts as Revenue Streams

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The once-humble pushcart, some now equipped with electricity and plumbing, has become a darling of mall operators and other landlords as a way of squeezing rental income from areas formerly occupied by mall rats.
 The wheeled carts, now called retail merchandising units, can add 2 percent to 3 percent to a mall rental stream. The greatest income is generated in the fourth quarter, when vendors of high-margin holiday knicknacks are packed as close as fire safety codes allow, experts say. During the two-month holiday shopping season, a vendor at a top mall can pay more than $20,000 for a 45-square-foot pushcart, and annual rents can reach $50,000. 
 "It's real money, let's put it that way," said Robert A. Michaels, president of General Growth Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust and the country's second-largest shopping mall owner, with 168. 
Much of this income comes from mom-and-pop peddlers like James and Lesley Stoehr of Plymouth, Mass., who sell souvenir items from two carts in Quincy Market in historic Boston. Pushcarts reappeared there in 1976, and it is hallowed ground in the industry. 
"I never really saw one until I came to Boston," said Mrs. Stoehr, 37, a Brooklyn native.
In their heyday in the early 20th century, pushcarts filled with fish and fruit stood cheek-to-jowl on Hester Street on New York's Lower East Side. But they vanished by World War II, with the advent of refrigeration and motorized vehicles, said Daniel Bluestone, an architectural historian at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville.
The comeback coincides with the emergence in the 1990's of the mall real estate investment trust. Income from pushcart lease agreements in the last decade grew by double digits annually as mall owners rolled out temporary tenant programs, according to Stuart Axelrod, a real estate investment trust analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Now, there are more than 150,000 carts and kiosks in operation, said Maria Scarfone, associate publisher of Specialty Retail Report in Norwell, Mass. While most are in malls, they can also be found in office buildings, airports, hospitals, casinos, hotels, turnpike rest stops and on college campuses.
Pushcart peddling was sometimes called an evil trade early in the last century in New York, and not everyone today is enamored of the latest go-round. Store merchants try to negotiate lease provisions to prohibit carts near their entrances, mall operators say.
For Mr. Bluestone, the proliferation of pushcarts illustrates abandonment of the earlier idea that shopping malls would serve as a public realm in suburbia.
"Central to the form was the idea that malls were to be something other than pure unadulterated commerce," he said. "They were to be gathering places that provided recreation, leisure and culture. I think absolute pervasiveness of the pushcarts shows a shift way from that purpose."
For the Rouse Company of Columbia, Md., introduction of pushcarts in Quincy Market was an act of desperation during a down economy. When it became clear the company's urban redevelopment, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, was going to open without a full tenant roster, Rouse solicited crafts makers to rent pushcarts. Vendors signed short-term leases for $125 a week and a percentage of sales. The concept was a success and hailed as an example of how to revitalize ailing downtowns.
"We thought, 'Why can't we take this idea to other spaces,' " said David L. Tripp, Rouse's director for investor relations.
He says Rouse has thousands of pushcarts in its properties, including South Street Seaport in New York, Harborplace in Baltimore and Riverwalk in New Orleans, as well as traditional suburban shopping centers like the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey. 
"Now, most of the mall owners have sophisticated programs," Mr. Tripp said.
The Simon Property Group of Indianapolis, the country's largest mall owner, introduced its program in the mid-1980's. General Growth of Chicago jumped on the concept about 10 years ago. Westfield America Trust of Los Angeles, the third-largest mall owner, started using carts in the early 1980's.
The last decade had the greatest growth in mall pushcart income, but Mr. Axelrod expects the growth rate to slow in a saturated market.
The number of carts in a mall can vary monthly, with most during November and December.
Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., a Simon property and the country's largest enclosed mall, with 4.2 million square feet, has up to 71 pushcarts in the mall each month, peaking during holidays and summer.
Most mall owners buy carts from manufacturers to create consistency and lease the carts to peddlers. 
No longer a crude box with wheels, the carts can sell for more than $18,000. They have electricity for cash registers and credit card machines, and some have plumbing for food service.
In Quincy Market the carts have traditional wagon wheels and push handles. In some malls they are slick platforms with barely visible castors. 
Some properties customize carts to make them architecturally compatible with the mall, said Rob McCoy, vice president of T L Horton Design in Dallas, which makes carts and kiosks.
Horton made Victorian-style pushcarts for the Willow Grove Mall in Pennsylvania, owned by the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust. Compared with their counterparts in permanent stores, pushcart peddlers pay a premium, with some operators paying more than $400 a square foot during the eight weeks leading up to Christmas. Store retailers pay $30 to $40 a square foot annually on new leases, Mr. Axelrod said.
"The pushcarts should pay more," said Brandon Famous, president of Fameco Real Estate, a retailer brokerage firm in Conshohocken, Pa. "They're right in the flow of traffic."
NYS Collection of Brooklyn peddles sunglasses from pushcarts in 35 East Coast sites and pays yearly rents of $25,000 to $40,000, according to its owner, Sal Babbino. And he pays a percentage of sales after a certain break point based on expected sales volume.
Mr. Babbino said his highest rent was at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, N.Y., a Simon property and the nation's fifth-largest mall, with 2.4 million square feet. There he pays $3,000 a month and $20,000 for the two-month holiday seasons, for an annual cost of $50,000 for each of two carts.
"For a 4-foot-by-10-foot space, that's a lot of money," Mr. Babbino said. 
For peddlers it is a way to start a business without much capital or long-term risk. Holiday sales for a single pushcart can exceed $100,000 at a top mall.
Consider Karen Sotomura of Honolulu who started out selling ornaments for tourists in the 1980's. It grew into Joseph K. & Company, which offers pushcart programs. During the 2002 holiday season, her Santa's Pens personalized holiday merchandise was sold from carts at 152 malls.
In that respect, not much has changed in 150 years. Some of today's signature businesses, like the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, a New York apparel manufacturer, began on a pushcart.
Pushcarts, said, William L. Crozier, a historian at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota who has written about the Lower East Side, "were a means of social mobility."
"With a little bit of capital and a lot of ingenuity you could rise up in the world," he said.
Working as a pushcart merchant also allowed Jewish traders to earn a living and have the freedom to observe the Sabbath, he said. 
Peddlers today have a little less freedom. They must abide by mall hours or risk being fined or evicted. Fines may be imposed for late openings, for carts left unattended or for boxes left in the aisles.
"Sometimes they can be very punitive," said Michael Brother, a Los Angeles retail consultant. He said landlords also had the right to move a cart's location.
Besides bringing in extra income, pushcart-style operations can serve as a feeder system for store space, mall owners say. Auntie Anne's pretzel chain, started in 1988 at a farmer's market stand in Downingtown, Pa., has 754 outlets, of which 95 are pushcarts.
Nevertheless, a lot of people are leery of buying from a pushcart. "They think we're fly-by-nights," said Kelly Byrne of Weymouth, Mass., who sells antique reproduction jewelry and gifts from a pushcart in Quincy Market. "They say things like, 'Will you be here tomorrow?' "

HEADLINE: Japan to Cut Contribution To the Budget Of the U.N. 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Japan, the second largest financial contributor to the United Nations, plans to cut its support by one-quarter in coming years, senior foreign policy makers said here this week.
 Japanese diplomats calculate that Japan's gross domestic product accounts for 14.4 percent of the global economy. Japan pays 19.5 percent of the United Nations budget, or almost $1 billion a year. By contrast, the United States accounts for 30 percent of world gross domestic product, and pays 22 percent. 
 "Japan cannot just give sweet faces to everybody," Yukio Okamoto, chairman of the prime minister's Task Force on Foreign Relations, said in an interview here on Monday. "We have to question: Why are we the only country in the world with inflated cost on our shoulders?"
Japan's planned cuts are partly motivated by the nation's worsening financial condition. After a decade of economic stagnation, Japanese taxes will barely cover half of this year's nearly $700 billion budget. Bonds will be printed and sold to cover the rest.
"Japan's fiscal situation is worse than Italy's," Mr. Okamoto said from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's office.
Moving on programs with weak constituencies, politicians have cut Japan's overall foreign aid budget over the last three years by 15.5 percent, or $1.3 billion. Last year, for the first time in recent memory, Japan ceded the title of world's largest donor of foreign aid to the United States.
At the United Nations, Japanese officials say they are angry that the world body has failed them on two counts.
First, they say, United Nations diplomats were happy to have Japan pay one-fifth of the budget but were never moved to take the basic diplomatic step of removing a clause from the United Nations' founding charter that describes Japan as a "former enemy" nearly six decades after the end of World War II.
"The 'enemy' clause -- no Japanese can understand why the U.N. continues such symbolism," Mr. Okamoto said.
Second, they say, Japan, which has the world's second-largest economy, has been frustrated in its bid to win a permanent seat on the United Nation's Security Council.
"We should get a seat on the Security Council and abolition of the enemy clause in the U.N. charter," said Hatsuhisa Takashima, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. "No taxation without representation is the basic idea."
Japan's $1 billion slice of the United Nations budget is more than the combined payments of four of five of the permanent members of the Security Council: Britain, China, France and Russia. Only the United States pays more.
One United Nations official here said cutting support would not help Japan's Security Council bid, arguing: "If their quest is for the Security Council seat, it is not smart politics. They are not creating an image that Japan is a team player."
Since hitting a peak in 2000 of 20.5 percent of the United Nations budget, Japan's share has dropped one percentage point. Now, Mr. Takashima said, the goal is to negotiate further reductions in this decade to reach parity with Japan's portion of world economic activity, 14.4 percent.
Calling for moving from "money diplomacy" to "real contributions" Mr. Okamoto cited as an example of Japanese contributions the peacekeeping troops sent to East Timor.
Samuel Koo, director of Unicef's office here, said cuts by Japan "would be extremely severe -- they would send the wrong signals." Noting that Japan is to play host to a conference on African development in November, he added: "A lot of countries look to Japan. They follow Japan's initiative."
Noting that Japan now pays 10 percent of Unicef's budget, he said, "From Unicef's point of view, funding cuts by Japan would be extremely severe."

HEADLINE: Catholic School Enrollments Fall, but Finances, Not Fear, Are Blamed 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
America's largest Roman Catholic school systems experienced significant enrollment declines this academic year as the clerical sex abuse scandal raged in the dioceses that oversee them.
 But Catholic education officials attributed the declines to tighter family budgeting in the recession, competition from charter schools and the migration of families out of inner cities, rather than to parental concern that pupils in parochial schools might be at risk of abuse. 
 In interviews, officials in the nation's 11 largest Catholic school systems cited declines in kindergarten-through-eighth-grade parochial school enrollments for the 2002-03 year ranging from 7 percent in Detroit to about 1.5 percent in New York, where Catholic elementary schools had grown steadily for more than a decade, compared with the previous academic year.
Catholic high schools experienced smaller declines in enrollment, and in some archdioceses they had modest increases. 
Both the Archdiocese of Boston, where the upheaval over the sex abuse scandal was most severe, and the Archdiocese of Chicago, where about 15 priests were suspended in 2002 amid accusations of abuse, experienced declines in K-8 enrollment of 6 percent, according to officials in those cities. But Catholic educators and other experts said the abuse scandal was not the reason for the decline.
"Parents just say they can't afford the tuition anymore," said Nicholas Wolsonovich, the superintendent of schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago, which educates 117,000 children, more than any other American archdiocese. "I don't see any evidence of a connection between the priest sexual abuse situation and our enrollment."
The Rev. Joseph M. O'Keefe, associate dean of the school of education at Boston College, said, "Catholic superintendents are very concerned about these declines in enrollment." But he said there was no evidence that the drops were related to the abuse scandal, though he noted that in a recent poll one in every five Catholic parishioners reported that because of the scandals they would stop donating money to dioceses, many of which subsidize urban parochial schools.
"The scandal will make itself felt around the money issue, because if laypeople stop donating to the dioceses, that will hurt the inner-city parish schools," Father O'Keefe said. 
Sister Kathleen Carr, the superintendent of Catholic schools in Boston, said that as the abuse scandal reverberated there last spring, she asked parochial school principals to ask parents who were declining to re-enroll their children about their reasons. Many said that because of rising housing costs in Boston, they were moving to the suburbs, Sister Carr said, and others said they were enrolling their children in charter schools, which do not charge tuition. Only a few parents, who had never enrolled children in parochial schools, expressed concern about sexual abuse, Sister Carr said.
Nora S. Murphy, a spokeswoman for the school system administered by the Archdiocese of New York, reported a 1.5 to 2 percent decline in K-8 enrollment, calling it "the first sizable drop in a good 12 years."
"Most of our parents are the working poor, and they've been hurt as the economy has shifted in the city," Mrs. Murphy said. Many Catholic families have been moving out of the city as apartments are converted to condominiums, she said, especially families from the Upper West Side and Washington Heights. 
"People are certainly disturbed by the sex abuse issues -- they are concerned with the hierarchy and the Catholic Church as an institution," Mrs. Murphy said. "But they trust the schools. They trust and respect the people who are teaching their children."
Parents considering the risks of sexual abuse in Catholic schools may also weigh the dangers in other schools. A United States Department of Education study found that during 2001, students in public schools nationwide were about twice as likely to be victims of rape, sexual assault, robbery or aggravated assault as students in private schools, 48 percent of whom attend Catholic schools.
Anecdotal evidence supports the assertions by Catholic educators that the enrollment declines have not been caused by the abuse scandal. Enrollments at some Catholic schools touched directly by the scandal this year, like Elder High School in Cincinnati, for example, rose in September. A priest on the Elder staff during the 2001-02 academic year and a former principal were accused last year of sexual misconduct. But the freshman class of 280 that enrolled in September was Elder's largest in several years.
In interviews, several parents whose families were affected by clerical sexual abuse said they had nonetheless decided to keep their children in Catholic schools. 
Elizabeth Blaine, whose sister-in-law was abused by a priest as a teenager, said she was stunned to hear of abuse allegations against the priest who officiated at her wedding and another priest who baptized her children. Ms. Blaine enrolled her son Ned in September as a freshman at Fenwick High School, a Catholic school in Oak Park, Ill. Her older son and daughter attend Catholic universities.
"We grappled with the sexual abuse issue, but do we send our children to Catholic schools?" she said in an interview. "We do -- with reservations." 
The five largest Catholic school systems, in order of their 2002-03 enrollment, are Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Brooklyn. The other six whose representatives were interviewed were Cleveland, St. Louis, Newark, Cincinnati, Boston and Detroit.

HEADLINE: Ford Posts Smaller Loss, But Its Costs Are Rising 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter today but continues to lose money and market share while its chief rival, General Motors, has posted profits and gained market share in the last two years.
 A year into Ford's corporate turnaround plan, overall costs continued to rise in 2002 because of, among other things, big changes in redesigned or new sport utility vehicles like the Lincoln Navigator, Aviator and Ford Expedition. The company said its goal was to trim $500 million from its costs this year. 
 Fierce competition is also expected this year in the vital United States market as foreign competitors continue to flood the market at the same time that industry sales are expected to fall. Ford's most important introduction of the year, a new version of its flagship F-150 pickup truck, will face competition from Nissan, which is joining Ford, G.M., Chrysler and Toyota in the full-size truck market. 
"The harder the company works on cost, the tougher the market conditions get," said John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It's tough to make net progress."
Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., is determined to spend aggressively to ensure that the company's vehicles are competitive. But Wall Street is concerned that Ford's capital spending, which will reach $8 billion this year, is not generating enough profits. 
"This company is spending a lot of money, and it's not clear they're getting a bang for their buck," said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, adding that Ford's capital spending per vehicle was 30 percent higher than that of G.M. "This revitalization plan hasn't really reached the acceleration point yet. It's just getting started."
There were some signs of progress. In the fourth quarter, Ford posted a net loss of $130 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.03 billion, or $2.81 a share, in the period a year earlier, which resulted from charges related to the turnaround plan.
Revenue for the quarter was $41.59 billion, up $869 million.
Excluding charges related in part to a restructuring of European operations, Ford had operating income of $150 million, or 8 cents a share. On that basis, the results beat analysts' expectations by a penny, according to Thomson First Call.
For the year, Ford's net loss was narrowed to $980 million from $5.45 billion in 2001. Ford Credit had operating income of nearly $1.4 billion, while the company's automotive operations lost $539 million. Over all, the company reported an operating profit, excluding one-time charges, of $872 million. That was enough to give the company's 95,000 hourly workers in this country a surprise -- if slight -- bonus of about $160 each. By comparison, G.M.'s hourly workers are entitled to a $940 bonus each.
Ford forecast operating earnings of 20 cents a share for the first quarter of this year, four times the consensus estimate of analysts tracked by Thomson First Call. The company increased North American production for the quarter by 25,000 vehicles, to just more than 1 million and 17,000 shy of 2001 levels. 
"Our plan is working," Mr. Ford said on a conference call with reporters and analysts. "We met or exceeded almost all of the targets we set for ourselves in 2002."
Shares of Ford were mostly flat, falling 2 cents, to $10.14. 
The company's expectations for 2003, which it has said relatively little about beyond projecting 70 cents in operating earnings, became somewhat clouded today after Ford accidentally posted several slides projecting 2003 results on its Web site.
Ford executives discounted the slides as wrong and said they were mistakenly released for about 10 minutes. Because of strict new rules regarding disclosure, the company also submitted a securities filing explaining that the extra slides were "draft and/or preliminary materials prepared for background and scenario planning and contained a number of material inaccuracies." 
But Nicholas V. Scheele, the company's chief operating officer, also addressed some of the specific forecasts in one of the slides during a question-and-answer session on the conference call.
Among the projections were a tripling of net losses in North America automotive operations this year and a huge swing in European automotive operations from break even last year to a $1.5 billion net profit this year. Asked about such a sharp change in fortunes for Ford's European operation, Mr. Scheele said it was related to bullish expectations for newer products like the Jaguar XJ sedan, the Volvo XC90 S.U.V. and the Range Rover.
"Coupled with Ford of Europe continuing very aggressive cost reduction, performance will see a major turnaround," Mr. Scheele said. But he also acknowledged that the company's Ford brand, which sells cars like the Fiesta in Europe, could be vulnerable if the European market stalled.
The slides also included projections for net income of $15 million in South America, in contrast to a loss of nearly $300 million last year. Mr. Scheele said production would increase because of a new plant in Brazil and that cost-efficiency improvements would improve performance.
"We would hope that effectively whatever happens, short of a major, major disruption in Brazil, we would see a break even situation in Latin America," he said.

Judge Orders Data
CHICAGO, Jan. 21 (AP)
A federal judge has ordered the Ford Motor Company to turn over safety data on its 15-passenger vans -- information the company has contended does not exist -- and fined the automaker for concealing evidence, a plaintiffs' lawyer said today.
Ford is accused of hiding the evidence in a case involving the deaths of two passengers in one of the large vans when it flipped on a Kentucky highway in 1996. Thirteen people from Illinois were aboard.
The ruling on a motion to impose sanctions against Ford could have implications in other cases against involving the Econoline vans, which have come under government scrutiny because of numerous accidents. Ford insists they are safe.
James Lowe of Cleveland, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said Judge Robert Gettlemen of Federal District Court ordered Ford to pay all costs by plaintiffs to obtain the safety records. The amount of that fine was not specified.
More important, Mr. Lowe said, Judge Gettlemen said he would inform the jury at trial that Ford's own records apparently showed the 15-passenger vans were not reasonably safe or stable.
The case, filed in 1998, is scheduled for trial Feb. 24. Ford has until Jan. 31 to turn over the testing records.

HEADLINE: Banks Encourage Overdrafts, Reaping Profit 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
At least 1,000 banks are encouraging customers with low balances to overdraw their checking accounts, allowing the banks to skirt credit laws and collect billions of dollars in new fees.
 The banks' programs cover checks that would otherwise bounce and even allow people to overdraw their accounts with A.T.M. and debit cards. The fees are paid disproportionately by low- and moderate-income people, according to industry consultants who help banks create and market the programs. One consultant advises banks to maximize the fees by opening branches "in supermarkets, particularly supermarkets with a middle to down market and a family target market." 
 Banks say that they are offering a service that enables people to avoid paying bounced-check fees to retailers. But many inside and outside the banking business say the programs, while extremely profitable for the banks, are a bad deal for consumers and amount to high-interest loans. 
The move to encourage overdrafts is a major shift. In the past, when consumer groups complained that bounced-check fees were excessive, banks generally responded that high fees encouraged people to use their checking accounts responsibly. Now, with banks increasingly dependent on fees from consumers, overdrafts have become a source of profit.
The Federal Reserve, which has the ultimate responsibility for overseeing the financial system, is looking into the legality of the programs and whether banks should supply consumers with more information. 
The new programs are much more expensive and restrictive than the overdraft lines of credit that banks have offered for decades to favored clients who have big balances or other accounts with them.
Unlike those lines of credit, which typically charge annual interest of up to 20 percent, the new programs charge flat fees of up to $35 for each overdraft. The fees translate into an annual rate of 1,000 percent or more. Unlike traditional lines of credit, which allow repayment whenever the customer chooses, these programs require customers to bring their accounts back into balance in only a few days. While traditional lines of credit have limits of several thousand dollars, the new programs have limits of $100 to $300. After that, banks allow the checks to bounce.
Typically a bank's best customers, about 10 percent, are offered traditional overdraft lines of credit, and they are not enrolled unless they explicitly agree. In contrast, the new programs automatically enroll almost every checking-account customer who does not have a traditional overdraft line. When they use debit or automated teller machine cards, customers often do not realize they have overdrawn their accounts until they receive a letter from the bank disclosing the fee.
"Some banks are looking at the fact that some consumers barely make it from payday to payday and have a very low balance, and instead of offering them a beneficial service, they are charging their customers bounced-check fees to take advantage of the situation," said Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America.
But the concerns of regulators and consumer groups have not stopped banks from promoting the programs, marketed as "courtesy overdraft protection" or "bounce protection." In brochures and letters to customers, the banks cheerily promise to make good on bounced checks.
Until early January, the Web site for Old National Bancorp, a $9 billion bank based in Evansville, Ind., promoted its overdraft program by asking: "Ever run short between paychecks? Ever been faced with unplanned expenses? If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you'll have peace of mind knowing you have the protection of Overdraft Courtesy with your Old National checking account. If you ever need more money than you have in your account, simply write a check."
After receiving questions from The New York Times, Old National removed that language from its Web site. Alan Boggs, senior vice president of Old National, which has 133 branches in five states, said the prior description was intended to inform people about the overdraft program, not promote it.
"We don't promote it as a line of credit," Mr. Boggs said. "It's there in case you make a mistake."
Other banks use similar language. In a brochure describing its checking accounts, Washington Mutual, the nation's seventh-largest financial institution and the largest to promote overdraft protection, writes: "Overdraft Protection: Did that last check catch you off-guard? Don't worry, we've got you covered." Washington Mutual never explains in the brochure that the program is not free. A spokeswoman said that the fees were disclosed when customers opened accounts.
Because they are not widely advertised and instead marketed mainly to existing customers, the programs have largely escaped public notice, and regulators are only beginning to examine them. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates many large banks, and the Indiana state banking department have warned banks about the programs.
The Federal Reserve has also asked for comments by next Monday about whether the programs might be covered by laws that require banks to disclose the cost of credit.
Depending on how quickly the overdrafts are repaid, their fees translate into an annual interest rate that can reach several thousand percent, far higher than the rates permitted by state usury laws.
Banks and consultants say that using an annual percentage rate to calculate the cost of the overdraft is misleading, because the fee is more like a credit card late fee than a loan.
"This isn't a loan product," said Joe Gillen, chief executive of Pinnacle Financial Strategies, which helps banks create the programs. "It allows the consumer to have another alternative to manage their funds." Even without the programs, many people would overdraw their accounts, Mr. Gillen said. The programs allow them to avoid the inconvenience of bouncing checks.
"Customers almost universally view this as a great service," William A. Longbrake, the vice chairman of Washington Mutual, said at an industry conference in December.
But critics say the programs are similar to the "payday loans" made by check-cashing outlets and other "fringe banks." Those loans, which are often exempted from usury laws because of their small size, usually cost $10 to $15 for every $100 borrowed and must be repaid in two weeks, terms less expensive than the cost of the overdraft programs.
"The purpose of this is not, in my opinion, to help the consumer," said J. Philip Goddard, deputy director of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. "These programs are only to increase fee income."
Daniel P. Stipano, deputy chief counsel of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said that the programs seemed "designed for banks to promote poor fiscal responsibility."
But Mr. Stipano said the programs appeared legal and his office had no plans to ban them.
While banks generally make the programs available to all customers, statistics from industry consultants show a few accounts generate most of the fees. In many cases, those customers are financially unsophisticated and are unaware until later how much they are being charged, consumer advocates say.
Mark Gregg, an Ohio man who received a liver transplant in November 2001, estimated that he paid more than $1,000 in overdraft fees to FirstMerit Bank of Akron, Ohio, last year. Account statements provided by Mr. Gregg supported that estimate.
"I was really sick, so there were things going on that I wasn't really diligent about," said Mr. Gregg, who was unable to work after the transplant and whose sole income is a $974 monthly Social Security disability check.
In October, FirstMerit closed Mr. Gregg's account, claiming he owed more than $400 in fees. A few days later, it took those fees out of an account belonging to his parents. Mr. Gregg's mother, Barbara, had co-signed his account when he opened it.
"I was storming mad," Ms. Gregg said. "They went into my account; they did not get my permission. I think that should be illegal." Ms. Gregg said she and her husband had been FirstMerit customers for 47 years.
But Ms. Gregg, who had a heart operation in November, said she had not complained to the bank. "I was ill, and I wasn't worried about anything else," she said. "It's been a bad couple years in this house."
Jacque Sir Louis, a spokesman for FirstMerit, said Ohio law gave the bank the right to garnish Barbara Gregg's account for the fees it had charged her son. "It's still up to the customers to make sure that they maintain a balance in their account," Mr. Sir Louis said.
The move to encourage overdrafts is a major shift for banks. In the past, when consumer groups complained that bounced-check fees were excessive, banks generally responded that high fees encouraged people to use their checking accounts responsibly.
"Overdraft fees are intended to be in a sense punitive, because what you're doing is technically illegal," said Diane M. Casey, the president of America's Community Bankers, a trade group of 1,300 small banks that markets overdraft protection programs to its members. Ms. Casey said the programs did not imply that her group supports overdrafts.
"You can view it as an insurance policy," Ms. Casey said. "These programs are reflecting the reality of how people manage their finances."
Overdraft charges are the largest part of a long-term move by banks to depend more on fees and less on interest from loans, regulators and consultants say. A study by the Fed last year found that banks raised their overdraft fees 24 percent from 1997 to 2001, to an average of $20.42.
Over all, banks will charge $30 billion in A.T.M., bounced-check and overdraft fees this year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, up 14 percent from 2001. The fees represent about 30 percent of banks' operating profits.
Washington Mutual charged customers more than $1 billion in overdraft fees last year, industry analysts estimate.
Dick Gowdy, executive vice president of Strunk & Associates, the leading vendor of overdraft programs, said that the number of banks that use Strunk's program had risen to 560 from 135 in 1999. The programs are growing because customers like them, Mr. Gowdy said.
Mr. Gowdy and other consultants agree that low- and middle-income consumers with low balances are more likely to use overdraft protection than wealthier people. "Areas of high unemployment, higher unemployment, you typically have more activity," he said. "If you happen to be a bank that's on a military post, you're probably doing twice as much activity as any other bank."
The average bank that aggressively markets an overdraft program will earn as much as $150 on each account annually in overdraft fees, three times that of a bank that does not, and about $200 in total fees, according to Mr. Gowdy.
But overdraft fees are not paid equally by all customers. 
In an article on bankstocks.com, an industry Web site, Ralph Haberfeld, a bank consultant, estimated that 4 percent of customers pay half the fees. That estimate would imply that a small group of people, like Mr. Gregg, the transplant patient and FirstMerit customer, pay as much as $2,000 annually in overdraft fees.
Overdraft protection programs "target people that least can afford it," Mr. Gregg said. Banks that use them "have got you against a wall, and you just throw up your hands."

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal On Dividends Is Revised 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Bush administration yesterday changed its proposal to exempt dividends from taxes in ways that will make life easier both for companies that pay dividends and for those that invest in other companies.
 The revised proposal will also make it possible for some companies to pay tax-free dividends even when they are losing money. Shareholders who receive such dividends would suffer a penalty by paying more in capital gains taxes when they sold their shares, but the dividends would not be subject to immediate taxes. 
 "Companies will know with certainty what the status of their dividends would be," said Pam Olson, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy. "We think the changes will be useful to the market because of the certainty that they provide." 
The alterations will not change the Bush administration's estimate of the cost of the proposal, Ms. Olson said. But that is because parts of it that had previously raised the possibility of raising taxes for some taxpayers had not been counted in the numbers.
Under the Bush plan, companies that pay corporate income taxes will be allowed to distribute tax-free dividends to shareholders based on the taxes they paid. That does not change in the revisions, but the timing of the payments would be delayed. For example, dividends paid in 2004 would be based on profits earned in 2002, rather than 2003. Corporate tax returns for 2002 will be due Sept. 15, so by the time 2004 begins the company would know with certainty how much it could pay in tax-free dividends.
That would mean that when each dividend was declared in 2004, the company would be able to say what the tax status of it was. "You would know what you are doing when you invest," said Robert Gordon, the president of 21st Securities. "They seem to be amenable to fixing the problems that have come out in the press and otherwise."
The delay also means that companies can choose to claim tax refunds based on taxes paid the previous year, rather than pay the dividends. For example, a company that paid taxes on its 2002 income but lost money in 2003 could decide not to pay tax-free dividends but instead to seek a refund of the 2002 taxes, based on losses in the later year.
Under current law, companies can go back two years to claim tax refunds. The original Bush proposal called for no such ability to obtain refunds. The revision allows companies to go back one year.
Under the Bush proposal, a company that does not choose to pay tax-exempt dividends or that does not pay as much as it is entitled to pay must instead distribute "deemed dividends" to investors. Those dividends would allow an investor to increase his or her tax basis in the stock and thus pay lower capital gains taxes when the stock was sold.
That provision is not changed. But one new feature would allow a company that has previously paid deemed dividends to go back and effectively reclaim them by paying dividends that would be tax free.
Ms. Olson said that should not be viewed as a change. "This was a level of detail that we did not drill down to," she said in a telephone interview.
Nonetheless, it does make the proposal much more attractive to some companies, particularly cyclical ones with variable earnings, than it had appeared to be.
For example, consider a company that pays $20 million in deemed dividends from 2003 through 2010, in addition to whatever tax-free dividends it pays. If it has no tax-free dividends it can distribute in 2011, perhaps because it lost money in 2009, it could still pay up to $20 million in tax-free dividends.
Shareholders who receive those tax-exempt dividends would suffer an offsetting tax penalty later because their basis in the stock would be reduced. So an investor who receives $1 a share in such a dividend would pay taxes on an additional $1 a share in capital gains when the stock was sold. But because that might be years later, and because capital gains tax rates are lower than the rates on ordinary income, investors would still be ahead of where they would be if the original dividend were taxable.
For corporations that invest in other corporations, the original Bush plan had set off alarm bells that the revisions cancel. Those revisions even offer the possibility for a company to hurriedly issue new shares in the next 10 days that would have tax advantages over shares issued on or after Feb. 3.
That tax issue concerns the so-called dividends-received deduction. Under current law, a company that receives dividends from another company usually has to pay taxes on only 30 percent of that dividend income.
But the original Bush proposal had said such dividends paid in 2003 and later would be fully taxable if the company was not entitled under the proposal to issue tax-free dividends.
The revision delays that provision until the end of 2005. Until then, any taxable dividends paid to other corporations that would have otherwise gotten the dividend-received deduction would still be able to get it. But that will apply only if the shares in question were issued before Feb. 3.

HEADLINE: For America's Big Retailers, Small Is Beautiful, Sometimes 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
After carpeting the country with stores measuring 150,000 square feet or more, retailers are discovering that people do not always have the time or the inclination to get all the way through them.
 Yes, the abundance of a 200,000-square-foot Wal-Mart Supercenter is impressive: the equivalent of four football fields of stuff. And sure, it is handy to be able to buy just about everything at a single 175,000-square-foot SuperTarget. But at the same time, time-pressed shoppers, particularly millions of aging baby boomers, are sometimes finding these stores to be too large, too inconvenient and too tiring to get all the way through. 
 And the big-box retailers have noticed. Wal-Mart Stores has been aggressively opening scaled-down versions of its Supercenters -- less than one-quarter their size -- called Neighborhood Markets. So far the company has built 46 smaller stores scattered through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee; a handful opened in Florida, Alabama and Utah in the last week. Retail analysts have taken to calling them Small-Marts. 
In Brooklyn, Home Depot has opened a shrunken version of its usual model. Other retailers, including Toys "R" Us and Staples, are retrofitting stores to make them smaller, cozier and more intimate, qualities the big-box format was supposed to displace. 
"Customers are demanding respect for their time," said David M. Szymanski, director of the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University. "One way to respond to that is to offer formats that cater to that."
Leisa Still suffers at times from big-store fatigue. Ms. Still, who lives in Seligman, Mo., and who herself works at a Wal-Mart, was looking through a rack of men's golf shirts recently at a Dollar General store in Pea Ridge, Ark. She had chosen to go there to pick up a few things she needed, and then get out.
"I would rather come here than fight the crowds at Wal-Mart," Ms. Still said. "It's a lot easier, and it's quicker."
Dollar General is one of several retailers whose mini-discount marts have thrived in the shadow of Wal-Marts and other large stores around the country. Dollar General's stores are built on the hunch that a smaller assortment in a more efficient structure will attract shoppers who do not want to wander through a vast retail space, not to mention the parking acreage surrounding it.
For the small-scale retailers, speed can be a point of pride: Walgreen, the drugstore chain with outlets that are typically 14,500 square feet, has even clocked how quickly shoppers can accomplish their missions. "Our customers can be out of the store in six minutes," said Carol Hively, a spokeswoman. "They're in a hurry, and they want to grab a couple of things. They don't necessarily want to have an extended shopping trip to a larger store."
Other retailers are trying to make their stores smaller or more inviting to customers, for reasons ranging from shopper rejection to real estate concerns.
Toys "R" Us, confronted with declining sales, spent more than $600,000 each to renovate its warehouse-style stores into cozier spaces. The toy retailer has switched from ceiling-high racks stacked with Barbies, Lego sets, Hot Wheels and stuffed animals to a format in which toys are grouped by maker or type. More than half of its 703 stores have been converted to the new look.
A concept called Dover has been changing the look of many Staples stores. The first Dover store, about 20 percent smaller than the old Staples prototype, opened last year in Dover, N.H., and removed much of the warehouse atmosphere that Staples has long had. The stores now have low-rise shelves and conveniently placed stacks of merchandise like toner and inkjet cartridges that customers said they needed most. 
Home Depot opened its first experimental smaller store in Brooklyn last year. For the Brooklyn store, which measures about 62,000 square feet, Home Depot took over an empty Pergament hardware store in the Mill Basin section. "This is close to home, it's quick, and there are no lines," said Donna Connelly, who had stopped in for one item -- an outdoor light fixture -- for her home in Belle Harbor, Queens. "It's overwhelming when the store is so big, if you're just coming for something specific." 
At Staples, "customer feedback to us said, 'We can't find certain items in your store, or we can't find your associates,' " said Demos Parneros, the company's president for United States stores. About 250 Staples stores have been converted to the new style, with about 850 to go. The redone stores are 17 percent smaller: 20,000 square feet, down from the original 24,000.
Even though America is a land that values plenty, offering a tighter assortment can pay off, a study conducted by Procter & Gamble a few years ago found. When variety was reduced in a store, purchases went up -- countering the idea that the less people saw, the less they would buy. 
"It's information overload," said Aradhna Krishna, professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. "There's an optimum amount of information that consumers want to process." In the study, she said, people's perception was that the size of the assortment was larger, even though there were fewer types of products before them.
Being small can also give stores a toehold in cities or towns where real estate is in short supply, or where the store would not appear to have a huge natural customer base. A smaller size provides "a way for them to be in markets where the economics don't make sense for a large store," said Mr. Szymanski, whose retailing studies center at Texas A&M is sponsored in part by Wal-Mart.
In addition, he said, "pressure to grow the business, especially in difficult times, and to reach out to new markets" is behind the new small stores, as well as the trend among many consumers to shop at big stores for some things and at small ones for others. 
Other retailers could also find strength in smallness, contends Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. "There are a lot of markets left in the United States where you could have a Wal-Mart, or a Sears or a Home Depot, but not at the size you are accustomed to having it," he said. "The real estate may not be available. Given the fact that space and sites for large stores is almost exhausted in America, they have to think about it." 
Home Depot thought about it, and the Mill Basin store is the company's solution. "It's an infield strategy in an urban neighborhood," said Jerry Edwards, Home Depot's executive vice president for merchandising. "The stores will go where we have determined the need for a store but may not be able to find enough acreage for a large store."
Geared to expect huge expanses, , some shoppers may need to adjust. "I find it is not really a Home Depot," said Winston Thornhill, a contractor renovating a house in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, who was eyeing a display of plumbing fixtures in the new store. "It seems like they don't really have the variety of items." 
But smaller formats may attract shoppers who either cannot or will not go to a big store all the time. "Some people find the Supercenter to be less convenient if they are in a hurry to do just some food shopping," said Ed Kolodzieski, Wal-Mart's senior vice president in charge of Neighborhood Markets. 
The first Neighborhood Market opened in 1998 in Springdale, Ark., not far from Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville. The stores are typically about 40,000 square feet, with a mix of groceries, over-the-counter drugs and beauty products. They appear to be typical grocery stores, with friendly touches like an honor-system coffee bar, and conveniences like prepared foods just inside the front door. 
Neighborhood Markets try to be convenient, but without the higher prices found in many convenience stores. "There is no premium for speed," Mr. Kolodzieski said. "We don't look at it as what our customers are willing to pay. Our approach is, What is the lowest-cost way to deliver what customers are looking for?" 
But there are only about 24,000 products on the shelves at a Neighborhood Market, compared with 100,000 in the Supercenters. A parking area surrounds the store, as at a Wal-Mart, but it is far smaller than those at the company's 200,000-square-foot stores. "It is a convenience alternative to the Supercenter," said Wayne P. Hood, a retail analyst for Prudential Securities in Atlanta. "If I was a supermarket or drugstore chain and I saw this coming, I'd be worried."
While the stores are intensifying competition between Wal-Mart and local grocery chains, particularly around Bentonville, it is not clear whether Wal-Mart can wring the same advantages from its smaller stores that it does at Supercenters.
"Out of the first four Neighborhood Markets they opened, three of them were right across the street from us," said Kim Eskew, vice president for marketing of Harp's Food Stores, a 45-store chain based in Springdale. But Harp's executives have found the effect less devastating than they feared. "Most of the business the Neighborhood Market does has come from the Supercenters that are nearby," Mr. Eskew said. 
Certainly that was true for Kirby Hamby, who was waiting in line at the deli counter at the Neighborhood Market in Rogers, Ark., one morning. "My house is halfway between the Supercenter and here," she said, "but if I'm just looking for quick things, I come here."
Mr. Kolodzieski said the same cost-cutting that built success at the Supercenters was saving money for the Neighborhood Markets, too. But Mr. Eskew said that profitability in the new, small stores may be lower than what Wal-Mart typically expects from its stores. 
"The verdict may still be out on whether or not they can make money when a high percentage of the sales are food," Mr. Eskew said. "In the Neighborhood Markets, they are in the same boat with everybody else."

HEADLINE: Columbia U. Sharply Trims Its Financing For Biosphere 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN and KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Columbia University plans to curtail sharply its financial support for Biosphere 2, the ambitious but troubled effort to simulate Earth's ecology under glass. 
 The university is under contract with the owner of the Biosphere, a 250-acre research center in the Arizona desert north of Tucson, to manage it until 2010. Three years ago, the university trustees approved $20 million to expand research and teaching programs there until 2005.
 But those efforts, and the fate of the center, are in doubt, many scientists and officials involved with the partnership said yesterday in interviews. 
The university has frozen hiring plans for new faculty members for the Biosphere and has said it will move a master's degree program in environmental public policy from the center, in Oracle, Ariz., to New York.
Biosphere 2 is owned by its builder, Edward P. Bass, a Texas billionaire and a longtime supporter of environmental causes.
Two reviews in the fall, one by a university panel and one by independent reviewers, found that the research did not justify further investment, university officials said. Columbia officials said yesterday that they would continue the management contract but that the university had to cut its financing. 
"It's just a very, very expensive facility," a senior official said. "While it's produced some good science, my view is it's just not worth the level of investment that Columbia had been projecting to put in." 
The university has put $25 million to $30 million into the center since taking over its management in 1996. 
Officials said they had not made a formal decision on spending. A spokesman for Mr. Bass said the university had told him that no more money would be forthcoming after June. 
Several officials and scientists involved with Columbia, Mr. Bass and the Biosphere said the university had concluded that it had no contractual obligation to invest more money.
Robert Kasdin, the senior executive vice president for administration at Columbia, declined to comment on Biosphere finances.
The plan had called for creating a broader group of partners, Mr. Kasdin said, "so that the Biosphere would be economically self-sustaining."
Biosphere 2 -- in theory Earth is Biosphere 1 -- has held a mix of promise and problems since it opened in 1991 as an extraordinary experiment in which eight human "biospherians" were sealed into a mock world along with 4,000 animal and plant species. 
There were a rain forest, marshes, a desert and a vestpocket ocean. 
The project was conceived, built and mostly paid for -- up to $200 million or more -- by Mr. Bass.
By 1994, with noxious gases building up under its glass domes, invasive species thriving, and biospherians' tempers flaring, the effort ended. 
Mr. Bass sought a university partner to help transform the Biosphere into a research center. 
The project meshed with Columbia's efforts to create an Earth Institute, spanning many disciplines in an integrated approach to studying environmental trends on the planet.
In 1999, when the Columbia board approved continuing the management contract and $20 million in further investment, Mr. Bass pledged an additional $30 million to help Columbia run the center. 
But the university has gone through enormous changes since then, with a new president, Lee C. Bollinger, and a new director for the Earth Institute, Jeffrey Sachs, an economist whose focus is less on basic biological research and more on meshing commerce with environmental conservation. 
A weaker economy has also put pressure on Columbia to re-examine its spending.
A committee from the Energy Department that visited the Biosphere this month was not impressed, according to people familiar with the visit.
A few years ago, Columbia officials had hoped that the federal government might be willing to put up money, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson visited the site in the closing days of the Clinton administration.
Martin Bowen, the chief financial officer for Mr. Bass's companies, said in an interview yesterday that he was disappointed with Columbia's planned reductions. 
"This was to be a major relationship," Mr. Bowen said.
Barry Osmond, who as president of Biosphere 2 has been working to improve research operations, said he would try to persuade university officials to maintain support at least long enough for him to assemble a consortium of universities or other financing sources to help sustain the project. 
Mr. Bowen said that might be difficult, because Columbia's decision to pull back had already "devalued the project."
"When the word is out in the academic and scientific community," Mr. Bowen said, "that the institution responsible for this vision, for building this project into something that is meaningful, wants to pull out, what does that do?"

SEPT. 26, 1991 -- Four women and four men are sealed inside the complex with the goal of living in a self-sustaining environment for two years. JULY 1992 -- A report by a panel of experts says that the project must focus more on science. Critics had dismissed Biosphere 2 as a "scientific crapshoot." JANUARY 1993 -- Oxygen levels had dropped more than 28 percent since it was sealed, endangering its occupants. Oxygen has to be pumped in, defeating the goal of a closed ecosystem.

OCTOBER 1993 -- A glut of peat and compost in Biosphere 2's soils led to bacterial growth and the oxygen depletion, scientists discover. NOVEMBER 1995 -- Columbia University says it will manage the station. DECEMBER 1999 -- Columbia trustees vote to invest $20 million in Biosphere 2 by 2005 and manage it until 2010.

To the Editor:
Re "New Players on Global Warming" (editorial, Jan. 15): 
With the administration and Congress committed to stimulating the economy, the stakes are much higher in the global warming debate. 
 Some estimate that 60 percent of our gross domestic product is from enterprises using electric power as principal energy. 
 Ill-advised experiments in carbon dioxide allocation would needlessly jeopardize the coal-based generation that delivers 53 percent of the electricity. 
Electric power is the core of the economy. Coal is the core of electric generation. Nothing stuns this energy-oriented economy like energy shocks. 
If the economy is priority No. 1, then good energy and environmental policies have to be companion priorities. Technology can resolve all questions about coal use in power generation.

HEADLINE: Still Reading, Just Not Paying 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Some Best-Seller Old Reliables Have String of Unreliable Sales" (Business Day, Jan. 20) suggests that many best-selling authors have seen sales of their books decline perhaps because of changing tastes on the part of the public or that possibly there is just a glut of too many books from the same authors. 
 The above may be true, but there may be a simpler reason for the "dismal holiday season for book retailers." It's called the economy. Sales may have fallen off for no other reason than consumers spending less discretionary money. 
 It would be interesting to study the traffic in local libraries across the United States, which may indicate that people are reading more than ever before, but that they are doing so more economically.

Virgin Airways Seeks New Agency

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A big advertiser is beginning a search for a new agency as other marketers complete reviews.
 The United States operation of Virgin Atlantic Airways is seeking a new agency of record, the company said yesterday, to replace CMG Communications in New York, which has handled the assignment since 1994, when the agency opened. The company spent $788,000 in major media in the first 10 months of 2002, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 The airline's growth requires the resources of a larger agency, said John Riordan, vice president for North American marketing at Virgin in Norwalk, Conn., part of the Virgin Group. Virgin named Roth Associates in New York to help manage the review, which will start next week, Mr. Riordan said. A decision is expected in the second quarter.
A co-founder of CMG, Michael F. Glavin, the president, came from Korey, Kay & Partners in New York, which handled the American Virgin account from 1984 until CMG was opened.
In a completed review, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism in Nassau, the Bahamas, named the New York office of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, to handle consumer advertising. The assignment, with billings estimated at $15 million, had been handled by Bozell in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Fallon had been eliminated in an earlier round of the review, when officials of the ministry narrowed their list to two finalists, Martin/Williams in Minneapolis, part of the Omnicom Group, and Mullen in Wenham, Mass., also part of the Partnership. But after they revisited Fallon last week, they awarded the account to the agency.
Another two-month review ended as Kyocera Mita in Fairfield, N.J., a document imaging company, named Seiter & Miller Advertising in New York as agency of record on its account, which had been handled by Ott Communications in Lexington, Ky. Spending was estimated at $12 million. Kyocera Mita is part of the Kyocera Corporation.

HEADLINE: Hispanics Now Largest Minority, Census Shows 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Hispanics have edged past blacks as the nation's largest minority group, new figures released today by the Census Bureau showed.
 The Hispanic population in the United States is now roughly 37 million, while blacks number about 36.2 million. 
 The figures, the first detailed findings on race and ethnicity since the 2000 Census was released two years ago, confirm what demographers and many advocacy groups have anticipated for several years. The new numbers are based on new population estimates from July 1, 2001, that were compared with the census figures from April 1, 2000. The figures showed that the Latino population grew by 4.7 percent, while the black population grew by just 1.5 percent. The white, non-Hispanic population, estimated at roughly 196 million, grew by 0.3 percent during the same period. 
"It is a turning point in the nation's history, a symbolic benchmark of some significance," said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington-based research and policy analysis organization. "If you consider how much of this nation's history is wrapped up in the interplay between black and white, this serves as an official announcement that we as Americans cannot think of race in that way any more."
The explosive growth in the Hispanic population results from higher birth rates and from the huge wave of immigration that has taken place in the last decade. The Census Bureau counts all people residing in the United States, whether they are legal immigrants or not. 
In addition to their symbolic significance, the figures carry important implications for the allocation of resources. In recent years blacks and Hispanics have often felt in opposition in seeking financing and political representation, and the new numbers could bring fresh tensions.
Some Latino advocacy organizations, perhaps anticipating possible difficulties, are already playing down the significance of the shift. "Rather than comparing groups we should be looking at the status of communities," said Sonia Perez, deputy vice president for research at the National Council of La Raza, a national Latino organization. "When you look at Latino and African-American communities, the elements of the agendas are not that different. We share many of the same issues, interests and values."
In many ways, the new figures are an indication of the growing multiculturalism in American society and the change in the way the Census Bureau allows people to classify themselves. The 2000 census, for the first time, allowed respondents to choose more than one race in identifying themselves. In addition, Hispanics, a cultural and ethnic classification, can be of any race. 
While the general African-American population is slightly smaller than the general Hispanic population, the number of Americans who declared themselves as black "in combination with one or more other races" is now 37.7 million, slightly higher than overall figure for Latinos. 
"The statistics are in the eyes of their beholders," said William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan. "What these numbers reveal is a bit of a conundrum. But advocacy groups, policy people and politicians will pick the interpretation of them that works best for them at any given time."
Much of the social and political impact of the population surge may not be immediately apparent. Roughly one quarter of Latinos living in the United States are noncitizens. And while there has been a significant migration of Hispanics to cities in the South, Midwest, and central plains, more than 50 percent of the Latino population remains concentrated in Texas, California and New York. 
The speed of population shift, though anticipated, has taken some demographers by surprise. "It came sooner than we thought," said Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of the Census Bureau during the Clinton administration. 
Among the factors that contributed to the faster than anticipated growth, said Ms. Farnsworth Riche, was greater cooperation between the Census Bureau and Latino organizations, which helped undocumented migrants feel safer cooperating with census takers. 
The slim numerical gap between blacks and Hispanics is expected to widen significantly in the next decade. Deteriorating economic conditions across Latin America, say many demographers, will continue to spur immigration. The birth rate among Latinos is also higher than among blacks.
Researchers expect the spurt to level off in a generation or so, as economic stability leads to lower fertility rates and Hispanics intermarry with other groups with some choosing to identify as black, some as white, and some as a combination of one or more ethnic groups or races.
"It will only get more broad and more complicated," said Mr. Suro. "It's a reminder that we will increasingly, as Americans, need to find new ways of categorizing people and talking about their differences."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE U.N.; 
Short of a 'Smoking Gun,' Allies Ask, Why the Rush?

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Pakistan and Bulgaria have a lot in common these days. They are both recent but energetic allies of the United States, both members of the Security Council -- and both hesitant to authorize war against Iraq in the near future.
 "If the inspectors say they want some time, I think that time should be given," the Pakistani foreign minister, Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, said of United Nations arms inspections in an interview today. 
 In a separate interview, the Bulgarian foreign minister, Solomon Passy, said, "We will still invest the maximum effort to avoid a military solution." 
At a meeting of Council foreign ministers here on Monday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met considerable resistance from three other permanent, veto-bearing Council members -- China, Russia and especially France -- to military action against Iraq in coming weeks. The chief weapons inspectors will give a report to the Council on Monday, and American officials have said that they might use that event to make their case for war. 
But in private meetings with 12 other ministers, Mr. Powell also heard much reluctance from the 10 nonpermanent members, diplomats said today.
Many of them argued that the inspections are just starting to work to pressure Iraq to disclose its illegal weapons, diplomats said. They said that without a "smoking gun" to prove Baghdad's defiance, they would have a hard time at this point convincing skeptics at home that war is justified.
"We still have to work with public opinion," Mr. Passy said.
Generally the nonpermanent members have much less influence than the permanent powers. But during the long negotiations over Resolution 1441, which set up the current inspections, the United States strengthened its hand against opposition from France by diligently marshaling votes from the nonpermanent members. For adoption, Council resolutions require nine votes in favor and no vetoes. 
The profile of the nonpermanent members was raised this year with the arrival on the Council of Germany, which is more powerful economically than Europe's permanent member countries, France and Britain. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said on Monday that Iraq must comply with Council resolutions, but he warned that premature war could unleash a new wave of terrorism. 
Mr. Kasuri said it is crucial for Pakistan, which just joined the Council on Jan. 1, to have an air-tight case against Iraq to present at home to avoid a destabilizing anti-American backlash.
"We have to present this in a way that people know it is not a selective application of Security Council resolutions," he said. He pointed to several decades-old resolutions seeking a solution to Pakistan's bitter fight with India over the territory of Kashmir, which he said have not been enforced the way Washington wants to enforce resolutions on Iraq.
His country, he said, feels no sympathy for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who has lent his backing to India in the Kashmir dispute. 
"Nobody has anything to do with Saddam," he said. Pakistan remains keen to preserve strong relations with the Bush administration, he said, but is in a "particularly difficult situation" because of the tensions created in the Muslim country by its support for the United States war to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan.
"When you talk of time, it doesn't mean unlimited time, so that everybody will forget about the situation in Iraq," Mr. Kasuri said. He said it should be up to the weapons inspectors to decide how much time they need and when to declare that the inspections have failed.
Bulgaria has been on the Council for a year, and has repeatedly proved its loyalty by voting with Washington. It was an early and avid supporter of the United States in the negotiations over Resolution 1441. 
Bulgaria was invited to become a member of NATO in November with decisive backing from the United States, and Mr. Passy made it clear that Sofia will side with the Bush administration if it forces a decision on war by the end of this month.
Mr. Hussein has not paid the $2 billion he owes Bulgaria for engineering work and equipment contracts from the 1980's, and is the country's biggest foreign debtor, Mr. Passy said. 
"Saddam will never return this debt," he said. "We can have this money back one day with a different government in Iraq."
Bulgaria has "in principle" offered military assistance to the United States for a war against Iraq, he said, including use of an air base for refueling and a military unit trained to assist soldiers who have faced chemical and biological weapons. 
Yet he insisted that it was important to keep the Security Council united. "We shall be working until the very last possibility is exhausted for a peaceful solution to be found," he said.

HEADLINE: Thinking About Iraq (I) 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
As the decision on Iraq approaches, I, like so many Americans, have had to ask myself: What do you really think? Today I explain why I think liberals under-appreciate the value of removing Saddam Hussein. And on Sunday I will explain why conservatives under-appreciate the risks of doing so -- and how we should balance the two. 
 What liberals fail to recognize is that regime change in Iraq is not some distraction from the war on Al Qaeda. That is a bogus argument. And simply because oil is also at stake in Iraq doesn't make it illegitimate either. Some things are right to do, even if Big Oil benefits. 
 Although President Bush has cast the war in Iraq as being about disarmament -- and that is legitimate -- disarmament is not the most important prize there. Regime change is the prize. Regime transformation in Iraq could make a valuable contribution to the war on terrorism, whether Saddam is ousted or enticed into exile. 
Why? Because what really threatens open, Western, liberal societies today is not Saddam and his weapons per se. He is a twisted dictator who is deterrable through conventional means. Because Saddam loves life more than he hates us. What threatens Western societies today are not the deterrables, like Saddam, but the undeterrables -- the boys who did 9/11, who hate us more than they love life. It's these human missiles of mass destruction that could really destroy our open society.
So then the question is: What is the cement mixer that is churning out these undeterrables -- these angry, humiliated and often unemployed Muslim youth? That cement mixer is a collection of faltering Arab states, which, as the U.N.'s Arab Human Development Report noted, have fallen so far behind the world their combined G.D.P. does not equal that of Spain. And the reason they have fallen behind can be traced to their lack of three things: freedom, modern education and women's empowerment. 
If we don't help transform these Arab states -- which are also experiencing population explosions -- to create better governance, to build more open and productive economies, to empower their women and to develop responsible media that won't blame all their ills on others, we will never begin to see the political, educational and religious reformations they need to shrink their output of undeterrables.
We have partners. Trust me, there is a part of every young Arab today that recoils at the idea of a U.S. invasion of Iraq, because of its colonial overtones. But there is a part of many young Arabs today that prays the U.S. will not only oust Saddam but all other Arab leaders as well.
It is not unreasonable to believe that if the U.S. removed Saddam and helped Iraqis build not an overnight democracy but a more accountable, progressive and democratizing regime, it would have a positive, transforming effect on the entire Arab world -- a region desperately in need of a progressive model that works.
And liberals need to take heed. Just by mobilizing for war against Iraq, the U.S. has sent this region a powerful message: We will not leave you alone anymore to play with matches, because the last time you did, we got burned. Just the threat of a U.S. attack has already prompted Hezbollah to be on its best behavior in Lebanon (for fear of being next). And it has spurred Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah to introduce a proposal to his fellow Arab leaders for an "Arab Charter" of political and economic reform.
Let me sum up my argument with two of my favorite sayings. The first is by Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers, who says: "In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car." It is true of countries as well. Until the Arab peoples are given a real ownership stake in their countries -- a real voice in how they are run -- they will never wash them, never improve them as they should.
The second is an American Indian saying -- "If we don't turn around now, we just may get where we're going." The Arab world has been digging itself into a hole for a long time. If our generation simply helps it stop digging, possibly our grandchildren and its own will reap the benefits. But if we don't help the Arabs turn around now, they just may get where they're going -- a dead end where they will produce more and more undeterrables.
This is something liberals should care about -- because liberating the captive peoples of the Mideast is a virtue in itself and because in today's globalized world, if you don't visit a bad neighborhood, it will visit you.

HEADLINE: Then There Are the Poor 

 BODY:
It may not be class warfare, but it's breathtakingly provocative. One week after President Bush proposed billions in tax breaks for fretful stock owners, he revived a plan to wring an additional 10 hours of work each week from women with small children who are managing to hold a job under the federal welfare reform program. The program was hailed as an early success in reducing the welfare rolls. But it is now being threatened with ideological wrenching under the Bush proposal. 
 Not only would the marginal working mother on welfare face a 40-hour week -- six hours more than the national average for all women with young children -- but funding would be frozen for child care, transportation and all the other things she needs to make it possible for her to work in the first place. Inflation of about 11 percent has already eaten away at these benefits, meaning less for job training and other important support programs. But the president proposes to freeze funding at the 1996 ceiling of $17 billion. 
 Aside from the poor, no one would feel the pain more than the nation's governors. They somehow have to keep the welfare system afloat even though Mr. Bush has promised them next to nothing in emergency aid to ease their budget deficits. The states are already cutting welfare to meet the budget crunch. Gov. Gray Davis of California would eliminate child care subsidies for 55,000 children and cut temporary cash grants by 6 percent in the welfare-to-work program.
Other states are shutting welfare offices and trimming payrolls as welfare rolls edge up once more. The perverse effect of a 40-hour mandate will be to force states to resort to discredited "workfare" -- leaf-raking jobs that eat up the welfare clock but promise nothing in the way of a career.
Mr. Bush trots out success stories when he does these photo ops on welfare. But the system's managers out in the states sense a swing of the pendulum back toward less help for the poor in the forthcoming deficit scramble, in which other, stronger constituencies have the advantage in vying for government shelter in hard times.

HEADLINE: The Class President 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Once when I was covering the first President Bush, I took one of his top political strategists out to dinner.
 After a couple of martinis, he blurted out that the president was having a hard time with the idea that I was the White House reporter for The New York Times. 
 Dumbfounded, I asked why.
"We just picture you someplace else -- at The Chicago Tribune maybe," he said. 
Growing up in a Victorian mansion in Greenwich, the son of a Connecticut senator and Wall Street banker, the president had conjured up a certain image of what the Times White House reporter would be like. Someone less ethnic and working-class, with a byline like Chatsworth Farnsworth III. 
Poppy Bush was always gracious to me, even though he hated getting tweaked about being a patrician and complained that journalists cared more about class than he did.
The Bushes see the world through the prism of class, while denying that class matters. They think as long as they don't act "snotty" or swan around with a lot of fancy possessions, that class is irrelevant.
They make themselves happily oblivious to the difference between thinking you are self-made and being self-made, between liking to clear brush and having to clear brush.
In a 1986 interview with George senior and George junior, then still a drifting 40-year-old, The Washington Post's Walt Harrington asked the vice president how his social class shaped his life, noting that families like the Bushes often send their kids to expensive private schools to ensure their leg up.
"This sounds, well, un-American to George Jr., and he rages that it is crap from the 60's. Nobody thinks that way anymore!" Mr. Harrington wrote. "But his father cuts him off. . . . He seems genuinely interested. . . . But the amazing thing is that Bush finds these ideas so novel. . . . People who work the hardest -- even though some have a head start -- will usually get ahead, he says. To see it otherwise is divisive."
When journalists on W.'s campaign wrote that he had been admitted to Yale as a legacy, the candidate's Texas advisers pointed out that he had also gotten into Harvard, and no Bush family members had gone there. 
They seemed genuinely surprised when told that Harvard would certainly have recognized the surname and wagered on the future success of the person with it.
If you don't acknowledge that being a wealthy white man with the right ancestors blesses you with the desirable sort of inequality, how can you fix the undesirable sort of inequality? 
The Bushes seem to believe that the divisive thing in American society is dwelling on social and economic inequities, rather than the inequities themselves. 
When critics of W.'s tax cuts say they favor the wealthy, the president indignantly accuses them of class warfare. That's designed to intimidate critics by making them seem vaguely pinko. Besides, there's nothing more effective than deploring class warfare while ensuring that your class wins. It is the Bush tax cut that is fomenting class warfare.
When the University of Michigan tries to redress a historic racial injustice by giving some advantage based on race, Mr. Bush gets offended by arbitrarily conferred advantages, as if he himself were not an affirmative-action baby.
The president's preferred way of promoting diversity in higher education is throwing money at black colleges, which is not exactly a clarion call for integration.
For all the talk about how Republicans were morally re-educated by the Trent Lott fiasco, Mr. Bush is still pandering to an unspoken racial elitism. 
He resubmitted the nomination of a federal judge with a soft spot for cross-burners. And, as Time notes this week, he quietly reinstituted the practice -- which lapsed under his father in 1990 -- of sending a floral wreath on Memorial Day from the White House to the Confederate Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, where those nostalgic for the Old South celebrate Jefferson Davis. Why on earth would the president of the U.S. in the year 2003 take the trouble to do that?
Back in '86, when the Post reporter suggested that class mattered, W. found the contention un-American.
But isn't it un-American if the University of Michigan or Yale makes special room for the descendants of alumni but not the descendants of the disadvantaged?

HEADLINE: Talks Begin On Trade Pact With Morocco 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration began negotiations for a free trade agreement with Morocco today, emphasizing the importance of expanding economic relations with the Muslim world and pledging to try to complete the accord within one year. 
 America exports only $475 million worth of goods to Morocco each year, but both sides cast the hoped-for agreement as one that might enhance Morocco's role as a business hub connecting North Africa to Europe, the Middle Eastern and the United States. 
 Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said he hoped other Muslim nations would see the benefits derived by a pact. 
Congress approved the United States' first free trade agreement with a Muslim country -- Jordan -- days after the terrorist attacks. That agreement, negotiated by the Clinton administration, swept away most tariffs between the countries. The administration says its labor and environmental rules have become a model for trade agreements now being negotiated.
The United States already has a free trade agreement with Israel.
Charlene Barshefsky, the trade representative during the Clinton administration, said today that trade negotiations could provide an important counterweight to the Bush administration's focus on fighting terrorism and preparing for a possible war with Iraq.
Mr. Zoellick said today that the administration was trying to expand trade with Bahrain and Egypt and to help Saudi Arabia join the World Trade Organization.
The competition between the United States and Europe over trade with Morocco, a country that imports $11 billion worth of goods a year, blew up into a surprising diplomatic quarrel last week. French officials were said to have raised questions about Morocco's ability to have free trade with both the United States and Europe. Mr. Zoellick responded with a riposte he repeated today, accusing France of refusing to recognize that Morocco is no longer its colony.
But, he added, he had been told by American officials that the French had backed off and said the dispute had begun with a misunderstanding.

HEADLINE: China Called Likely to Oust 78 North Koreans 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Human rights campaigners warned today that China planned to send home the 78 North Korean refugees captured last weekend when the police foiled their exodus from China.
 The attempt last weekend to bring boatloads of the refugees to South Korea and Japan was financed and supported by 21 aid groups from South Korea, France, Japan and the United States. In a news conference here today, five nongovernmental groups demanded the release of the 78 North Koreans and 3 South Koreans, including a news photographer. 
 Alarmed by Chinese television reports that the refugees would be sent back shortly, Doctors Without Borders charged that over the last month China has forcibly returned 3,200 North Korean refugees and detained 1,300 more in camps. 
"Eighty percent of the support networks have collapsed," Marine Buissonniere, the group's Korea spokeswoman, said at the news conference. "All the Chinese and foreign aid workers have been arrested and some are still in prison."
Norbert Vollertsen, a German campaigner against North Korean human rights abuses, who has been involved in several attempts to find refuge for North Koreans, said: "This was only the first step. You can be sure we will try again."
Today, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman would not confirm a Chinese report that the refugees would be deported this week. But the spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, did castigate foreign aid groups for helping the North Koreans, whom China views as economic migrants.
"I want to point out that recently some international organizations or citizens used the North Korean illegal immigrants to steadily create trouble," she said. "These organizations' actions violate China's laws and harm social stability. These actions are illegal in China, and any country should fight against them."
China fears that a trickle of refugees could become a flood, leading to the destabilization of North Korea.
The Rev. Douglas E. Shin, a Los Angeles-based pastor, accused China of "double standards," contrasting its speed in deporting refugees to North Korea to its reluctance to impose economic penalties on North Korea over the resumption of its nuclear weapons program.
Cooperation between the North Korean and Chinese police is so tight, Mr. Shin charged, that Kim Jong Nam, the oldest son of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, is "in Beijing, taking care of this refugee roundup."
Chun Ki Won, a South Korean Christian missionary, warned, "These refugees will end up in political prison camps when they get back." 
"Up until now there has been some occasional leniency on those forcibly sent back to North Korea," continued Mr. Chun, who spent 220 days in Chinese jails for helping refugees. "But currently, there is no trial, no legal procedure when they are sent to the political prison camps."
Tim Peters, an American Christian aid worker from Seoul, said punishment of returned refugees in North Korea could be as severe as execution. Four refugees whom he had cared for until they were sent back last May were shot by firing squads for carrying Bibles, he said.
"The North Korean refugee in China is hunted like an animal -- he is under a bounty," continued Mr. Peters, who runs a nongovernmental organization, Helping Hands Korea. "The bounty for turning in North Korean refugees has recently been raised three or four times from what it was last summer, to 3,000 yuan" or $362. The reward for turning in an aid worker helping North Korean refugees is 10 times higher, he said. The boat evacuation plan derailed last weekend, Mr. Shin said, because "it turned out to be a setup."
The human rights workers urged the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to intervene to prevent the forced repatriation of the 78 arrested last weekend.

HEADLINE: Battle Nears Over Rezoning Near Seaport 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A long-running battle over a New York real estate family's desire to build a 43-story residential tower near the South Street Seaport despite 20 years of opposition by neighborhood residents and elected officials is about to pose a sharp challenge for the Bloomberg administration.
 The project, known as 250 Water Street, is the Bloomberg administration's first experience with that classic New York battle: powerful real estate interests clashing with local politicians and residents, with the city expected to take sides and make decisions. 
 Community groups and elected officials have blocked at least seven previous attempts by the developers, the Milstein family, to build what opponents describe as an oversize building within the low-slung historic district that marks Manhattan's origins as a seafaring port.
But this time, the Milsteins' proposal for apartment towers has emerged only weeks after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined his vision for rebuilding Lower Manhattan by encouraging development, especially housing. 
And the Milstein project has become particularly touchy for the Bloomberg administration. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, did not return calls for comment, nor did the Landmarks Preservation Commission or the City Planning Department.
The Milsteins say their project is a test of the mayor's resolve to rebuild downtown, increase housing and encourage risk-taking developers. Residents and property owners are vowing to fight for a historic district that they say can be a valuable tourist attraction and an economic engine because it harks back to the days of Moby-Dick. 
Both sides are girding for battle today at a public hearing at the Department of City Planning over a plan sponsored by Community Board 1 to "downzone" the South Street Seaport Historic District, a move that would prohibit tall buildings. Both sides fear that the Bloomberg administration will give in to their opponents. "This has the potential to be a very bloody battle," said one planning commissioner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Milsteins have enlisted the Real Estate Board of New York and hired a public relations specialist, George Arzt. 
Their opponents are backed by the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, local politicians and the Municipal Art Society, as well as local landowners and the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group.
The project site is a parking lot that covers the block bound by Beekman and Water Streets, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip.
"The development of 250 Water Street would serve as an important catalyst in the city's effort to rebuild and attract new economic investment to Lower Manhattan," said Howard Milstein, whose family bought the lot in 1979. "City planners have long recognized that a successful development of vacant sites such as 250 Water are vital to the revitalization of the financially struggling seaport area."
The Milsteins have scaled back what was a proposed 43-story office tower in 1984 to a residential building with two towers, one 24 stories tall and the other 13. The two towers, they say, break up what would have been a massive building and provide views to the East River. The project, on the western edge of the historic district, would help support the low-scale buildings there, they say.
Whatever City Planning does, the proposal needs the approval of the landmarks commission. 
The project, the Milstein camp says, would be smaller in height than Southbridge Towers, the high-rise apartment complex across Pearl Street from their block. The developer is aware that many of the residents of Southbridge are political supporters of Mr. Silver and opponents of the Milsteins' plans.
Many of the important principals know each other well. Mr. Doctoroff was once a partner of Howard Milstein in their ill-fated ownership of the Islanders hockey team, though neither man expresses any affection for the other. And Jennifer J. Raab, a former chairwoman of the landmarks commission who failed to approve one of the Milstein proposals for Water Street, is a cousin of Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance.
Madelyn Wils, chairwoman of Community Board 1, said the towers would clash with the four- and five-story brick buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries that characterize the 12-block historic district. 
She said the community board raised $80,000 to come up with a plan for rezoning the district, with the encouragement of the planning department under both the Giuliani and the Bloomberg adminstrations.
But the developer learned of the proposed rezoning last year as it was working on its eighth plan for the site, by Charles A. Platt, an architect and a former commissioner who had voted against a previous Milstein plan. Ms. Wils and others now fear that the Bloomberg administration will scuttle the zoning proposal. 
"They can't say, 'All bets are off,' " Ms. Wils said. "Promises have to be kept. You don't wipe out a historic district in the name of rebuilding downtown. The Milsteins have not played nicely for 20 years. But because of their greed we have not been able to settle this to everyone's satisfaction."
The Milstein camp, in turn, said that the community board's zoning plan would result in an ugly squat building covering the entire lot.
Frank J. Sciame, a property owner in the historic district who has developed apartments in two 18th-century buildings, supports downzoning.
"I am very much pro-development, especially downtown, but not above all else," he said. "Downtown needs housing, but it also needs quality-of-life elements that give it life."
But the Milstein camp suspects that the Bloomberg administration will approve the rezoning effort because it does not wish to tangle with Mr. Silver. Mr. Silver, a longtime opponent of the Milsteins' plans, dismisses the talk.
"This is simply something that should be done," he said about the community board's rezoning.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 23, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the first paragraph of an article yesterday about a proposal for an apartment tower near the South Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan misstated the height and configuration. As the article said later, the project would be an apartment complex with two towers, one 24 stories tall and the other 13 stories. It would not be a single 43-story tower; such a proposal was abandoned earlier.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans Little More Money For Bulk of Federal Programs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The budget President Bush plans to propose to Congress early next month calls for the smallest increase in years in spending for most government programs and little new money at all except for domestic security and the military, the White House said today.
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the president's budget director, told reporters that Mr. Bush wanted discretionary spending, which involves all federal outlays except spending for automatic benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare, to grow by only 4 percent, or about $30 billion, in the fiscal year 2004, which begins Oct. 1. 
 That would be less than half the rate of growth in 2003, the current fiscal year, and less than one-third the rate in 2002. 
The figure does not include the potential cost of a war with Iraq.
The biggest increases, Mr. Daniels said, would be for domestic security and the military. Some rise in spending, he said, would be allowed for education and veterans programs. That would leave little new money for the hundreds of government programs in areas like medical research, environmental protection and space exploration.
"We do have to be careful about spending" in light of the mushrooming budget deficits and the possibility of a war with Iraq, Mr. Daniels said.
Last week, Mr. Daniels indicated that the new budget would show a deficit of $300 billion or more, the largest deficit in history in terms of dollars but somewhat smaller than the deficits of the 1980's and early 1990 when measured as a percentage of the economy. He said the budget would be in deficit for "the foreseeable future."
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the implication of Mr. Daniels's announcement was that programs outside defense and domestic security would actually have to be cut by billions of dollars.
"This is another example of the president's misplaced priorities," Mr. Conrad said. "While he's proposing a budget that contains real cuts in real programs, he's pushing another big tax cut."
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Mr. Conrad's counterpart in the House, said, "We're beginning to see the trade-off between domestic spending and tax cuts."
Based on what is known about the administration's plans, $14 billion of the $30 billion proposed in new spending would be for the military and another $5 billion would be for domestic security programs. Education spending on poor children is expected to rise by about $1 billion. That would leave only about $10 billion for all other programs, a rise of 1.3 percent, which is less than the expected 2 percent inflation rate. 
Discretionary spending rose 13 percent in fiscal 2002 and is expected to grow another 9 percent in 2003.
The budget director's statement today came soon after Mr. Bush met in the White House with a group of economists who favor his $674 billion, 10-year tax-cut plan. One of them, Prof. Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard, who was chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said later that Mr. Bush's plan was the right tonic for the ailing economy.
Mr. Daniels said the 4 percent rise in discretionary spending matched the anticipated growth in the average family's spending over the same period. "The government's budget ought not increase more than the typical family's," Mr. Daniels said.
The $751 billion the government is expected to spend this year on discretionary programs is about one-third of the entire federal budget. Most of the rest goes for Social Security and Medicare, under which benefits are paid automatically to everyone who is eligible, and for interest on the national debt.
Mr. Daniels suggested that in the new budget, Mr. Bush would propose long-term limits on spending for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The budget director called this "a serious attempt to modernize Medicare."

HEADLINE: Mayor Joins Officials Seeking U.S. Help in City Budget Crisis 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg added his voice, though somewhat quietly, yesterday to the growing chorus of local elected officials who want the federal government to send the city money to help pull it through its budget crisis.
 Mr. Bloomberg went to Senator Charles E. Schumer's Midtown office yesterday to announce his support of a bill Mr. Schumer is introducing that would channel $40 billion in federal aid to state and local governments for budget relief. The bill would net New York State $2.5 billion, of which $650 million would go to the city. 
 Although many elected officials -- from Senator Schumer to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to members of the city's Congressional delegation and the City Council -- have long called for budget relief from the federal government, Mr. Bloomberg has discounted the possibility: he would love the money, he has said, but he is not counting on it.
Unlike most of New York City's elected officials, Mr. Bloomberg is a Republican, and he has been very cautious in making requests to his fellow Republican, President Bush. In throwing his support behind the bill yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg took pains to emphasize that it was a bipartisan effort: it is being introduced by Senator Schumer, a Democrat, and Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a Republican.
Just last week, when Mr. Bloomberg was asked about seeking federal aid, he said: "While I would love to see the federal government give New York money to close its budget gap, the way Washington works is, if they did that, they would have to do it, I assume, for every city. And that's a lot of money, and they probably don't have that."
Asked why he was suddenly calling for such aid, Mr. Bloomberg said: "Calling for it, and my judgment as to whether or not they can get it, No. 1, are two different things. No. 2, I hadn't counted on Senators Schumer and Snowe championing the cause."
Mr. Schumer said that with cities and states across the nation struggling with budget deficits, he hoped that the proposal would win support in Washington, where the Bush administration is focused on a policy of tax cuts to jump-start the economy.
"For the federal government to cut taxes, and then have the states and localities raise taxes, is sort of like robbing Peter to pay Paul," Mr. Schumer said. "You wouldn't get much of the stimulus that we all seek and need in the new fiscal plan."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WHITE HOUSE; 
BUSH SAYS IRAQIS ARE STILL RESISTING DEMAND TO DISARM

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that Iraq was not complying with demands that it disarm and expressed frustration at calls from France and other nations to allow more time for diplomacy and United Nations weapons inspections.
 Mr. Bush's comments were part of a coordinated effort by the administration to make a case to both domestic and international audiences that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, must go, even if achieving that goal requires sending in troops. The effort involved speeches by senior administration officials, the release today of a document outlining what the White House said was a pattern of lying and deceit by Mr. Hussein and the establishment of a new White House office to promote its message abroad. 
 The document made no new charges about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction and provided skeptical allies with no new evidence or intelligence to overcome their opposition to military action. 
France, Germany and other nations, which have counseled against a rush to military action, continued to resist. The diplomatic roadblocks threatened to complicate administration efforts to reach decisions in the next several weeks about whether to launch an invasion, and if so, whether to seek explicit backing from the United Nations Security Council. The French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, said today in Belgium, "We see no justification today for an intervention, since the inspectors are able to do their work."
Even before France warned on Monday that it would not support any Security Council resolution for military action against Iraq in the coming weeks, the United States faced complicated issues of timing, with some nations and the weapons inspectors themselves seeking more time to search for chemical and biological weapons and evidence of a nuclear weapons program. Inspectors have found no smoking guns, nor has the Bush administration successfully pointed them to any.
The military buildup in the Persian Gulf is scheduled to reach a level by mid- to late February that would allow military commanders to invade using their preferred battle plan. By midspring any attack could be slowed by the hot desert weather.
Using some of its toughest language to date, the administration signaled today that its decisions would be relatively speedy.
Likening Saddam Hussein's maneuvering to "a rerun of a bad movie," the president warned again that time was running out for Iraq to disarm and suggested that international opposition would not deter the administration if it decided that an invasion was necessary.
Mr. Bush indicated that he had not yet made a decision on military action, telling reporters, "I will let you know when the moment has come."
He signaled that for now he would continue pressing nations that are expressing doubts about military action, noting that the United States had overcome the expectation last fall that it would be unable to win a unanimous Security Council vote on Iraqi disarmament.
"It's clear to me now that he is not disarming," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Hussein. "And surely our friends have learned lessons from the past. Surely we have learned how this man deceives and delays. He's giving people the runaround."
The American diplomatic and public relations effort is expected to build through next week, when the weapons inspectors report to the Security Council on Monday, Mr. Bush delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday and the Security Council convenes on Wednesday to review the inspectors' report.
The 32-page document released today, titled "Apparatus of Lies," purports to document the elaborate ways in which Mr. Hussein has deceived his people, world leaders and Western journalists -- all in the name of enriching himself, building his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and oppressing Iraqis. 
The administration dispatched Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, to make a speech here today in which he dismissed as "very dangerous wishful thinking" the hope that Mr. Hussein would voluntarily give up any chemical or biological weapons he has or abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Rebuffing the notion that an aggressive weapons inspection program or diplomacy could keep Mr. Hussein in check, Mr. Armitage said it was "ludicrous" to think Mr. Hussein would remain "in his box."
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, will use a speech in New York on Thursday to define the administration's expectations for how Iraq should disarm, administration officials said. On Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the nonmilitary options toward Iraq had been all but exhausted.
But rallying support for military action has clearly been complicated by France's stance, which has been backed to varying degrees by Germany, Russia and China, among other nations.
The administration has not made a decision on whether to seek a formal new resolution backing military action from the Security Council, an American official said today. 
Mr. Bush has promised to consult with the other Security Council members. But he has left open the option of leading a "coalition of the willing," as he put it again today, to depose Mr. Hussein without Security Council authorization beyond that contained in Resolution 1441, which was adopted unanimously last fall. It warns of "serious consequences" for Iraq if it fails to disarm.
Administration officials said the timetable was still to press for a decision from the Council in a matter of weeks rather than months, on the ground that Mr. Hussein's defiance of the demand for cooperation was already obvious. The French may disagree, one official said, but their argument that the inspections are working to disarm Iraq "won't stand up to scrutiny."
But several of the nations most skeptical about the need for war showed no signs of backing down. 
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, told a political rally in Germany, "Don't expect Germany to approve a resolution legitimizing war; don't expect it."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met in Washington today with his Italian counterpart, Franco Frattini. Afterward, Mr. Frattini said his country would support the United States "in the unfortunate event of a war," but he added that "this will be done within the U.N. framework."
Mr. de Villepin of France said the European countries on the Security Council were seeking a common position. "It's important that Europe can express itself about such an important conflict with a single voice," he added. "We are mobilized. We want to believe that war can be avoided."
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the closest ally of the United States in confronting Iraq, said the international pressure on Baghdad was already having an effect on Mr. Hussein's government. "They are rattled, they are weakening," Mr. Blair told the House of Commons.
To help get its message out around the world, the White House formally announced today that Mr. Bush had established an Office of Global Communications to guide United States government agencies in how to "disseminate truthful, accurate and effective messages about the American people and their government" to audiences around the world.
But the administration continued to face arguments that confronting Iraq was a less pressing matter of national security than pursuing the campaign against terrorism and that in any case an aggressive inspections program would keep Mr. Hussein from using any weapons he has or might develop.
Mr. Bush showed no sign that the criticism had changed his thinking. Speaking to reporters in the Roosevelt Room, the president said Mr. Hussein had been given "ample time" to disarm but instead had chosen to "play hide and seek."
"You know, how much time do we need to see clearly that he's not disarming?" Mr. Bush said with evident frustration. "As I said, this looks like a rerun of a bad movie and I'm not interested in watching it."
His spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush would continue working to "put spine into the United Nations and the rest of the international community" in enforcing the resolutions. Should the United Nations fail to back up its original resolutions demanding Iraq's disarmament, Mr. Fleischer said, the organization would risk becoming irrelevant in the same way the League of Nations did between the two world wars.

Kennedy, in Sweeping Attack, Faults Bush on Iraq and Taxes

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy accused the Bush administration today of rushing into war with Iraq at the expense of the struggle against terrorism and the domestic needs of the country.
 "This is the wrong war at the wrong time," Mr. Kennedy said in a speech at the National Press Club encompassing virtually all of the Democratic critique of the administration's foreign and domestic agenda. "The threat from Iraq is not imminent, and it will distract America from the two more immediate threats to our security: the clear and present danger of terrorism and the crisis with North Korea." 
 Mr. Kennedy's broadside was one of the most forceful Democratic denunciations of the administration's conduct of foreign policy since Sept. 11. Mr. Kennedy, of Massachusetts, is more prominent and less constrained by political concerns than the Democratic presidential candidates, but he reflected what appears to be a growing willingness among Democrats to take on Mr. Bush's actions overseas and a confidence that Mr. Bush's economic policies lack widespread support. 
Mr. Kennedy echoed the comments of the administration's European critics in demanding that United Nations weapons inspectors be given more time to conduct their search in Iraq, saying that the recent discovery of empty chemical warheads was a positive sign.
"If our goal is disarmament, we are likely to accomplish more by inspections than by war," he said. "The international community accomplished greater disarmament during seven years of inspections than it did during the gulf war."
He said the administration had been "AWOL" in letting a crisis build in North Korea and had overreacted by refusing to negotiate when that country restarted its nuclear program. 
Mr. Kennedy focused on the tax-cut plan as an indication of misplaced priorities. The rich, he said, should be asked to sacrifice no less than the middle class and the poor.
"We cannot say it is wartime for the rest of America, but still peacetime for the rich," he said.

Apology From Rumsfeld
(By The New York Times), WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld apologized today for remarks that some veterans' groups had criticized as disparaging draftees.
Earlier this month, Mr. Rumsfeld said he opposed calls to reinstate the draft, and suggested that the training and expense of conscripting troops had not been worth the trouble. Draftees, he said, "were sucked into the intake, trained for a period of months and then went out, adding no value, no advantage really, to the United States armed services over any sustained period of time."
Today, Mr. Rumsfeld said his remarks had been misunderstood. He had sought to underscore the importance, he said, of letting members of the all-volunteer forces have longer tours of duty to make full use of their training and experience.
"The last thing I would want to do would be to disparage the service of those draftees," he said. "I always have had the highest respect for their service and I offer my full apology to any veteran who misinterpreted my remarks."

The Two Koreas Open Cabinet-Level Talks

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
North and South Korea began their first cabinet-level meetings here today since the start of a crisis last fall over the North's nuclear weapons programs.
 The chief northern delegate, Kim Ryong Song, a senior cabinet minister, struck an upbeat note about the talks, which are scheduled to last four days, saying, "Let's hold our hands together and move forward." 
 Mr. Kim's arrival nearly coincided with that of John R. Bolton, the American under secretary of state for arms control and international security, who flew here from China, where he had discussed presenting the issue of North Korean nuclear proliferation to the United Nations Security Council. 
But potentially the most important meeting on the crisis, several regional experts said, took place on Monday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. There, a special Russian envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov, presented a three-part resolution plan to the North's leader, Kim Jong Il. 
The plan would involve guarantees of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, written security guarantees for North Korea from the United States, and a package of relief and economic aid for the impoverished Communist state.
In Beijing, where he went after the talks, Mr. Losyukov said he had sensed "some optimism the problems can be resolved." 
The Russian diplomacy followed an Australian delegation's effort to press North Korea on the need to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, told Australia's Nine Network after the delegation's visit: "I'm a little more confident than I was a few days ago because of the messages the delegation has brought back with them. They had pretty constructive talks." 
North Korea experts cite what they call two sure signs that the country is contemplating a diplomatic solution: the abrupt softening in official statements in the last week, and the rare access given to Mr. Losyukov. He met for six hours with both Chairman Kim and Vice Marshal Cho Myong Rok, who was North Korea's special envoy to the White House during the Clinton administration. It was equally unusual, those experts said, that North Korea broadcast news of the Russian envoy's visit the same day, rather than delaying a day or two.
The crisis began in October with the American disclosure that North Korea was secretly developing a nuclear weapons program, in violation of a number of international agreements. The situation has been in a downward spiral ever since, with Washington engineering the punitive suspension of fuel shipments to the country, which had been provided under a previous nuclear arms control agreement, and North Korea retaliating by expelling nuclear monitors and withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
For weeks, North Korea has insisted that bilateral discussions with the United States to guarantee its security are the only way out of the deadlock. This weekend it repeated those calls, urging "knee to knee" talks with the United States. Washington, on the other hand, has said it will not negotiate with Pyongyang, and has cast the problem as a confrontation between North Korea and the international community.
"The U.S. has defined this as an international crisis, and for that reason has ruled out a bilateral dialogue," said Scott Snyder, the Korea representative of the Asia Foundation, a regional research organization. "But at the same time, all of the parties recognize that unless the United States is involved in the diplomatic process, there probably won't be a solution. The Russian visit will be very useful for informing the North of how united the international community is on this issue. For the time being, though, I don't expect a breakthrough."
The talks here between South and North Korea, meanwhile, will be watched closely for indications of whether the North is willing to modify its behavior in return for South Korean economic and diplomatic support, or whether it simply seeks to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul.
South Korea's president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, has been an outspoken advocate of dialogue and engagement with North Korea, to the point of irritating Washington, diplomats say. In a live television interview over the weekend, for example, he said that he worried about war plans being entertained by senior American officials. 
President Bush and members of his cabinet have gone out of their way recently to say there are no plans to attack North Korea. Washington is engaging in intensive consultations with the incoming administration here; with the looming possibility of war with Iraq, the United States is pursuing dialogue to resolve the North Korean crisis.
In the past, South Korea has rarely pushed security issues in its discussions with the North, and the United States is eager to see it do so.
Asked about the nuclear crisis, South Korea's unification minister, Jeong Se Hyun, who is leading the talks with the North, seemed to play down the issue. "The nuclear concerns are just one aspect of the talks," he said. "We have a lot to discuss."

HEADLINE: Carter Offers Proposals to Resolve Conflict in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter dived into this country's tumultuous political crisis today, offering two proposals for ending seven weeks of bitter stalemate between President Hugo Chavez and a broad coalition of opponents that has left the country's economy in shambles and its people poised for violence.
 Speaking about the incendiary turmoil in carefully measured language, Mr. Carter, last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, urged the government and its opponents to accept an electoral settlement to the conflict. 
 He pledged that the international community would oversee compliance, so that "there would be no delays or trickery." 
He said that in any accord, the opposition would be expected to immediately end a national strike that has lasted for 51 days, shutting down most major businesses and crippling the state-owned oil industry.
"Our feeling is that both sides now want to reach an agreement to end the impasse that is destroying the economy of this country," Mr. Carter said during a news conference this morning. "I don't think anyone imagined that the strike would last 50 days. And no one wants to see it last for 70 days or 100 days.
"In my opinion," he added, "the proposals we have put forward encompass the basic demands of both sides."
Mr. Carter's proposals were drafted after four hours of private meetings with President Chavez on Monday and many hours of meetings with important business people, union officials and political parties who lead the opposition movement.
In the briefing, Mr. Carter acknowledged that his plan was not a "revolutionary concept," but more an echo of ideas that have been slowly gaining support within the opposition and the government.
One proposal he made today was the adoption of a constitutional amendment that would cut the president's term from six years to four. The amendment -- which would require a vote by the National Assembly or a public referendum -- would end Mr. Chavez's term this year.
As an alternative, Mr. Carter suggested that both sides agree to a recall referendum in August that would allow the people to vote on whether Mr. Chavez should be removed from office. The current Constitution already allows such a vote.
"This meets the needs that the opposition expressed to us yesterday, that there had not been a specific proposal placed on the table," Mr. Carter said. "I think this will be a step in the right direction. My hope is that both sides will receive the proposals favorably and that they will be adequately flexible to accommodate the differences that may still exist."
Later, in a briefing with American reporters, Mr. Carter said he believed that his proposals were the best hope for peace. "The alternative is to continue chaos," he said.
In the briefing, Mr. Carter said he was pleased by the "very positive reaction" from President Chavez. But he cautioned that Mr. Chavez had not given the proposals his full support, and that Mr. Chavez was reluctant to support an amendment that would shorten his term. 
Mr. Carter also noted that Mr. Chavez was not eager to let all of the 30,000 oil workers who joined the strike have their jobs back.
Since the strike began on Dec. 2, Mr. Chavez has announced the firing of more than 1,000 oil workers, many of them senior and middle managers. Strike leaders have said they will not end their work stoppage unless the government agrees to rescind those dismissals.
Mr. Carter said that he had appealed to Mr. Chavez on behalf of the oil workers, but that Mr. Chavez had charged that some workers had sabotaged refineries and tankers.
"That is a criminal act," Mr. Carter said. "But the decision about the punishment of those people would be made by the courts."
Mr. Carter arrived in Venezuela six days ago. He spent the weekend fishing for peacock bass with Gustavo A. Cisneros, considered Venezuela's most powerful businessman and a key figure in the opposition. 
Mr. Carter said he and Mr. Cisneros had not talked politics. But in his time here, Mr. Carter was able to get a close-up look at the deep damage and heightened tensions of Venezuela's latest political storm.
On Friday, President Chavez seized warehouses full of soft drinks and bottled water that had been closed by the strike. The government threatened further seizures against food companies that it accused of hoarding essential supplies.
Mr. Chavez also implied that he might walk away from negotiating sessions with the opposition that have been overseen by the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Cesar Gaviria.
In an interview, Mr. Gaviria acknowledged that Mr. Carter's visit had come at a difficult time.
"Circumstances have changed a lot in the last few days," he said. "There's much more tension."
Nevertheless, an increasing number of opposition leaders have abandoned calls for Mr. Chavez's immediate resignation and have begun publicly expressing support for a constitutional amendment to shorten his term. In an address to the National Assembly last week, Mr. Chavez said he would not support such an amendment. But he said that if it was passed by a popular vote, he would abide by it.
"I think that is the path to a solution," said Eduardo Fernandez, president of a Christian Democratic party. "The fact that Chavez has said he would accept it, I think that is a way out of the crisis."
Since well before the strike, Mr. Chavez repeatedly told the opposition that he would abide by a recall vote. But opposition leaders argued that the political crisis was too explosive to wait until August for an electoral resolution.
"I hope there is going to be some backing down on both sides," Mr. Carter said, "which is always a crucial element in every dispute in which I have ever been involved."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK; 
A Waterfront Palace of Produce

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
THE mightiest architecture critic in San Francisco spoke forcefully on Oct. 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake shook the unsightly Embarcadero Freeway to its marrow and unwittingly liberated one of this city's most beloved and historic buildings.
 The Ferry Building, on the waterfront at the foot of Market Street, was once the spiritual heart of the city's public life, the Grand Central Terminal of an era when ferries plied the fog-shrouded waters, and getting to and from San Francisco involved water rather than graceful spans of steel. For 30 years before the quake, the terminal, built in 1898 and designed by A. Page Brown, a former McKim Mead & White draftsman, was all but hidden by the freeway, which severed the connection between building and city. Its lighted clock tower -- modeled on the bell tower of the cathedral in Seville -- was barely visible above the concrete. 
 The freeway was deemed unsafe and dismantled after a political battle in the early 90's. And in March, San Franciscans will finally be reunited with their waterfront landmark when the Ferry Building assumes yet another guise. After a three-year, $90 million preservation effort, it will reopen in time for spring asparagus and fava beans as the Ferry Building Marketplace, the new home of the city's heralded Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market and a yearned-for mecca for the city's food-obsessed culture.
Where baggage and cargo handlers once stood will be Northern California's culinary A-list, including Cowgirl Creamery from Point Reyes, complete with dairy bar; the Acme Bread Company of Berkeley, with on-the-spot hearth ovens; and the Hog Island Oyster Company from the tiny coastal hamlet of Marshall, whose seawater tanks are purified with ultraviolet sterilizers. The anchor tenant will be the farmers' market itself, the holy grail of locally grown organic fruits and vegetables.
The building's architectural liberation, especially the double-height skylight nave with arches recalling Roman aqueducts, is likely to come as a surprise to many who are too young to remember the interior with its marble mosaic floors. 
Until the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge eclipsed ferry traffic in the 30's, the building was the crossroads of San Francisco. From 1885 to 1930, the most direct way to reach the city from points north and east was by water. Over 20 million frenetic commuters and travelers a year hustled up the second-floor gangplanks to waiting rooms, sitting on wooden benches listening for the whistles that would carry them home.
The architecture, though utilitarian, reflected the bay's mountainous grandeur. The building -- the only surviving link to the outside world after the 1906 earthquake -- was designed as a public gathering space, with a 656-foot hall luminous with natural light. Its tower like a layer cake, once lighted as a beacon for ships, can still be seen for miles down Market Street.
In its shadow have been over a century of parades and protests, including the bloody labor strikes of the 1930's and, more recently, last Saturday's antiwar rally. At sunset on the Bay Bridge, the tower often unfolds in slow motion through the fog, anchoring the ethereal city in the mist.
Like many urban landmarks, it has suffered decades of indignity. The raffish clatter along the waterfront, symbolized by the departed Sanguinetti's restaurant across the street, where steam beer, spaghetti, Italian bread and all the fish you could eat for a nickel vanished when ferries declined as a favored means of transportation. When a group of shipping and import-export companies moved in, in 1952, the interior was bisected, modernized and divided into seven-foot-wide corridors with low fluorescent-lighted ceilings as if it were just an office tower. The 656-foot-long skylight was covered with plywood and asphalt shingles, the arched windows with triangular panes stripped and outfitted in aluminum. 
The crowning blow was the Embarcadero Freeway, erected in 1958, "the Dambarcadero" as the columnist Herb Caen called it. When it was demolished, a San Francisco Examiner editorial observed: "You have to go to the Berlin Wall to find more jubilation over concrete being reduced to rubble."
Cathy Simon, the design principal for SMWM, the architects who oversaw the restoration, regards the Ferry Building as "San Francisco's living room." Now nearing completion, it is the historic piece de resistance of the revitalized Embarcadero, with its waterfront palm-lined pedestrian walk and vintage trolley cars connecting Pac Bell Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, with Fisherman's Wharf.
With the preservation architects Page & Turnbull, Ms. Simon has brought back the nave, with its curved trusses and creme fraiche-colored brick and marble walls, and re-exposed the vaulted skylight, resurrecting the cathedral-like aura. The eastern side of the building facing the water, once slotted with piers, has been rebuilt.
The upper floors are office spaces with killer views. For the first time, the waters of the bay will be visible through the building, and passengers taking ferries to Oakland, Sausalito and elsewhere will be able to walk through the building to get to the piers. Along the way they can pick up varietal chocolate or artisanal olive oil as they stroll a Parisian-style indoor streetscape.
The rejuvenation of the building comes at an odd moment. With the Bay Area economy reeling and tourism down, the city is a different place from just four and a half years ago, when the Port of San Francisco, a city agency, held a competition for development of the building. The project is a public-private venture financed by Equity Office Properties Trust of Chicago, which is leasing the building from the port agency, which will share in the profits. The word in the incestuous world of San Francisco foodies is that rents have been reduced to lure culinary stars. The developers are counting on the 250,000 downtown workers and roughly 11,000 ferry passengers, a number expected to rise with the planned expansion of ferry service in the next decade.
The convergence of food and architecture may be prescient: food permeates culture in San Francisco as it does in perhaps no other place. This is a city where college-educated farmers write books and subscribe to the symphony, while cultural figures like Michael Tilson Thomas, the music director of the San Francisco Symphony, the filmmaker Philip Kaufman and the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti breakfast at the Cafe Bastille on Saturday mornings before shopping at the nearby farmers' market.
For all the symbolism and glory of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is not a place where people meet. Randolph Delehanty, a historian and author of "San Francisco: The Ultimate Guide" (Chronicle Books, 1995), thinks the timing of this addition to San Francisco's public life could be felicitous, given the uncertainty of the world and the city's swollen population of bon vivants.
There is comfort food and comfort architecture, too. "The worse things get," he observes, "the more you like your food."

HEADLINE: Inflation Is Exceeding Target Set By Canada 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
While Americans worry about the risks of a double-dip recession, slack demand and falling prices, the talk north of the border is about the opposite. Consumer demand is strong, inflation is on the high side and there is talk that an interest rate increase may be needed this year to slow the pace.
 Statistics Canada, the government statistical office, said today that consumer prices were 3.9 percent higher in December than they were a year earlier. The core inflation rate calculated by the Bank of Canada, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in December, the 10th consecutive month that it exceeded the bank's target of 2 percent. 
 Canada has outpaced the United States in economic growth for most of the last two years. It is less dependent on the deeply depressed technology and telecommunications industries, and has been buoyed by strong automotive industry sales. In contrast to the United States, Canada's national budget is roughly in balance and it has a current-account surplus.
The Bank of Canada said on Tuesday that it would maintain its benchmark overnight lending rate at 2.75 percent, reflecting uncertainty over economic prospects in the United States and a possible war in Iraq. But the bank cautioned that inflation was accelerating faster than it had expected. 
"With the stance of monetary policy currently very stimulative, a reduction of stimulus will be required in order to return inflation to the 2 percent target over the medium term," the bank said.
The prospect of rising interest rates has helped lift the value of the Canadian dollar above 65 United States cents in the last week, its highest in eight months. It traded this afternoon at 65.27 cents.
Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Canada, wrote in a report after the bank's announcement that it "is clearly signaling that, in the absence of a marked slowdown in growth or a sharp drop in core inflation, monetary policy will be tightened as soon as economic and geopolitical risks subside."
Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, offered the view, however, that "if the U.S. economy stays sluggish and the Canadian dollar firms, the bank may find that is enough of a drag on economic growth." About 85 percent of exports go to the United States.
Mr. Shenfeld said that he did not expect further interest rate increases this year, but he acknowledged that his was a minority view.
In a sign that the Canadian economy may be starting to run out of steam, Statistics Canada also reported today that factory shipments fell by 1.3 percent in November, after being unchanged in October. The main Canadian stock index, which has risen 18 percent since its low in October, rose slightly today.

HEADLINE: Outsider Art, In From the Edge And Under the Gavel 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
ROBERT M. GREENBERG doesn't exactly look like Diane Keaton in Woody Allen's "Annie Hall," but stepping into an elevator in Hell's Kitchen last week, dressed in a maxicoat with a beret pulled tight to his wire-rimmed glasses, a long bob of hair hanging out the bottom, he shared some of the same oddball charm.
 Mr. Greenberg, 54, founder and chief creative officer of R/GA, an interactive advertising agency, and a specialist in digital imagery, worked with Mr. Allen on "Zelig," constructing the archival film sequences that pasted Mr. Allen's Leonard Zelig into the past. 
 Oddball charm also characterizes Mr. Greenberg's collection of outsider and self-taught art, a significant portion of which is to be auctioned on Monday at Christie's in New York, in the first stand-alone sale by either Christie's or Sotheby's devoted to the category of outsider art. 
But charm is problematic, as Woody Allen's Alvy Singer discovered.
Outsider and self-taught art, defined by Christie's as art created by insane, institutionalized, unschooled and other "culturally isolated" individuals, can be as dark as it is naive. And its marketplace -- the dealers, collectors and venues like the Outsider Art Fair, opening today at the Puck Building in New York -- can be as subject to visions as its artists.
"There's nothing sweet about it," Mr. Greenberg said, at home in his loft on West 38th Street, where he lives with Corvova Lee, his companion of 17 years, in a troubling crowd of carnylike works of art.
Mr. Greenberg's day at Christie's is problematic too. The outsider art world has drawn its sword, both in defense and attack, amid fear over whether a well-invested champion is attempting to legitimize it as fine art or abandon it. And there is worry that the small enclave of outsider art, living largely by its own rules and its own assigned value, will not play well on the big stage, failing to deliver the big prices and celebrity that Christie's and Mr. Greenberg are expecting. "The galleries are nervous," Mr. Greenberg acknowledged. 
Christie's could find itself in a cold sweat too if, as dealers are saying, collectors have purchased pieces from Mr. Greenberg's collection through galleries during the last year.
In addition to raising money for further collecting and for architectural projects like his houses on Fire Island and St. Bart's and a new house in upstate New York, Mr. Greenberg said he hopes to help outsider art's acceptance within the contemporary art world. An auction by a major house could ensure attendance by important institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, which has exhibited outsider art but rarely collected it. It could also attract important contemporary art collectors, with deeper pockets, breaking the ceiling on prices in the provincial realm of outsider art and setting self-aggrandizing records. In the current economic climate, expensive outsider art might look like a bargain.
Betting that the time was ripe, Christie's complied with Mr. Greenberg's thinking with an extensive mailing of 15,000 catalogs and announcements to buyers and bidders on its contemporary art, folk art, Americana, tribal art, antiquities, 20th-century decorative arts and American Indian lists. Its presale estimate, $1.5 million to $2.2 million for the 121 lots, 15 of them not from Mr. Greenberg's collection, have raised eyebrows if not yet prices.
Nancy Druckman, director of the American folk art department at Sotheby's, who handles outsider art for that house, described the $400,000 to $600,000 estimate for the lot on the catalog cover, "Noah's Ark," a limestone block by William Edmondson, a stone carver working in Tennessee in the early 20th century, as "pretty aggressive."
Robert Manley, the specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie's who, with Margo Rosenberg in the American folk art department, worked with Mr. Greenberg on selecting the lots and pricing them, said that typically it was Mr. Greenberg who pushed the estimates high, something Mr. Manley thought unconservative for a category that was simultaneously trying to establish itself with a new general audience.
John Ollman, the owner of Fleisher/Ollman Gallery in Philadelphia, through whose hands the ark passed before, described it as "outrageously overestimated." Mr. Ollman explained: "I've sold more Edmondsons than any dealer in the United States, and I sold the ark. It's an important piece but not the most important piece. It's never been a piece that sold for more than $305,000."
Asked if contemporary art collectors might be prepared to pay what outsider art collectors never have, a central gamble of the Greenberg sale, Mr. Ollman replied, "That's myth -- do you know anybody that's spending $500,000 that doesn't do their homework and find out what something's worth?"
Mr. Ollman has been proved wrong at least once. Sotheby's 1977 sale of a collection of 21 drawings by Bill Traylor, an artist from Alabama and an outsider art market star, took in $777,700, roughly three times its presale estimate. Traylor, who died in 1947, is now considered blue-chip enough to be regularly included in contemporary art sales.
There has also been talk that the material in the Greenberg auction is uneven in quality -- a reflection of outsider art generally -- and that the maturing field is undergoing a critical shakeout that will pull sterling like Traylor, Edmondson, Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez into the vault of collectible contemporary art and leave others at the door, as devalued as slag by the publicity of an auction.
"It's the next major issue of the field -- quality," said Randall Morris of the Cavin-Morris gallery in New York. "Just a piece of wood with eyes on it isn't any good anymore."
Of equal concern is speculation that the Greenberg auction might not do well because works in the group were already on the market, available through various dealers and only too familiar to key collectors, who have either purchased from it or passed on it. 
Mr. Greenberg has been actively selling during the last four years, in addition to collecting. He took a booth with Robert Berman, a fine art dealer in Santa Monica, Calif., at last year's Outsider Art Fair in New York, and the year before. Mr. Berman said that he had also sold pieces with Mr. Greenberg from the collection this year and that Mr. Greenberg was "de-accessing" through Frank Maresca of the Ricco/Maresca gallery in New York, a statement confirmed by Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Ollman said he understood, from clients of his who had bought or been offered pieces, that substitutions had been made in the Christie's sale, as pieces sold privately.
Mr. Maresca denied on Monday that he had offered or sold items from Mr. Greenberg's collection in the last year. 
"He's not a dealer in disguise, as many collectors are," Mr. Maresca said, characterizing Mr. Greenberg as a friend as well as a longstanding client. The Greenberg Center at the Ricco/Maresca gallery, intended as a "study center" when it was announced in 1996, is now largely storage that the gallery was providing Mr. Greenberg, not a sales salon, Mr. Maresca added.
At Christie's, Mr. Manley said he was unaware that pieces taken from the sale were removed because they had been sold.
"There were two or three things that we initially had planned on, which we're no longer selling," he said. "Bob changed his mind."
Mr. Berman said he thought that the obvious reason for the sale on Monday was the once unobtainable cachet of an auction at Christie's for outsider art.
"It's a way to stimulate the market," he said, adding, "It could be the start of a collecting frenzy, or an interesting lesson in what kind of auctions not to do."
Lyle Rexer, author of "Jonathan Lerman: Drawings by an Artist With Autism" (Braziller, 2002), called the exclusion of outsider art from mainstream art appreciation and pricing, a "grass ceiling" that the field itself was in part responsible for.
"Except for blue-chip artists like Traylor and Ramirez and Edmondson, and a few others," he said, "the prices are really iffy -- every single piece, every artist. It's never been tested with the big boys. Outsider art people can profess to want to exist in the nexis of contemporary art, but the value wouldn't hold up. Lots of dealers are happy to make money at a lower level. Making outsider art visible and making it meaningful may not be the same thing."
Though the sale has unquestioned rarities, like the Edmondson ark, other material is available through dealers. "We have comparable material," Mr. Maresca said, adding that he thought the estimates were realistic.
"An isolated auction means very little to me," he said. "I think Christie's views it as an experiment, but the field has been established since the 1940's."
Though it accepted the Greenberg pieces as the focus of an auction, Christie's declined to exercise its clout to dismiss the specialist labels "outsider art" and "self-taught art" and introduce the pieces at its important contemporary art sales in May.
"They don't believe in the material," Mr. Ollman said in Philadelphia. "Sotheby's throws it in with Americana."
In his loft, settled into a leather chair, Mr. Greenberg talked of the future. He said he wants to collect six artists in depth, including George Orr, the "Mad Potter of Biloxi." He wants to build a house, much like the minimal Mies van der Rohe country retreat designed for Dr. Edith Farnsworth, outside New York. He thinks of Tadao Ando, the Japanese architect, as someone who could realize it. 
"Tadao fits the bill," Mr. Greenberg said. "He's totally self-taught. He was a prizefighter originally."
Asked about why he collected outsider art and what he had learned from living with it, Mr. Greenberg referred unexpectedly to his expertise with digital imagery.
"Let's say I want to generate this right here," he said, pointing to a glass vase designed by Tapio Wirkkala on a glass coffee table. "I could tell you every algorithm that you'll need to use to do this, and there's probably 20. But the main ones are the imperfections. To generate the imperfections is really what makes this real -- the smudges, the dust, the imperfections in the glass." Mr. Greenberg recalled: "When we made 'Zelig,' we had every different type of imperfection that we put back into the film -- the weave and shake and streaks. That's what makes it look archival and true."
Mr. Greenberg looked out at his collection of beautifully stubborn art, as though in the light of Christie's sale he might have to ask its forgiveness.
"It's changed my way of seeing," he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KOREAN PENINSULA; 
North Korea Informs South Korea That It Doesn't Plan to Produce Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
North Korea said today that it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons, making the pledge to South Korea in high-level talks here in which both sides appeared to be playing to different audiences.
 The North Korean statement, which was heavily qualified, seemed intended to make the country's position sound more reasonable amid a festering nuclear proliferation crisis, and to appeal to an increasingly sympathetic South Korean audience. 
 "Although we have withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have no intention of producing nuclear weapons at this stage," North Korea's chief delegate, Kim Ryong Song, said in a keynote speech at the first session of the cabinet-level talks in Seoul. "The danger of a war that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula is coming from the outside not from within." 
South Korea officials, meanwhile, pressed North Korea to return to the status quo of a month ago, before it heightened the crisis by expelling international monitors and removing the seals on containers that had housed nuclear fuel, which could be readily used in weapons production. "We demanded that North Korea replace the seals at its nuclear reactor and reverse its withdrawal from the N.P.T. to regain the confidence of the international community," said Rhee Bong Jo, a spokesman for the South Korean delegation.
South Korea, whose incumbent president and president-elect are both ardent advocates of economic support and engagement with North Korea, is being watched closely by Washington, which seeks assurances that South Korea will work with the United States to develop a common strategy on the issue of nuclear proliferation by North Korea.
John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, met with South Korean officials today and reaffirmed Washington's intention to take the matter of North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities before the United Nations Security Council as soon as possible. Mr. Bolton said a consensus had emerged in the region for that approach..
"We're prepared to talk directly with North Korea, but we'll not negotiate," Mr. Bolton said at a news conference in Seoul, after meeting South Korean officials with the Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry.
"We will not talk to them in a way that rewards them for their behavior, and amounts to a submission to blackmail," he added.
In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in an interview released today that the United States was studying proposals for renewing talks with North Korea, either bilaterally or in conjunction with other countries.
"It's a very delicate time now and a lot of what we're doing, we're doing it quietly and with some discretion," Mr. Powell said. "But I think we made some progress."
His cautious optimism was echoed by a senior Australian diplomat who visited North Korea last week. Australia is one of the few Western nations that has diplomatic relations with North Korea. 
"Having been through the three days over there with them, we're mildly encouraged that there might be some prospect of dialogue," said the diplomat, Murray MacLean, the first assistant secretary for North Asian Affairs in Australia's Foreign Ministry, in an interview. "But I would emphasize that achieving dialogue is going to be, in itself, quite a long, slow process, and the dialogue, when it gets going, will be as well."
For weeks, North Korea has been signaling that it is unwilling to discuss the nuclear issue with anyone but the United States. Washington has insisted just as firmly that the problem is a matter for the international community, and not one that the Bush administration is willing to negotiate bilaterally.
The North Korean pledge here today to forgo nuclear weapons development for now appeared to be a reward to South Korea's leaders for their recent insistence in conversations with Washington on what they called the need for a peaceful, negotiated solution to the crisis. Substantively, North Korea conceded little today, but it might have improved its image with the South Korean public.
Relations between the United States and South Korea have grown increasingly strained in recent months, over political differences about how to deal with North Korea, and because of weeks of anti-American protests here, which coincided with a presidential campaign and the election in December of the liberal candidate, Roh Moo Hyun. Mr. Roh has demanded a leading role for South Korea in resolving the North Korean crisis.
North Korea would like to encourage as much distance as possible between Washington and Seoul, and it has lately stepped up its contacts with South Korea, after months of very little contact. The two Koreas are engaged in three separate rounds of talks this week. Red Cross talks at the Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea ended today with an agreement on a new round of family reunions. Negotiations on a stalled project to open cross-border railway and road links were scheduled to begin in North Korea later.
Throughout the crisis, North Korea has been playing on themes -- sometimes ham-handedly, sometimes more subtly -- that are meant to woo a South Korean public that seems increasingly nationalistic, and yearns for reunification and an end to the cold war in Korea.
"At this moment, all inter-Korean projects face grave obstacles posed by outside forces which do not like us to join our hands," Mr. Kim, North Korea's chief delegate, said today. "The North and South should uphold the great cause of national independence and crush attempts by outside forces seeking to meddle in intranational affairs and forge ahead, without interruption, with all issues including economic projects which have been agreed upon by the two sides."
Almost in direct reply, however, Mr. Rhee, the South Korean spokesman, told reporters, "The South emphasized that overall inter-Korean relations would be unable to move ahead without the nuclear issue being resolved."
North Korea can only have been encouraged by recent developments in South Korea, where Mr. Roh, the president-elect, has rejected the use of force in any dispute involving nuclear weapons in North Korea and of revising the five-decade-old alliance with the United States.
Mr. Roh's advisers have spoken in recent days about greatly increasing economic cooperation with North Korea, where the economy has nearly collapsed, and they have even hinted at seeking a reduction in the 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea. Today, the newspaper Hankook Ilbo, citing documents it said it received from Mr. Roh's transition team, said Mr. Roh would "invite North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for a second North-South summit meeting and seek ways to establish military confidence-building by scaling back military forces and examining each other's drills."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Dividend Plan Is of Little Use To Margin Buyers

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Investors who buy stock with borrowed money will find that the dividends they get will be taxable even after other dividends are no longer taxed, according to the Bush administration.
 "This could have a big impact on people who buy stock on margin," David Hariton, a tax partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, said yesterday, a day after the Treasury disclosed its plan to make dividends taxable if they came from "debt-financed stock." 
 The Treasury said it would extend an existing provision, known as Section 246A, that applies to corporations that buy stock with borrowed money. Under that law, dividends from such shares do not qualify for the existing tax break on dividends paid by one corporation to another.
Robert Gordon, the president of 21st Securities, said that under such a provision, "a margin investor will see his dividend become not tax-free, but proportionate; if you bought a stock on 50 percent margin, 50 percent of the dividend will be taxable." That would mean investors would be better off if dividend-paying stocks were bought with cash not borrowed for the purchase. 
Keeping such stocks out of margin accounts, which enable investors to borrow up to half the value of the stocks they purchase, would be one way to do that.
Not only margin debt could be affected. Mark Fichtenbaum, the tax director of 21st Securities, said that an investor who used a home-equity loan to buy stock could find that the dividends are taxable.
Greg Jenner, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said in an interview that he expected that investors would alter their behavior as a result of the rule, perhaps by keeping dividend-paying shares out of margin accounts.
Advocates of ending what they call the double taxation of dividends have predicted that the change would lead to a rise in stock prices, by making stock investments more attractive. But if investors were to sell stock to pay off margin loans, that could cause share prices to fall.
The use of margin loans has declined sharply since hitting a record in March 2000, at the peak of the stock market bubble, when margin borrowers owed $278.5 billion. But they still owed $133.1 billion at the end of November, the latest figure available. 
The context of the existing Section 246A is a conclusion by Congress that companies, which can deduct all interest payments from taxable income, should not be able to generate tax-preferenced income with tax-deductible interest.
The rule was written somewhat narrowly because virtually all companies borrow money for one purpose or another and there was no intent to keep all companies from buying dividend-paying stock. Thus the law provided that the dividend would be fully taxable only if the money used to buy the stock came from debt that was "clearly incurred for the purpose of acquiring dividend-paying stock or otherwise is directly traceable to such an acquisition," in the words of a House committee report when the provision was adopted in 1984.
But the government has sometimes taken an expansive view of just what amounted to debt incurred for the purpose of buying stock. Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett, has sued the government in federal court in Nebraska, seeking refunds of $16.3 million in taxes and interest that the Internal Revenue Service forced Berkshire to pay after auditing its returns for 1989 and 1990.
In that suit, filed last August, Berkshire said it borrowed money in four transactions in 1988 and 1989 for the purposes of maintaining its financial strength and liquidity, and to have money available if attractive acquisitions became available. The I.R.S. concluded that some of the money was used months later when Berkshire purchased shares of Coca-Cola and other companies. In some cases, Berkshire said, the I.R.S. traced money "through literally hundreds of short-term investments" to what it concluded was the ultimate purchase of the Coke stock. Berkshire argued that the tracing was arbitrary, and that the purchase could as easily have been traced to other sources of funds.
Investors who borrow money to make investments would face another negative tax consequence under the Bush proposal. Currently, investors can deduct interest on loans to make investments, but only to the extent that they have investment income, a category that includes capital gains and interest income from bonds, as well as dividends. Nontaxable dividends will not qualify as investment income, and that by itself could mean that some investors will no longer have enough investment income to fully deduct their investment interest.
An investor who finds that part of his dividend income is taxable, as a result of applying Section 246A, would have the advantage of having that taxable dividend count as investment income, increasing the investment interest that could be deducted.
The Bush proposal would make dividends generally tax-exempt, if they were paid by companies that had paid sufficient federal income taxes to justify the dividends. Other dividends would be taxable to individual investors, as all dividends are under the current law.
Some investors who kept margin accounts might choose to have those accounts contain corporate bonds and stocks that do not pay dividends, for which there would be no tax disadvantage. Dividend-paying stocks could be shifted into cash accounts. Still, if the dividend-paying stocks had originally been bought with loans in the margin account, and those loans were still outstanding, the government might take the position in an audit that the dividends were taxable even though the shares had been moved out of the margin account.
To the extent that margin accounts hold fewer dividend-paying shares, that could make it harder to sell shares short. Short selling is done by investors betting a stock will decline, as well as by investors seeking to hedge a position in a related security, like a convertible bond from the same company.
To sell stock short, an investor must borrow shares from another investor and then sell them. A primary source of borrowed shares is margin accounts, and taking such shares out of margin accounts would deplenish that supply.
The dividend-exclusion proposal already threatened to make it harder to borrow stocks around the time dividends are paid. That is because an investor, to get the tax-free dividend, would have to own the shares at the time of the payment. (An investor who lent such shares would normally receive a payment in lieu of the dividend from the borrower, but that income would be taxable.)
Some investors, like pension funds and charitable foundations that do not care about the tax status of dividends they receive, would still be willing to lend shares for shorting. They might be in a position to charge higher fees for making the loans.
Increased difficulty in borrowing shares could also lead to new interest in single-stock futures, which economically provide the same investment as buying or shorting a stock, depending on whether an investor buys or sells a futures contract. Such futures now trade on two American exchanges, but have not yet taken off. The single-stock future with the greatest open interest on both exchanges is Microsoft, but the open contracts on the two exchanges together cover only 823,000 shares, a fraction of daily trading volume in the stock.
On another issue related to the Bush proposal, Mr. Jenner, the Treasury official, said the intent of changes announced Tuesday was to assure that companies that now get a tax break through the dividends-received deduction would not lose that break until 2006, even if the companies paying the dividends turn out not to be able to pay tax-exempt dividends.
Some tax lawyers had said that the change announced by the Treasury on Tuesday would leave open the possibility that some such dividends would not be covered. "They are probably reading too much into the words," Mr. Jenner said, adding that if the proposal did not accomplish what the Treasury intended, it could be changed. 
"The statutory language is not written," he said. "We are learning a lot from people. The notion that this is fixed in stone is just not true. To the extent we find things we need to adjust, we will do it."

Envisioning a Bridge as a Penn Station Foothold

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
A SHORT-LIVED bridge may unlock one of New York City's longest-gestating projects: the transformation of the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue into a new Pennsylvania Station.
 The temporary bridge is to be erected next year for the Republican National Convention, creating a seamless walkway between Madison Square Garden and the post office, formally the James A. Farley Building, where 250,000 square feet will be set aside for the news media. 
 The walkway will cross the avenue on a modular, prefabricated structure known as a Bailey bridge, based on a design by Sir Donald Coleman Bailey that Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery credited with having helped the Allies win World War II.
Advocates of a new Penn Station envision the Bailey bridge over Eighth Avenue as an architectural beachhead. 
"When the public sees this type of structure being built and something under construction, it will be a symbol of the beginning of the new Penn Station at Farley," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and its subsidiary, the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, which is in charge of the transformation.
This is a case of an essentially anticosmopolitan gesture -- the imposition of a private pathway that interrupts the public's view -- in the service of a quintessentially urban project: a railroad station in the heart of town.
The linking of buildings actually has a certain urbanity as a three-dimensional expression of the city's multilayered transportation network.
And there is a long pedigree. In 1527, for example, Pope Clement VII used a passageway over the streets of Rome, between the Vatican and the Castel Sant'Angelo, to escape the troops of Emperor Charles V.
In the early 20th century, New York's Bridge of Sighs over Franklin Street carried convicted prisoners between jail and the courts, while the Bridge of Progress transported shoppers over Ninth Street from the old wing to the new wing of the Wanamaker department store on Broadway.
Industrial buildings along the far West Side were linked in 1933 by the New York Central's elevated freight railroad viaduct, now called the High Line, which threaded its way into and through the structures.
Perhaps the apotheosis of over-the-street bridges was the copper-clad triple-decker constructed in 1925 to join the Gimbel Brothers department store on Greeley Square with its annex at 116 West 32nd Street.
But given their effect on the streetscape, such conduits have largely been discredited by city planners since the construction 20 years ago of a mini-skyway system at Hunter College, with two bridges over Lexington Avenue and another over 68th Street.
That is why David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, architects of the new Penn Station, has faced skeptical questions about his firm's role in designing the bridge, too. His answer: "It's temporary. It has not only a useful purpose but a spirit and liveliness that could be quite interesting."
In the longer run, Mr. Childs said, "anything like this that pushes the project ahead and makes the Farley Building more available for the eventual use of the train station is highest on my list."
It has been 11 years since the idea was first advanced to create a soaring new Amtrak gateway within the shell of the Farley Building, which was designed by McKim, Mead & White as a companion piece to the original Pennsylvania Station, arguably New York's greatest lost landmark. The Farley Building happens to sit directly over the west end of the passenger platforms.
"You don't get a second chance like this often," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said in 1993. Even in his retirement from the Senate, he has remained one of the most ardent advocates of the new Penn Station. Farley watchers looking for his hand in the latest development will note with interest the central role played by Kevin Sheekey, now a special adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and formerly Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff.
IT was his task to find space for a press center that would make New York's convention bid competitive. Farley offered a solution, pending the relocation of some postal operations. (The Postal Service is confident that will happen, though the restoration of 90 Church Street in Lower Manhattan is critical to the plan, said Diane Todd, a spokeswoman.)
To link Farley with the Garden, a Bailey bridge will be rented and stand for five to six weeks. It is expected to cost several hundred thousand dollars -- in any case less than $1 million -- a tab that will be picked up privately by the New York City Host Committee.
Fifteen feet above the avenue, wrapped in printed translucent vinyl and glowing from within at night, the bridge will stretch 180 feet from the Garden to the top of the steps at the north end of Farley. "Without it," Mr. Sheekey said, "there is no doubt in my mind that the Republicans would not have come to New York City."
Asked whether the bridge also served a longer-term strategic purpose, Mr. Sheekey demurred. "Let's just say the senator doesn't disapprove," he said.

HEADLINE: World Forum, Back at Davos, Faces Tough Economic Skiing 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The black-tie gala with the poolside bar and the big-band cabaret has been canceled for fear that it would coincide with war in Iraq. Ski time has been curtailed to just a brief morning on the pistes above this Alpine village. The trail to a buffet reception in a five-star hotel tonight began with airport-level security blocking the route to the champagne and canapes.
 This year, as the World Economic Forum returns to its home of 33 years in Switzerland from a brief foray last year to New York, the mood has darkened. Corporate stars have fallen in disgrace. Economies have slowed, stripping businesses of the self-confidence and supremacy they once drew as champions of globalization. The drum beat of possible war echoes from Iraq. And the twin challenges of protesters and terrorism after Sept. 11 have persuaded the Swiss authorities to mount their biggest security operation with police officers and troops on the ground and warplanes in the skies. 
 "There's a sense of seriousness that is far greater than we have seen in many years," said Robert D. Hormats, an investment banker from Goldman Sachs in New York. "And there's a sense that the business community has far less influence, a view that events are pulling us along. There's a sense of humility."
Last year, moreover, when the forum held its first ever session outside Davos, the movers and shakers who attended the gathering turned the meeting into global party time.
But, with many of the forum's onetime glitterati humbled by accounting scandals, mismanaged mergers, personal greed or economic downturn, the party this year was already over for some. Onetime stars like Stephen M. Case of AOL Time Warner, Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi or Percy Barnevik, the erstwhile Swedish guru of boardroom behavior, have been toppled from the pinnacles of corporate power since the forum was last held in Davos.
"We have noticed," said Klaus Schwab, the forum's 64-year-old German-born founder, "that the life of a chief executive officer has become relatively short."
"We are living in a new age of modesty," Mr. Schwab said in an interview. Or, as Mr. Hormats put it: "Two or three years ago there was a premium on celebrity. Now there's a premium on judgment."
That's not to say anyone is really slumming it or that this gathering has become a place for the poor and the meek. Among the participants, around 1,000 corporate figures have paid up to $30,000 to attend along with 1,000 other representatives of the media, religion, advocacy groups and governments, including Colin L. Powell, the American secretary of state, and King Abdullah of Jordan.
To protect such luminaries against possible terror attacks and a planned demonstration by anti-globalization protesters on Saturday, Switzerland has mounted a $10 million security operation, closing the airspace over Davos, deploying hundreds of police officers and 2,000 troops to guard a ski resort whose residents sometimes find it all a little too much.
The theme this year is "Building Trust," but that may well be overshadowed by the threat of war with Iraq. Mr. Schwab said today that, in a last-minute addition to the program running from Thursday through next Tuesday, the opposition leaders exiled by President Saddam Hussein would arrive here to talk about the chances of ever creating a democracy in their land.
Not only that, Mr. Powell and King Abdullah are key players in the Iraq crisis. "Iraq will be the overwhelming theme of all the discussions in Davos," Mr. Schwab said.
But others have different agendas.
Anti-globalization protesters, for instance, announced on Tuesday that they would not submit to police scrutiny of their personal effects on the way to Davos on Saturday, threatening a standoff at the barriers erected at a small railroad station on the climb up to this village 5,500 feet above sea level.
Comparing the barriers to cattle-pens, protesters said that if they could not reach Davos unhindered, they would demonstrate elsewhere as they did two years ago in riots that spread to Zurich, Switzerland's financial capital.
Apart from the McDonald's outlet here, targets of their wrath will include survivors of the corporate turndown, like Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder; Michael S. Dell of Dell Computer; Sir Howard Stringer of Sony; and John T. Chambers of Cisco Systems, rubbing shoulders with political players including former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General John Ashcroft.
But corporate globalization no longer seems to be the force the demonstrators depict it to be. "I would argue that the power of corporations has completely disappeared," Mr. Schwab said.
Whether or not the corporate world will disappear from Davos is unclear. In 2005, Mr. Schwab said, "I could well imagine myself to be somewhere else, possibly in New York."
Some people here would not object, even though Davos earns an estimated $18 million from the invasion of business types paying a bloated $250 a night for three-star hotel rooms.
Thomas Saggaras, a ski instructor working part time as a bus-driver in the absence of pupils during the forum, said people had become tired of the security checks and restrictions and would vote soon on whether to host the gathering in future.
"The town is blocked off," he said. "You can't move around. People don't like that."

HEADLINE: Turkish Court Casts Shadow On Would-Be Premier's Role 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Turkey's highest court today rejected the claim by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the victor in elections last fall, that he was the head of the nation's governing political party. The ruling raised the specter of a political crisis in a nation already struggling with recession and the backwash of a potential war in neighboring Iraq. 
 But the governing Justice and Development Party quickly said it would move within days to re-elect Mr. Erdogan, laying to rest any question about whether he was in charge of the country's most popular political faction. 
 Mr. Erdogan, once a fiery Islamic leader, has embraced secular politics and led the party to a dominant position in Turkish elections last November by campaigning on social issues. Although many secular politicians question his renunciation of religious politics, he is widely expected to be appointed prime minister after elections in March in which he plans to seek a seat in Parliament. Many Western leaders already regard him as Turkey's head of government in all but title. 
But a series of daunting legal problems rooted in his Islamic past and his years as mayor of Istanbul have kept him from occupying any official position of authority in the Turkish government, much less the key post of prime minister. Today's ruling appeared to raise another hurdle to that goal. 
In the ruling, the Turkish Constitutional Court nullified Mr. Erdogan's status as head of the ruling party on technical grounds, saying that he had surrendered the post months ago when he gave up the title of "founding member" of the Justice and Development Party. 
Mr. Erdogan had shed that title under pressure after government prosecutors sought to ban the party outright, saying it was a reincarnation of the banned Islamic Virtue Party. "He should have resigned the chairmanship along with the founder membership," Judge Hasim Kilic of the Constitutional Court said today. "The fact that he has not resigned does not mean that he is chairman."
Party leaders countered that Mr. Erdogan could be elected as chairman within days, eliminating any question over whether he had given up the job earlier. 
The larger question is how long secular critics of Mr. Erdogan can sustain efforts to keep him from power. Mr. Erdogan, 48, a populist with a broad following, has been formally banned from holding political office since 1998, when he was convicted of inciting racial hatred after reading an Islamic poem at a rally.
After his Virtue Party was banned, Mr. Erdogan and other moderates formed the Justice and Development Party, which won a decisive majority in November's parliamentary elections. Mr. Erdogan says the faction represents the political mainstream, and has courted Western support by declaring Turkish membership in the European Union to be a party priority and by openly supporting Turkey's diplomatic and military alliance with the United States. 
Although he holds no political office, he is widely considered to be a shadow ruler behind his close ally, Abdullah Gul, who currently holds the prime minister's post. In December, the new Parliament sought to make the arrangement a formal one, amending Turkey's Constitution to lift the prohibition against Mr. Erdogan's seeking political office and being elected prime minister. 
But Mr. Erdogan has remained dogged by political and legal obstacles to a political career, not limited to the court ruling today. 
In a separate action today, a local court in Istanbul acquitted Mr. Erdogan on corruption charges stemming from his years as Istanbul's mayor in the mid-1990's, stating that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of favoritism in awarding contracts. Eleven businessmen and city officials were found guilty and fined in the case.

HEADLINE: Kodak Trails Wall St. Forecasts; It Announces More Job Cutbacks 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Eastman Kodak said today that it would cut 1,800 to 2,200 more jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force. 
 The cuts were announced as Kodak reported a fourth-quarter profit that fell short of expectations and its chief executive cautioned that 2003 would be a difficult year. 
 Kodak earned $113 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter in contrast to a loss of $206 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales edged up 2 percent, to $3.44 billion, from $3.36 billion in the 2001 period. 
Excluding one-time items, earnings were $191 million, or 65 cents a share. That fell short of the consensus forecast of 68 cents a share by Thomson First Call. 
In trading today, Kodak stock fell $4.41, or 11.7 percent, to $33.18. 
For all of 2002, the company earned $770 million, or $2.64 a share, up from $76 million, or 26 cents a share, in 2001. Revenue fell to $12.8 billion from $13.2 billion. 
Kodak estimated 2003 earnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.95 a share. Thomson First Call analysts forecast $2.71 a share. 
The chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, pointed to continued softness in film sales, partly from the growing popularity of digital cameras, and to continued economic weakness. "The only bright spot on the world economy I can see is Asia," Mr. Carp said, adding that "China continues to be a great opportunity for Kodak."
The company eliminated 7,000 jobs last year, reducing its work force to 70,000. The latest job cuts, many from photofinishing operations in the United States and Western Europe, are expected to save $35 million to $50 million this year and eventually $65 million to $85 million. 
Kodak controls about two-thirds of the United States film market, but profits have been hurt by falling prices as well as the drop in film sales. Company executives predict a decline of 4 percent to 6 percent in the industry this year. 
Kodak also announced today that more than 28,000 employees would receive bonuses of 7.15 percent of their pay, an increase from 2 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Rowland Says 1,000 More Must Be Laid Off 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
With Connecticut's budget gap now estimated at $650 million and growing, Gov. John G. Rowland said yesterday that 1,000 state employees would soon receive layoff notices, in addition to the more than 2,800 who have already gotten pink slips in the last two months. 
 The governor's office, government employee unions and state legislators have been unable to reach any agreement on balancing Connecticut's $13.4 billion budget. Mr. Rowland has said that leaves him little choice but to continue to cut jobs. 
 "Unfortunately in this budget situation, the governor's options to reduce costs are very limited," said Mr. Rowland's spokesman, Chris Cooper. "About the only place where he can get cost savings on the personnel side is through concessions or layoffs." 
Since November, Mr. Rowland and his budget director, Marc S. Ryan, have been calling on union leaders for concessions of at least $450 million, which they say could help close the deficit and perhaps restore some jobs. 
Union leaders have accused the governor's office of making unreasonable demands and say they have already offered concessions totaling $1 billion that the governor rejected. "There is not going to be a budget solution unless every laid-off worker is put back into public service," said Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the unions. 
Ms. Smith said the additional layoffs would only hurt state residents. "Threatening more service cuts, threatening more layoffs is only going to put people in the state through more turmoil and chaos unnecessarily," she said.
The two sides have been stalemated for more than two months. There have been no formal negotiations since shortly after Mr. Rowland announced the first round of layoffs in December, and they have done little more than trade recriminations. 
Mr. Cooper said the new layoff notices would begin going out by early next week. He said that officials were not identifying the specific areas where jobs were being eliminated but that they would be "across the board."
At the Statehouse in Hartford yesterday, Mr. Rowland said he had directed Mr. Ryan to try again to resume negotiations with the unions. Mr. Cooper said the governor still believed that some layoffs could be avoided and others reversed.
"There is not a firm timetable," he said of the new round of pink slips. "The governor is still hopeful that concessions could call these layoffs back, and he is willing to rescind as many as possible of the original 2,800 and as many as possible of these next 1,000." 
In December, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, called the Democratic-controlled General Assembly into a special session to consider his latest budget package. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the measure next week, and Democratic leaders said it would be rejected. 
"I think it's no secret that it won't pass, so I guess that plan doesn't work," said the House speaker, Moira K. Lyons. "We have been working hard to come up with a plan that, while clearly imperfect from anybody's point of view, would be able to get the votes to pass and become law."
Legislators are expected to caucus today on the budget issue. Ms. Lyons said she believed that the governor's office had not identified specific cuts in the latest round of layoffs because it was becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate jobs without hurting constituents.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Airport Rent Deal May Help City Temporarily 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's announcement yesterday that he would help get the city an extra $500 million in rent for its two airports was his opening move in what promises to be a tense game of budgetary chess between the city and the state.
 The city has long sought back rent payments for La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, which it owns but leases to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. And the city has recently been negotiating a proposal to trade the land beneath the airports to the Port Authority in exchange for the land where the World Trade Center stood, land the authority owns. That trade could still go forward, officials said. 
 But if the governor's announcement marked the resolution of a nearly decade-long dispute over airport rents, it left much unresolved about its effect on the city budget.
The good news for the city is that the governor's proposal would give the city a shot of much-needed money. The bad news is that it would be mostly a one-time infusion, which would do little to alleviate the city's long-term budget problems. And it was far from clear whether the $500 million the city would get from the deal would be in addition to the many other state actions that the city is seeking, or instead of them.
The city, which is facing a $3 billion deficit next fiscal year, is seeking roughly $1.7 billion in help from the state, which is facing its own $12 billion gap next year. But Governor Pataki has not exactly been on the same page as his fellow Republican, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, when it comes to what form that help might take. 
The governor has spoken out against a $1 billion commuter tax and new tolls on the East River bridges that the mayor has proposed. And Mr. Bloomberg is counting on the state to give the city an additional $275 million to help pay for the new teachers' contract, and another $200 million that would result from other state actions.
But with the state reeling from its worst financial crisis in decades, some fiscal experts say that the state, far from offering the city additional help, may actually end up cutting aid. 
Indeed, city officials have been scrambling to present their budget plan early next week, earlier than they had planned and before Mr. Pataki releases his state budget plan on Wednesday. The idea, city officials said, is to make sure their requests are heard before the governor is on record as denying them.
Still, although the city has put the value of the airport leases as high as $860 million when spread over several years, officials said it would be helpful to finally get the money.
"To get half a billion now is certainly a plus," said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency. "The question is, does this check the state contribution box completely for helping the city out of its budget problems, or is this essentially a down payment on other assistance?"
The Port Authority confirmed yesterday that it would be willing to provide more than $500 million in additional lease payments in exchange for a long-term extension of its lease to operate the airports.
Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, said, "The city has been pursuing these back payments for several years and is looking forward to resolving the issue."
Just hours before Mr. Pataki announced the airport deal, which would be mostly a one-time, nonrecurring source of revenue, the city's budget director, Mark Page, told a budget conference at Baruch College that he hoped that the state would approve recurring sources of revenue, such as a new commuter tax. "We're looking to have sustained spending and sustained revenues basically, more or less, together," Mr. Page said. 
Several officials said that the Port Authority rent payments would not preclude a future swap of the airports for the World Trade site, and might even be a precursor of it.
The swap would allow the city to integrate the redevelopment of the trade center site with its larger effort to revitalize Lower Manhattan and provide the Port Authority an exit from the real estate development business, a role that has generated extensive criticism for the agency.
The back rent had been a sticking point in the negotiations. After remaining dormant since late summer, the talks about the swap revived this month as both sides showed renewed interest in completing the exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Inequality Grew in 90's Boom, Fed Reports 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Economic inequality increased markedly as the boom of the 1990's fizzled, even as incomes increased at almost every level, according to a detailed new survey by the Federal Reserve released today. 
 Conducted at the end of 2001, when the economy was in a recession, the survey compared wealth and income with levels of 1998. It suggests that the benefits of the economic boom were widespread but extremely uneven. 
 The wealth of those in the top 10 percent of incomes surged much more than the wealth of those in any other group. The net worth of families in the top 10 percent jumped 69 percent, to $833,600, in 2001 from $492,400 in 1998. By contrast, the net worth of families in the lowest fifth of income earners rose 24 percent, to $7,900. 
The median accumulated wealth for families at the top was about 12 times that of lower-middle-income families through much of the 1990's. But in 2001, the median net worth of the top earners was about 22 times as great.
While income in the top 10 percent of households surged 19.3 percent from 1998 to 2001, income for the bottom fifth of households increased 14.4 percent.
The survey is compiled every three years and is based on interviews with more than 4,000 families. Its results come as President Bush proposes a plan to cut taxes $674 billion over 10 years. Opponents of the plan, which has as its centerpiece a proposal to eliminate most taxes on stock dividends, say most of the benefits would be showered on the richest taxpayers.
Administration officials respond that a large percentage of ordinary Americans now own stocks and would benefit from both tax-free dividends and any lift in market prices.
The survey provides some ammunition for both sides. It shows that wealth became more concentrated, but it also confirms that more than half of all families own stocks, either directly or through their mutual funds and pension plans.
A controversial element of the survey may be the part that deals with household debt.
American consumers provided much of the backbone for economic growth, but economists have long been worried that consumers ran up too much debt in the process.
The Fed's report contends that household debt is more benign than it seems. It noted that Americans did in fact borrow more in 2001 than in 1998 but said that their net worth rose even faster. 
As a share of total family income, the Fed said, the aggregate debt burden of families in fact decreased to 12.5 percent in 2001 from 14 percent through most of the 1990's.
Even accounting for stock market declines after the survey was conducted, the Fed said, household wealth was still higher in 2001 than in 1998.
"Rising aggregate debt levels alone do not necessarily imply that conditions deteriorated at the level of individual families," the report said.
But at least some outside economists disputed that conclusion on several grounds. 
They noted that in addition to a further stock market decline, unemployment rose after the survey was finished in December 2001. They also said that the survey understated signs of trouble that were already apparent.
Mark Zandi of Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., noted that the percentage of low-income households more than 60 days past due on a debt increased to 13.4 percent in 2001 from 12.9 percent in 1998. 
Mr. Zandi said an abundance of newer data provided stronger evidence that lower-income households were under much more stress than before: personal bankruptcies, automobile repossessions, mortgage foreclosures and other indicators of bad debt all reached records in 2002.
The Fed calculations "clearly misrepresent the debt load as it existed in 2001 and even more clearly misrepresent the debt load as it exists now," Mr. Zandi said. "This is a problem that is going to get worse."
To be sure, the Fed survey also shows that even middle- and lower-income families benefited from the economic boom. Home ownership increased, even though housing prices climbed 25 percent. Stock ownership reached 51 percent of all households. 
The average income of African-American families surged 20 percent from 1998 to 2000. But for reasons that Fed officials had difficulty explaining today, the average income for all nonwhite and Hispanic families barely increased.
"I am alarmed and disheartened by the growth in inequality in this report," said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group based in Washington. "I am especially mindful of this problem, given the administration's tax proposals. I hope policy makers take this data into consideration."

HEADLINE: Among 4 States, a Great Divide in Fortunes 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Every Wednesday morning in Colorado Springs, dozens of recently laid-off executives gather to share job tips and emotional sustenance.
 The support group at the Pikes Peak Workforce Center attracts people like Sally Schelter, 51, a software programmer from Columbia, S.C., once so certain about a secure future here that she paid her own moving expenses in October 2000 to take a $78,000-a-year job with MCI. Nine months later she was let go. 
 "I was told this was a great opportunity with a company that doesn't lay off people," Ms. Schelter said. And now? "I'm looking everywhere for a job. I've got a zillion resumes out, but I'm getting very few responses." 
In the last two years, thousands of people in Colorado and Utah have been turned out of their jobs, victims of a bursting technology-telecom bubble that had the most profound effects in the high-flying centers of Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs and Salt Lake City.
In Wyoming and Montana, where there was no bubble to burst, such anxieties are unimaginable.
"When I came out of college, I had a choice of the oil fields or the mines, and seeing all the oil field workers with one limb missing, I chose the mines," said Larry Likewise, 62, who has worked the coal fields of northern Wyoming for 41 years and loves the financial and psychological stability it has proved.
When he started, in 1961, he made $1.55 an hour. Today, he earns $24.53 an hour.
"I've raised three children and got seven grandchildren," Mr. Likewise said. "I own everything I have. I've got insurance, vacation, just a good life. I like what I do and have no reason to change."
For all their differences, Ms. Schelter and Mr. Likewise capture the latest turn in fortunes in the Mountain West. Two years ago the growing high-technology centers in Colorado and Utah seemed places of boundless potential, while Montana and Wyoming were just tootling slowly along.
By 2000, Colorado, with 4.3 million people, had an all-time low unemployment rate of 2.8 percent. Utah, with 2.2 million people, had a near-record low of 3.3 percent. But as the downturn swept across the country, those states' greatest strengths became their greatest weakness.
Since 2001, Colorado and Utah have lost nearly 60,000 jobs combined, most of them in the region's backbone industries of high-tech, telecommunications and transportation. With far fewer people, Montana and Wyoming struggled without much success to diversify their economies. Now that failure has had its bright side, allowing them to escape severe misfortune.
Buoyed by their natural resources of gas, oil, coal and timber and aided by changes in national policies that favor exploration and development, they have added jobs and kept their economies relatively stable. In Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer, minerals accounted for 50 percent more in tax revenues for the state in 2000 than all other products combined.
And as different as the two pairs of states are -- Colorado and Utah, Montana and Wyoming -- their fates could become "vastly, vastly different," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank, if the United States goes to war with Iraq.
"If you have a strong economy, with the price of gas and oil staying low, that helps Colorado and Utah and hurts Wyoming and Montana," Dr. Sohn said. "If oil and gas prices go up, that hurts the national economy but helps Wyoming and Montana. War is one of those things that could affect everybody. A short, decisive war might keep oil and gas prices down. A long, messy war could drive them up."

Influx of New Residents
While the four states constitute one of the sparsest regions in the country, with only 7.9 million people, they have had some of the fastest population growth rates between 1990 and 2000, led by Colorado and Utah.
It is easy to see why. The four states have glorious national parks, snow-capped peaks for skiing in winter, wild rivers for rafting in summer, spacious forests for hunting, ample open space for development, labor pools that are skilled and educated and the rugged can-do spirit that has always characterized the Mountain West. But for different reasons they now have only modest hopes about their economic futures.
For the executives who flocked to Colorado and Utah when the states were booming, the downturn has been startling.
Just a few years ago economic fortunes throughout the region were robust, with thousands of workers from other states moving in on the promise of high-paying jobs and secure futures. Office complexes were full. Housing costs were climbing. Retail sales were soaring. 
As Americans swelled the population of Western states in recent decades, Colorado and Utah benefited as much as any of them with migrants from both coasts drawn to the area's natural beauty, low costs and high quality of life.
By the 1990's, Denver and Salt Lake City were high-fliers in the style of Silicon Valley, riding a wave of capital investment in the high-tech, biotech and telecommunication industries. Denver's new airport, which opened in 1995, spurred even more growth with flights to Europe and the Far East. Ski resort towns like Aspen in Colorado and Park City in Utah, always a lure for celebrities, became popular as second-home locales for other moneyed classes.
Utah had the additional surge of economic energy fueled by years of preparations for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. That helped the state build more highways, add hotels and develop recreational sites for use long after the Games ended.
Both states enjoyed near full employment -- and that made the recession of 2001 that much more severe.
As market demands began falling, big companies merged or went out of business, job growth receded, housing prices increased at declining rates. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 made things worse, chilling travel and resulting in the layoffs of hundreds of United and Continental employees in Colorado and Delta workers in Utah as flight schedules were cut by a fifth.
Nor did it help that consecutive dry summers and snowless winters were sending vacationers elsewhere: The venerable Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs said summer wildfires last year led to the cancellation of more than 1,000 room reservations.
Economists say the recession was the worst to hit Colorado since the 1930's, sparing almost no sector of the economy and contributing to the current $850 million projected state budge gap, one of the largest in the country.
"We were doing so well through 2000," said Patty Silverstein, president of Development Research Partners, an economic consulting company in Littleton, Colo. "At the end of the first quarter of 2001, things started to fall apart as manufacturing companies, primarily high-tech, saw a falloff of production orders. But every sector has been hit equally hard."
In Colorado the unemployment rate last year rose to 5.3 percent, Utah's to 5.2 percent. And both are expected to rise again this year before receding in 2004. A recent one-day job fair in Denver attracted 8,200 unemployed workers, the most ever for an event held six times a year since 1997.
Dr. Sohn, the Wells Fargo economist, said, "Colorado currently has one of the weakest economies in the country after having one of the best only two years ago." Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah described 2002 as "the toughest year for Utah's economy since 1954."
Most of the losses have come at companies like Qwest, Lockheed Martin, AT&T, WorldCom, United Airlines and Continental Airlines. And feeling the pinch are the once high-paid managers who show up at the Pikes Peak Workforce Center. Joseph W. Mason, 53 and a father of nine, lost his job three months ago after 17 years with Ford Microelectronics, a company bought by Intel. He was a finance manager, earning $125,000 a year.
"The group has been helpful," Mr. Mason said of the support network. "I get an understanding of what other people are doing and I find job leads. I'm averaging about two a week and I apply. But so far, I've had no interviews."
Nor has Melissa Hogan, 29, a program analyst who left Sacramento in May 1999 for a $60,000-a-year job with WorldCom. She was let go last month, leaving her with a mortgage and a mother living in a nursing home. She has recently returned to school to study electronic business management, taken in a roommate to help with expenses and sent out hundreds of resumes.
"They were boom times when I came here," Ms. Hogan said. "We were writing our own paychecks at that point. I never imagined the bottom would fall out of the market as it has. A recruiter for Qwest recently told me they get 300 to 400 resumes a week for each job they have."

Sectors Feel the Pinch
Virtually all the economic measures have been discouraging. Last year, the new Denver airport reported its first annual decline in passengers in seven years, a 6.8 percent drop. Investments in the advanced technology industry fell by 70 percent, to $1.5 billion, from the year before, according to a report by US Bank. Hotel operators in Denver said last year was their worst in more than a decade, with an occupancy rate of 60.5 percent, the lowest since a 60 percent rate in 1990.
Despite the lowest mortgage rates in more than 30 years, permits for new houses in Colorado last year fell by 25 percent from 2001. Retail sales deteriorated over the year and the picture "looks much worse than the industry nationally," David Givens, an analyst for Economy.com, said in a report on Colorado for 2002. He also forecast another rise in the unemployment rate, to 5.6 percent, for this year before falling in 2004 as new investment resumes.
In Utah, the overall effect of the recession has been much the same but on a smaller scale, said David Harmer, executive director of the Utah Department of Community and Economic Development. The state got lucky, he said, in that many new capital projects, like highways and hotels, were completed before the downturn hit hardest. Still, even the smallest of businesses have suffered.
"Last year was a bad year for everyone in our type of business," said Don Norberg, general manager of Sheri Griffith Expeditions in Moab, Utah, which arranges river rafting trips in Utah and Colorado. "We were down 30 percent, with a peak of 28 boats and 130 guests. In 2001, we had 170 guests. This year, we didn't go way out of our way to purchase any additional boats."
Declining tax revenues have contributed to a state budget deficit of $117 million, a gap large enough that few programs are being spared. Mark Shurtleff, the Utah attorney general, eliminated the nation's only "porno czar," an assistant responsible for helping enforce Utah's strict pornography and obscenity laws. The job was created just two years ago to great fanfare in a state known for its conservatism.
"We have to make cuts somewhere," Mr. Shurtleff said.

Birth-Rate Plus and Minus
Future growth in Utah is assured in one respect. It has the highest birth rate of any state in the country. That would seem a plus. But economists say it puts an added burden on state officials to find some way to restart the rapid job creation that came during the 1990's.
"How well we do depends upon our ability to generate new jobs," Mr. Harmer said. "We have a lot of young people coming into the work force. The question is, are we increasing the number of jobs to absorb them?"
The picture is not as grim to the north. Montana and Wyoming never had the same kinds of high hopes for growth as Colorado and Utah so they did not experience such a deep fall.
With fewer people than Washington, D.C., Wyoming is the least populous state in the country. Montana is ranked 44th. What both states lack in people, they make up for in natural resources, and for now, the gas, oil, coal and timber industries are keeping them economically buoyant and relatively insulated from troubles affecting other regions.
How long that continues is a function of efforts in Montana and Wyoming to diversify their economies. Growth may hinge on whether state leaders can attract a wider array of companies offering higher paying jobs to keep more high school and college graduates in state jobs and wean the states off a dependency on revenues from oil.

An Industrial Expansion
So far, Montana has done a better job than Wyoming.
Despite low business costs, cheap housing and a high work ethic, the rural nature of both states has remained a disincentive for companies with high-paying jobs to locate there. Neither has a strong revenue base from manufacturing or high technology. In each state, an Air Force base is the biggest employer, Malmstrom in Great Falls, Mont., and F. E. Warren in Cheyenne, Wyo.
But Montana has had more success expanding industries that have proved resilient to economic declines elsewhere, like business services, real estate, housing construction and wood products, ending last year with the nation's second highest rate of growth.
"In almost all industries, Montana had a very broad-based expansion," said Andy Kish, an analyst for Economy.com. "Manufacturing was down, unemployment stayed low, at 4.4 percent, and consumer confidence in Montana was a bit higher."
Paul Polzin, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Development at the University of Montana, said the lack of high-tech industries in Montana would keep the state's long-term growth at a slower pace than the rest of the country. "But through 2001 and 2002," he said, "when everybody else was going through the floor, we were doing better than the national average."
Wyoming's employment rate has remained steady for three years at 3.9 percent, well below the national average. But that is both good and bad news for the state. It reflects Wyoming's continuing role as a major supplier for the nation's natural gas and coal. However, it also indicates that the state is failing to bring in many new jobs in other industries.
For now, the negative effects are overshadowed by good fortune. Wyoming is producing a third of the coal used in the United States and 41 percent of its natural gas. Those levels are expected to increase as exploration expands and new pipelines for natural gas are completed. Together, coal and gas generate about a third of state revenues.
Further, Wyoming is one of the few states with a surplus, about $137 million, and last year spending increased by 17 percent.
But both states have drags on their economies that could harm them in the long run. Montana is currently facing a budge deficit that could reach $240 million within two years, making it the state's deepest gap in nearly two decades. Wyoming is constantly losing its college graduates to other states, where jobs pay more.
Without the kind of high-tech industries that have aided Colorado, Utah and other western states, Montana and Wyoming will remain heavily dependent on the ups and downs of resource markets, leaving them less control over their own economic destinies. Many economists agree that for both states the lack of economic diversity, low wages and slow population increases mean long-term growth is likely to lag behind any national recovery.
"The mountain states are expected to regain economic ground with the 2003 recovery," Dr. Sohn said. "They have beauty, scenery, a good quality of life and their populations are growing. But they all have one factor in common for their economic strength in the future. They need to attract jobs."

Debt-Heavy AOL Considers Sale of Publishing Unit
AOL Time Warner is seeking to sell its book publishing division in an effort to pay down some of the debt taken on with AOL's acquisition of Time Warner, people involved in sale discussions said. But in the current market getting a decent price may be difficult and there is no guarantee a buyer will emerge.
 The move, at a time when many media companies are short on cash, underscores the pressure on AOL Time Warner to pare its $26 billion debt. AOL is also trying to sell its three Atlanta sports teams, its interests in at least two cable channels, and a minority interest in its cable unit. Page A1.

HEADLINE: BUSH PLANS TO LET RELIGIOUS GROUPS GET BUILDING AID 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration plans to allow religious groups for the first time to use federal housing money to help build centers where religious worship is held, as long as part of the building is also used for social services. 
 The policy shift, which was made in a rule that the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed this month, significantly expands the administration's contentious religion-based initiative. 
 The White House says it wants to end discrimination against religious groups. Opponents say the policy breaches the separation of church and state. 
Current regulations generally prohibit religious groups from using federal housing and community development grants, which totaled $7.7 billion last year, to build or rehabilitate structures. The new rules, still subject to final approval by housing officials, allow the use of federal aid to acquire, rehabilitate or build centers used for religious and specifically approved nonreligious activities, so long as no federal money is used for the religious section. 
A church could erect a building using federal money to create a shelter for the homeless in one part and private money to create a sanctuary in another part, officials said. A synagogue could use a grant to rehabilitate part of its building for a counseling center for AIDS patients or the poor. A Muslim group could apply for federal money to upgrade the lighting and equipment in a room in its mosque to allow it to be used as an counseling center for single parents. 
Bush administration officials, who have made religion-based initiatives a cornerstone of their agenda, said that religious organizations had historically been discriminated against in the fierce competition for federal grants and that the change was simply intended to level the field to compete for the pool of money.
"We see no reason to exclude religious organizations from participation in these programs if there can be a reasonable mechanism to ensure that a program has no particular religious connotation one way or another," the general counsel of the housing department, Richard A. Hauser, said in an interview. "There's no reason you can't have a cathedral upstairs and something that would look like any other room in the basement" for counseling.
Civil rights advocates, legal experts and Congressional critics attacked the change. They said it moved the government dangerously close to financing the building of houses of worship in violation of the separation of church and state.
"This is probably the most clearly unconstitutional aspect of the White House's faith-based initiative that we've seen up to this point," said Christopher Anders, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. "What this does is take federal money that is serving the neediest of the needy in our society and diverts it to the bricks-and-mortar construction of churches and sanctuaries and other places of worship." 
Opponents said the change forced the government into the difficult position of having to determine which part of a building is used for worship and which is for social services.
"You run into the nightmarish problem of having the government monitor what goes on inside churches" and sanctuaries, said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who promised to seek hearings on the change. "Are we going to start sending in the inspector general to charge people with committing a bar mitzvah?"
A spokeswoman for the housing department, Diane Tomb, said the proposed change grew out of misinterpretations of past policy that effectively blocked religious groups from access to housing programs. 
In a New York City case, Ms. Tomb said, a religious group was wrongfully blocked from activities in a common area of a publicly financed housing project. "That's discrimination," she said.
President Bush made headlines in a speech on Dec. 12 when he bypassed Congress and issued an executive order to make it easier for religious groups to receive federal money for welfare programs. 
Like most of the debate in the two-year push for initiatives that involve religious groups, the order focuses on the social services that many groups rely on the government to pay for. In the change, released on Jan. 6 without fanfare, officials proposed a potentially far-reaching shift that centers not on services but on how buildings run by religious groups are financed and built. 
The rules have consistently banned grants for buildings with any religious component, officials said. The current regulations for one popular home investment program, for instance, ban grants to "primarily religious organizations" and say housing projects "must be used exclusively" for secular activities.
The new regulations set up a system for programs at mixed-use sites "where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities." The change does not spell out how the proportion would be formulated. Officials said that would have to be determined case by case.
The public has until March 7 to comment before the department is scheduled to issue its final approval. The change would apply to all HUD grants, including programs for economic development in low-income areas, emergency shelters and housing aid for single-parent families, young people and AIDS cases. 
Many funds like the widely used community development block grants are sent through cities, which give them to local groups. Other funds go directly to private providers.
Advocates for religious groups applauded the shift, saying it sends a message of inclusion and predicting that it will open financing avenues that had been closed to many groups. 
"This should be a welcome step," said the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, president of the National 10-Point Leadership Foundation, a coalition of groups that represents primarily black churches. "It's entirely reasonable." 
Some civil rights advocates and Congressional critics promised to fight the change. Several legal experts said the new policy might not pass muster under a 1971 Supreme Court case, Tilton v. Richardson, that restricted aid to religious institutions. 
"The question is whether you can legitimately allocate, say, 80 percent of a building for religious use and 20 percent for secular use and say that the federal money is only paying for the secular use," said Douglas Laycock, a professor and religious liberties specialist at the University of Texas Law School. "The answer to the allocation question right now in the courts is no, you can't do it."
A professor at the Cardozo Law School, Marci Hamilton, said that it might be difficult for government lawyers to argue that they can truly separate a religious and social functions in a building and that many religious groups might not even want to try to do so.
"Once religious entities start arguing that any portion of their building is for nonreligious purposes," Professor Hamilton said, "they start opening themselves up to all sorts of problems like their tax-exempt status as religious institutions. It's a whole Pandora's box."
Billy Terry, who oversees religious issues for the National Congress for Community Economic Development, said that the change sent "an important message, and it denotes the tenor of this administration."
Although many religion-based groups do a good job of distinguishing between religious and social service components, Mr. Terry said, separating them can prove messy.
"It's like trying to take the sugar out of cupcakes," he said. "The line can get blurred."

HEADLINE: Pataki Hits Speech Circuit To Sell Vision 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki took to the road yesterday to sell his philosophy that the state must look beyond its budget crisis and hold down taxes to protect jobs and improve the state's economy. At the same time, he warned that the crisis was so severe that the alternative steps would be extremely difficult, affecting all New Yorkers.
 Mr. Pataki, who in style and practice has favored behind-the-scenes negotiations over public pronouncements, told a New York City audience of business and community leaders that New York shared a bleak financial plight with many states. 
 But he said he intended to respond to it with different economic solutions, putting him at odds with many of his Democratic opponents and some of his Republican colleagues around the nation who are considering tax increases.
"To be sure, we face a fiscal crisis today of a magnitude we have not confronted in our lifetime," the governor said in remarks delivered in a mirrored banquet room at the Waldorf-Astoria to the Association for a Better New York.
"Other states will propose massive tax increases," Mr. Pataki said later in the roughly 20-minute speech. "California is looking to solve its problems in part with more than $8 billion in tax hikes. We will not be making that mistake."
The speech was the first of three Mr. Pataki has planned to deliver to business leaders across the state. The others will be on Long Island tomorrow, and in Syracuse Monday, leading up to the governor's budget address on Wednesday in which he will lay out exactly how he intends to close a budget gap he described for the first time yesterday as $12 billion.
The speech, though unusual for this governor, was in line with remarks that he has made since he began his third term. He set the groundwork in both his Jan. 1 inaugural address and in his annual speech to the Legislature on Jan. 8. 
The remarks also reflect Mr. Pataki's overall ideology of fiscal conservatism, though he is also known as socially liberal.
The governor reaffirmed his commitment to holding down taxes that he has said will kill jobs, prolong the recession and deepen the budget gap. He called instead for shrinking government spending, though he offered no hint of what would have to go.
At the same time, the governor noted that localities, like New York City, are also suffering from the prolonged economic downturn and the attack on Sept. 11, and have turned to the state for help. In a surprise move, he announced that he was pushing for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to settle a longstanding dispute with the city and pay more than $500 million for airport rents. The money will help the city close its budget gap, projected at $3 billion next year.
"There will be a retroactive payment that covers the past, and there will be higher payments that go forward in the future," said Michael McKeon, an aide to Mr. Pataki.
The governor offered no relief for other localities, some of which have been complaining that they may have to raise taxes to cover gaps created by lower revenues and higher Medicaid costs, which the state shares with counties and New York City.
In Albany, Republican legislators, and even some Democrats, gave the governor credit for taking to the road to promote his message. But Senate and Assembly leaders were divided over what he had to say. 
Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the State Senate, welcomed the content.
"What I am hearing him say is, 'No new taxes,' and I agree with that," Mr. Bruno said. 
In a statement, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said, "Once again, the governor's rhetoric does not match the facts." 
He said the decision by the State University of New York to raise tuition and the possible increase in subway fares sought by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, both agencies the governor controls, were tantamount to tax increases.
Mr. Pataki did not shirk from noting the depth of the state's fiscal problems. Aides said the speech was meant to sell his philosophy, but also to prepare the public for the painful budget decisions to come.
"Never before have New Yorkers faced this type of fiscal challenge," Mr. Pataki said.
"It will require cuts in some of our most precious programs and projects, many of which I have championed personally," he said. "But we can either cut them today and allow for the growth that will fuel them tomorrow, or subject New Yorkers to job losses and a fiscal crisis for years to come."
No one could remember when Mr. Pataki had ever delivered such a pointed message about the budget, before its submission, in forums outside of Albany. 
His flurry of public comments was noteworthy for a governor who had always carefully controlled his public exposure, but who had been even less visible lately, presumably as he worked on a budget proposal that was likely to cause a more contentious legislative battle than usual in Albany.
Since late last year, the governor has slowly been acknowledging the true nature of the fiscal storm approaching, a problem he seemed to shrug off during his fall re-election campaign. Just weeks before the election, his budget officials said they expected the budget to hold through the end of this fiscal year, March 31.
But in November, just after his re-election, his administration cited unforeseen circumstances and asked for budget cuts. In December, Mr. Pataki said the gap could be $2 billion this year. In his inaugural speech, he first uttered the word crisis. In his annual speech to the Legislature, on Jan. 8, he called the problem the worst in a lifetime.
Under pressure from both the left and the right to declare his budget intentions, he finally said in the Jan. 8 speech that he was opposed to "job-killing taxes."
He then unexpectedly decided to embark on the speech tour, adopting a Reagan-style barnstorming to sell his ideas to the rank and file, administration officials said.
Aides said that, by going outside Albany, the governor was also trying to extend the debate beyond the special interests, like labor unions and advocacy groups for social services or education, and the powerful lobbyists who hold great sway over lawmakers.
"It is a chance to communicate directly to a larger audience," said an adviser to Mr. Pataki. "Why we must take the measures we must take, and not raise taxes, and what the significance of those actions will be to people's daily lives. The idea is to weigh the benefit of the greater community versus the needs or wants of people to grow certain programs."

HEADLINE: Government In Showdown In Bid to Shut Beef Processor 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
After a year of record recalls of meat suspected of contamination, the Bush administration is asserting its legal right to seek the shutdown of an Omaha slaughterhouse for repeated violations of food safety rules.
 The Agriculture Department will argue in Federal District Court on Thursday that the plant, Nebraska Beef Ltd., should be effectively shut down after numerous citations for unsanitary conditions. The investigation last August of the Omaha slaughterhouse was sparked by the discovery of hamburger contaminated with E. coli 0157:H7, some of which was supplied by Nebraska Beef. 
 Saying it would lose $2.7 million each day of a suspension and be driven out of business, Nebraska Beef won the first round in the case last week, convincing Judge Joseph F. Bataillon of Federal District Court that economic considerations outweighed what the company called the government's questionable accusations and authority. Judge Bataillon issued a temporary restraining order against the suspension. 
Consumer advocates and members of Congress have warned that the case reveals the essential weakness in the system; the government's inability to enforce health safety rules in the meat and poultry industry. They argue that the Agriculture Department will need new, explicit powers from Congress before the department can enforce rules strict enough to combat bacterial contamination of raw meat in the nation's slaughterhouses.
"This is an extraordinary case because it shows, bottom line, that the U.S.D.A. has no real authority to close a plant, even one with gross violations," said Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Food Policy Institute of the Consumer Federation of America.
Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, would not comment on the pending case. She is planning to announce proposals to bolster her department's budget for food safety programs on Thursday, money that would add new inspectors and more surveillance and microbiological testing.
For the administration, victory in the Nebraska Beef case would answer critics who have accused the Agriculture Department of failing to take aggressive action to improve meat safety after last year's recalls of tens of millions of pounds of meat and poultry, some after deaths from food-borne illnesses.
"We have to win," said one senior official at the Agriculture Department who spoke anonymously because the case is pending. "When you are finding repeated food safety violations that is an indication that the plant is deficient and we have to be able to remedy that." 
Officials at Nebraska Beef did not return telephone calls about the case.
But in briefs filed with the court, the beef packing company argued that a suspension of the plant's operation would cause irreparable damage to the company's reputation.
"Once a company's quality image has been damaged, if it is ever repaired, it takes years; the length of time Nebraska Beef Ltd. does not have," said Michael Thatcher, senior vice president for sales at the company.
This is not the first time inspectors have found fault with Nebraska Beef. In confidential reports over the past three years, the company has received regular citations from federal inspectors for failing to comply with safety rules. These include three citations for the discovery of fecal material on carcasses. One dated Oct. 15, 2001, stated that an inspector found "visible fecal material on the neck, armpit, underneath the foreshanks, and underneath the brisket area of two carcass sides."
Congress has debated putting more teeth in the inspection system for the past three years.
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said today that he would re-introduce legislation with Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, to restore the power of the Agriculture Department to "exercise a range of options -- from imposing fines to suspending operations -- when they find that a plant is contaminated."
"Our scientific inspection system should be a watchdog, not a lap dog," Mr. Durbin said. "We are not doing enough to protect consumers and families."
Mr. Durbin first introduced his legislation in 2000 after the Agriculture Department was told by a federal court that existing law did not allow it to close the Supreme Beef plant in Dallas even though its ground beef failed tests for salmonella three times in one year.
Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture during the Clinton administration, fought that case and said in an interview that it demonstrated "a serious gap in the law."
"We tested our authority and we lost," he said. "Now it is up to Congress to correct it and see it as a matter of high priority for public health."

HEADLINE: On the Pavement, A New Contender 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
FRANK TROPEA stands on the Brooklyn Bridge, taking in the breathtaking view of Manhattan on a bitterly cold Saturday afternoon.
 Actually, he is standing about eight inches above the bridge, atop his Segway Human Transporter, the high-tech celebrity scooter. 
 He has stopped because a young woman and her husband saw him riding along the bridge and ran after him, flagging him down. "Hey, a Segway!" shouts Jon Levitsky, pronouncing the name as if its first syllable rhymed with "hedge." (It is pronounced SEG-way, like "segue.") Mr. Levitsky and his wife, Sharon Herbstman, catch up to chat. The conversation goes the way hundreds of conversations have already gone for Mr. Tropea, the owner of the first Segway in New York City. 
 Women, in general, ask whether it is difficult to ride.
 (No.)
 Men, in general, ask three questions:
 How much does it cost? How fast does it go? What kind of mileage do you get with that?
 (About $5,000, 12.5 miles per hour, about 11 miles per electrical charge.)
 The 12.5 miles per hour is, apparently, theoretical. Mr. Tropea can rarely reach that speed; too many people stop him to gawk and talk. 
 In a world where toys still matter, he has the most awesome secret decoder ring of the moment, the shiniest Schwinn. The two-wheeled Segway's simple looks have been compared to an old-fashioned reel lawn mower's, but its seeming simplicity is deceptive.
 Using sensors, solid-state gyroscopes and home-brewed software, the Segway's inventor, Dean Kamen, has made a remarkably stable machine that keeps the rider balanced and even compensates for the hazards of rough terrain, gravel and sand. But the technology is hidden with the stylish understatement of the Tivoli Audio radio, which places sophisticated frequency-grabbing circuitry behind only two knobs and an old-fashioned case. 
 It will not be available to the general public until March, but advance sales have already made it one of the 200 best-selling items on Amazon despite its $4,950 price tag.
 But something there is that doesn't love a Segway. Some groups speaking on behalf of pedestrians say that the vehicles will crowd the sidewalks, increasing the risk of injury. One such group, America Walks (www.americawalks.org), has fought legislation that would legalize the Segway on sidewalks, and says on its Web site, "Nothing that moves faster than walking speed belongs in the space intended for walking."
 Thanks to a vigorous lobbying campaign by Mr. Kamen's company, 33 states have passed laws explicitly allowing the Segway to roam their streets and sidewalks. Many of those states allow cities, however, to ban the machines, and several are considering it. San Francisco is the first major city to have done so; Santa Cruz, Calif., after mulling a ban, decided to wait and see. 
 On the Brooklyn Bridge, Rick Heffernan, a 38-year-old epidemiologist walking along with a Starbucks cup in his hand, asks Mr. Tropea about the risks and whether the safety mechanisms built into the device could be defeated. 
 "Everything is dangerous, if you're stupid," he replies.
 Mr. Tropea got his Segway early, on Dec. 24, by winning a contest in which he had to say, in 75 words or less, why he liked the Segway. He wrote that he liked the idea of eliminating the expensive taxi trips that "contribute to air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion." The "practical and elegant" invention, he said, "moves you forward towards a cleaner and quieter city."
 He had been a fan from the beginning, when Inside.com, a media-oriented Web site, broke the story in January 2001 about a mysterious new invention by Mr. Kamen, who had achieved fame and fortune through creations that include an innovative arterial stent and a wheelchair that climbs stairs. A frenzy of speculation and hype ensued over IT, the code name for the machine at the time. Meanwhile, Mr. Tropea, who works in Manhattan as an administrator for the city's courts, created his own Web site, SegwayChat.com, to discuss the invention and help other fans keep up with the news.
 Winning the contest (there were 31 other winners) did not get him a discount, but it did get him a trip to New Hampshire to tour the Segway plant, to take a brief training course and to have dinner with the other winners at Mr. Kamen's home. Mr. Tropea, 27, speaks of the experience the way a teenager might talk about meeting a rock star.
 One might expect the wife of anyone who brings home a $5,000 scooter, no matter how cool, to call the family psychiatrist. But Mr. Tropea's wife, Azeeza, is happy with the purchase.
 "I can't ride a bicycle," she says, but "it took me about a minute to learn to ride the Segway." She believes they will, over time, save money on car service fares. "Too bad we cannot have two so we can ride together." She calls it "the magic ride."
 Mr. Tropea has no financial deal with the company to promote the machine, but no force on earth can keep him from doing so, either. He is besotted. "It's called a Segway Human Transporter. Five thousand bucks. Yeah, electric, just 10 cents a charge. You want to try it?" He lets people stand on the device, get the feel of the machine's calculated balance and spookily intuitive responsiveness.
 The rider tells a Segway to go by leaning forward, and to slow down or go backward by leaning back. Twisting a small ring on the left handlebar tells the device to turn.
 "It's awesome, man!" shouts Kalin Ivanov, who broke off from videotaping a panoramic sweep of the city to capture Mr. Tropea in action. 
 Mr. Tropea said some people argue that he has bought an overpriced "geek magnet." But it is rather a people magnet, especially for the opposite sex, he said. "If I wasn't married, this is what I would need to meet girls," he said.
 It is no exaggeration. A young woman catches his eye and asks about his ride. "Can you go fast?" she asks, and raises an eyebrow playfully. "Do you think you could catch me?"
 Segway fans like Mr. Tropea envision fleets of the machines in a range of models replacing current forms of transportation for police officers on the beat, letter carriers and hundreds of other workers who need to scoot around but do not need a car or truck for the job.
 Commenting, "We live in an obese society," one man on the Brooklyn Bridge, Jack Smith, asks why a machine that allows people to exercise even less is a good thing. Mr. Tropea answers, "I don't replace any walking with the Segway." He uses it only for trips that are not within easy walking distance, like his weekly visit to his parents' home in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn, a few miles away from his place in Bay Ridge. He figures that he is saving more than $100 each month in car service bills. 
 He even takes the machine on the subway, using mass transit to extend its reach. (Going up and down stairs is less trouble than might be expected. He dismounts and lowers the 85-pound Segway gently in front of him on the stairs, bouncing it down one step at a time. Going up, he is able to turn on the "power assist" feature so that the wheels turn and help him pull it.)
 Mr. Smith walks away satisfied. But like the members of America Walks, he has picked up on an undercurrent of resentment. Some of that is almost certainly related to the backlash sentiment against Hummers, Escalades and other holdover symbols of boom-time excess that would cast the Segway as the sport-utility vehicle of the sidewalk.
 "It's got this redolence of New Economy foolishness," said Thomas Frank, a social critic and the author of "One Market Under God" (Anchor Books, 2001), which skewered the dot-com heydays. Even the Segway's playfulness, its appeal to the inner child, he finds galling. "It's as though being a responsible adult is a burden of the working class," he says, while the more fortunate "get to posture as special, exalted beings of wonder and innocence." 
 If that pothole lies ahead, Mr. Tropea seems unconcerned. As he hits the sidewalks of Lower Manhattan, he weaves effortlessly through the throngs along Canal Street. He glides around people who pull loaded carts that are more than twice the width of Mr. Tropea and his machine, and he avoids the tables set up by outdoor hawkers. He takes up less space than, say, a beefy football lineman, but he does attract attention. He is going gently.
 Mr. Tropea was chosen to be a pioneer because he is all the right things: patient, considerate, passionate. He will demonstrate it for anyone who asks, answering the same questions endlessly. His 75-word essay, after all, did not say, "I like the Segway because it would help me to terrorize people on the sidewalks and run over adorable puppies." He is SegwayMan, who has pledged to use his powers of effortless transport and celebrity for good instead of evil.
 Come March, a different breed of Segway owner may begin to appear, the kind of people like the young man who skated by Mr. Tropea at breakneck speed and looked back, smirking. The idea of people like him trading in skates for a Segway would do far more than America Walks might to sour people on the scooter. 
 Still, many of the would-be skeptics might not be able to bring themselves to hate the Segway. Fiona Bayly, a marathon runner who lives in New York, says she is inclined to dislike it because the city "depends on its pedestrians to give it its vitality." Removing people's shoes from the sidewalk encroaches "on an aspect of city life that it shouldn't encroach on," she says. "It just seems so foreign." 
 Then Ms. Bayly wavers. "It's good that they don't pollute," she says. "If we could decrease car use and increase Segway use, that would be fantastic." 
 And stops again.
 "They look like fun, to tell you the truth."

HEADLINE: Ivan Rodriguez Joining Marlins 

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Ivan Rodriguez must not have felt much like a 10-time All-Star, a 10-time Gold Glove winner or a former American League most valuable player while he went more than a month without a job. There was minimal interest in Rodriguez, a 31-year-old, often-injured catcher, who was seeking a lucrative, multiyear contract after the Texas Rangers did not offer him salary arbitration. 
 But Rodriguez found a new baseball home yesterday, when the Florida Marlins signed him to a one-year, $10 million contract that includes deferred payments. Rodriguez had received a three-year offer for about $21 million from the Baltimore Orioles -- his agent was in Baltimore negotiating yesterday -- so the Marlins deal was a bit surprising. 
 For Rodriguez, it was a relief to be wanted. He is a future Hall of Fame player who was stuck on baseball's unemployment line. He hated being there and hopes to perform well enough in 2003 to earn the significant contract that eluded him this time.
"I got into a situation where I got depressed, me and my family," Rodriguez said. "Nothing was going on. This is my first time in the free-agent market and it was very tough. I guess it was the wrong time. There's always another time.
"Now I have to help the Marlins win a lot of games."
Rodriguez will receive $3 million this year, and the other $7 million will be deferred without interest. He will receive $3 million in June 2004, $2 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2006. 
The deal includes a no-trade clause and an agreement that the Marlins will not offer him salary arbitration after the season.
The Marlins made the arbitration clause part of their first proposal, which was enticing to Rodriguez.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Bush wants $670 billion in tax cuts, but where's the bang for the buck?

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
PERHAPS the highly unequal distribution of gains from the Bush administration's $670 billion in proposed tax cuts would be justifiable if the plan offered the prospect of significant economic growth. But this plan, more than half of which is made up of tax cuts on dividends, would have far less stimulative impact than has been promised in both the short run and the long run. What we have here is a huge tax cut for the rich without a commensurate bang for the buck for the economy. 
 First, let's consider the trifling short-term stimulus. Originally, the administration suggested that the package of tax cuts would result in a stimulus of more than $100 billion in 2003. But now the administration suggests that the stimulus would be in the range of only $50 billion to $60 billion in 2003, most of that a result of moving the tax cuts approved in 2001 forward, raising child allowances and a few other changes. The dividend tax cut provides almost no near-term stimulus. 
 In the meantime, some economists are now forecasting another decline in the gross domestic product in the fourth quarter -- the dreaded double dip. Several groups, liberal and conservative, are calling for a stimulus of as much as $200 billion. The longer we wait, the further we may fall. 
And the long-term benefits of the new tax package -- in particular, the dividend tax cuts -- are every bit as poorly thought out.
Corporate income is taxed when it is earned. If it is paid in dividends, it is taxed again as income for investors. A cut in dividend taxes should spur corporate investment and long-term growth. But many who believe that such double taxation of dividends results in an inefficient use of capital and encourages too much debt, including this writer, do not believe that the current proposals are an optimal way to encourage growth.
One of the most intriguing questions is raised by an influential group of economists who cut across the political spectrum. This "new view," best represented in the United States by Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley, maintains that when companies invest out of retained earnings, they are in effect deferring the tax that would have been paid by investors had they paid out the money in dividends. It is as if investors simply had the money in a tax-sheltered 401(k) plan. So a reduction in dividend taxes has no stimulative effect on business investment for these companies. 
Perhaps surprisingly, research by such noted conservative economists as Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute and even R. Glenn Hubbard, President Bush's own chief economist, is sympathetic to this view.
How good is the theory? George R. Zodrow, an economist at Rice University, has long followed the empirical research and says that one of the most recent studies in the field, by Mr. Hassett and Mr. Auerbach, suggests that the elimination of dividend taxation would encourage only about half the nation's corporations to invest more.
There are other, more traditional concerns. The White House just forecast that if the tax cut plan is passed, federal budget deficits will reach up to 3 percent of the G.D.P. That is a level that could almost get a member nation thrown out of the European Union. 
Such deficits might be acceptable if they were based on temporary government spending, but given that they would be partly caused by permanent tax cuts, they might be with us for a long time. 
Jane G. Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service argues that the deficits would probably push up interest rates on borrowing and undermine any stimulative impact of the dividend tax cut on investment or consumption.
At a time when low mortgage rates are a main prop under the economy, allowing Americans to continue to buy houses, a rise in such rates would be particularly counterproductive. 
Still another impediment to getting a stimulus from the Bush tax plan is that many corporations pay no taxes at all. William G. Gale and Peter R. Orszag of the Brookings Institution argue that even though the administration is proposing a benefit for those that pay their taxes, too many loopholes would remain, and a large number of companies would still find it more attractive to avoid taxes altogether than to pay dividends. Moreover, they point out that President Bush's proposal would open new loopholes. Mr. Gale says the tax package was hastily put together and just not adequately vetted by the professionals in the Treasury Department.
Finally, many economists say stock prices would go up less than the Bush administration implied as a result of the cuts. A likely estimate is that stocks would rise no more than 4 or 5 percent, or up to $50 billion. Such a rise might induce consumers to increase spending on goods and services by about $20 billion a year, or a paltry 0.2 percent of G.D.P. 
The Bush administration is, in fact, offering us, as Mr. Gale says, "a tax cut that is masquerading as tax reform."
If tax reform is what the nation needs, then we should do it right. For one thing, it should be revenue-neutral. The Democrats might consider calling the president's bluff by proposing true dividend reform, but only if the income tax on the wealthy was raised to offset it. 
And any reforms of dividend taxes should also be comprehensive. All corporate profits should be taxed at least once. Finally, dividend tax reform would be fully effective only if dividends were deductible for the corporation, not the investor, thereby making them truly comparable to interest on debt.
It is hard to imagine $670 billion in tax cuts that would stimulate the economy less than the Bush proposal. By linking tax reform and a tax cut stimulus, apparently for political reasons, the administration is likely to fail at both.

HEADLINE: Top Strategist Terms Bush A Populist About Taxes 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Karl Rove, the White House's senior political strategist, said today that President Bush was a populist whose call for the elimination of taxes on stock dividends was aimed at "the little guy."
 In a wide-ranging session with reporters, Mr. Rove suggested that the president ranked with Theodore Roosevelt as an environmentalist and predicted a close 2004 presidential race. He said the Republican Party had been strengthened by the controversy over Senator Trent Lott, and he played down his own reputation as the most powerful behind-the-scenes White House adviser, on both policy and politics, in generations. 
 "I'm one voice among many around the senior staff table in the morning," he said. "This town can only operate successfully through myth, and one of the myths is that there has to be some Svengali-like person sitting in the White House."
Mr. Rove's session with reporters today was a rare instance of him subjecting himself to lengthy questioning, and he easily spanned political and policy matters, providing answers that in some cases seemed certain to provoke the administration's opponents.
Asked how Mr. Bush compared with Teddy Roosevelt on foreign and economic policy, Mr. Rove replied that the president is a populist.
"Give him a choice between Wall Street and Main Street and he'll choose Main Street every time," Mr. Rove said. 
When faced with a decision whether to call for the elimination of the tax on dividends at the corporate level or the individual level, Mr. Rove said, the president sided "with the little guy."
Asked to elaborate, Mr. Rove said that "wealth is too important to be left to the wealthy" and that Mr. Bush wanted to reward risk-taking entrepreneurs. He said Mr. Bush's overall tax plan would actually put more of the total income-tax burden on upper-income people by removing more low-income people from the federal tax rolls.
The Tax Policy Center, a research group run by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, said in a report last week that 45.8 percent of the benefits of eliminating the dividend tax would go to the top 1 percent of the nation's earners -- households making more than $316,000 a year -- and that nearly 70 percent of the benefits would go to the top 5 percent, or households with income of $133,000 or above.
Mr. Rove spoke after Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic minority leader, derided Mr. Bush's $670 billion tax cut proposal today as the "Leave No Millionaire Behind Act" and suggested that Mr. Bush's declining poll numbers were directly linked to his favoring the wealthy.
On the environment, Mr. Rove said Mr. Bush had pursued enlightened policies, such as encouraging the thinning of forest on federal land to reduce the damage from forest fires.
"I would suspect that Theodore Roosevelt would be standing up and applauding the president's initiative on, say, healthy forests," Mr. Rove said. "We have more trees today in the United States than we did when Theodore Roosevelt was president, on our public lands."
Earlier in the day, Senate Republicans defeated an attempt by Democrats to roll back Mr. Bush's plan to ease air quality regulations on many older power plants and factories. At an appearance in New Hampshire, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, called the Bush White House "the most anti-environmental administration since the environmental movement began in the late '60's and early '70's."
Discussing politics, Mr. Rove said he expected the 2004 presidential race to be more like the tight election of 2000 than President Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election in 1984. He said the Democratic challenger would emerge from a tough primary fight strengthened, and that even the successful prosecution of any war would not be cause for overconfidence at the White House.
"I see a very close election," he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: EUROPE; 
France and Germany Draw a Line, Against Washington

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
In a blunt rejection of American impatience toward Baghdad, the leaders of France and Germany said today during ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of a French-German cooperation treaty that they shared common views on Iraq, and that any Security Council resolution for military action would have to await the report of weapons inspectors.
 President Jacques Chirac of France said that "war is always the admission of defeat, and is always the worst of solutions." 
 "And hence everything must be done to avoid it," he said, adding, "France and Germany have a judgment on this crisis that is the same."
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, appearing with Mr. Chirac at a news conference, said, "We both want a peaceful solution to the crisis in Iraq, and we will work toward that in close cooperation." On Tuesday, Mr. Schroder expressed his most forceful rejection yet of military action. 
The words took on particular weight, since France and Germany hold the Security Council presidency this month and next.
The leaders were speaking at daylong ceremonies in the French capital and at nearby Versailles recalling the signing in 1963 of the Elysee Treaty, which was meant to set the agenda for new stages of European integration. 
A list of areas in which both countries seek closer cooperation that was published today contained a pledge that they would "be attentive to adopt common positions in international bodies, including the Security Council."
On Tuesday, the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, said France would seek the agreement of other European countries, including Britain, to oppose American pressure for military action before there was a clear signal from the weapons inspectors and agreement by the Security Council. France plans to act at a European Union ministers' meeting Monday and Tuesday that coincides with a report to the Security Council on Monday from the chief weapons inspectors.
Mr. de Villepin has refused to rule out the possibility that France, as a permanent member of the Security Council, will use its veto if the United States presses for a United Nations resolution authorizing war.
But the statements of unity by Mr. Chirac and Mr. Schroder vividly illustrated the lack of unity among European states. Britain announced on Monday that it was preparing almost 30,000 troops for action in Iraq. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Tony Blair, appearing to side with Washington, stated that fresh intelligence indicated that the intensified preparations for military action in the Persian Gulf was undermining the rule of Saddam Hussein.
The show of unity by France and Germany appeared to reflect the determination of the French -- who hold the Council presidency this month -- to prevent the Bush administration from forcing the issue of Iraqi compliance in the Council later this month. Mr. Chirac said that "as regards this common position," France and Germany -- as the Council president in February -- were "entirely coordinated and in permanent contact every day."
Late Tuesday, Mr. Schroder made his most resolute statement to date against any resolution for war. At an election rally of his Social Democratic Party in the German city of Goslar, Mr. Schroder said, "I have told, in particular, our French friends, but others as well, and I am going a step further in what I say here and now: do not reckon with Germany approving a resolution authorizing war. Do not reckon with that."
In his remarks today, Mr. Chirac did not go that far. But he said the common view of Paris and Berlin was "grounded in two ideas: the first is that any decision belongs to the Security Council, and to it alone, expressing itself after having heard the report of the inspectors in conformity with the pertinent resolutions approved by the Council." The second, he said, was that "war is always the admission of defeat, and is always the worst of solutions. And hence everything must be done to avoid it."
Mr. Schroder, asked whether he had anything to add, replied with one word, "No."
Opinion polls across Europe indicate that opposition to the use of force against Iraq is widespread. Antiwar demonstrators have taken to the streets repeatedly in numerous European cities, with marchers silently or loudly objecting to America's threats to use its military might against Baghdad.
The two leaders gave their views during a day of ceremonies intended to reassure each other, as well as their European partners, that their countries still see their destinies as intertwined. Early in 1963, President Charles de Gaulle and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer met in Elysee Palace to sign a treaty that Mr. de Gaulle predicted would gradually end "centuries of rivalry."
During much of the cold war, while West Germany served as the motor of European economic growth, it bowed to the political leadership of France. With German unification, Paris at first harbored concern over possible German domination.
But in recent years, Germany has been struggling to overhaul its inflexible economy, while the French have better mastered the challenge of globalization and all but replaced the Germans as the engines of European growth. Now, the addition of 10 additional members to the European Union and the discussions taking place in Brussels to create a kind of constitution for the enlarged union are putting renewed strains on French-German understanding.
For the French, the confrontation with Iraq appears to afford Paris the opportunity to revive a strong French-German bond as the basis for a more vigorously assertive European foreign policy. With the question of Iraq welding the ties between Washington and London even more closely, the French appear to have a sense of urgency.
"Passing from 15 to 25 members, the European Union is not only in danger of being diluted into a free trade zone," Charles Lambroschini, chief editorialist of Le Figaro, wrote today, "it risks being transformed into a simple protectorate of the United States."

HEADLINE: Venezuelan High Court Suspends Referendum on President Chavez 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Venezuela's Supreme Court today suspended a referendum scheduled for Feb. 2 on President Hugo Chavez's rule, dealing a blow to the broad coalition of government opponents who had hoped that the vote, though nonbinding, might force him to resign.
 Since the start of the year, the referendum has been a principal objective of many business people, union officials and politicians. To achieve it they have led a national strike, shutting most major businesses and crippling the state-owned oil company, the engine of the Venezuelan economy. 
 The strike is now in its eighth week, and today there was fresh evidence of the depth of the economic damage it has inflicted. Venezuela's central bank suspended its foreign exchange trading for a week in an effort to stop the free fall of country's currency, the Bolivar. Finance Minister Tobias Nobrega said new foreign exchange policies, including "restrictions" on foreign trade, would be unveiled next week. Experts predict that the government may impose exchange controls to protect its depleted foreign reserves, caused partly by the dramatic decline in oil exports.
"The government must adopt urgent measures to prevent our international reserves from further deteriorating," Mr. Nobrega said in a television address.
Yet leaders of the nation's chief business chambers and striking oil workers vowed to keep up their work stoppages to press the government to allow the Feb. 2 referendum. The opposition had collected some two million signatures to call the vote. The nonbinding measure would ask voters whether they believe President Chavez should resign.
The Supreme Court ordered the National Electoral Council to stop work on the referendum, to the joy of government supporters, who see it as an illegal ploy. "It is nothing more than a fraudulent measure that is backfiring on the people who proposed it," said Juan Barreto, a legislator for President Chavez's party, the Fifth Republic Movement. "And for that reason it has caused them frustration and rage."
Mr. Chavez has publicly expressed opposition to the measure, saying that the constitution only allows for a recall referendum against his government in August, the midpoint in his six-year term. But opposition leaders said they saw the court decision today as proof that the government would block any formal accounting of public opinion.
Opposition leaders are scheduled to fly to Washington on Thursday to attend the first meeting of Venezuela's so-called "Group of Friends" -- the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Spain and Portugal.
The group will receive two proposals made here Tuesday by former President Jimmy Carter. The first was that the government and its opponents support a constitutional amendment to shorten the president's term and call for new elections. The alternative was that the two sides agree to support a recall referendum on Mr. Chavez's rule.

HEADLINE: Bush Pushes Tax Cut as Small-Business Aid 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush pushed his economic plan in an important political swing state today, saying that it would benefit America's small-business owners and that it was not a giveaway to the rich.
 "Oh, sure, you hear the typical class warfare rhetoric, trying to pit one group of people against another," Mr. Bush said in a frigid warehouse of JS Logistics, a trucking company, where volunteers for the White House used white stickers to cover the "Made in China" stamps. 
 "But lost in all the rhetoric," Mr. Bush said to the friendly crowd of invited small-business owners bundled up in fur and leather gloves, is that "small businesses pay taxes at the individual income tax rate, starting here with JS Logistics." 
Mr. Bush said that his plan would help small business in two ways: by reducing personal income tax rates on small business owners who include their profits on their individual tax returns, and by tripling -- to $75,000 -- the amount that small businesses could write off for the purchase of new equipment.
"The best way to encourage job growth is to let companies like JS keep more of their own money so they can invest in their business and make it easier for somebody to find work," Mr. Bush said to considerably stronger applause than the muted clapping that greeted his opening remarks threatening military action against Iraq.
Mr. Bush's trip was the latest assault in an aggressive campaign by the White House to sell the president's $674 billion package of tax cuts and welfare benefits that he announced in Chicago this month. The plan has run into major objections from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, whose approval is needed. Administration officials acknowledge they have a difficult selling task in the months ahead.
Mr. Bush focused today on promoting his plan to a politically potent group that is not usually associated with the richest Americans. A White House fact sheet supplied to reporters today said nearly 40 percent of small businesses are owned by women and close to 15 percent are owned by members of minorities. Small businesses employ more than half the private work force, the White House said, and create more than two out of every three new jobs.
The president said that his economic plan would provide an average tax cut of $2,042 to 23 million small-business owners. "Now, some will say in Washington, of course, that's not much money," Mr. Bush said. "It's a lot of money to somebody who has got two employees. It's a lot of money to somebody making a decision whether or not to expand a business. It's a lot of money."
The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan is the immediate elimination of taxes on stock dividends, a provision the administration says would put $364 billion in the hands of investors over the next decade. It is also the part of the plan that has attracted the most political fire, and Mr. Bush did not dwell on it today. Instead, he sounded favorite themes about the robust entrepreneurial spirit in America.
"Look right around you, right here in JS," Mr. Bush said. "It's one of the things that makes us a great nation. There are thousands of Americans from all walks of life who are realizing their dream of owning their own business."
Despite the day's planned focus on the economy, Mr. Bush opened his remarks with a lengthy and impassioned case for action against Saddam Hussein, making it sound as if war was imminent. Mr. Bush also threatened Iraq's generals and soldiers with trials for war crimes if they obeyed an order from Mr. Hussein to use weapons of mass destruction "on our troops or on innocent lives within Iraq."
Before his speech, Mr. Bush met for 20 minutes with a group of 10 small-business owners and employees, now a standard for a Bush day trip. As is almost always the case, the remarks from the group were enthusiastically in support of the president. 
When Mr. Bush offered them highlights of his tax-cut package and said it would spur the economy, Greg Hantek, the co-owner of JS Logistics, responded, "It's kind of like preaching to the choir."
Mr. Bush smiled and said, "Sometimes the choir needs redemption."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MILITARY ANALYSIS; 
Fighting Solo If Necessary

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Even if there is substantial allied resistance to an invasion of Iraq, the United States will be prepared to attack with a force of 150,000 by middle to late February, according to military experts and American officials. 
 But allied criticism could make it more difficult to secure NATO's support for any war in Iraq and complicate Washington's efforts to secure access to some bases in the region. If the war goes ahead, allied reluctance may also make it harder for the United States to share the military burden and economic cost for occupying and rebuilding Iraq after Saddam Hussein is gone. 
 From the start, the force that the Pentagon has planned for an Iraq invasion has been overwhelmingly made up of Americans. Contributions from Britain and Australia, who are likely to join a military campaign to oust Saddam Hussein even if the United Nations Security Council remains divided over the issue, are small by comparison. 
The United States is expected to deploy about five aircraft carriers, four or more Army divisions, a Marine Expeditionary Force and the Air Force's most modern fighters and bombers in a 150,000-person force that could expand even further.
Britain is sending just over 30,000 troops, while Australia will deploy an initial complement of special forces, a troop ship and F/A-18 aircraft.
Even if the United Nations Security Council were to formally endorse an attack on Iraq, the United States military would be doing most of the fighting. Conversely, even if the Security Council remains deadlocked over the need for military action, there will almost certainly be some allies fighting alongside American forces. 
The dispute between the United States and its French and German allies over the purpose of the United Nations weapons inspections and the threshold for going to war with Iraq does nothing to alter the American-dominated nature of an operation under the overall command of Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the head of the United States Central Command. 
"While the U.S. government would welcome the assistance of the United Kingdom and other countries, at the end of the day this will be a U.S.-led operation in which the bulk of the troops and the preponderance of combat forces will be American," said Joseph P. Hoar, a retired four-star Marine general and the former head of the Central Command. 
Still, the Bush administration has sought to marshal as broad an allied support network as possible for political as well as military reasons.
"We have, in my estimation and I think in General Franks's estimation, the coalition support to do what we need to do," Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today. "Obviously the more of that, the better, frankly, for all sorts of reasons."
A sharp split within NATO or among Security Council members could hamper American political and military planning in several respects. 
One potential problem concerns the indirect support the United States has sought from NATO, measures that are largely intended to facilitate the American buildup in the Persian Gulf by relieving United States forces of other duties. 
The United States, for example, has proposed that NATO ships patrol the eastern Mediterranean Sea and that NATO send Awacs warning and command planes to Turkey. NATO nations have not yet asked the alliance's military authorities to prepare contingency plans for such steps, diplomats said. Some allies do not want NATO's military planning to begin before the report next week by a chief United Nations weapons inspector, Hans Blix, on inspections of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and before further deliberations in the Council. 
Another issue concerns the United States' access to ports, airfields and air space in the Middle East. While the United States is not asking Arab states to send forces to fight alongside United States troops, the American war plan depends on cooperation by Kuwait, which would be the launching pad for the main ground offensive, and Qatar, where the Central Command's forward headquarters will be located. The United States is also counting on access to airfields in other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.
If force must be used, those nations believe it should be done under the terms of a second Security Council resolution on Iraq, one that would explicitly authorize an attack. That way their support for a potential United States attack could be portrayed as a way of enforcing the will of the Security Council and not as a means of helping the Bush administration redraw the geopolitical map of the Middle East.
"Kuwait, like the rest of the international community, would prefer to have a second resolution that allows the use of force against Iraq," said Kuwait's ambassador to Washington, Salem Abdullah al-Jaber al-Sabah. "As to how Kuwait would behave without a second resolution, there is no reason to jump the gun at this point in time. It is a wait-and-see situation."
With American forces pouring into Kuwait and the Kuwaitis still angry over the Iraq's invasion of their country in 1990, it seems clear that Kuwait, like most gulf states, would back an American attack on Iraq even without an explicit United Nations endorsement. 
But the open disagreement between the United States and its allies may aggravate Washington's dealings with Turkey, whose territory the United States wants to use to open a northern front against Iraq. While Turkish officials have said that a second Security Council resolution is needed, American officials are calculating that Ankara will drop that demand. The dispute among NATO allies makes that politically more difficult for Turkey's new government. 
Another reason why broad allied support is desirable to the United States concerns Washington's plan for occupying and rebuilding Iraq in the event of a war. While the United States is prepared to carry out the main combat role in any war with Iraq, it would like a broad range of nations to help maintain order in a post-war Iraq and share the burden of rebuilding the nation after Saddam Hussein's government is ousted. 
That would free up the United States military to attend to other missions, including the campaign against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, and it would reduce the cost of the war and the postwar occupation to the United States. But enlisting broad international support could be more difficult if the United States is seen as charting too unilateral a course. 
"If the United States needs to keep 100,000 troops in Iraq for three years, that will put a real burden on the U.S. military," said Michael O'Hanlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution. "We really need the allies for that. We have got to have most of them buying into the initial concept in order to help us with the stabilization afterward."
Those complications, however, are far less worrisome to the Bush administration than failing to fulfill its promises to disarm Iraq, by force if necessary, and to do so in a short time frame. If war comes, the Pentagon's timetable calls for it to take place during the winter months, before soaring desert temperatures make it difficult for troops to wear the cumbersome suits that protect them against chemical and germ weapons. 
There is no simple answer as to when a war might begin. The United States military could advance its attack preparations and begin an air campaign and even a ground attack while forces are still flowing into the region. That scenario is known as a "rolling start." Referring to that possibility, General Myers said today: "We're ready now. The Iraqi regime should have no doubt."
Alternatively and far more likely, the United States will wait until its main force is deployed. That would enable the American forces not only to advance on Baghdad but also to fan out through Iraq to locate suspected caches of poison gas and germ weapons and ensure that Iraq is not able to fire Scud missiles at Israel from the western desert. It would also enable Washington to protect Iraq's oil fields and put a force in northern Iraq that could prevent any potential conflicts between the Turks and the Kurds.
Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired four-star Army general who commanded the 24th Mechanized Division during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, said he thought the American military would be prepared to carry out such a ambitious attack by late February or early March. United States combat power in the region, he said, is "building rapidly."

HEADLINE: At a Distance, Bush Joins Abortion Protest 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush told tens of thousands of abortion protesters today that he shared their commitment to "protect the lives of innocent children waiting to be born," and asserted that the anti-abortion movement was gaining steam in Congress and the culture at large.
 Mr. Bush, speaking by telephone hookup from St. Louis to protesters assembled on the Mall, also said that he expected Congress to pass a ban this year on the late-term medical procedure that critics call "partial birth abortion." He reaffirmed his promise to sign legislation to end that procedure, which he called abhorrent and an offense to human dignity. 
 Mr. Bush was roundly cheered at the annual "March for Life," held to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision declaring a constitutional right to abortion. He was just as roundly denounced by supporters of abortion rights, who used the 30th anniversary of Roe to warn that a Bush presidency and a Republican Congress have placed the right to abortion in profound jeopardy.
"Pro-choice America has to wake up," said Elizabeth Cavendish, legal director for Naral Pro-Choice America.
The competing messages, which spilled into the streets and up to the steps of the Supreme Court, came as the latest New York Times/CBS News poll showed that half of those surveyed expect Mr. Bush to appoint justices to the Supreme Court "who will vote to make abortion against the law." Thirty percent said they expected him to appoint justices who would vote to keep abortion legal.
Much of the urgency and edge in the current debate comes from the widespread belief that a Supreme Court vacancy could come at any time; the last vacancy occurred nine years ago, making this the longest stretch without change on the court since the early 1800's.
The anti-abortion crowd, which braved frigid weather and, in many cases, lengthy bus trips to gather here, was upbeat. It was a young and heavily Roman Catholic group, many members carrying banners from their schools, parishes or organizations like the Knights of Columbus. Organizers said that more than 100,000 people had assembled for the march. (The National Park Service no longer provides crowd estimates.) The demonstrators carried signs that declared such sentiments as "Women Deserve Better Than Abortion," "Michigan Loves Our Pro-Life President" and "Respect Life, Diocese of Pittsburgh."
Speaker after speaker told the cheering throng that the tide was turning in the long struggle to restrict legalized abortion, and that a new Republican majority in the Senate and a sympathetic ally in the White House would ease the way for new curbs on abortion and cloning.
Citing the movement's gains in the House and the Senate in last fall's elections, Representative Todd Tiahrt, Republican of Kansas, declared: "I am very optimistic. You are making a difference." 
Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, told the rally, "Each and every one of you here today is part of the greatest human rights movement on the face of the earth," adding, "Ladies and gentlemen, you get it."
Based on recent polls, Mr. Smith asserted, "a growing majority of American get it as well."
Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, told the crowd: "Young people, fight for all you're worth and we will dance on the grave of Roe v. Wade." 
And Mr. Bush himself set the tone for the day when he declared, "You and I share a commitment to building a culture of life in America, and we are making progress."
Still, the White House was trying a carefully calibrated approach on this divisive issue. While he rallied the marchers, Mr. Bush did so from St. Louis, where he was campaigning for his economic plan. At the same time, his top political adviser, Karl Rove, told reporters that the president was focusing on an agenda that fell far short of the abortion ban he -- and the movement -- support.
Asked how long it might be before Mr. Bush started pushing for such a ban, Mr. Rove replied: "For now, we're focusing on getting the partial-birth abortion ban and doing something about cloning. Let's get those victories before we start making prognostications about what might be years in the future."
Mr. Rove also said that "whether you're pro-life or pro-choice, there's a desire to find common ground." He said he believed that there was common ground on issues like cloning, parental notification laws and banning the "partial birth" procedure.
Critics assert that what they call "partial birth abortion" amounts to partly delivering a fetus and collapsing its skull. Abortion rights supporters maintain that the government should not dictate to doctors the procedures they can and cannot use to protect a woman's health.
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, told reporters today that "issues such as partial-birth abortion are issues that you will likely see this Congress address and address fairly early," although he added that there was no specific timetable. 
Abortion opponents considered the Democratic majority, under Senator Tom Daschle, a major obstacle to moving on legislation like the "partial birth" ban.
The New York Times/CBS Poll released today showed that the vast majority of Americans continued to believe that abortion should be available in at least some cases: 39 percent said it should be generally available, 38 percent said it should be available with stricter limits than currently exist, and 22 percent should it should not be permitted.
In what has become one of the enduring rituals in Washington, each side made its case with graphic imagery: Many abortion opponents carried pictures of aborted fetuses, in one case superimposed on the American flag. Abortion rights supporters countered with the images of women, including women who died of botched abortions performed when the procedure was illegal.
A small group of abortion rights supporters rallied in front of the Supreme Court today, chanting "Not the Church, Not the State, Women Must Decide their Fate." Competing chants rose from the March for Life: "Pro-choice, That's a Lie, Babies Never Choose to Die!"

With Art All the Rage Again, Projects Are Finished

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
IT is not as if Tom Eccles, the director and curator of the Public Art Fund, is without opinions. Mr. Eccles, whose nonprofit group presents attention-getting projects like the Witch Catcher -- a mysterious new installation with a soaring, twisted chimney at City Hall Park and, in 2000, Jeff Koons's flowering 40-foot-tall terrier puppy in Rockefeller Center -- has plenty of them.
 Hear him on the Central Park project, just approved by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to allow the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude to install billowing saffron-colored fabric along the walkways (not one of his fund's projects.) 
 "Would it be a different experience in the park? Yes. Do I want a different experience in the park? Not really," says Mr. Eccles, 38, who speaks in a soft Scottish accent. "But it will be something to see. Should New York City do it? Yes, absolutely. There's a sea change, and the Bloomberg administration is trying things that have not been done before. So it's not an issue of whether I like it." 
All right. It must be nice having a longtime arts supporter in the mayor's office, even for an organization with historically strong civic ties. 
The fund was founded in 1977 by Doris C. Freedman, the first director of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. Mr. Bloomberg, through his corporate philanthropy, was a patron of several fund projects.
Mr. Eccles's organization was invited by the Bloomberg administration to present an exhibition in City Hall Park; thus the Witch Catcher, with its chimney twisting 25 feet high.
Mr. Eccles certainly has ideas about things. But on a recent morning in the fund's Midtown office, it quickly becomes obvious that he is not at ease talking about himself. Even so, he is exceedingly polite, eager to answer questions, even if his body language screams: get me out of here.
As the interview goes on, he seems to have other things on his mind. He mentions an important afternoon meeting downtown but refuses to discuss it. "It's Lower Manhattan governmental," he says. "Something to do with downtown that I can't talk about; something big downtown." 
Soon, he is tugging a dark overcoat over a preppy blue shirt. He explains that he may go through three or four outfits in a day because of the range of people he meets, from gallery owners to landlords of major buildings.
"Sometimes I do get kind of caught out," he says with a smile. "I forget about a meeting and I'm wearing a leather jacket. I think people allow me a certain latitude for being British."
HE is trailed into the subway for a trip to City Hall. He has agreed to stop at the Witch Catcher, which was created by the New York artist Brian Tolle. It is the first of six works of art to be placed in the park in what will make up "MetroSpective," on view until July.
"One of the most important things is you provide people with something that normally doesn't exist in their lives," Mr. Eccles says. "That's the difference between us and museums, not inside and outside. It's that people experience it as a part of their daily lives."
Even in tough economic times, the private group's budget has risen to $2.3 million from $500,000 in the last five years, of which less than 5 percent comes from the government. Mr. Eccles credits the group's president, Susan Freedman, the founder's daughter.
Mr. Eccles took over as the fund's director in 1996. He says the group has stepped out of its mainly administrative role, adept at cutting through bureaucratic red tape, and become more of a production company, organizing and commissioning projects.
He has just returned from Turin, Italy, where he reviewed a U.F.O. project, which resembles a huge effervescent egg. It will be installed this spring inside the public atrium in the old I.B.M. building at 590 Madison Avenue (between 56th and 57th Streets). "In a way, what we are trying to do is constant change, evolving the edges of what art is and public space," he says.
Mr. Eccles is a native of Glasgow. In November, he joined a committee, organized by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is drafting the World Trade Center memorial mission statement.
He says the fact that he is British has never come up. "I have kind of lived the American dream in a weird way," he says.
Mr. Eccles is married to a former marketing manager who now stays home with their 4-year-old, Rachel, in Brooklyn Heights. The couple left Scotland in 1993. He says his American wife, Jennefer, was homesick. And he felt the Glasgow art scene, where he had worked as an independent curator, was too small and introverted.
He received a master's degree in philosophy and Italian at the University of Glasgow, studying for two years with Umberto Eco, the Italian novelist and philosopher, at the University of Bologna.
His father was an architect who specialized in public housing, and his mother was a deputy director of housing in Edinburgh. "They both always talked about public space and public values," he says.
When asked if he has a wish list of things he would like to see in the city, he says no.
"I'm in an amazing position where most of them come true," he says. "I love working with artists and being able to carry projects from start to finish. That's more important than for me to realize my vision for the city."

Time and Fallon Expand Relationship

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
Time magazine in New York, published by the Time Inc. division of AOL Time Warner, is expanding its relationship with Fallon Worldwide by consolidating its worldwide account and naming Fallon as worldwide creative agency of record.
 The Fallon headquarters in Minneapolis and the office in New York have handled the Time account in the United States since 1991. 
Time spent $227,000 in big consumer media in the United States in the first 10 months of 2002, according to CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres, and spent additional amounts in trade publications. 
 With the decision, which came without a review, the Fallon New York office assumes creative duties for the account in Europe, which had most recently been handled by Wink Media in London when Wink was part of Time Inc.
The Singapore and Hong Kong offices of Fallon assume creative duties in Asia, which had been handled by the Hong Kong office of Bates Worldwide, part of the Cordiant Communications Group. MindShare in London, part of the WPP Group, continues to handle worldwide media buying for Time. Fallon is part of Publicis.

HEADLINE: Suit Says Chicago Housing Renewal Plan Perpetuates Segregation 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
A lawsuit was filed against the Chicago Housing Authority today on behalf of thousands of public housing residents who say they were steered to mostly black, high-crime and impoverished neighborhoods when they were forced to move as part of a plan to demolish the city's high-rise housing projects. 
 The suit charges that the housing authority did not provide adequate relocation services or counseling to families displaced by the demolition. It contends that the housing authority has violated federal law, including the Fair Housing Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
 The lawsuit was filed by the National Center on Poverty Law, the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Business, and Professional People for the Public Interest. 
At a news conference this morning, representatives for the advocacy groups said they wanted the housing authority to start a program to adequately help families forced to move as the authority continues its huge job of razing the housing projects that have been trouble-ridden, crumbling eyesores for decades. This year alone, 600 more families will be involuntarily relocated with Section 8 housing vouchers, the suit says.
"These families were promised a better future with better housing under the relocation program," said William P. Wilen, spokesman for the National Center of Poverty Law. "The program was not created to perpetuate segregation and steer families to African-American areas."
The suit names as defendants both the housing authority and its chief executive officer, Terry Peterson. In a written statement, the housing authority said it was "disappointed" that the groups had filed the lawsuit.
"We have respect for the work these groups have done surrounding civil rights and segregation," the statement said, "and we concur that improvements should continue to be made to the service system and elements of our relocation process for residents. However, we feel that the best way to make these changes is not through a lawsuit that drains needed resources but by working with C.H.A.'s resident leadership and housing and social services experts to develop meaningful solutions."
A study commissioned by the poverty law center found that residents displaced by the demolition now live in other Chicago neighborhoods that are just as segregated and as poor as the ones they left. The study tracked more than 3,200 families relocated from public housing from 1995 to 2002 with Section 8 vouchers or certificates, which can be used by poor families toward rent in privately owned housing. 
It concluded that about 83 percent of the residents moved to neighborhoods that were at least 90 percent black and that nearly 50 percent of the families moved to neighborhoods where there was a high concentration of poverty. The study also found that while some families located housing in neighborhoods that were slightly better than their old ones, their new neighborhoods has high crime, poor schools and substandard housing.
The housing authority "has denied these families the choice to move to a better area of the city," Mr. Wilen said. 
According to the suit, the housing authority promised residents that it would help them move to more economically and racially diverse neighborhoods. It said that in 2001 the authority and an advisory counsel for tenants entered into a contract that promised "comparable replacement housing," and help in finding housing in low-poverty or racially diverse areas of the city that were not less desirable than the neighborhood where relocating residents already were living.
The suit charges that agencies hired by the housing authority to help relocate residents most often showed them housing in poverty-stricken, predominantly black neighborhoods on the city's South and West Sides and refused their requests to help them move to more integrated communities.
Alexander Polikoff, spokesman for Business and Professional People for the Public Interest, said the suit did not seek to halt the relocation program but to force the housing authority to provide better social services and better housing counseling for displaced residents.
Clyde Murphy, spokesman for Chicago Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said relocation had led to the "wholesale re-segregation of the African-American population in Chicago."
Although the demolition effort itself has been welcomed by public housing residents, some say that now that their old neighborhoods are slowly gentrifying and becoming safer, they have to move to neighborhoods where gangs, crime and drugs are major concerns.
"It's awful," said Mary Sistrunk, 31, a mother of eight. She is among seven current or former residents cited in the suit and lives in Englewood, a police district with the second highest number of homicides in the city. "I'd like to move to a decent neighborhood where my children have a better place to live."
On South State Street today, bulldozers hummed while plowing a pile of concrete and dust that was once a high-rise at the Stateway Gardens housing development.
"You take an entire building and you tear that building down, where are all these people going?" said Clifford Smiley, sitting inside a public library across the street from the demolition.

HEADLINE: Bleak Forecast as City Jobless Rate Climbs 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
New York City's economy ended 2002 in steep decline, with an unemployment rate far above the national average and an accelerating loss of private sector jobs, according to data released today by the state and city governments.
 The jobless rate jumped to 8.4 percent in December, up from 8 percent in November, after adjustment for seasonal factors, according to the New York State Department of Labor. 
 The last time such a large percentage of the labor force was looking for work was March 1998, when the jobless rate was heading downward. 
The employment situation in the city is far graver than in much of the country. In the last 12 months, the city's unemployment rate has jumped by 1.1 percentage points; nationally, the jobless rate has risen just 0.2 percentage points in the same period, and now stands at 6 percent.
The increase in New York City unemployment can be traced to low levels of hiring by stores during the holiday season, and to layoffs by airlines and brokerage firms, said James P. Brown, an analyst for the Labor Department. 
"We're going to see some more of that going forward," Mr. Brown said, referring to the layoffs.
Companies in the city have already eliminated close to 175,000 jobs in the last two years, including 11,700 in December, according to the New York City Comptroller's Office, which adjusts Labor Department data to reflect seasonal factors.
Job losses in the fourth quarter of 2002 were not as severe as those in the fourth quarter of 2001, which included the immediate economic aftershocks of the attack on the World Trade Center, the comptroller's office said. 
But that period aside, the city lost more jobs in the last three months of 2002 than at any time since the recession that ended in 1992.
"The city's jobs recession has continued for a second straight year," William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, said in a statement.
He said that the city lost 1.2 percent of its payrolls in 2002, a drop six times as big as the national decline of 0.2 percent.
Some economists fear that when the final figures for 2002 are available, in March, New York City's employment losses will be even larger. The state revises the employment data each year to reflect new information about payrolls that is included in tax returns.
The city's economy is not expected to rebound any time soon, economists say, citing among other things the city's severe fiscal problems, which recently led to an 18.5 percent increase in property taxes.
"With the war in Iraq looming, along with the spike in oil prices, businesses should continue to put off hiring or investing in newer technologies," Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist for the newsletter The New York STAT, said in an e-mail message.
She continued, "As a result, New York City's employment numbers should continue to decline in the coming months."

 The guidelines, which are being published as part of a settlement of a lawsuit, are not compulsory, according to people involved, and doctors will be free to deviate from them. But Kaiser patients, and the public, will now have access to guidelines they can use to assess the treatment they are receiving. Page C3.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DISSENT; 
Some War Protesters Uneasy With Others

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
After a weekend of antiwar protests that many participants say signaled an expansion of public opposition to military action against Iraq, some organizers are facing criticism, much of it from within the movement, about the role played by their group, International Answer.
 Attendance at rallies in Washington and San Francisco last Saturday was in the tens of thousands, and reflected a mix of views that spanned the social and political spectrums. Many protest organizers say the presence of labor unions, religious groups, business people and soccer moms showed a growing mainstream opposition to the war. 
 But behind the scenes, some of the protesters have questioned whether the message of opposing war with Iraq is being tainted or at least diluted by other causes of International Answer, which sponsored both the Washington and San Francisco rallies. 
Answer, whose name stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, was formed a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, by activists who had already begun coming together to protest policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Some of the group's chief organizers are active in the Workers World Party, a radical Socialist group with roots in the Stalin-era Soviet Union. The party has taken positions that include defense of the Iraqi and North Korean governments and support for Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugolav president being tried on war crimes charges. 
The positions of some of Answer's members have caused rifts in past antiwar movements as well. In January 1991, at the onset of the Persian Gulf war, two coalitions of protesters marched separately, on consecutive weekends, because one refused to align itself with the other, whose members included current Answer officers who would not criticize the Iraqi government or support economic sanctions against it.
In an interview today, Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a spokeswoman for Answer, said questions raised about the group's role were "classic McCarthy-era Red-baiting." 
"When you select out the Socialists or Marxists," she said, "the point is to demonize and divide and diminish a massive, growing movement."
But Answer's critics say they simply wish that when it sponsors antiwar rallies, it would confine its message to opposition to war. At the rally in Washington, the group's speakers advocated causes like better treatment of American Indians and release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the radical activist long imprisoned for killing a Philadelphia police officer.
Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of the Jewish magazine Tikkun, which sent protesters to the rally despite concerns about pro-Palestinian speeches planned there, said: "There are good reasons to oppose the war, and Saddam. Still, it feels that we are being manipulated when subjected to mindless speeches and slogans whose knee-jerk anti-imperialism rarely articulates the deep reasons we should oppose corporate globalization."
Karen Guberman helped organize a small protest in her neighborhood in Northwest Washington last weekend, in part to provide an outlet for those who felt uncomfortable attending the Answer-sponsored rally. 
"I felt like it was important just to go and be counted," Ms. Guberman said, "but many of my friends felt they couldn't count on what was going to be said, and so we did this very specific thing."
In fact, some of the newer antiwar coalitions were formed precisely to create a forum for protesters with views different from Answer's. Leaders of those groups have carefully avoided criticizing Answer, for fear that doing so would undercut their movement.
Still, the more mainstream voices in the antiwar movement may be trying to focus the message. The next national rally is scheduled for Feb. 15 in New York, and it is being sponsored by United for Peace, a coalition of more than 120 groups, most of them less radical than Answer. 
Answer has signed on as a supporter of the New York rally, but it is not yet clear what role it will play in shaping the tone. Leslie Cogan, a coordinator with United for Peace, said her organization would welcome a wide variety of perspectives. But she added, "We want our speakers making a clear link to the issue." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a debate among antiwar demonstrators over the role of groups like International Answer, whose causes extend beyond its antiwar message, misspelled the surname of an organizer for United for Peace, who said her members welcomed a wide variety of perspectives from protesters at rallies. She is Leslie Cagan, not Cogan.

Glavine Changes Much More Than His Baseball Uniform

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: ALPHARETTA, Ga. 

 BODY:
Tom Glavine had everything he needed to be a good husband, a good father, a good pitcher and, please, do not forget this one, a good golfer, within his valuable fingertips right here. No need to move an inch. Wake up, brush your teeth, and, voila, Glavine's happy, successful life was as picturesque to him as a rainbow.
 He lives in a brick-faced palace with six white columns dotting the entrance like sentries. There is a basketball hoop and a hockey net beside the circular driveway. A wedding picture of his wife, Christine, is above the fireplace in his den. It gets noticed before the two Cy Young awards near it. He lives in a gated community on a golf course, which is crucial for someone obsessed enough to want to play in 35-degree weather last week. His mailbox is 27 miles from Turner Field, the home of the Atlanta Braves. 
 How could Glavine ever tamper with this perfect setting? He can drive two minutes to have lunch with Amber, his 8-year-old daughter from his first marriage, at school. He can play hockey with Jonathan, Christine's 8-year-old son from a previous marriage. He can melt as Peyton, his 3-year-old son, hands him a paper plate filled with pasta shapes and tells him, "I made it for you." He can smile as Mason, his 2-year-old son, cries because he is a 2-year-old. How do you even dream of abandoning any of these precious experiences?
But Glavine did. At least for a while each year. He chose to sign a three-year, $35 million contract with the Mets last December, leaving the team he had been with for 16 years and adding more uncertainty to a challenging family situation. At times, there will be no lunch dates, no hockey practices, no craft creations and no familiar wailing while Glavine is tossing changeups in Flushing.
"Did I feel a little bit guilty? No," Glavine said. "A lot guilty? Yeah. That's the thing I had the most difficult time with, getting over the guilt that I was adding to the chaos. If I just stayed in Atlanta, it's one less thing for my kids to worry about. I talked to my parents and my brother and sister about it. They all assured me that that wasn't the case."
Glavine, who turns 37 in March, and his second wife have two children together and each has joint custody of one child from a first marriage. He called it a "less than Brady Bunch-like existence," and his decision to relocate has seriously altered the delicate balancing act.
As Glavine sipped coffee at his desk last week, it was shocking that he actually sat still for over an hour. He had swum at the Y.M.C.A., visited Amber at school and was poised to play golf on a blustery day. All creature comforts. All things that will change a bit in New York. He only remained in his chair because his tee time was canceled.
"The course," Glavine said, "is frozen."
If Glavine had to pitch a few days after becoming a Met seven weeks ago, he wonders if he would have been mentally prepared for it. That is an interesting admission for a pitcher who normally shows as much emotion as a statue, but that is how wrenching it was to spit out a goodbye to Atlanta and to say hello to the Mets. Glavine wanted to stay, but he said the Braves were so indifferent in pursuing him that they helped make an agonizing decision easier. Until Glavine actually made it.
"You go through a checklist of emotions and what your life consisted of and how it's going to change," Glavine said. "You tend to focus on the changes you're going to feel the most. That's where I was stuck for a while."
He said he was content now, both excited and relieved about New York. His kids have picked their bedrooms in their new house in Greenwich, Conn., and told him how much they want to see the Statue of Liberty. They have retired their Braves shirts and giddily wear ones that say "Mets."
"It's kind of funny when you're in their element and you hear, 'Why is your Dad going to play for another team?' 'Well, he was mad at the Braves,' " Glavine said.
Glavine laughed as he recounted his eavesdropping. He was disappointed with the Braves, and he stresses how happy he is to be a Met and how flattered he is that Fred Wilpon, the owner, wants him to help change the image of the organization. He called his time in Atlanta a "wonderful ride." It included 11 division titles, a 1995 World Series championship, 242 victories and five 20-victory seasons. But the wonderful ride had an ugly ending.
"For me, I think there was assumption, being here as long as I've been and with my family situation, that there was no way I'd leave," Glavine said. "That assumption turned out to be wrong. There was a little bit of a lackadaisical approach to my free agency. There were things that went on far more than what happened in that last meeting that rubbed me the wrong way that were certainly part of it coming undone."
Glavine could not get the Braves to call him for more than two weeks as he was trying to figure out whether he should stay or go. He requested a meeting with Braves General Manager John Schuerholz and the team's president, Stan Kasten, in a late attempt to stay. A person familiar with the discussions said Glavine, in that meeting, told Atlanta the exact amount it would take to keep him. The Braves offered him a three-year, $30 million deal, but they wanted to defer a portion of the money, lowering the value of the offer.
"I think there's been a perception that I was offered something by the Braves that I wasn't offered," Glavine said. "It's kind of the old read-the-fine-print deal."
Two days after that contentious meeting, which lasted six hours, Glavine became a Met. Schuerholz and the Braves held an unusual news conference one day later to explain their attempts to sign him. Normally, the Braves do not comment on negotiations, but Schuerholz said they had unfairly been called unprofessional in their dealings with Glavine.
Schuerholz reiterated this week that the Braves had not been cavalier in their negotiations and that the organization had to balance what an older pitcher wanted against the changing economic climate in baseball, and in their organization. The Braves are under a mandate to keep their payroll at $93 million. Schuerholz said the Braves were not disrespectful toward Glavine and did what was best for them in navigating a difficult situation. 
"Ultimately, he took the larger contract," Schuerholz said. "He shouldn't be painted as an ogre for that. He took the bigger contract. There's nothing wrong with that."
So now he is a Met, and even in jeans and a tan sweater, the slender Glavine looks as if he is ready to throw an 84-mile-per-hour fastball on the corner. He has two framed Braves jerseys in his den, one with the number 200 on it for his 200th victory and another with 2,000 on it for his 2,000th strikeout.
Both are measurements of Glavine's ability, but to really know him, Glavine said, you must know his parents. His father, Fred, worked construction in Billerica, Mass., from the time he was 18 and eventually formed his own company. It was common for his father to get up at 4 a.m. and pour a foundation by 9 or 10 so he could attend one of his son's games. His mother, Mildred, was a school secretary and never thought it odd to leave a family vacation to drive her son home two hours to a Little League game.
Glavine's work ethic comes from them. As a scrawny 18-year-old, he was selected by the Braves in the second round of the baseball draft and was also drafted by the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings in the fourth round. Politely, Glavine said he could have played in the N.H.L.
Glavine's dedication comes from his parents, too. He was booed as a high-profile union representative in Atlanta -- for years he has been the National League's player spokesman -- but he ignored the verbal abuse and was more concerned about serving his teammates than winning a popularity contest.
Naturally, when Glavine confronted free agency, he leaned on his parents. They have been married 44 years, Glavine said proudly. He said his parents assured him that his kids would adjust and volunteered to visit often. Christine Glavine's parents live in Rhode Island and will also be frequent visitors. 
"To me, Tommy is such a good father, he'll make it work," Mildred Glavine said. "I don't think it'll make that big a difference. It might be more exciting." 
Precise planning has calmed Glavine, too, as he and Christine have devised schedules for where they will be every day this year. Mention May 30 or Aug. 12 and Glavine can tell you the lineup. There are Plan B's and C's as well. The X factor for them will be managing the periods in parts of April, May, August and September when the family will be apart. 
"I'll have days where I haven't seen one of them and I'll say, 'If I was home, I could do this or that,' " Glavine said. "But that's normal for everybody."
The easiest part will be the baseball, Glavine insisted. He walks, talks and acts like a leader, something the Mets desperately need. Teammates will learn by listening to him and watching him. Glavine has reminded himself that four years (if he triggers the contract option) in New York is a brief time in his children's lives. Even Christine conceded, "We needed a change." 
They have it. In New York, Glavine will still have everything he needs to be a good father, a good husband, a good pitcher and, yes, a good golfer. But not everything will be at his fingertips anymore. Certainly not during a few months each season. Still, to Glavine, the scene remains picturesque. It is just different.
"I think I made the right decision," Glavine said. "It's going to be fun. I think I'm going to go around with a pep in my step for the rest of my career. Like we heard in church that weekend before I signed, change is good. Change is a good thing."

BYLINE:  By David W. Chen (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 New Yorkers who are out of work will receive information on their next unemployment checks about another potential source of aid: emergency housing assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The FEMA program, which was established after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack, offers assistance to people who are facing eviction or foreclosure. Many people have only recently become aware of the program, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, above, a Manhattan Democrat, who urged the State Department of Labor to include the information on all checks. The program expires next Friday. David W. Chen (NYT)

HEADLINE: MY BROOKLYN; 
Landmark Towers, Still Loved and Lived In

BYLINE:  By WENDELL JAMIESON

 BODY:
The Tower Buildings and I first met when I was in the fifth grade at Brooklyn Friends School. This was the mid-1970's. My teacher, Victor Wagner, took the class on a long winter walk through Brooklyn Heights to Cobble Hill and halted our unruly two-by-two procession on Hicks Street, next to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. After some patient and not-so-patient quieting, Mr. Wagner -- in my memory he looks like the actor Abe Vigoda -- directed our eyes skyward.
 It was a fantastic sight to a 10-year-old: bright red brick walls cut at intervals by black cast-iron railings; semicircular stone stairwells you could see from the outside; pointed and square-topped towers spiking the sky. Mr. Wagner let us go, and we raced up those cold, echoing stairwells, a stampeding, shrieking, sweating, ascending army of private school kids. We flew down the breezeways, our arms puffed out in our unzipped parkas, dangling mittens attached, and peeked through the windows. The place seemed deserted, and a little scary. 
 Twenty years later, the buildings and I became reacquainted. During a frustrating apartment search, annoyed by real estate agents, I stopped at the rental office (the place didn't seem deserted anymore), and was soon climbing back up those worn stone steps, more slowly and more quietly, to the top floor, the sixth. It was tiring, but the one available apartment was a find: two bedrooms, two walk-in closets, a medium-size living-dining room, plenty of sunlight, $875 a month. And a view from the breezeway of the Statue of Liberty.
Never mind the other view from the breezeway, the one into our two front windows. My wife and I took it. In the five years we lived there, we never quite got used to our neighbors walking by and sometimes inadvertently glancing in. But we enjoyed another fringe benefit: the architecture classes that would gather in the courtyard, beneath the towering maple, the professor lecturing and pointing upward just as Mr. Wagner had.
Whenever I had a few minutes, I would stand at the back of the class and listen, and I learned that these buildings were one of the first experiments in socially engineered housing in New York City history, an affordable complex that gave urban workers in the late 19th century a measure of space, light, fresh air, security and, perhaps most important, dignity. They were not just special and mysterious to me, they were special to the city, and they had touched and improved the lives of thousands of people long before that motley class from Brooklyn Friends School came along.
They are now called the Cobble Hill Towers, but they were originally part of a complex called the Tower and Home Buildings. Since 1975, they have been owned by a man named Frank Farella, but he was aware of them long before that. In the 1940's, Mr. Farella and his family lived in Gravesend, Brooklyn, and went regularly to what was then known as South Brooklyn to see relatives. As they drove down Hicks Street, the youthful Frank would gaze from the back seat of his father's 1936 Plymouth. He, too, was taken by the latticelike iron railings, the pointed towers.
"I was always curious about it; they were so different than other buildings," Mr. Farella said recently, plenty of Gravesend still in his voice.
This portion of Hicks Street was a true commercial street back then, cobblestoned, not a service road running alongside the B.Q.E. The ground floors of the buildings, now enclosed with gates, were filled by small stores with matching striped awnings: a delicatessen, a candy store, a bakery, an office for a ship-cleaning company that serviced the big freighters docked a few blocks away.
As young Frank and his family drove by, they would have passed the home of a 12-year-old named Pat Drobney who lived with her father, mother and younger brother in a first-floor apartment. While the buildings may have seemed magical to a kid from Gravesend -- as they did to me, a kid from Park Slope, 30 years later -- they cast an even more enveloping spell on this young girl living in them.
Pat Drobney is now Pat Marren. She remembers scooting around the courtyard sprinkler in her bathing suit in summer and singing carols around a giant Christmas tree in winter. And she vividly recalls the complex's office, with its banklike counter where residents -- sanitation men, the owners of the deli, utility and shipyard workers, at least one priest -- would pay their rent at the beginning of the month. She can visualize this scene with remarkable clarity because that office was long ago turned into an apartment, and she lives in it now.
"Where I am sitting on the couch, there was an archway," she said. "And you used to pay your rent here, and we used to make cookies here. If you paid your rent early, you got 50 cents back, and at Christmas time you got a jar of jam."
There were a few gangs around -- Mrs. Marren remembers especially the Kane Street Midgets -- but the buildings were safe. She had friends on almost all the floors, but never ran noisily up the stairwells: "We weren't allowed, no way."
The family moved around from apartment to apartment, never leaving the complex. She married, and she and her husband moved to 14th Street in Brooklyn. For six months. Then they moved back.
In 1975, she met Frank Farella. He was then a small-time developer with several buildings around Brooklyn. "The guy from one of the oil companies I worked with told me about these buildings," he said. "He was servicing them, and his client wanted to sell. So I came down and I looked at them and I said, 'Well, this is an amazing property, but there are a lot of problems.' "
Of 244 apartments, nearly 100 were vacant; 11 had had fires and were boarded up. The courtyard was piled high with garbage. "You would walk into the courtyard, and you wouldn't know who's who," Mr. Farella said. "You'd find a gang of people in the corner who'd moved into a vacant apartment, squatters, undesirable people, dope peddlers, you name it. It was a mess over here." Not to mention visits by shrieking classes of fifth graders from Brooklyn Friends School.
The buildings had declined along with the fortunes of much of the Brooklyn waterfront. The oil crisis of the 70's made it nearly impossible to turn a profit from renting the apartments; the annual oil bill hit $80,000 (close to what it is today, 27 years later); tenants in rent-controlled apartments were paying as little as $44 or $60 a month.
Mr. Farella thought he could make a go of it. He made the deal on Oct. 31, 1975, and two days later met the tenants. They gathered at St. Peter's Church on Warren Street and welcomed him with hisses, curses and boos -- not only was the place a shambles, but there had been no heat or hot water for two weeks. He pleaded for patience but thought he would never get it until one elderly man shushed the angry crowd and suggested they give him a chance. That was Mrs. Marren's father, Joseph Drobney.
The empty oil tanks were filled, and Mr. Farella started making plans. But first, some research: "Everyone told me, this is a famous building," he recalled. "I said, 'Let me look it up and see what it is all about.' " So he went to the Brooklyn Historical Society, and that is where he learned of Alfred Tredway White.
The A.I.A. Guide to New York City (published by the American Institute of Architects) and the Encyclopedia of New York devote just a few paragraphs to White, but he was very important to those who have spent some or most of their lives in his greatest creation, even if they have never heard his name.
He was born in 1846 and as a young adult traveled regularly to London, where he was exposed to and intrigued by new affordable housing projects. He took the lessons home to Brooklyn, where, in 1876, he built the Home Buildings on the south side of Baltic Street, off Hicks. This was when Brooklyn was a city, and the bridge that bears its name was being built just a little more than a mile away.
The Home Buildings were really two structures, one on Hicks, one on Baltic. White next built the Tower Buildings -- three structures, one a block long -- across Baltic Street, on Hicks, as well as two lines of small brick row houses, which he called the Workingmen's Cottages.
The Tower Buildings are more elaborate than the Home Buildings, but the basic idea is the same: with the stairwells and the hallways on the outside, sunlight and air filled the front and back of the apartments, and the air kept moving, a change from tenements. Toilets and bathing facilities were in the basements. The courtyards were a haven for children to play in, away from the dangers of the filthy, packed-dirt streets crowded with rattling horse-drawn wagons.
"It was the first project in New York City, to my knowledge, that created a semipublic courtyard, a communal space," said Carmi Bee, a partner at Rothzeid Kaiserman Thomson & Bee Architects in Chelsea who teaches at the City College School of Architecture. He takes his classes regularly to White's project. The breezeways, he said, diminished privacy but eliminated depressing interior stairways, improved safety by putting more eyes on the street and "animated" the facades of the buildings. For children, he added, "they're like a jungle gym."
The little decorative details that White envisioned -- the repetitive patterns of bricks that look like miniature upside-down ziggurats, the bay windows, the arches over the doorways, the little tower with a base of tiles with wave designs -- engaged and intrigued the minds of the people who lived there, and made their lives better.
There were no housing programs or agencies in New York in White's time, but he was not just a do-gooder. His favorite saying, according to the A.I.A. Guide, was "philanthropy plus 5 percent" -- it was nice to help people, but it was nice to make a little money, too.
Mr. Farella saw that the man who had created the buildings 100 years earlier had given him a workable blueprint for refurbishing the complex. The restoration, designed by the architect Richard Henry Behr, began in 1978. The tenants played musical chairs: they were first moved out of the Home Buildings -- cold-water flats when Mrs. Marren was a child -- into vacant apartments in the Tower Buildings, and then moved back when their original places were done. Mr. Farella had to adhere to strict city guidelines because, he said, "it's a landmark situation."
It was impossible to install elevators. The biggest job was restoring the apartments to their original design: during World War II, with the waterfront economy booming and apartments near the docks in short supply, they had been subdivided, eliminating cross-ventilation. Mr. Farella brought the number of apartments down to 188, all with sunlight and air on both sides. 
In 1980, with all the other work done, the final elements were finished: the courtyards. "The most glorious day we had here was when we put the new lawn out," Mr. Farella said.
Today, he charges less than he can for the apartments, to keep a mix of people who he thinks contribute to the life of his buildings. Our rent was around $950 when we moved in 1999, and that was on the high end, a good deal less than some professionals living a block away in Cobble Hill's brownstones, paying $1,800 for a one-bedroom apartment. 
My wife and I shared the stairwells with retirees, nurses and interns from nearby Long Island College Hospital, freelance writers, an engineer for the city. We moved after we saw, from our breezeway, an interesting-looking condominium building being built on the other side of the B.Q.E. It took the movers all day to get our stuff down those narrow, semicircular stairs.
"The only reason people ever leave is the reason you did: they buy an apartment," Mr. Farella said. "Otherwise, we can't get rid of them."
These days, whenever I pass by the Tower and Home Buildings, I still gaze at all that iron and all those bricks. During the years I lived there, I never walked down Baltic Street without getting a frisson of pride as my home came into sight, lighted up like a Christmas tree at night. Then I would pass the windows that Pat Marren decorates for each holiday. Climbing those steps, sometimes two at a time, I wondered about the people who had come before, their boots slowly wearing down the stones.
And I took a million photographs: the view from the window in my walk-in closet, the wave tiles on that little tower, the pattern of the snow as it settled on the wrought-iron railings.
Alfred Tredway White was right: those little details really do make your life better.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Don't Worry, Honey. It's an Investment!

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN

 BODY:
LIKE the faithful at a revival meeting, the frenzied crowd swarmed toward the stage of the vast tent in the Arizona desert, checkbooks flapping like fans in the stifling heat.
 From the lectern, a perspiring man in blue blazer and tie bellowed into a microphone, exhorting the devotees to part with their dollars. A pack of assistants, similarly attired, roamed the edges of the throng, crooking fingers, arms sweeping the air as if they were orchestra conductors, eyebrows raised in supplication. Whenever anyone came close to surrender, the men in the blazers pounced. 
 "Go for it!" they yelled. "You can do it!" 
The religion here in the Scottsdale sands last week was cars -- rare ones, expensive ones, the kinds of machines that prompt gasps even from the converted. The occasion was the annual Barrett-Jackson auction, one of the largest of collectible-car events in the country, with some 700 automobiles on the block in four days. About 160,000 people passed through -- buyers, sellers, collectors, dealers and gawkers -- many of them fervent believers in the lasting power of vehicular art.
"You want what your dad had, or what you couldn't afford when you were in high school," said Gary Lindenmayer, an auto appraiser from Chandler, Ariz., who has owned about 75 cars and who carried in his wallet a photograph of one of his favorites, a pink-and-white 1955 Ford Crown Victoria. "People here are recreating memories."
Larry Cate did just that, ponying up $38,000 for a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro convertible touted as an Indianapolis 500 pace car, red decals on its doors. "Anyone who does this had better have an understanding wife," said Mr. Cate, who is from Annapolis, Md., and owns five other cars, four of them Corvettes.
"It could be worse," said his wife, Dana, sounding resigned. "It could be women, or drugs, or gambling."
Founded three decades ago, when it gained instant attention with the sale of a 1940 Mercedes 770K for $153,000, the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company's annual event in Scottsdale, a Phoenix suburb, has become a mecca for the motoring world, a place where the serious collector and the helpless voyeur stand side by side, trading talk of Weber carburetors, Low Kar shifters and other esoterica.
The atmosphere at the show last week was a far cry from the deadpan decorum at Christie's or Bonhams, both of which hold regular antique and classic-car auctions. Bidders and gawkers -- almost without exception male -- crowded the stage, often blocking the view of the gleaming metal and chrome while the auctioneers raced along, pushing through 200 cars a day.
Their rat-tat-tat babble got faster as the dollars climbed, and they paused only occasionally, to let a pitchman extol a car's virtues. Successful bids earned whoops, yells and ringing applause, as when a sky-blue Corvette, which went to its first owner in 1957 for $4,601, pushed the bidding to $92,000 before the gavel came down.
This year, many buyers seemed cautious, despite obvious temptations. Bidding for Reggie Jackson's 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/2 stalled at $340,000 -- he had wanted $500,000. Even the so-called star of the show, a 1957 Jaguar XKSS, one of only 16, failed to reach its $1.3 million reserve, the lowest price the owner would accept. 
Still, there were buyers for 637 of the 708 cars available, and they brought in $26.4 million, a respectable sum in a shaky economy. The figure is marginally less than last year's total, but nowhere near Barrett-Jackson's record year, 1990, when $37.3 million worth of cars were sold.
"They've had about a 30 percent increase in revenues since 1999, while the economy has been going the other way," said Keith Martin, the publisher of Sports Car Market magazine and a regular attendee. "So in spite of the economy, you still have a group of enthusiasts who can afford to spend big bucks on the fulfillment of a four-wheeled fantasy."
Overall, the collector car market has risen just about 10 percent in the last decade or so, Mr. Martin said, but only one segment of the market, American cars from the 50's, 60's and 70's, have experienced anything like a boom.
The highest prices paid last week at the Barrett-Jackson auction, which specializes in American cars from those three decades, were for a pair of 1967 Ford GT40 racecars -- one went for $347,760, the other for $318,600 -- and a 1966 Shelby Cobra 427 S/C, which went for $253,800.
But some of the bids needed help. A car from the actor Don Johnson's stable, a yellow 1970 Plymouth Barracuda that he drove in the television show "Nash Bridges," sold for a handsome $137,500 after the auctioneer, whipping up as much hysteria as he could muster, enlisted the help of Mr. Johnson himself, who had driven the car to its spot on stage, to sing its praises.
"That was about 100 percent over value," said Phil Hope, a Phoenix developer, as the auctioneer declared it sold. "It was dead at $100,000, and they really worked it. These guys are sophisticated, and they know how to get a couple of these bidders going against each other."
After watching a 1933 Ford C400 victoria, converted to a low-slung canary-yellow street rod, sell for $62,000, Michael Shelby, a son of Carroll Shelby, whose creations epitomized muscle cars three decades ago, said the price "didn't make a lot of sense." But he suggested that buying such cars might be a palliative in an uncertain economy. "Maybe these people need something to feel good about," he said.
At the height of the dot-com boom a few years ago, money poured into collectible cars, often bought by people too young to know much about what they were getting.
"The guys who made money in Internet stocks, they were buying four or five muscle cars at a time, paying $100,000 for a car that was worth $50,000 or $60,000," said Mr. Lindenmayer, the auto appraiser. "That drove the prices up. I like to see records broken, but the car had better justify the price."
Given the current state of Wall Street, bargain hunting was an eminently good idea, said Bill Mann, a vintage auto and truck dealer from Redwood City, Calif., who put down $45,500 for a white '57 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible. "It seemed pretty cheap," he said. "I lost as much in the last two days in the stock market as I just paid for that car."
But for car lovers, the fun and the spectacle at Barrett-Jackson may mean as much as the economics.
Richard Munz, a retired developer from Madison, Wis., who keeps 40 cars in a downtown garage back home, said he had been coming to the Barrett-Jackson auction for about 25 years. "You find the greatest cars in the world at this show," he said. "It's a happening."
He had stopped bidding for the star-of-the-show Jaguar at $925,000 (the auctioneer had started the bidding at $600,00, despite the $1.3 million reserve). "I can't let my emotions get carried away," Mr. Munz said. "There's a limit to everything."
For $80, any car lover could buy admission to all four days of the auction and could scour vendors' stands for high-quality jewelry, antique race car posters, vintage gas pumps and pedal cars, and life-size sculptures of American Indians on horseback. On the grounds surrounding the big tent, crowds trolled the columns of cars, reverentially peering inside, taking care not to scratch flawlessly painted fenders.
Inevitably, cars advertised with celebrity connections attracted hordes eager to get close to history: Jacqueline Kennedy's white 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, one of three lent to the White House by the Ford Motor Company; Howard Hughes's 1954 Chrysler New Yorker, equipped with an air purification system to keep out germs; a 1965 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III convertible owned first by Debbie Reynolds and later by Lucille Ball.
"All this is fantasy stuff for arrested adolescents," said Leo Brereton, a dealer in design drawings of prototype cars, as he looked around the bustling sea of car compulsives. "The American automobile is the vehicle people use to drive to the promised land. That's why they call them car nuts."

HEADLINE: Never Say Die In Indie Opera 

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE

 BODY:
A SPOTLIGHT clicks on and lights a cardboard sun. The seven-member chorus bursts into song as a singer costumed as a waiter slices oranges on the piano. The soprano enters with the tenor hidden beneath her skirt.
 Judith Barnes is rehearsing an opera at the Vertical Player Repertory, which happens to be in her apartment. 
 In a former factory in Brooklyn, in a room that used to be Ms. Barnes's sculpture studio before she got a degree in voice from Indiana University and returned to Brooklyn with the opera bug, Vertical Player Repertory is embarked on its fifth season. The high brick walls and tin ceiling have resonated with everything from Handel's "Alcina" to Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana." This week the room is full of the percussion sets, keyboards and hanging fabrics of the set of "The Dwarf," a new comic opera by Yoav Gal. (Final performances are tonight, tomorrow and Sunday.) 
It seems crowded now; it will be more so with an audience of 60 or so people for the performance, standing against the wall or sitting on cushions on the floor. Vertical Player Repertory is attracting an ever larger audience. At this rehearsal the piano is supplying all the music, which illustrates the humorous fairy tale quality of the story by giving its harmonies a sardonic twist. In performance there will be four instrumentalists. Mr. Gal had to reduce the orchestration from the original 25.
In small opera, everyone has to pitch in. The lead soprano is the stage director and created the sets. The composer is moonlighting as a costume designer. The opera is about a woman who goes around with her lover, a dwarf named Lingus, under her gown, and designing a bustle large enough to conceal Aram Tchobanian, the tenor who plays Lingus, seemed as much a source of pride to Mr. Gal as writing the piece itself. He watched anxiously as Ms. Barnes and Mr. Tchobanian tried it out for the first time.
"Am I waddling?" Ms. Barnes asked. "Maybe a little," said a chorus member. "I'll sashay," Ms. Barnes decided, suiting her actions to her words. Mr. Tchobanian shuffled along on his knees behind her, his toes peeping out beneath her gown. "Wear white socks," someone advised him.
Ask the man on the street to define opera and you're likely to get adjectives like grand, foreign, expensive. Ask a New York opera patron about opera beyond the Metropolitan and City Operas, and you might get a mention of the Amato Opera, the stalwart 107-seat theater on the Bowery that's been putting on tiny productions of classic operas since 1948. But none of these quite covers the broad spectrum of indie opera companies that produce fully staged opera around New York City in living rooms, church basements and city parks.
"Grand" hardly describes Ms. Barnes's Vertical Player Repertory, or Golden Fleece, a downtown outfit that has been presenting new opera on a shoestring for 30 years. But "small" doesn't really fit the New York Grand Opera, which plays Verdi in Central Park with a full-size orchestra. Or the Dicapo Opera, which has its own opera house (although with only 204 seats), a professional set and costume workshop, and an annual budget of $1.2 million.

Homemade to Professional
The range of opera companies in New York is astounding. The companies discussed here are only part of the picture. And that's not even counting troupes that present opera in concert: the Opera Orchestra of New York, Teatro Grattacielo, Pala Opera, New York Opera Forum and others.
The offerings run the gamut from the creatively homemade -- like "The Dwarf" -- to the crisply professional, like "Patience and Sarah" by Paula Kimper, a production by American Opera Projects that had a big success at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1998. Going to indie opera in New York can mean hearing the New York Grand Opera do Verdi in Central Park, embodying both opera's traditions and its stereotypes: bright, two-dimensional sets; elderly tenors in glossy wigs; big powerful music. It can mean sitting in a small space in the East Village for a sung one-woman version of Anne Frank's diary -- attic hideout, iron bedstead and all -- as conceived by Nancy Rhodes and the Encompass New Opera Theater. It can even mean taking in Beijing opera at the New Victory Theater, where the Qi Shu Fang Beijing Opera Company is presenting "The Women Generals" this weekend.
The only thing these groups really have in common is a devotion that keeps their directors working long hours for little or no pay year after year. In today's economy, it takes all the resources and energy they can muster just to stay afloat.
Why do it at all? "I wanted to maintain the freedom to satisfy my musical cravings," said Mimi Stern-Wolfe of the Downtown Chamber and Opera Players. Most directors echo her or Michael Capasso of the Dicapo Opera, who said succinctly, "A combination of passion and insanity."

Unusual Repertory
One of the biggest reasons for starting an opera company is that it lets you do the art you want the way you want. Whether they're conductors, composers, stage directors or singers, most founders of New York's small companies created them because they found no other outlets to do what they wanted.
For some, that was new or unusual repertory; for others, it may have been simply conducting. Vincent La Selva of the New York Grand Opera, a talented Verdi conductor, has somehow failed to establish a strong foothold in international opera; but his company got on the map and into the Guinness Book of World Records by presenting all 28 Verdi operas in chronological order. (It took eight years.)
Companies that present traditional repertory also see themselves as a training ground for opera careers. "We are in a sense on the precipice of the professional field," said Michael Spierman, a conductor who founded the Bronx Opera in 1967. (Its latest offering, Smetana's "Bartered Bride," finished its run last weekend.)
Mr. Spierman auditions young singers, many with experience in regional companies, and rehearses them exhaustively, paying them a small fee. "Professionals in the field come and see the shows," he said, "and often people are hired a few days off a production. We'll get a call saying, 'Who was that masked man, that bass-baritone; can I have a phone number?' "
Singers who appear with these companies hope that a Bronx or Amato Opera performance will be a step on the way to a promising career. The precedents are there: Mignon Dunn and Jon Frederic West sang with the Amato Opera; the Bronx Opera presented the tenor Neil Rosenshein and the conductor George Manahan, now the music director of the New York City Opera. And the Regina Opera in Bensonhurst had Dolora Zajick in "Cavalleria Rusticana" in 1980 and Mark Delavan in "The Merry Widow" in 1992. "They wouldn't have sung with us," said Fran Garber-Cohen, chairman of the Regina's board, if the troupe had not met a certain standard.
But these are exceptions. Very few people go on from these companies to truly big success. And there's certainly no guarantee of a review. If critics come at all, it tends to be for unusual repertory. So when Mr. Spierman takes the Bronx Opera to Manhattan, it's with the lesser known of his season's two operas. At Dicapo, too, it's the more uncommon fare that (sometimes) gets media attention.
With audiences, it's just the reverse. "Our subscriber base is very conservative," Mr. Capasso said. Many who subscribe to all four of the season's operas turn in their tickets for the one less known (or contemporary) work. (This ends up being to Dicapo's advantage, since it can resell the tickets to single-ticket buyers.) Even in Ms. Barnes's eclectic surroundings, which one might expect would draw venturesome souls, "Cavalleria Rusticana" brought in a larger audience.
Among the more traditional companies, one senses a certain jockeying for position: they're competing for singers, for reviews, for audiences for their own "Boheme." But among the companies devoted to contemporary work, the audience's conservatism helps create a sense of solidarity. "The more, the merrier," Ms. Rhodes said.
"These various companies are not competitive," said Richard Marshall, founder of the Center for Contemporary Opera. "They are willing to help each other, through sharing mailing lists or sharing promotion. We're trying to create a climate where people see these newer things all the time, so they aren't strange anymore."
To help foster this climate and a dialogue about creating new work, Opera America, the national service organization, is bringing together producers, patrons and artists in New York this March for four days of discussion and seeing new opera in the hope of encouraging new projects. Encompass, the Center for Contemporary Opera and American Opera Projects will all be involved. "Smaller companies are sometimes great laboratories for new works," said Mark Scorca, president of Opera America. "They're not bound by pressure to produce a subscription series, so they can give creative artists all the time they need."
Because major American companies have started producing more American opera, some smaller companies have changed their initial emphasis. Ms. Rhodes, for example, took up the banner of American opera with encouragement from Virgil Thomson. Encompass's first production, in 1975, was of his opera "The Mother of Us All." "He said, 'Nancy, I leave to you the mantle of American opera,' " Ms. Rhodes recalled.
Today, however, rather than producing extant American operas, she is concentrating on developing new work, which includes writing a libretto for a new opera with the composer Lior Navok.

Dreaming of Donations
Ms. Rhodes dreams of a more significant place for her company, starting with a home of its own. "If someone wrote me a check for $10 million, I know exactly how my theater would look," she said.
In the absence of such a donation, performance space is a problem. "The space ballet changes all the time in New York," said Lou Rodgers, founder of the Golden Fleece. Once a venue is discovered, prices rise, which put the Angel Orensanz Center for the Arts on the Lower East Side, where American Opera Projects used to perform, out of the company's reach.
And since the company books only one or two nights at a time, rather than a more lucrative long run, "theaters hate to get back to us," said Charles Jarden, the group's executive director, who had to scramble to find a theater for his new production, Deborah Drattell's "Marina: A Captive Spirit," which will be staged in May at the DR2 Theater in Union Square.
On the other hand, it was a performance space that inspired the founding of the Henry Street Chamber Opera (soon to be known as the Gotham Chamber Players). On seeing the Harry De Jur Playhouse, "our mission was clear," said Neal Goren, the company's music director: "To present distinguished productions of rarely heard intimate operatic masterpieces that were composed for spaces such as this."
By putting its whole budget into a single production, the company can attract more established performers, like the mezzo-soprano Beth Clayton, who will take the title role in the next production, "Die Schwarze Spinne," or "The Black Widow" by Heinrich Sutermeister, a Swiss composer. The company had a critical success in November with its last production, a double bill of one-act operas, "The Forest's Voice" and "The Knife's Tears," by Bohuslav Martinu. 

Renting Out Space
And for Dicapo, performance space is a significant source of revenue. Having created its theater in a church basement in 1995, the company now makes good money renting it out. Dicapo, of course, has both lights and piano; but there's one piece of equipment a traditional opera company doesn't need. "They come in and ask, 'Where's your sound system?' " Mr. Capasso said. "And we say, 'We don't have one.' "
In the matter of resources, today's weak economy isn't helping anyone. Heavily dependent on government support, particularly the New York State Council on the Arts and the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, many opera companies are waiting nervously to hear the details of next year's budget cuts. "The wonderful thing about being somewhat small is that we don't have too many people we have to lay off," said Jonathan Levi, co-founder of the Nine Circles Chamber Theater, whose "Art of the Fugitive" was given last week at the 92d Street Y.
Mr. Levi, at least, has a day job; he's the director of the Fisher Center at Bard College, a performing-arts complex that will open this spring in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Not everyone is in such a privileged financial position.
"It's a piece of the puzzle," Mr. Jarden said of his salary from American Opera Projects. That is the core of the income he assembles, as most freelancers do, from several sources: sitting on grant panels, for example. Some company directors -- Ms. Rhodes, Mr. Spierman, Mr. La Selva and others -- have teaching jobs. Some are married to people with more regular incomes. And some have recently lost their day jobs, like Jay Meetze, the founder of the Opera Company of Brooklyn: budget cuts eliminated his post as a music teacher in a New York City school.

Financial Risks
Mr. Meetze, a conductor, knows all about the financial travails of producing opera. When he founded his company in 2000, his mandate was to perform fully staged, high-quality opera productions. Within two seasons he had a $40,000 deficit.
Mr. Meetze contacted all the singers he knew, asking if any of them were preparing roles for out-of-town engagements that they'd like to try out in public (for no fee) first. "So many people responded," he said, "that I ended up with nine operas."
This season he's presenting two performances of each, in concert, with piano accompaniment -- one for a paying public, one in a city school -- around New York. He has also set up a mentoring program, matching eight singers to eight students at the Young Women's Leadership School. This summer those students will form the chorus when Mr. Meetze produces all nine of the season's operas, this time with chamber orchestra, as the New York City Summer Opera Festival.
Meanwhile, Mr. Meetze beefed up his board to nine members, and they're embarking on a $500,000 capital campaign. Next season he plans to offer staged opera again: 10 productions culminating in a second summer festival.
For most people who found small opera companies, the company turns out to be an end in itself. But the size of the company doesn't reflect the size of the dreams -- whether you've been at it three years, like Mr. Meetze, or almost 30, like Ms. Rhodes. "Jimmy is loosening his reins up there because of his many responsibilities," Mr. Meetze said of James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera. "Down the road, when I have more experience, I wouldn't mind taking that over."

HEADLINE: Berlin Journal; 
Starved for Cash and With 3 Opera Houses to Feed

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Wielding flowcharts like a rapier and his ledger book like a shield, Thilo Sarrazin was ready for the first round of wage negotiations with Germany's largest labor union.
 Mr. Sarrazin is the top financial official in Berlin, a city of soaring ambitions that have fallen to earth in recent years. The restored German capital, he never tires of noting, is buried under debt -- in fact, it should have gone bankrupt years ago. 
 It is Mr. Sarrazin's job to tell Berliners that they can no longer afford their state-subsidized luxuries: three opera houses, two zoos and 150,000 city workers where 100,000 would do.
Berlin is demanding that the union's rank and file accept a four-year wage freeze. The union, having extracted a much richer deal from the federal government, says Berlin's penury should not be passed on to its garbage collectors, kindergarten teachers and bus conductors.
There is talk of a strike in February. 
"So what?" said Mr. Sarrazin, as he shut his briefcase and headed for battle. "If they go on strike, I'll save a lot of money."
By day's end, the negotiations had collapsed.
Berlin was in trouble even before the German economy ran out of steam, hobbled by grandiose building projects, a stunted industrial base and a bloated public sector. Red ink was tolerated at first as a legacy of Germany's reunification, later as the price of having a proper capital after decades of the West being ruled from cozy, provincial Bonn and the East from only eastern Berlin.
But the economic malaise has turned the city's finances from red to angry purple. With public debt of $49 billion -- projected to rise to more than $60 billion by 2006 -- Berlin resembles not so much the New York City of 1975 but a debt-ridden Latin American country of today.
On a per capita basis, said Mr. Sarrazin, Berlin's debt is more than double that of Argentina.
"I say it as a joke, but with a purpose," he said.
Last November, Berlin appealed to the federal government for help. But the finance minister, Hans Eichel, has his own troubles. The European Union recently scolded Germany for running too high a budget deficit. So he said no.
Yet people here still expect the German government ultimately to bail out Berlin, even if the city has to go to court.
That makes Mr. Sarrazin a lonely crusader for spending cuts. He brandishes charts that show Berlin's debt spiking upward in an ugly zigzag. But they have little impact.
"This system cannot be reformed," said Markus C. Kerber, an expert on municipal finance at the Technical University of Berlin. "You've got a combination of West Berlin socialism and East Berlin Communism."
In the fall of 2002, Berlin throbbed with rumors that budget cuts would force a merger or the closing of one of its three opera houses. After fierce lobbying, the city agreed to leave all three open, but cut their financing.
Among prominent cultural institutions, only the Berlin Philharmonic has raised money aggressively from private sources. Nor are Berliners willing to shoulder a greater burden in supporting culture.
"Berlin has a very sophisticated audience, but no one wants to pay for extremely expensive tickets," said Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, former general manager of the Philharmonic.
Few places symbolize Berlin's financial plight better than the Palace of the Republic, a monstrous pile erected by the East German Communists. Parliament voted in the summer of 2002 to tear down the building and rebuild the Prussian king's palace, which once stood on the site. With no money for construction, it continues to blight the city center. 
Berlin is not the only German city in a financial hole. Hamburg and Munich face budget cuts and mushrooming debt. In Frankfurt, the once-wealthy financial hub, tax revenue from companies has plummeted by more than $400 million since 2000. 
But Berlin's problem is more basic, said the mayor of Frankfurt, Petra Roth. To establish a self-supporting local economy, Berlin needs to develop an industrial base and an international profile.
"Germany should have a powerful, wealthy and vivid capital city," Ms. Roth said. "It needs to attract a lot of institutions, like the European Central Bank." Lest anybody get the wrong idea, she added, "My job as mayor of Frankfurt is to make sure it doesn't get them."

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Rise; Economic Indicators Improve 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 18,000 last week, the Labor Department reported today. But a prominent gauge of economic activity by an industry research group was more promising.
 The group, the Conference Board, reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose by 0.1 percent in December, to 111.3, lending support to the view that the economy would perform better this year than last. While the increase was small, it was the third consecutive gain and followed advances of 0.5 percent in November and 0.2 percent in October. 
 The Conference Board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said the series of positive readings suggested "that the economy might turn in a better performance in the first quarter of 2003 than it did in the second half of last year."
The Labor Department, though, reported that the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 381,000 last week, up from a revised figure of 363,000 the previous week. Economists had been predicting a rise in jobless claims, given that claims declined by an unexpectedly large 30,000 the previous week.
The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which helps to smooth out weekly variations, ebbed last week to 386,500, from 388,500 the week before, reaching the lowest level since late November.
The Labor Department reported early this month that the nation's jobless rate remained at an eight-year high of 6 percent in December. Some analysts are predicting that the unemployment rate will reach a high around 6.5 percent in early summer before an expected period of economic growth generates jobs.
Labor Department economists cautioned that this week's 18,000 increase in jobless claims could be revised significantly next week because it was based on more estimates than usual because the holiday on Monday provided less time to collect data.

PERSON: Marvin Bower 

HEADLINE: Marvin Bower, 99; Built McKinsey & Co. 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Marvin Bower, whose leadership of McKinsey & Company turned the business of selling management advice into a keystone of American corporate culture, died on Wednesday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 99.
 McKinsey was a small engineering and accounting firm in Chicago in the 1930's when Mr. Bower, abandoning his Cleveland law practice, went to work there. In the decades that followed, he helped McKinsey -- and through McKinsey the entire management consulting field -- to grow beyond the skepticism of those who called it a racket and into a serious and substantive industry. 
 Today, McKinsey advises 100 of the world's 150 biggest companies. Business Week magazine in 1987 termed Mr. Bower and Edwin B. Booz, founder of Booz Allen Hamilton, the two people most responsible for the growth of management consulting after World War II.
Jack Sweeney, editor in chief of Consulting Magazine, said business historians routinely hail Mr. Bower as "the father of the consulting profession."
Mr. Bower has been credited with taking a fledgling industry and setting its course not only as to the kinds of services it could sell but also the standards it must uphold for its work to be respected.
He displayed something of a passion for niceties. He insisted that McKinsey be called a firm, never a company. Jobs were engagements and the firm had a practice, not a business. Employees for many years were required to wear hats.
Mr. Bower's approach, beginning with common sense, was supercharged with the input of the brightest graduates of Harvard Business School, whom he preferred to long-serving executives. McKinsey's business grew beyond giving advice on far-reaching corporate reorganizations to the likes of General Motors and General Electric, in time advising Germany on how to rebuild the economy after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A current assignment is advising United Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy protection, on how best to restructure its service and fares to remain competitive.
Mr. Bower stressed integrity. Consultants, he maintained, must always put the interests of a client ahead of McKinsey's own revenue. They were to do only work that was necessary and that they could do well.
He had the title of managing director from 1950 to 1967, and stayed on for many more years. In 1993, at the last of a series of retirement dinners, a colleague, Jack Crowley, recalled a meeting in which the head of the client company bellowed argumentatively. Mr. Bower told the executive that his company's problem was its top leadership.
"There was deathly silence," Mr. Crowley said. "It happened to be totally accurate. That was the end of our work with that client, but it didn't bother Marvin."
Mr. Bower was born in Cincinnati on Aug. 1, 1903, and grew up in Cleveland, where his family moved when he was a child. He went to public schools there and graduated from Brown University in 1925.
At that time, he had no fixed idea of how he wanted to make a living. His father, who was deputy recorder of Cuyahoga County, persuaded him to study law.
In 1927, he married the former Helen M. McLaughlin, who worked to help him through Harvard Law School and then Harvard Business School. She died in 1985, and Mr. Bower married Clothilde de Veze Stewart three years later. She died in 1999, as did Mr. Bower's son Peter. 
After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1930, Mr. Bower was hired by the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Cleveland. The firm assigned him to serve as secretary of a number of committees of the bondholders of troubled companies.
"No one asked why these companies failed -- or how much earning power the new bonds could support," Mr. Bower said in an interview with MBA magazine quoted in Investor's Business Daily in 2000.
In 1933, he secured an interview with James O. McKinsey, a former University of Chicago professor who had started a firm of accountants and engineers in 1926. He liked Mr. Bower's ideas about a professional management firm and offered him a job.
In 1937, when Mr. McKinsey died of pneumonia at 48, Mr. Bower and another senior partner, A. T. Kearney, disagreed over how to run the firm. Mr. Kearney kept the Chicago office and eventually named it after himself -- A. T. Kearney & Company. Mr. Bower named the New York firm for his departed partner.
He persuaded his colleagues not to follow other consulting firms' lead in selling themselves to other companies or public shareholders. His strongest argument was made by example: he sold his own shares back to the firm at book value when he turned 60 -- far less than he could have received on the open market. In essence, Mr. Bower considered McKinsey too good to sell.
"Would the Vatican go public?" asked Forbes magazine in an article about McKinsey in 1987. "The First Marine Division?"
Not that Mr. Bower did not embrace change. In the early 1960's, he recognized that offices had become less formal. So he showed up for work without a hat, becoming the first to break his own rule.
Mr. Bower is survived by his sons Richard, of Bronxville, N.Y., and James, of Providence, R.I.; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Role in the World Dominates Economic Talks as Brazilian Clamors to Be Heard 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
In private banter and public pronouncements, the United States today dominated the first day of the World Economic Forum here. But it sometimes seemed as if the politicians and captains of industry meeting here were talking about two totally different countries.
 There is the United States that is massing for war -- a superpower feared and resented in many parts of the world, to judge by the mood in this Alpine village-turned-talk-shop. But there is also the United States with an economic engine on which the world is depending to regain its prosperity. 
 Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia was loudly applauded after he noted that public sentiment around the world had turned sharply against the United States over its handling of Iraq.
"You cannot trust someone who says, 'You will go along with other people, but if they don't want to follow, you will go on your own,' " said Dr. Mahathir, who was once one of the staunchest supporters among Muslim leaders of the Bush administration's campaign against terrorism.
"The level of trust has diminished somewhat," he said. "And lately, I think it has reached a very low level indeed."
In a later interview, Dr. Mahathir contended that "the whole world" rejects a possible war in Iraq. He said the Bush administration's apparent determination to "go it alone" if the United Nations did not mandate military action had eroded most of the good will built up by the United States overseas.
"In many instances, people express a dislike for America, maybe to some degree, you may call it hate," he said.
But Malaysia has thrived in part because of American-built semiconductor factories and other investments. The chairman of DuPont, Charles O. Holliday Jr., who sat on a panel with Dr. Mahathir, pointedly reminded him that Mr. Holliday's chemical company had a plant there.
The importance of the United States to the global economy, whatever its politics, was a recurring theme here. Several economists and businessmen said Europe and Asia would remain in the doldrums as long as a recovery in the United States did not gain momentum. 
"There are no other engines," said Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1999. "Japan will take longer to recover from the downturn than the U.S. has. And the rise of the euro will dent exports in Europe, which is the only strong part of their economies."
Professor Mundell worries that the United States will not rebound powerfully enough to pull the world with it.
"We'll keep going along sluggishly, but that's not enough for the U.S. to be the motor of the global economy," he said.
The prospect of a war further complicates matters. Oddly, given its prominence in political discussions, the potential effect of an Iraq war on the global economy figured relatively little in the day's panels.
Some economists said this reflected the difficulty of calculating how such an unpredictable event would affect oil prices, markets and the confidence of consumers. But a few tried anyway.
"If oil goes to $38 or $40 a barrel, we'll have another recession," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "If an economy is growing vigorously, it can withstand a shock. If it is barely growing, the shock can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."
In his rounds today, Mr. Roach said he heard little discussion about how other countries could contribute to global growth. The role of the United States as a prime mover, he said, seems to be taken for granted.
"The U.S. gets criticized for behaving unilaterally," he added. "That's fine, but if you have any better answers, let's hear them."
The isolation of the United States seemed starkest during Dr. Mahathir's remarks. To some extent, he was playing a traditional role of provocateur. In 1999, he raised eyebrows by discussing how a cabal of Jewish financiers, led by George Soros, had ruined Malaysia's economy.
This time, however, his message resonated with the audience, which applauded him like an elder statesman.
Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, gamely argued the White House's position. But even he conceded that the United States had not done a good job of explaining its goals to the world.
The former archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. George Carey, seemed to speak for many here, saying, "I would be profoundly concerned if my country was so disdained in some parts of the world."

HEADLINE: Grupo Mexico Faces Debt And Striking Copper Miners 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Grupo Mexico thought it was seizing its big chance to step up into the ranks of the giant multinationals, a rare feat for a Mexican company, when it bought an American rival, Asarco, in October 1999.
 The deal made Grupo Mexico the third-largest copper producer in the world -- but at a terrible moment, when copper prices were falling into a deep slump; they have still not recovered. The company has yet to find a way to make its big deal pay off, and has meanwhile been hit from other directions as well -- environmental problems in America, trouble refinancing its $2.8 billion in debts, and labor strife at home. 
 Some 1,200 miners at its Cananea mine, about 30 miles south of the Arizona border, walked off the job this week, demanding a raise of 5.25 percent that they say they have been owed since last year, plus productivity bonuses. 
The Mexican government stepped in late today to mediate between the company and the union, while a labor court considers whether the strike is legal and whether the company violated the current contract. A ruling could come as soon as Monday.
"The company has always been very reluctant to negotiate," said Juan Escamilla Ortega, an official of the National Miners' and Metalworkers' Union. 
Indeed, the company has taken a hard line, threatening on Tuesday to close the Cananea mine, which produces 150,000 tons of copper a year, if the workers stayed out. News of the threat helped push Grade 1 copper for March delivery up to 77.3 cents a pound in New York trading, the highest in six months; it retreated slightly to 77 cents a pound today. 
The company made a similar threat when workers struck for a week last June, and prices spiked then, too, topping 80 cents a pound. That strike ended with a pay agreement, but other issues remained unsettled, and they now figure in the new strike.
The company has continued to invest in the mine, which is more than a century old. A bloody 1906 strike at the mine, then American-owned, made Cananea an enduring symbol for the Mexican labor movement. 
"Over time, a series of strikes is not positive for morale," said Joe Bormann, Latin America credit analyst at Fitch Ratings in Chicago.
Juan Rebolledo, Grupo Mexico's vice president for international affairs, said in an interview today that "in the right conditions, Cananea could produce well." But Cananea's miners are already the highest paid in Mexico, he said, and the cost to produce a pound of copper at the mine is now higher than the selling price of the copper. "The specific conditions are bad," he said of the mine's current economics. "If you add to that very intense labor activism, then you have a problem."
Even when prices shoot up in response to labor problems or other disruptions, though, they remain much lower than Grupo Mexico was counting on when it bought Asarco for $1.2 billion; it also assumed $1 billion in debts. 
Many analysts thought at the time that Grupo Mexico's chief executive, German Larrea, was taking a smart calculated risk, gambling on his company's proven cost-cutting acumen to turn Asarco around. And they applauded the prize that came with Asarco -- a 54 percent stake in Southern Peru Copper, one of the world's lowest-cost producers.
"The whole trouble for Grupo Mexico is related to the fact that the copper industry is downtrodden," Mr. Bormann said. "Since the acquisition, copper prices have hovered around 71 or 72 cents, which has made it difficult for them to ever generate the cash to repay debt." Through much of the 1990's, Grade 1 copper sold for more than $1 a pound. 
Aside from the strike, debt repayment is the company's most pressing problem. The Asarco unit faces a Jan. 31 deadline for payment on a $450 million syndicated loan, and a $100 million bond issue coming due shortly thereafter. Grupo Mexico wants to finance these payments by having Asarco sell the Southern Peru stake to another of Grupo Mexico subsidiaries.
But the United States Department of Justice objected, and filed suit to stop the sale. The deal, officials said, would strip Asarco of its most valuable asset, one it needs to be able to avoid bankruptcy as it faces hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental cleanup costs at closed sites in the United States. 
Mr. Rebolledo said the company was making progress on settling the dispute. "We are optimistic that everything will fall into place at the right time," he said.
Even if the details of the Southern Peru sale can be sorted out, though, Asarco must still reach a settlement with American regulators over the cleanup costs. One analyst, Tom Meyer of UBS Warburg, thinks the total cost may come to $700 million or more if Asarco is found to be fully responsible at all the sites; an Asarco spokesman, Clay Allen, said that figure was "significantly higher than our estimates." 
Grupo Mexico itself is close to completing a deal to reschedule some $875 million in debts at its Mexican mining operations, but that will buy the company just a bit of breathing room, according to Mr. Bormann, the Fitch credit analyst. It is no substitute for what the company needs most: a sustained rally in copper prices.

For Apartment Prices, It Wasn't That Bad a Year

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Resilient even in hard times, the average price for an apartment in most of Manhattan slipped only 3.4 percent last year, to $819,975, according to one major market survey. It had been $849,118 in 2001, a year in which the average price hit a historic high before being buffeted by the World Trade Center attack and the recession.
 And while the market did turn sluggish during the fourth quarter -- coming off a spring and summer during which the average price had rebounded 7.7 percent, from $788,256 in the first quarter to $849,013 in the third -- it still ended 2002 with a 15.7 percent increase in closed transactions, according to the Insignia Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report. Sales volume climbed to 9,093 last year from 7,858 in 2001. 
 Demand for small apartments and a slackening in the luxury market played an important role in lowering the overall average price.
Those findings were, in general, corroborated by a survey conducted by the Corcoran Group, indicating that the average price for Manhattan co-ops increased slightly last year (0.4 percent), to $700,000 from $697,000 in 2001, while the average for condominiums slipped a bit (3 percent), to $1,037,000 from $1,069,000. At the same time, sales volume in both categories rose more than 15 percent.
Given the recession and the attack, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the Elliman report, "we're moving sideways, which I think is pretty amazing."
Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said: "The market showed continued strength in certain segments, particularly studios, one- and two-bedrooms, while in the fourth quarter downward pricing pressure surfaced in the three- and four-bedroom market. But, over all, volume is outpacing expectations."
The Elliman report is based on 9,093 sales from Battery Park to West 116th Street and East 96th Street. That represents 85 percent of the market, Mr. Miller estimated.
With $819,975 the average for all apartments, the report found that studio prices jumped 24.8 percent last year, to $284,802 from $228,135; one-bedrooms increased 4.4 percent, to $429,840 from $411,633; and two-bedrooms rose 4.6 percent, to $1,001,708 from $957,805. The three-bedroom category experienced a 7 percent decline, to $2,523,248 from $2,714,216, and for four or more bedrooms there was a 16.6 percent decline, to $4,813,554 from $5,771,554.
Manhattan's price per square foot rose 2.7 percent last year, to $633 from $616, Mr. Miller said, and the average size of all apartments that sold declined 6.1 percent. "That means that a portion of the drop in the average price was directly attributable to the reduction in the size of those apartments that transferred," he said.
The historic high for Manhattan's average price, $894,617, was recorded in the second quarter of 2001. "That's when the market stalled because we were edging toward recession," Mr. Miller said. "The average price dropped to $849,194 in the third quarter of 2001, which included 20 days of post-9/11 when we had market paralysis."
The Corcoran report calculated co-op and condominium statistics separately.
With the average co-op price of $700,000 "virtually unchanged" from $697,000 in 2001, Ms. Liebman said, the average studio price was $218,000, up 6 percent from $205,000. For one-bedrooms the average was $400,000, up 8 percent from $372,000. The two-bedroom category rose 6 percent, to $854,000 from $802,000, and the average for three-bedrooms was $2,117,000, a 7 percent drop from $2,279,000.
In the condominium sector, with a marketwide average of $1,037,000, the average for studios was $332,000, up 12 percent from $296,000 in 2001. For one-bedrooms, it was $529,000, up 1 percent from $526,000. In the two-bedroom category, the average was $1,110,0000, up 6 percent from $1,049,000, and for three-bedrooms it was $2,330,000, down 5 percent from $2,462,000.
The Corcoran report, based on sales below East 96th Street and West 125th Street, recorded 4,488 co-op transactions in 2002, up 15.9 percent from 3,871 in 2001, and 2,528 condominium sales, a 15.1 percent increase from 2,196.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE FIREFIGHTERS; 
Oil Teams Recall Kuwait And Fear Iraq May Be Worse

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: ELK CITY, Okla., Jan. 21 

 BODY:
On a scrap of windswept prairie 7,000 miles from the Persian Gulf, in a small office where two stag trophies gaze down from the walls, Ronnie Roles is preparing for an American invasion of Iraq.
 Mr. Roles is president of operations for Cudd Pressure Control, one of the three American companies that extinguished hundreds of oil well fires in Kuwait after the Persian Gulf war and have lately been in touch with the Pentagon about similar service in Iraq. 
 Like his counterparts at the other companies, Boots & Coots International Well Control and Wild Well Control, Mr. Roles is making sure that men and equipment in the United States and around the world can be sent to Iraq at a moment's notice. Bush administration officials and oil industry executives now worry that Saddam Hussein could similarly torch Iraq's oil fields if the United States attacks, just as retreating Iraqi troops blew up 700 of Kuwait's 1,000 oil wells in 1991, sinking the country into a months-long night of roiling fires and black skies. 
For all their experience in such danger, the firefighting companies say Iraq could pose extraordinary new challenges. No one in the industry has worked on oil wells tainted by chemical or biological weapons. No one wants to enter booby-trapped fields. And no one is quite sure who will pay for salvaging Iraq's vast oil reserves, the second largest in the world after Saudi Arabia's.
"Initially, the problems would probably be the same as in Kuwait," Mr. Roles said, "whether there are working airports, or water nearby to fight the fires. But with the fields there in Saddam's backyard, will he cause more problems with things like mines at the wells?"
A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Dan Heplage, declined to comment on any contact with oil firefighting companies, saying the Defense Department did not discuss contingency plans or talks with private companies unless a contract is signed. "But it is part of our job to be ready for different situations," he added. 
The Bush administration says that restoring Iraq's oil production is paramount to the United States' long-term interests in the country and the Middle East. Revenue from oil exports would be crucial to reviving the economy if Mr. Hussein is ousted, and a healthy economy, in turn, would shore up political stability. So if Iraq's oil industry were damaged -- a possibility very much on the minds of American military planners -- companies that battle fires would need to get to the fields fast to limit the destruction.
"It's not unimaginable that the war effort would still be going on while we're in there," said Jerry L. Winchester, the president and chief operating officer of Boots & Coots, based in Houston.
Oil field firefighters make no secret of the thrill they get from walking into danger. Though the legendary Red Adair is no longer in business, the men who run this generation of companies are all his proteges. They are the rock stars in an industry that has become increasingly tame, high-tech and climate controlled. Yet there are fewer fires and blowouts than there used to be. Of the 40 to 60 emergencies that Wild Well Control handles every year, only about 6 of them rage into fires, its chief executive, Pat Campbell, said.
Kuwait turned out to be like nothing the companies had ever seen, and Iraq could be worse, executives said. When Iraq invaded, Kuwaiti oil executives who had fled into exile and Western well-control companies were able to work together in anticipation of the sabotage of Kuwaiti fields. Those Kuwaitis who stayed in their occupied country reported back to their old bosses that the Iraqis were placing explosives on the wells, Mr. Campbell recalled. The executives and the Westerners thought Mr. Hussein might damage a couple of hundred wells at most. 
In March 1991, when the first teams of firefighters arrived, they thought they had walked into a version of hell, Mr. Winchester said. "You're used to pulling up to a location and seeing one well on fire, not 80, and you know there's another 80 out there and a few hundred behind those."
The fires roared louder than jet engines. Smoke blotted out the sky. Oil pooled in lakes in the desert. Allied forces had bombed the Iraqi troops in the Kuwaiti fields, leaving behind thousands of unexploded cluster bombs that were quickly camouflaged in shifting sands. Escaping troops seized the earth-moving equipment the firefighters would need to control the wells. And there was little water to use.
Experts initially estimated that it would take four or five years to extinguish the fires. Instead, the job was completed in nine months. The firefighting companies, executives said, had some good luck and a great deal of help -- both of which could be hard to find in Iraq.
Iraq's fields are all over a sprawling country, Mr. Campbell said, with some in the swampy south or the mountainous north, where it may prove hard to ship the huge equipment needed. Kuwait's flat desert terrain made shipments relatively easy. 
As prolific as some Kuwaiti wells are, there are Iraqi wells that produce more oil. If they were blown up, they might be harder to control, and the oil spills from them more difficult to contain. "That's a big environmental nightmare," said Bill Mahler, marketing manager at Wild Well Control. 
Firefighters do not expect help from Iraqi oil officials. The Kuwaitis piped in water from the sea that the firefighters used to put down the flames. But many Iraqi fields are far from rivers and lakes; it is unclear where water would come from.
The Kuwaiti military, along with Allied forces, helped clear ordnance and debris, but the well-control companies are keenly aware that if they go to Iraq, they may well encounter great hostility toward Americans.
They have worked in dangerous places before. Mr. Roles recounted how the military in Algeria always accompanied his men to damaged wells in the 1990's, at the height of the country's vicious if low-grade civil conflict. But no one welcomes another layer of danger beyond what there already is at the wells, executives said.
"Our conversations with the government on this are very brief," Mr. Campbell said. "We say, 'Make it safe, and we'll be there.' And they say, 'We will.' But I haven't lasted in this business 30 years because I believe what some guy in an office says."
The Kuwaiti mission was very lucrative for well-control companies, Mr. Winchester said. The industry is unsure who will pay to repair the Iraqi oil fields -- the United States government, the United Nations or the Iraqis themselves once their fields were operational again. 
"I don't know, and I don't know if anyone else knows yet," Mr. Roles said. "The government hasn't volunteered and said, 'We'll pick up the bill.' "
And there remains the slight hope that Iraqi troops, while ready to destroy their neighbor's riches, would balk at destroying their own. "Saddam might blow up his own wells if he felt he had nothing left to lose, but the Iraqis themselves might not do that if they feel he is on his way out," Mr. Campbell said. "That should be everyone's hope. But for thinking that all that could not, should not happen, after standing in the middle of the fires in Kuwait, I can't really say, 'Never.' "

Europeans Try to Stem Anti-U.S. Anger

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Cool down in Washington and calm down at home was the advice from Europe after continental tempers detonated over Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's dismissal of France and Germany as "old Europe" because they are trying to avert a war with Iraq. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld's comments to foreign reporters in Washington on Wednesday outraged both European politicians and ordinary citizens, who took the remark as example of America's growing arrogance. 
 "The only answer is, 'cool down,' " the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said today in Istanbul when asked for his reaction. 
President Jacques Chirac of France, visiting Berlin, counseled composure after members of his government took to the airwaves to denounce the American defense secretary. Mr. Chirac's spokeswoman said the French president wanted the debate to "take place with seriousness and calmness." 
The trans-Atlantic catfight raised Europe's already elevated anti-American sentiment another notch. Washington "continues to want to govern the world alone and more and more without rules," Martine Aubry, a Socialist leader and influential former labor minister, told France's RTL radio. 
France and Germany's opposition have prevented NATO from approving Washington's request for help in any conflict with Iraq, though most of the alliance's 19 countries are ready to do so. 
Mr. Rumsfeld said he thought of Europe as more than just Germany and France. "I think that's old Europe," he said. "If you look at the entire NATO Europe today, the center of gravity is shifting to the east and there are a lot of new members." 
The comment was seen as part of an effort by Washington to marginalize France and Germany on the Continent, though the two countries dominate Europe's economic and political affairs. 
"I want to remind everyone that this 'old Europe' has resilience, and is capable of bouncing back," the French finance minister, Francis Mer, told LCI television. "And it will show it, in time."

HEADLINE: A Measured Mayoral Message 

 BODY:
Delivering his second State of the City address yesterday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg did not needlessly pander, clutter his remarks with levity or pull a rabbit out of a hat. But on the coldest day of the year, amid a staggering financial crisis, he conveyed a sense of hope that New York City's challenges are surmountable. He pronounced the city "strong, confident and undefeated." These words could easily apply to the mayor himself -- or at least to the image Mr. Bloomberg sought to convey of a leader undaunted by dipping popularity ratings. 
 His remarks, delivered in the glass-enclosed Brooklyn Botanic Garden, were a candid if incomplete accounting of the city's legitimate successes and obvious problems. They were designed not to dazzle but to reassure, and were delivered in as heartfelt a manner as this disciplined mayor has ever managed. It was the right speech for the occasion. New Yorkers need reassurance right now. 
 The mayor cited, among other signs of vitality, the low crime rate; New York, he said, is the nation's safest big city. He also noted its continued hotel construction; the Republican Party's choice of New York for its National Convention; and the long-awaited realignment of the school system.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that the municipal economy had weakened. But unlike last year, when he threatened to send his staff roaming through the bureaucracy in search of spending cuts, he didn't try to scare anyone. Instead he issued a measured summons to Albany, Washington and municipal workers' unions to give him the help he will clearly need to close the city's gigantic $3 billion budget gap. In specific terms, this means help in containing ballooning Medicaid costs and getting a commuter tax and more federal dollars, as well as improved productivity from the city's work force. He also asked the City Council to pressure state legislators by passing its own tort reform bill that could save the city hundreds of millions of dollars in legal actions.
Despite budget cuts, he said, he will not compromise New Yorkers' quality of life. And while he lacked the animated passion of his predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, on the subject of crime, Mr. Bloomberg pledged new efforts to bring down sex crimes and to continue a successful campaign to reduce crime in the city's most vulnerable areas.
Without getting warm and fuzzy, the mayor expressed concern that the property tax increase could cause hardship for "hard-working people." He also promised improved accountability, including regular status reports on how he is doing on every project he has proposed. This could be useful in helping the public keep score. It could also make for handy reference in a second mayoral campaign.

REBUFFING 2 ALLIES, U.S. PUSHES DEMAND THAT IRAQ DISARM

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Despite the deepest diplomatic rift in decades with some major European allies, a parade of top Bush administration officials closed ranks today and demanded in closely parallel speeches and statements that Saddam Hussein give up all weapons of mass destruction. They insisted that the United States would not have to act alone if war should be needed to force him to do so. 
 "I don't think we'll have to worry about going it alone," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said at a meeting here with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain, Washington's most stalwart ally, brushing aside renewed opposition to a war from France and Germany. 
 As resistance to military action appeared to harden among members of the United Nations Security Council, a senior administration official acknowledged that the United States did not now have the votes to force a second Council resolution explicitly authorizing an attack, and Mr. Powell said it was "an open question" whether to seek one. 
The top administration officials -- whatever their previous stance -- argued that it was up to Iraq to turn over its weapons to United Nations inspectors and not the job of the inspectors to ferret them out or find a "smoking gun." They warned that Mr. Hussein was balking and that time was running out.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, said "we know from multiple sources that Saddam has ordered that any scientist who cooperates" in interviews with the inspectors "will be killed, as well as their families." Excerpts, Page A11. 
A top Iraqi official said today that scientists had refused to be interviewed, rejecting a central United Nations demand. Mr. Wolfowitz said Mr. Hussein was making no serious effort to disarm, unlike regimes in South Africa, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which gave up their nuclear weapons in the 1990's in response to international pressure. No sooner had he spoken than Hans Blix, a chief United Nations weapons inspector, also cited South Africa in unflattering contrast to Iraq, hinting at the thrust of the report on Iraqi compliance that he is to deliver next week.
It was another day of sharp oratory and continued military buildup in the Persian Gulf region, as Australia announced that it was sending an unspecified number of troops, including special forces and an air reconnaissance team in advance of possible deployment of fighter planes, plus a transport ship .
In a speech on foreign policy at Georgetown University, Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, earned loud applause when he sharply criticized the Bush administration for failing to win broader international support for possible military action.
"I say to the president, show respect for the process of international diplomacy because it is not only right, it can make American stronger," Mr. Kerry said. "Mr. President, do not rush to war."
But the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said, "The president is confident that Europe will heed the call." He drew a distinction between France and Germany and other nations from Eastern Europe to Spain, Italy, Australia and Britain. He added that it would be "entirely possible for good friends to stay on the sidelines," and said Mr. Bush was "respectful" of the posture of France and Germany. 
French and German leaders reacted sharply to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's blunt dismissal of them on Wednesday as part of "old Europe" and as "problems" in handling the crisis over Iraq. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said, "Our position is not a problem; it is a constructive contribution."
In fact, the French and German opposition appeared to be causing considerable problems for President Bush with some veto-holding members of the Security Council, including China and Russia. 
In a telephone call, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told Mr. Bush that next week's scheduled report from United Nations arms inspectors should provide the "main criteria" in deciding what to do next, the Kremlin said. Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told reporters in Athens: "There is no serious reason for the start of a military attack on Iraq. We hope that no country will take single action outside United Nations decisions."
In Turkey, diplomats from six of Iraq's neighbors issued a two-page declaration calling on Baghdad to cooperate more fully with United Nations inspectors to avoid "another war and all its devastating consequences."
In Congress, where Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Powell held a closed-door session in the Senate on the Iraq situation, the defense secretary told reporters who chased him down a corridor that his remarks would not have any effect on European-American relations, and added: "At my age, old is a term of endearment." His senior aides said that Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks were not premeditated, but came in response to a reporter's broad assertion that "a lot of Europeans" gave the benefit of the doubt to Iraq.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, sought to soften Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks, saying the United States had no plans to break its alliances.
"These are the people that we do so many things with every day -- fighting terrorism, cooperating in NATO, economic cooperation, air traffic, everything under the sun," Mr. Boucher said. "We have differences on some issues sometimes, but these are our allies, and we're not pulling back from them, nor they from us." 
Experts and diplomats said Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks seemed intended to show reluctant allies that the United States was capable of waging war against Iraq without the support of major NATO allies. But those experts warned that European allies would be needed to help provide troops and money to rebuild Iraq after a war.
American officials took pains to note that negotiations had not even begun at the United Nations on a possible second resolution or other action, and said they expected no concrete action before Mr. Bush meets with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain at Camp David at the end of next week. 
But they made it clear that after weeks of circling the question, the United States had rejected the desire of most Security Council members for more time to allow weapons inspections to go forward. "Sooner, rather than later, Council members are going to have to address the consequences of Iraqi noncompliance," a senior official said, adding that the administration would not view the lack of Council approval as a decisive constraint.
Mr. Powell, who was the chief advocate for taking the administration's case to the United Nations last fall, again signaled his own growing impatience. In an interview on Tuesday, he said: "The question isn't how much longer do you need for the inspections to work. Inspections will not work."
Today, Mr. Powell said, "Let's not lose sight that the issue is the disarmament of Iraq, not how much more time the inspectors need, but how much more time we should give Iraq when they have not used the time they've already been given to do what is required of them, and that is to disarm."
Mr. Wolfowitz, long one of the administration's most vocal advocates for military action against Iraq, made an almost identical warning in his speech, declaring: "The decision on whether Iraq's weapons of mass terror will be dismantled voluntarily, or whether it will have to be done by force, is not up to us or to the U.N. The decision rests entirely with Saddam Hussein. So far, he has not made the fundamental decision to disarm, and unless he does, the threat posed by his weapons programs will remain with us, and indeed, will grow."
Referring to the inspections now under way, Mr. Wolfowitz used a business metaphor to make his case.
"When an auditor discovers discrepancies in the books, it is not the auditor's obligation to prove where the embezzler has stashed his money," he said. "It is up to the person or institution being audited to explain the discrepancy."
In Moscow, Mr. Powell's deputy, Richard L. Armitage, who has long sounded notes of caution about any military campaign, said on a Russian radio broadcast that "there is sufficient authority to move now without a second resolution" from the United Nations. Speaking on Echo Moscow radio, he said "no decision has been made yet to attack Iraq," but added, "It is time for Saddam Hussein to finally come clean and disarm."
After the Senate briefing this afternoon, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he intended to discuss the need for the United States to share more of its intelligence with the inspectors.

HEADLINE: Bush's Backing, Still Strong, Shows Steady Decline 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER

 BODY:
President Bush's public support has eroded steadily over the last 12 months, with a rising number of Americans expressing discontent both with his economic policies and his handling of foreign affairs, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows.
 The poll, taken at the midpoint of Mr. Bush's term as he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, found that 59 percent of Americans approve the way he is performing his job. That figure is the lowest it has been since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But the president's ratings were unusually high after Sept. 11, 2001 and, by historical standards, remain strong today. 
 There were some encouraging findings for Mr. Bush. Two-thirds of respondents were optimistic about the next two years under Mr. Bush. And 4 in 10 said the nation would be in better condition five years from now. 
Still, the survey turned up many points of potential concern -- some reminiscent of the problems with the economy that his father encountered 12 years ago -- as Mr. Bush prepares for the campaign ahead.
Even as Mr. Bush has turned most of his attention to preparing the country for a war against Saddam Hussein, Americans said they were twice as concerned about the economy as they were about either a pending war in Iraq or the war on terrorism.
Nearly 50 percent of the public expressed disapproval of how Mr. Bush was handling the economy, while 41 percent expressed disapproval of his management of foreign policy, which has been the foundation of his extraordinarily high levels of support since Sept. 11. Those disapproval figures are the highest they have been since Mr. Bush took office.
Half of all respondents said Mr. Bush did not share their priorities for the country, an increase of 14 points from when the question was asked a year ago. That is a question pollsters watch closely to measure potential vulnerabilities of a candidate.
The Times/CBS News Poll of 997 adults nationwide was conducted by telephone from Sunday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey found that Americans disagree with Mr. Bush on issues like cutting taxes, affirmative action and appointing judges who oppose abortion rights. Those are all issues that Democratic presidential candidates have been raising against him in early campaign swings through Iowa and New Hampshire.
More than half the respondents said they opposed a centerpiece of Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, the elimination of a tax on dividends, which Democrats have used to portray Mr. Bush as a friend of the rich.
A majority of the poll's respondents -- including 49 percent of Republicans -- said reducing the deficit would be more likely to revive the economy than would cutting taxes, the course pressed by Mr. Bush. The White House announced last week that the budget deficit for next year would reach at least $300 billion.
Finally, 63 percent said things were going worse in the country that they were five years ago.
Taken together, the poll is the latest indication of the conflicting sentiments Americans hold for the president. While his overall job approval rating remains at what most politicians would view as an enviable level -- and Republicans remain confident about his reelection prospects -- the poll offers reasons for hope among the six Democrats now seeking the nomination to challenge him in 2004. 
Of particular note, only 44 percent of respondents said they approved of how Mr. Bush was managing the economy. That figure is almost identical to the 42 percent of respondents who said they approved of the way that Mr. Bush's father was handling the economy at a similar point in what proved to be his first and only term in the White House.
For all the attention on Mr. Bush's ratings, job approval levels two years into a president's first term are an imprecise indicator of how a chief executive will fare on Election Day. Ronald Reagan, with a 37 percent approval rating at this point in his first term, went on to win re-election by a landslide, while President George Bush, with 62 percent, lost.
The poll measured support for Mr. Bush's policies toward Iraq, at a time when many Democratic presidential candidates have turned up their criticism of his handling of the situation. Just yesterday, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts delivered a speech in Washington that sharply criticized Mr. Bush as failing to win broad international support for military action and talked about a "blustering unilateralism" that, Mr. Kerry said, is "wrong, even dangerous, for our country."
Although Mr. Bush has signaled that he is prepared to lead a war against Iraq without the support of the Security Council, nearly two-thirds of Americans said they wanted him to try to find a diplomatic solution to the Iraq situation, while 31 percent said the United States should resort to military force. Even so, 64 percent said they approved of the United States taking military action to oust Saddam Hussein, while 30 percent said they disapproved.
On several issues, the poll -- and the comments of respondents in follow-up interviews -- suggested that Mr. Bush's views were somewhat out of step with many Americans' views.
"President Bush is concentrating on the war effort in Iraq and not worrying about the country," said Marianne Reiter, 70, a Republican in Queens. "I think he justifies the tax breaks by thinking they will get people to vote for him."
That perception might be particularly strong now because Mr. Bush in recent weeks has taken steps that have reinforced his standing with conservatives in his party, which Democrats have argued would cost him among moderate and independent voters. Those include his opposition to the affirmative action program used by the University of Michigan to increase minority enrollment, his pressing the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts and his advocacy of the elimination of the dividends tax.
The poll found that 54 percent of respondents said affirmative action in hiring, promoting and college admissions should be continued, while 37 percent said it should be abolished. Along those lines, the respondents said they expected Mr. Bush to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will vote to make abortion illegal, but that stance was not shared by a majority of respondents.
So far, at least, Mr. Bush does not appear to have persuaded the nation that the way to repair the economy is a new round of tax cuts, or that the cuts he has proposed would not favor the wealthy.
"We should not be cutting taxes as long as there is a deficit," said Nancy Stevens, 65, a Republican who is a retired store owner from East Hardwick, Vt., said in a follow-up interview. "The tax cuts helped only the wealthy. If we took care of the budget deficit, it would trickle down better to the lower income people."
Robert Hall, a 74-year-old retired high school business instructor from Louisiana, said: "We didn't have a budget deficit until President Bush got in there. All those years we struggled to get rid of the deficit and now we're right back into it. The tax cuts put us back into the deficit."
Fifty-six percent said that lowering the deficit was the best way to improve the national economy, while 36 percent said the best way was cutting taxes. And 69 percent said the deficit was "a bad thing," while 21 percent said it was a good thing. 
And 58 percent of respondents said that Mr. Bush's policies favor the rich, compared with 10 percent who said they favored the middle class. In addition, 26 percent said they treated everyone the same and 1 percent said they favored the poor. Two-thirds of respondents said big business had too much influence on this White House.
The poll pointed to some vulnerabilities in what has been Mr. Bush's strong suit, foreign policy and the war on terrorism. By 55 percent to 40 percent, Americans said the administration was reacting to events as they occurred abroad rather than having a clear foreign policy plan.
Slightly more than half of the respondents said the United States was less respected in the world today than it was two years ago, when Mr. Bush took office, while one-third said relations with Europe had worsened. And while the public said they viewed Iraq as a bigger threat to world peace than North Korea, reflecting the White House view, respondents named Al Qaeda as the biggest threat of all.
The poll also suggested some concern about what the White House has done to forestall future domestic terrorist attacks. Just over 40 percent said Mr. Bush had a clear plan for fighting terrorism, while 53 percent said he was reacting to events.
Fifty-two percent said they believed the government had done "all it could be reasonably expected to do" to protect the country from future terrorist attacks. But 45 percent said it could have done more.

How Poll Was Done
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday through Wednesday with 997 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Sales Pitch: New York's Worth the Cost 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
In his State of the City speech, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gave more details yesterday of his aggressive plan to market New York City as a luxury brand, an address for which companies should be willing to pay a higher price.
 To sell his idea, Mr. Bloomberg said he would create a sort of civic road show, in which the city's Economic Development Corporation would travel the world, promoting New York's economic potential in much the same way that Wall Street markets new companies to investors. At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg said the city would hire its first chief marketing officer. A search is under way. 
 "Their sales pitch in cities around the globe will be that New York is the world's second home, a place where people from literally anywhere, if they have a dream, and are willing to work, can succeed," he said. "That's the message that won us the right to represent the United States in the international competition for the 2012 Olympics. We're confident it will win us attention from businesses around the world."
The plan expands on Mr. Bloomberg's remarks this month at an economic conference at Rockefeller University, in which he described the city as having unique advantages that for certain businesses are worth the higher taxes and operating costs.
Some say it is a smart approach for a city in desperate straits. "I don't know quite how he will sell it," said Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College. "But I think he's on to something. We can no longer be passive and just assume this is New York City. Our hubris is no longer enough. You have to take advantage of the asset." 
The first stop on New York's road show will be London, in mid-March, said Andy Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation. "We're figuring out who our target customers are," Mr. Alper said. "We're identifying the decisionmakers, and we're going out to market the benefits of our product. And we think that New York has an awful lot of benefits for many, many companies that are not currently here."
Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, the city's leading business group, observed that after Sept. 11, 2001, many New York businesses began spreading out their operations. "We are going to lose jobs at an accelerated rate," she said. "The question is where will new growth come from, how will we grow our economy? The truth is we have a great competitive advantage as being an international headquarters city that companies throughout the world may well want to locate to, but they have not figured out how to do it."

HEADLINE: MAYOR OPTIMISTIC DESPITE CITY'S PAIN 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Plagued by gloomy poll numbers and an intransigent economy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged in his State of the City address yesterday that his administration's decision to impose an 18.5 percent property tax increase had enraged many New Yorkers, and he expressed sympathy for those forced to sacrifice.
 Mr. Bloomberg laid out a modest agenda for the second year of his mayoralty, one that is heavily dependent on fiscal help from Albany and Washington. He again called on labor unions to provide concessions or live without pay increases, and he raised the specter of layoffs. 
 But the mayor, who made the unusual decision to give the annual address to the City Council at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden rather than in the Council's chamber, also insisted that New York City was far from doomed and was in fact better off than many other cities. 
Capitalizing on the city's greatness, he said, will be one of his chief goals in 2003. To that end, he announced that he would appoint a chief marketing officer, whose job it would be to travel around the nation selling the city as if it were an initial public offering of stock.
"I wouldn't trade our hand for the cards that any other major city holds," Mr. Bloomberg told the crowd of council members, commissioners, businessmen, clergy members and other movers and shakers in municipal business. "Because while we have short-term problems in common with other cities, New York has competitive advantages that make our long-term future far brighter than theirs."
Mr. Bloomberg, who generally hews to tough language when discussing the city's budget problems, sounded a sympathetic note yesterday for the city's residents, who have to bear the burden of his economic policies by paying the increased property tax.
"In an already difficult environment," Mr. Bloomberg said, "it has forced hard-working people to dig deeper into their pockets. I want to assure you, I would not have asked the City Council to take these steps if they weren't necessary or if we had any practical alternatives."
In recent months, polls have demonstrated many New Yorkers' deep dissatisfaction with Mr. Bloomberg's job performance, in spite of his many accomplishments. In interviews, many residents said that they did not believe the mayor, a billionaire, truly understood their economic pain. 
Yesterday, in stark contrast to Gov. George E. Pataki in his address to the State Legislature two weeks ago, which was notably light on gloomy budget talk, Mr. Bloomberg continued to hammer home the notion that the city had been on the road to fiscal trouble since before the terrorist attack in 2001, and that New Yorkers would continue to face sacrifices to keep the city moving.
"Taxes and frugality are far better than crime, filth and abandonment," he said. "And as to the short-term political fallout, I would rather be less popular, knowing that New Yorkers are safe, than promise a rose garden I know we can't deliver." He also called on the city's labor unions to give concessions or suffer contracts without raises and possible layoffs. 
Mr. Bloomberg, who faces a $3 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year, called again on Albany to reinstate a tax on people who commute into the city for work, even though the governor and other legislative leaders in Albany have said that such a tax is as likely as bluebonnets sprouting along the Capitol lawn in January. Undaunted, Mr. Bloomberg pressed ahead in calling for other help from Albany and Washington, including relief from mounting Medicaid costs.
In his address, Mr. Bloomberg gave an enthusiastic summary of the achievements of his first year. Among them: his trifecta in gaining control of the city's schools, keeping crime at an all-time low and snagging the 2004 Republican National Convention. 
Mr. Bloomberg drizzled his speech with a few plans for next year, like the formation of a commission to study the charter, this time with a focus on the way the city procures goods, and a new Police Department program to reduce sex offenses. The mayor will also seek to merge some city agencies, and will give a detailed plan for developing the West Side of Manhattan, including, perhaps, a stadium that he refuses to call a stadium, but rather a "multi-use sports facility."
Mr. Bloomberg also seemed gleeful that the Cirque du Soleil will be performing on Randalls Island this spring, and said that a new ferry would take people to the island. 
Mr. Bloomberg tends to use his major speeches as opportunities to be a cheerleader for the city rather than to give serious peeks into his legislative agenda. Last year, while he spoke openly about wanting to gain control of the school system, he gave no real hint about some of his other policy goals, like a sweeping ban on smoking or his desire to have nonpartisan elections in New York. 
Mr. Bloomberg told his speechwriters this year that he wanted his State of the City address to focus on short-term challenges and the bright future of the city. Aides said he sent back a first draft for revisions last week because it was not optimistic enough. The mayor continued to work on the speech through the weekend, and went over the final draft yesterday morning at a coffee shop in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Democrats to Tackle Insurance Industry 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats are planning to push for a curb on the insurance industry's longstanding exemption from antitrust laws, in an effort to hold down rising medical malpractice premiums.
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, plans to introduce a bill to make it illegal for malpractice insurers to collude in setting rates or otherwise engage in "price fixing, bid rigging or market allocations." 
 Mr. Leahy and some other Democrats say they believe that the antitrust exemption allows insurers to act in concert in a manner that would be illegal in other industries and that removing the exemption would be an important step in controlling malpractice premiums. 
Democratic leaders say the legislation will be a counter to a proposal by President Bush that seeks to rein in malpractice premiums solely by limiting jury awards. 
Past efforts to curb the antitrust exemption have failed, and the Democrats' legislation would face a difficult battle. But Democrats say the push by insurers and doctors to limit awards by state judges and juries in malpractice suits has opened the door for lawmakers to re-examine the wide exemptions in the federal law. 
Republican leaders attribute the increase in malpractice premiums almost exclusively to what Mr. Bush recently described in a speech in Pennsylvania as frivolous suits and "lousy" juries. They have proposed a plan to limit the jury awards that are intended to compensate injured patients for pain and suffering and punish doctors who commit the most grievous medical errors.
But many experts and some in the insurance industry say the sharp increases in malpractice premiums are driven by a broader range of factors. They say the plunge in investment income from bonds and stocks, as well as the continuing shakeout from a severe price war in the 1990's, have had major roles in spikes for premiums that have prompted some doctors to curtail their practices or quit.
Democratic lawmakers have discussed legislation that would parallel efforts in some states to force health insurers to pay doctors more promptly. Although doctors face rising malpractice premiums, they are also being squeezed by the sometimes slow and antagonistic process of being paid by health insurance companies.
Mr. Leahy was joined today by three other Democratic senators -- Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, John Edwards of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts -- in a letter urging other senators to support reforming the insurance industry.
"Most of the legislative proposals being bandied about seem likely to reduce health care accountability without lowering malpractice premiums," the four senators wrote.
The antitrust exemption, they added, lets insurers "collude to set rates, resulting in higher premiums than true competition would achieve -- and because of the exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate any such collusion." 
Insurers deny having taken advantage of the exemption to engage in price collusion, and they defend the exemption, saying it may improve competition. As a result, the industry says, there is no reason for the legislation.
"Insurers are not engaged in price-fixing," said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. "It is simply not the case. There are no meetings between insurance companies where prices are determined."
The exemption, Mr. Hartwig added, allows insurers an important means of obtaining information about losses and trends in the industry that gives them more certainty in setting rates. That may encourage insurers to enter new markets or expand their businesses, he said.
The exemption, Mr. Hartwig said, "increases the ease of entry into the market."
"If you remove the information available today to insurers," he said, "you would have a situation that in the long run could act to decrease competition."
Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, another trade group, said strong protections against anticompetitive behavior were already in place. Although Ms. Rochman said she could not comment on Mr. Leahy's proposal because she had not seen it, she said focusing on the exemption was a disappointing effort to shift blame from the true causes of higher malpractice premiums.
A senior Republican aide in the Senate also criticized the legislation, saying, "This sounds like an attempt to change the subject, rather than address the real issue of exorbitant lawsuits."
Some lawmakers and consumer advocates have offered other suggestions for smoothing the spikes in premiums. Some have suggested creating a reinsurance organization to help shoulder underwriting risks.
Some groups have argued that the public should have access to information in the National Practitioner Data Bank about specific physicians' malpractice records, helping patients avoid doctors who have repeatedly lost cases. According to Public Citizen, the group that Ralph Nader founded, 5.1 percent of doctors account for 54 percent of malpractice settlements and awards.
The data bank, operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, allows hospitals to review the malpractice records of individual doctors but forbids releasing that information to the public.
Democrats have actually taken a page from Mr. Bush's legislative history in making another proposal. It would require insurers, after limits on jury awards have been enacted, to pass through all the benefits of lower damage awards directly to doctors through lower premiums. The proposal is similar to legislation in Texas from 1995 that Mr. Bush praised while he was governor and on the presidential campaign trail as saving consumers billions of dollars.
The White House has not said whether it would support a similar proposal in its effort to limit malpractice jury awards.

HEADLINE: Bush Economic Adviser Says He's Not Finished Yet 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
R. Glenn Hubbard never left any doubt that he could manage without working for President Bush. Less clear is whether the president will want to manage without Mr. Hubbard.
 A plain-spoken, earnest workaholic, Mr. Hubbard is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. It is a position that offers prestige but little power under most presidents, but Mr. Hubbard has been a chief architect of Mr. Bush's $670 billion tax-cutting proposal. 
 More than anybody else in the administration, Mr. Hubbard pushed relentlessly in favor of the plan's central feature: eliminating taxes on corporate dividends.
Today, after a report in The Wall Street Journal that he plans to resign this spring, Mr. Hubbard, who is on a two-year leave from his job as a professor at Columbia University, said the report was premature. But he acknowledged that he was "not a lifer" in the administration.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, told a C-Span interviewer today: "Glenn has been signaling for a long time his desire to return to his academic life. I think we all have to understand his decision to move back."
People close to the administration have long speculated that Mr. Hubbard's successor is likely to be N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University.
Friends of Mr. Hubbard said he had always assumed he would return to Columbia well before the end of Mr. Bush's first term.
"Glenn didn't move to Washington thinking that this would be a long-term thing," said William M. Gentry, an economist at Columbia who has collaborated with Mr. Hubbard on numerous papers. "It wouldn't surprise me if he comes back, but I really don't know."
Mr. Hubbard, 44, has filled a void in the administration since early December, when Mr. Bush fired Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary and Lawrence B. Lindsey as director of the National Economic Council.
Unlike his former colleagues, Mr. Hubbard has managed to avoid making gaffes when speaking in public, and he has expressed his views in clear and simple terms.
Mr. Hubbard's leave from Columbia expires this spring. Though he had told White House officials that he could probably get an extension, his wife and two sons still live in New York City, and he commutes to Washington.
Though few people consider Mr. Hubbard a true power player in the White House, experts on tax policy say Mr. Hubbard's role in the tax plan is unmistakable.
Eleven years ago, as a deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury in the first Bush administration, Mr. Hubbard helped write a far-reaching study that laid out the arguments for eliminating dividend taxes as part of a more fundamental reform of the system of taxing corporations.
Mr. Hubbard said then and still says that cutting taxes on dividends would increase investment, reduce distortions in the current system and perhaps even help clean up corporate accounting practices.
As an academic, Mr. Hubbard was never bothered by the fact that business groups often opposed the idea because many companies did not want to be pressured into paying dividends.
Nor did he fret that the move would provide little immediate stimulus to the economy. As a longtime opponent to "Keynsian fine-tuning" of the economy, Mr. Hubbard is skeptical about stimulus measures and much more interested in long-term policy changes.
Nor was Mr. Hubbard troubled by the fact that more than half of the tax benefits would flow to only 5 percent of taxpayers. As a longtime proponent of what he calls "life cycle" analysis, Mr. Hubbard has argued that the distribution of tax burdens varies as much with a person's age and situation as with his or her status in society.
Experts on tax policy say the administration's proposal on dividend taxes, which would cost the Treasury $300 billion over 10 years, is an almost perfect reflection of Mr. Hubbard's academic style.
The proposal takes pains to block companies from awarding tax-free dividends if they are already using other tax breaks to avoid paying corporate taxes. It would also let companies pass on a tax break to shareholders even if the company retained its profits and did not pay out dividends.
Both features make the plan extremely complicated, and they have already provoked criticism in Congress. But they reflect Mr. Hubbard's goal to end double taxation, rather than all taxation, of companies, and his pursuit of "neutral" taxes that do not bias a company's behavior in one direction or another.
Mr. Hubbard has long viewed the elimination of dividend taxes as merely the first step toward a broader overhaul of the tax system -- an overhaul that might eventually lead to a flat tax or a broad-based "consumption tax."
In a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Hubbard insisted that Mr. Bush's current plan was separate from that more distant goal. "The president is a pretty straight shooter," Mr. Hubbard said. "If he had wanted fundamental tax reform, he would have said so."

HEADLINE: Preserving Democracy in Venezuela 

 BODY:
The best hope for a peaceful, democratic outcome to Venezuela's political crisis may now rest in the mediation efforts of Jimmy Carter. During his presidency Mr. Carter was a firm champion of democracy throughout Latin America, standing up to the military tyrannies that then predominated in the region. Now he has proposed two principled and plausible solutions to the long-running conflict over President Hugo Chavez, which has divided Venezuela's people, hobbled its economy and raised the specter of a breakdown in constitutional rule. 
 Mr. Carter, who met separately in recent days with Mr. Chavez and opposition leaders, offers two possible solutions, both compatible with Venezuela's laws and the right of its people to choose their own leaders freely. One provides for passage of a constitutional amendment, either by Venezuela's legislature or a popular vote, that would shorten the current six-year presidential term and provide for new elections later this year. The other would set up a binding referendum this summer on whether Mr. Chavez should resign or stay in office as scheduled until 2006. That isn't exactly what either side wants, but Mr. Chavez and at least some opposition leaders have suggested that they might be able to accept one or both of the Carter proposals. 
 Until this week Mr. Chavez's opponents had hoped to drive him from office long before summer. They were counting on the combined pressure of a non-binding referendum that had been scheduled for Feb. 2 and a national strike now in its eighth week that has shut down much of Venezuela's vital oil industry, depriving the government of badly needed revenues and sending world oil prices soaring. 
But the strike has begun faltering, and this week Venezuela's Supreme Court suspended preparations for the February referendum, which Mr. Chavez had vowed to ignore anyway. That should strengthen elements of the opposition willing to accept a reasonable compromise along the lines Mr. Carter has suggested. 
The United States and five other nations trying to resolve the standoff hold their first meeting in Washington today. Venezuelans of all persuasions should rally behind the Carter proposals.

HEADLINE: A Leader With a Foot Now in Both Worlds 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Arriving for last year's World Social Forum here, well before he had been elected president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was blunt in his criticism of the world's top policy makers then gathering for the World Economic Forum in New York.
 "The sheer amount of barbed-wire fencing," he said, showed that "what those men there were thinking was no good for the majority of humankind, especially for the poor." 
 This year, Mr. da Silva will stop here only briefly to address the 100,000 or so antiglobalization activists gathered for the third Social Forum before jetting off to Davos to speak to "those men," now back at their traditional venue in the Swiss Alps, but still behind barbed wire.
The fact that Mr. da Silva is willing to rub shoulders with the Che Guevara T-shirts at the Social Forum and the suits in Davos illustrates the fine line he has been walking since taking office on Jan. 1. 
On the one hand, Mr. da Silva, a former metalworker, has appeared on television and on magazine covers as popular "Presidente Lula," the caring leader who takes his cabinet on trips to some of Brazil's poorest regions to show he intends to make good on election promises to redress this vast country's appalling social inequities.
Ditching for a while the suits and ties that helped him win over more reticent, conservative voters during last year's election campaign, Mr. da Silva reverted to his working-class roots, touring shantytowns, embracing an AIDS-afflicted child here, comforting a poverty-stricken widow there.
If the popular reaction is anything to go by, Mr. da Silva is managing to persuade Brazil's poorest that their economic lot can improve. Wherever he goes, Mr. da Silva draws a crowd and he plays it like a rock star.
On the other hand, Mr. da Silva has struck a serious note with the markets, nominating an economic team that is bending over backward to persuade investors that Brazil is a safe bet and that unorthodox policies are simply not on the agenda. Its first major policy decision was to raise interest rates this week to their highest level in nearly four years, assuaging fears the new government would be soft on inflation.
The government is also advancing with plans, long awaited by the markets, to reform Brazil's wasteful public sector pension system, inefficient tax laws and archaic labor legislation.
Maybe because of such ambiguity, Mr. da Silva's announcement he would fly to Davos caused furor among radicals on the left of his Workers' Party. Candido Grzybowski, a member of the Social Forum's steering committee, called the decision "lamentable." 
Mr. da Silva was scheduled to speak here Friday before leaving Saturday for Europe.
"The decision to go to Davos had to be a controversial decision because it was a political decision," said Oded Grajew, a co-founder of the Social Forum and now Mr. da Silva's personal aide for social affairs.
Mr. da Silva "wants to show the world that it is possible to combat poverty and misery with at least the same weight as is being given to the fight against terrorism," Mr. Grajew said.
If Mr. da Silva delivers any antiglobalization message, it will most likely be here rather than in Davos, where he will be trying to persuade the international financiers present to reopen credit lines to Brazilian companies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in financing were cut off before Mr. da Silva's election triumph last October, when many were predicting Brazil's economy would collapse. 
Given Mr. da Silva's most recent wooing of the markets, however, even Wall Street analysts say he could get a serious hearing at Davos for Porto Alegre's main political idea that for world prosperity, the plight of the poor must be addressed.
"Finally there's someone between those two poles of thought who can absorb both points of view," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist at the New York branch of WestLB, a German bank. "All his political life he's been a good negotiator. Maybe he can pull this one off, too."

HEADLINE: Connect, Only Connect 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
The whiteboard in Duncan J. Watts's office at Columbia University was a thicket of squiggly blue lines, circles and calculus equations. Mr. Watts, an associate professor of sociology, had just begun a passionate disquisition on the virtues and liabilities of scale-free networks when the telephone rang. It was Alfred Berkeley, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, hoping to chat about the exchange's design.
 Mr. Watts, 31, is a network theorist. And these days that means fielding frequent calls from powerful admirers like Mr. Berkeley -- Wall Street moguls and government officials eager to tap into a nascent academic science that few understand but that many think may hold the key to everything from predicting fashion trends to preventing terrorism, stock market meltdowns and the spread of HIV. 
 Never mind that Mr. Watts's new book on the subject, "Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age," which will be published by W. W. Norton next month, is littered with the arcana of theoretical physics as well as charts and graphs that appear to require an advanced degree in math in order to decipher. Network theory is hot. Two other recent books on networks, "Linked: The New Science of Networks" (Perseus, 2002) by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi and "Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks" (W. W. Norton) by Mark Buchanan, have already sold tens of thousands of copies. 
And that's not counting sales in the burgeoning genre of consumer studies, where network science terms and concepts are invoked with near religious fervor. From Malcolm Gladwell's three-year-old best seller, "The Tipping Point," to just-published analyses like "The Influentials" and "Branded: The Buying and Selling of Teenagers," the shelves at Barnes & Noble are laden with books alternately applauding and deploring the importance of things like hubs, connectors, mavens and influencer teens for creating fads, cementing brand loyalty and swelling profits. 
"Network theory has become a bit of a fad," Mr. Watts conceded after hanging up the phone. "I spend half my time telling people I think it's relevant to a lot of problems people care about and half my time trying to tone down the hype." 
Network scientists study networks: collections of people or objects connected to each other in some way. Think of the 1.5 million Manhattan residents or the 30,000 genes inside a human cell. Such networks, scientists argue, behave in ways that can't be understood solely in terms of their component parts. Without knowing what every single person or object within the network is doing, they say, it's nevertheless possible to know something about how the network as a whole behaves. 
Stated that way it sounds simple. But as an intellectual approach, network theory is the latest symptom of a fundamental shift in scientific thinking, away from a focus on individual components -- particles and subparticles -- and toward a novel conception of the group. As Mr. Barabasi, a professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame, put it: "In biology, we've had great success stories -- the human genome, the mouse genome. But what is not talked about is that we have the pieces but don't have a clue as to how the system works. Increasingly, we think the answer is in networks."
Not that network theory is an entirely contemporary creation. Its roots stretch back nearly 300 years, to Leonhard Euler, a brilliant 18th-century Swiss mathematician who dabbled in nearly every branch of modern science, from algebra to astrophysics. In 1736, Euler took up a brain teaser that had preoccupied the residents of Konigsberg, a Prussian town on the Pregel River not far from where he lived: how to cross all seven bridges in town without crossing the same bridge twice. No one had been able to pull off the feat, but Euler provided the mathematical proof that it could not be done. To do so, he turned the problem into a network, depicting the bridges as lines and the landmasses they connected as nodes. 
After Euler, mathematicians continued to analyze networks, then called graphs, enumerating the properties of orderly and static structures like ice crystals and beehives. No one thought to tackle networks of people or objects that were, as Mr. Watts puts it in his book, "actually doing something -- generating power, sending data or even making decisions." Such complex real-world networks were assumed to be random: nodes and links connected in an arbitrary, disorderly fashion.
But clearly this is not always the case. "Imagine that you really did pick your friends at random from the global population of over six billion," Mr. Watts writes. "You would be much more likely to be friends with someone on another continent than someone from your hometown, workplace or school. Even in a world of global travel and electronic communications, this is an absurd notion."
Of course, studying a network of six billion people is an unfathomable proposition. It wasn't until the mid-1990's and the advent of powerful computers that network scientists were able to analyze real-life networks of significant size and complexity. And in doing so, Mr. Watts and his colleagues made some tantalizing discoveries. By 1998, they had found that networks as diverse as actors, power grids, the World Wide Web, the proteins in a human cell and the neurons of a wormlike organism called C. elegans aren't random at all but obey the same simple, powerful rules.
For example, whether the network has nearly a billion nodes (the estimated number of Web pages) or just half a million (roughly the number of actors in the Internet Movie Database), the paths between any two nodes tend to be extremely short -- such that, for example, any two movie actors can be connected by an average of less than four links.
That may not seem like news to anyone who has played the Kevin Bacon Game -- in which film actors invariably turn out to have starred in a movie with Mr. Bacon or else with another actor who has -- or seen John Guare's play "Six Degrees of Separation." (The play was inspired by the famous 1967 experiment in which the Harvard social psychologist Stanley Milgram tried to prove that anyone in America could reach anyone else through a chain of fewer than six people.) But it was not entirely clear why these should all be "small-world" networks. As Mr. Watts points out, "There is nothing similar at all about the detailed way in which movie actors choose projects and engineers build transmission lines."
Eerier still, in 1999, Mr. Barabasi and a student at Notre Dame found that many of these small-world networks are also what scientists call scale-free. Many natural phenomena, including traits like height and I.Q., tend to cluster around an average (producing the familiar bell curve distribution). By contrast, scale-free networks go in for extremes: a few hubs -- nodes with lots of links -- and many more nodes with hardly any links at all. (Think of Google, the search engine, as a hub, and your personal homepage -- which probably has just a few links -- as an ordinary node.) 
Mr. Barabasi's discovery startled scientists. "People always knew there were networks but thought they were random," he said. "To know they were nodes linked by hubs was very unexpected." 
It also provoked a frenzy of research. For as Mr. Barabasi and his collaborator were able to show, the structure of scale-free networks has important practical implications. If you remove a few nodes at random, the network can still function normally. But if you remove one of the hubs, the results can be catastrophic.
Inspired by this insight, cancer researchers are now homing in on the cell's hub proteins in order to learn how to defend them from devastating attacks. Epidemiologists studying sexually transmitted diseases are arguing that it makes more sense to identify and treat the hubs in the transmission network than to give drugs to everyone. "The Bush administration's policy to give drugs to mothers with children is completely irrelevant to stopping AIDS in Africa," Mr. Barabasi said. "It's much better to go and target the hubs."
Even the United States military has begun recruiting network theorists to conduct counterterrorism research, with the goal of learning how to protect information and economic networks at home and destabilize terrorist networks abroad.
Yet just which network model describes human society remains a subject of fierce debate. Mr. Barabasi believes the human social network is scale-free with the expected smattering of richly connected hubs. Mr. Watts disagrees. "If you asked people to list the number of people they recognize, that could be scale-free, everyone recognizes Michael Jordan," he said. "But if you said, 'Who would you trust to look after your kids?' That's not scale-free. As you start to ratchet up the requirements for what it means to know someone, connections diminish." 
Is society a small-world network of the sort Milgram was interested in? Mr. Watts spent the past year trying to test that idea, using the Internet as a proxy for the world population. Whatever the results, he says, it's clear that human psychology has not yet adapted to the implications of a connected world. 
"We like to think of our world as full of atomized individuals," he said. "But decisions people make and the actions they take are so hopelessly entwined with the behaviors of everyone else that it's difficult to draw the boundaries around the individual." When it comes to choosing a CD or explaining the success of Harry Potter, your preference may matter less than the network's. 
But some scholars dismiss the network hypothesis altogether. Judith S. Kleinfeld, a psychologist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, prompted a flurry of media attention last year when she published an article questioning the validity of Milgram's small-world findings. Given the prevalence of networks -- from power grids to airports to the Internet -- it's tempting to assume that human society is a network as well, she says. But ultimately, that is impossible to prove. 
"Duncan assumes the world is a matrix," Ms. Kleinfeld said in a telephone interview. "He wants to know how you get from one point on it to another. But what if the world isn't a matrix? What if people aren't all connected? What if they're islands in space?" 
Mr. Watts admits that he faces daunting empirical challenges -- and that overzealous scientists are a concern. "You can turn almost anything into a network," he said, holding up two papers he had received on the "small world of human language" and shaking his head. "So what?"
"When I'm brutally honest with myself, I think that if we can figure this out, we can answer some important questions. Other times, I think it's just too hard."

HEADLINE: Don't Pester Europe on Genetically Modified Food 

BYLINE:  By Clyde Prestowitz; Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, is author of the forthcoming "Rogue Nation: The Unintended Consequences of America's Good Intentions."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration recently announced that it is considering taking action against the European Union because of its ban on imports of genetically modified foods. It's a profoundly bad idea. 
 As a former Reagan administration trade hawk, I take a back seat to no one in demanding the opening of foreign markets. But in this case and at this moment, we need to look hard at our priorities. 
 The ban on genetically modified food has been a sorely troublesome issue for the United States and the European Union for a long time. Without any scientific grounds, but on the basis of the so-called precautionary principle -- that is, if we can't prove absolutely that it is harmless, let's ban it -- the union has prevented genetically modified food from the United States from entering its markets. This is almost certainly a violation of World Trade Organization rules, which don't recognize the precautionary principle. If the United States follows through on its threat to file a case, it has a very good chance of winning. But this is a situation in which we could easily win in court but lose not only in the market, but also in the arena of our broader interests.
American trade officials tend to see the issue purely as a matter of European agricultural interests once again colluding and hiding behind phony scientific worries to exclude competitive American products. There is no doubt that there is an element of that in this case. But it is by no means the major part of the problem. Whether rationally or not, many, and perhaps most, Europeans are scared to death of genetically modified food. And this is not entirely a matter of Europeans' falling victim to protectionist propaganda or hysteria. 
We must remember two things. One is that Europe has recently had some very bad experiences with contaminated food. Health experts in the 1990's maintained that beef from cattle with mad cow disease was perfectly safe -- until scores of Britons died. 
That experience was all the more searing because food is to European culture what free speech is to American culture. There may be no good scientific reason for concern, but to consider eating something that has resulted from some laboratory manipulation is felt by many Europeans as a kind of denial of the true self. For Americans to insist that the union accept genetically modified products is bound to be felt in Europe as another exercise in American cultural and economic imperialism. 
We may win the case before the World Trade Organization, but that is likely only to guarantee a hardening of resistance by consumers. 
The administration will argue that it wants only to give the consumers a choice. But as one who spent years selling to European supermarkets and consumers, I can say with confidence that such a move by the United States would very likely result in a European campaign against all American food. 
That brings us to the second main point. We have already caused great resentment among our European allies by rejecting the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the International Criminal Court, both of which were championed by the European Union. Given that we will want European support for whatever actions we eventually decide to take in the Persian Gulf or in North Korea, is this really the time to mount what is bound to be a bitter, high-profile case in order to sell genetically modified potatoes? 
It is, indeed, appalling that some countries would rather starve than accept donations of genetically modified corn. But trying to force genetically modified food down European throats is the surest way to guarantee that they swallow neither the potatoes nor a lot of other more important American proposals.

HEADLINE: Chairman Resigns From E*Trade; His Big Pay Package Angered Investors 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Christos M. Cotsakos, the flamboyant chairman of the E*Trade Group whose huge pay packages have angered investors, resigned suddenly yesterday.
 E*Trade, the online brokerage firm, said the departure of Mr. Cotsakos, who gave back part of an $80 million compensation package last summer, was a mutual decision made by him and the company's directors. Mitchell H. Caplan, the company's president, will succeed Mr. Cotsakos as chief executive. A director, George Hayter, will become the board's nonexecutive chairman. 
 In an interview, Mr. Cotsakos, who will receive severance of $4 million, said there was no story behind his resignation.
"There's never a right time or a good time," he said. "There's just a moment. This was the right time to do something different."
Mr. Cotsakos, 54, said he planned to write books, teach children and become involved with "entrepreneurial start-ups."
E*Trade, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has had some success in branching out from stock trading into online banking. But its stock price has languished, some analysts said, because investors remained concerned about how Mr. Cotsakos was running the company.
"From an investor's standpoint, this removes one big source of controversy," said Ken Smith, co-manager of the Munder NetNet fund, which owns about six million shares of E*Trade. "He got paid a lot of money and, to some degree, he probably deserved it. He took a real small company and made it into a household name."
Mr. Smith said the change in command did not alter his opinion of the company's prospects because he did not expect any change in operations. But, he said, the stock could rise on the news because "this takes away something that might have caused other investors to not look at it."
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, E*Trade's shares were unchanged at $4.49, down 93 percent from their high in April 1999.
Richard H. Repetto, an analyst at Putnam Lovell NBF in New York, lowered his estimate of the stock's fair value to $6 from $7 to $8 this week, after the company gave a measured outlook for the coming year. But he said he expected the executive change to give the stock a lift.
"Investors were concerned about governance," Mr. Repetto said. "The stock has traded at a discount to its peers. I attributed the discount to a number of factors, not the least of which was corporate governance."
Flush with commissions paid by individual investors during the stock-trading frenzy of the late 1990's, Mr. Cotsakos went on a spending spree. He appeared with a chimpanzee in ads that ran during the 2002 Super Bowl, the most expensive commercial time on television.
E*Trade also sponsored the halftime show at the Super Bowl for three years, before dropping its sponsorship this year. Lately, it has been sponsoring the Rolling Stones' concert tour. The company also opened flashy stores in high-rent districts, including one on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.
For years, Mr. Cotsakos traveled frequently to London in pursuit of a doctorate from the London School of Economics. He completed the degree last year. Under fire from investors for his pay, Mr. Cotsakos agreed last year to forfeit $21 million of the $80 million the company had agreed to pay him for 2001.
The company also received criticism for its practice of lending large sums to its executives to buy homes in Silicon Valley at the height of the housing market there. All of those loans have been repaid and the company will make no more, Mr. Cotsakos said. 
Mr. Caplan, 45, is succeeding Mr. Cotsakos on the board, too. He declined to say how much he would be paid, but said that his compensation would be determined by a committee of independent directors and would be "in alignment" with that of his peers. Mr. Caplan, a more staid executive who has overseen E*Trade's push into electronic banking, said the company remained committed to providing online brokerage services.
Mr. Cotsakos predicted that his detractors would be proved wrong eventually.
"If you build the right franchise, the stock price will always follow," he said. "That will bear things out over time."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Christos M. Cotsakos as chairman and chief executive of the E*Trade Group misidentified the university from which he earned a doctorate. It is the University of London, not the London School of Economics.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
The Era of the Medici, Merchants Who Longed to Be Monarchs

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Art patronage on a grand scale is about getting power, holding on to it and making it look pretty. That's a central premise of "The Medici, Michelangelo and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence" at the Art Institute of Chicago, a show packed like a bank vault with precious objects, many of them associated with a family of middle-class merchant-bankers who strove to be kings.
 Indeed, the very words Medici and Florence evoke certain art images: the rectitudinous sculptures of Lorenzo Ghiberti; Filippo Lippi's peachy madonnas, Luca della Robbia's ceramic putti and swags. The dynasty's progenitor, Cosimo de' Medici (1389-1464), advanced the careers of all these artists, simultaneously gilding his own reputation as a man of liberality and taste. 
 His grandson, Lorenzo, called the Magnificent, nurtured the young Michelangelo, bringing him to live under his roof. Lorenzo's largesse paid off. Michelangelo (1475-1564) became a megastar, bigger than Florence, bigger than Italy, bigger than life. And as his reputation spread throughout Europe, it lent his hometown patrons the kind of luster by association that money alone cannot buy.
Cultural capital produced political capital. The Medici began moving in rarefied international circles. They made good marriages, which led to even better marriages, which led to exalted socio-economic alliances; two Medici women became queens of France. The family also did well on the ecclesiastical front, producing three popes and consolidating a strategic base in Rome. 
Art patronage played a role in dynastic advancement, and Michelangelo remained a crucial shaper of the Medici image. In 1519, he was asked to design a new facade for the family church of San Lorenzo and to create a family tomb. The facade project fell through, and he left the tomb unfinished when he went to Rome in 1534, never to return to Florence. Yet the sculptures he completed -- among them four allegorical figures representing times of day, and the sweet, sleepy David or Apollo that is in the show here -- determined the course of Florentine art.
The exhibition, organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Polo Museale Fiorentina, travels to Detroit (March 16 to June 8) after closing here on Feb. 2.
It starts with the years just after Michelangelo's departure, with the coming to power in 1537 of a second Cosimo -- Cosimo di Giovanni delle Bande Nere de' Medici (1519-74) -- who established a new family line and the first autocratic Medici court. While Cosimo the Elder had presented himself as a citizen among citizens, his namesake assumed a fancy title: Cosimo I, duke of Florence and grand duke of Tuscany. The art he sponsored matched and amplified his regal aspirations.
If, for example, he couldn't have Michelangelo himself, he would at least hire artists who inventively emulated him. Among the most interesting was Jacopo Carrucci, known as Pontormo (1494-1557), a peculiar man and a fantastically inventive painter, as is suggested by a drawing in the show. It is a highly idiosyncratic version of one of Michelangelo's Medici tomb figures, in which the various anatomical parts -- head, buttocks, legs -- seem to belong to different bodies but together make a freakish, Mannerist sort of sense.
Freakish was perhaps not quite what Cosimo I had in mind for a new Medici look. So he turned for an alternative to Pontormo's cool-minded pupil Agnolo Bronzino, whose high-resolution technique and flair for flattering stylization was more the ticket.
Not that Bronzino was dull. No image in the exhibition is more audacious than his portrait of the young Cosimo as a nude Orpheus, all cushiony flesh and erotic gestures. Equally riveting is his depiction of the duke's aristocratic wife, Eleonora of Toledo, who is nearly devoured by the assertively patterned gown she wears. This is a copy of a picture that was such a hit that Bronzino and his workshop made several versions.
Bronzino's portraits, including one of the poet Laura Battiferra degli Ammanati, shown in eaglelike profile, represent high points of the Medici archducal aesthetic. At the same time, many other artists were competing for Cosimo's eye and purse, and for the attentions of his son and successor, Francesco.
Laura's husband, the sculptor Bartolomeo Ammanati, was one. He is represented by two pieces, one of them a bronze figure of a nubile goddess demurely cupping her breasts like a 1950's Playboy bunny. Another was the prolific and influential Giovanni Bologna, known as Giambologna, whose blank-eyed portrait bust of Francesco makes this notoriously introverted ruler -- he rarely met his subjects face to face and went out only at night -- look unreadably formidable.
Then there is that gifted factotum, Giorgio Vasari, who made history chiefly by writing it. His "Lives of the Most Eminent Architects, Painters and Sculptors" remains the primary biographical document of the period and his lasting claim to fame. At the same time, he had a busy career as a painter, architect and supervisor of Medici projects.
For Cosimo he oversaw the renovation of the Palazzo Vecchio, the old Medici stronghold, covering its shabbily genteel interior with Mannerist frescoes a la mode. For Francesco, he created the famous Studiolo, a small, windowless, densely ornamented room within the palace. Used to store and display the myriad objects that Francesco collected, it was an Italian version of the kunstkammer, or cabinet of art and wonders, that appeared elsewhere in Europe in the 16th century.
In a sense, the entire exhibition is a giant kunstkammer, chock full of virtuosically fashioned things, each delivering a promotional spin, overt or implied. Tapestries and luxury textiles are reminders of Florence's role as a center for silk production and weaving. Work in pietre dure, or stone inlay, may also be seen as a vehicle of self-advertising: this eye-grabbing art was a Florentine specialty.
As evidence of dynastic enterprise, there are the so-called Medici porcelains, the first porcelains made in Europe. They were experimental, and production was quickly discontinued. Of the 60 or so surviving examples, one of the most elaborate, a large ewer painted with chinoiserie dragons, is in the exhibition. It now belongs to the Detroit Institute of Arts. The accumulation of such insistently decorative items eventually makes the show, which is not small, exhausting. Like the Metropolitan Museum of Art's earnest Vermeer exhibition last year, the result is reminiscent of a scholarly essay that crams in every last bit of supporting data, when a shorter text and fewer illustrations might have made the main points more persuasively.
Of course, overwhelmingness was what the Medici dukes were after, and the show's curators -- Marco Chiarini, Alan P. Darr and Larry J. Feinberg -- get that exactly right. It may say something about our own hype-battered modern tastes, though, that the single most moving work -- a wooden crucifix attributed to the aged Michelangelo -- is also visually the most modest. Small, sketchily carved and unfinished, thought to have been a gift for his nephew, it seems to emerge from a private, interior world in which surface polish and earthly ambition play little role. It too is power art, but of a very different kind.

HEADLINE: Marxist to Rightist, and Back to Court 

BYLINE:  By DESMOND BUTLER

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Horst Mahler, a former Marxist urban guerrilla and lawyer for the Red Army Faction, now represents the extreme right-wing National Democratic Party. But the virulence of his views has not diminished, and his outspoken comments on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States have landed him back where he was decades ago -- in court.
 Last week, Mr. Mahler went on trial here on charges of approving of crimes and inciting violence, and could face three years in jail if convicted. A few weeks after the attacks in 2001, in a broadcast interview with Norddeutscher Rundfunk, the public network in North Germany, he called the terrorists' actions justified. 
 "It was frightening, but one also had the feeling that at last, finally, they had been hit in the heart," Mr. Mahler said then. "And it will certainly make them think. So, I say it was an action that, as cruel as it was, was justified."
In other comments in a letter posted on his Web site, Mr. Mahler has expressed more strident admiration for the Sept. 11 attacks.
"For decades, the jihad -- the holy war -- has been the agenda of the Islamic world against the Western value system. The Anglo-American and European employees of the global players, dispersed throughout the world are -- as Osama bin Laden proclaimed a long while ago -- military targets. Only a few need be liquidated in this manner; the survivors will run off like hares into their respective home countries, where they belong."
Mr. Mahler, 67, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1974 for bank robberies in connection with the Red Army Faction terrorist group. Once part of the extreme left that violently opposed residual Nazi tendencies in Germany, he is now known for anti-Semitic and anti-American rants.
In the opening day of his trial, Mr. Mahler confirmed the comments about the Sept. 11 attacks, but argued that the program's editing took them out of context. In a telephone interview, he explained, "I stand by what I said, but they cut out some of my other comments in which I said that this is not the way to fight back. The oppressed should win not with war, but with spiritual debate."
Prof. Hajo Funke, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University, studies right-wing extremism and was once a student with Mr. Mahler in the 1960's. He said the activist and his party are generally careful to stay within legal bounds when voicing their views, in part because the party faces a proposed government ban, which it is currently contesting in Germany's constitutional court.
"As a lawyer, he knows where the boundaries are and usually disguises his message," Mr. Funke said of Mr. Mahler.
By apparently justifying a violent act, Mr. Mahler may have infringed the law and weakened his party's case. Last year, Mr. Mahler was fined 7,200 euros in another German court for similar comments about the attacks.
German law limits free speech in cases of incitement and hate. The statutes were strengthened in the 1980's after complaints from Germany's Jewish community that post-war laws were too vague to prosecute neo-Nazis for propaganda, especially denials of the Holocaust. The Constitution also allows the banning of extremist political parties.
"These laws arose from the background of Germany's Nazi past and the persecution of the Jews," said Klaus Geppert, a law professor at the Free University. "Because of the German experience, we cannot accept anti-Semitic or racist expression."
According to Mr. Funke, Mr. Mahler's party has won followers by combining anti-Semitism and xenophobia with conspiracy theories about American power. Between 1996 and 2000, party membership grew from 3,500 to 6,500 members, particularly from unemployed youth in the eastern part of Germany.
"Mahler's vision is the most destructive of all of those expressed by German neo-Nazis," Mr. Funke said. "This is a confluence of Hitler's anti-Semitism and anti-imperialist nationalism."
In the Hamburg court last week, Mr. Mahler called the United States, "the bloodiest and most imperialist power the world has ever seen," according to the Associated Press.
He also said the Sept. 11 attacks were part of an American conspiracy. "It's not true that Al Qaeda had anything to do with it," he said.
The comments appeared to reflect an unsettling development in Mr. Mahler's ideology. In October, Mr. Mahler and his party's leader, Udo Voigt, reportedly attended an event at Berlin's Technical University sponsored by Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic militant group with 27,000 members in Germany that was recently banned here for extremism and for spreading anti-Semitic propaganda in universities.
For Mr. Mahler, making common cause with Islamic groups has some precedent. He and other members of the Red Army Faction received terrorist training in Lebanon in the early 1970's from Al Fatah.
Mr. Mahler, who is defending his party in court against the government petition to ban it, is not the only former leftist in Germany to have made a political transformation. The German Interior Minister, Otto Schily, who instigated the government's petition, was also a Red Army Faction lawyer, and he once represented Mr. Mahler while he was a fugitive in the underground.

HEADLINE: Deficit Tripled, Los Angeles Archdiocese Says 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which cut 60 jobs and pared numerous programs last year in an effort to bridge a $4.3 million budget gap, has released figures showing that the deficit has more than tripled. 
 Officials of the archdiocese, the largest in the country, now project that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30, will reach $13.4 million. One-time costs, including settlements resulting from sexual abuse lawsuits, accounted for $7.7 million of the estimated shortfall. In addition, the diocese said, the operating deficit has grown to $5.7 million, a $1.4 million increase. The total budget is $43.4 million. 
 "Various options are being considered to address the projected deficit, such as the use of reserves," the diocese said in Thursday's report. "The impact of any action is contingent, in part, on the outcome of the current litigation facing the archdiocese."
About a dozen lawsuits claiming child sexual abuse by members of the clergy, including a class-action suit, are pending against the archdiocese, and lawyers representing people who say they have been abused say there may be many more cases.
"We've made the Los Angeles Archdiocese aware of the existence of a couple hundred victims," said Raymond P. Boucher, who represents more than 200 people in the class-action suit he filed last summer. 
The diocese says it has paid out $3.5 million for such litigation costs since 1985, with insurance paying an additional $4 million to $5 million. While the cost of future litigation remains uncertain, the diocese is estimated to have about $150 million in insurance coverage.
The archdiocese's financial disclosure comes as lawyers for the church and victims have been meeting to discuss how to proceed with the cases and examine the potential for settlements.
Mr. Boucher questioned the timing of the diocese's release of the information.
"I don't think it is coincidental," he said. "It's designed to help them develop some sympathy for the position they want people to think they're in. It's all about suppressing these cases."
Tod Tamberg, director of communications for the archdiocese, said the reports were issued annually.
"As to those who would say the church is trying to look as poor as possible, the audited report is there," Mr. Tamberg said. "There's nothing hidden."
From 2001 to 2002, the archdiocese's assets fell to $626.4 million, from $643.7 million, according to the report. Much of the decrease was in investments that lost value or were sold to cover operating expenses. At the same time, the archdiocese has seen insurance and pension costs rise.
"The church is subject to the same market forces as other nonprofit organizations," Mr. Tamberg said. "Economic conditions have not been good and are unlikely to improve in the near-term."
The budget covers the church headquarters, and it finances departments that provide pastoral support to parishes, schools, seminaries and other institutions in the archdiocese. Individual parishes, the new Our Lady of the Angels cathedral, as well as schools, hospitals and other institutions, have their own budgets.
Although the archdiocese will have to reduce administrative costs, Mr. Tamberg said, it has not determined whether more layoffs will be necessary.
Pledges were down about $7.6 million. Officials said that was because fund-raising for the new cathedral came to an end and noted that giving was increasing at the parish level. Donations in local parishes rose by more than $5 million in fiscal year 2002, to $153.8 million, from $148.6 million in 2001.
"I think that's an indication that Catholics continue to remain strongly rooted in their faith and their local Catholic communities," Mr. Tamberg said.

HEADLINE: In Land of Vacant Apartments, a Renter's Market 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Erik C. Strandberg and Lisa Sjostedt began their search for a Manhattan apartment last year with low expectations: they figured they would end up paying a fortune for a dark and dingy one-bedroom.
 Instead, they lucked into a tenant's market. After the landlord offered them three months' free rent and other inducements, cutting their effective cost by nearly $1,000 a month, they moved on Jan. 1 from Florida into an apartment with wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows on the 42nd floor of the Victory, a new tower at 41st Street and 10th Avenue. 
 "It was a huge surprise," said Ms. Strandberg, 24. "We ended up getting a beautiful apartment." 
For the first time in more than a decade, landlords are dangling free rent, Internet service, health club memberships, parking and just about anything else to lure tenants into their buildings. Concessions of one kind or another are available at high-rises from One Sutton Place North on the Upper East Side to the Avalon Riverview on the waterfront in Long Island City. But nowhere are the benefits more generous than on the far West Side of Manhattan, where nearly a dozen new buildings have opened in recent months with several thousand apartments.
"Until recently, you never heard of landlords giving free rent," said Michael Shapot, a broker at Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy. "You had tenants lined up with boatloads of cash to rent apartments as they came on the market. But with the changing economy and the softening of the rental market, landlords need to offer incentives or lower the rent or both." 
The sweetest deals in the city may be at the Victory, Mr. Shapot said. The 47-story tower opened last year, with 417 apartments. Mr. Strandberg said his apartment had been discounted to $2,850 a month from $3,150. After some negotiating, Mr. Strandberg said, the couple got three months' free rent and free Internet service, bringing their effective rent down to about $2,200 a month on their one-bedroom apartment.
Within a few blocks of the Victory, there are a half-dozen other new towers, whose banners heralding deals are fluttering in the frigid winds. Among them are River Place, with 900 apartments, at 42nd Street and 12th Avenue; the New Gotham on West 43rd Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues; and 360 West 43rd Street, as well as the Pennmark, Chelsea Tower, Ritz Plaza and Rivergate.
"For a while, it was the landlord's day," said David L. Picket, president of the Gotham Organization, a developer with five rental buildings in Manhattan, including three on the West Side. "Now it's the tenant's day."
This does not mean that Manhattan apartments are suddenly inexpensive, not in a city where a quarter of all tenants spend more than half their income on rent. Ms. Sjostedt and Mr. Strandberg, 24, for instance, moved to New York from Tampa, where they rented what they considered an overpriced one-bedroom apartment for $1,050 a month, less than half of what they now pay.
During the real estate boom in the 1990's, the average rent for a Manhattan apartment jumped 88 percent, to $3,096 in 2000, which was the peak, according to the Feathered Nest, a real estate company specializing in rentals.
Since then, rents have retreated by more than 20 percent. Still, the average price today is about $2,350 a month.
Nancy Packes, president of the Feathered Nest, does not expect a quick turnaround. With layoffs continuing on Wall Street and in other industries, New York City's unemployment rate has climbed to 8.4 percent, the highest since March 1998.
"Every time you pick up the paper, you see companies contracting or leaving New York," said Daniel Brodsky, a developer who recently built a 41-story tower at 420 West 42nd Street and is completing the two-building complex at 360 West 43rd Street. "It's not a mass exodus, but college graduates aren't so quick to get jobs anymore."
As a result, landlords are forced to offer free rent and other inducements for the first time since 1991, the last downturn in the real estate market. But free rent only lasted for about nine months, Mr. Brodsky said. This time around, he said, the tenant's market will last longer.
Already, tenants expect to get at least one month of free rent when they sign a lease, brokers say. Some landlords have raised their asking rents so that they appear to be offering a discount during negotiations.
But for the most part, brokers say that every landlord in Manhattan is offering something, even to existing tenants who want to renew their leases, because they have to compete with new buildings where developers are anxious to fill their apartments.
The situation may get even more competitive on the far West Side in neighborhoods like Clinton and Chelsea.
The Feathered Nest estimates that 15 more buildings, with 3,865 units, will go up in the next three years between 31st and 59th Streets, all on the West Side.
Developers have long sought to gentrify the Clinton neighborhood, a working-class and semi-industrial area also known as Hell's Kitchen. But towers built during the real estate boom of the 1980's were forced to cut rents and provide free rent in 1991 after the boom turned into a depression.
Construction began anew in the late 1990's and the city announced plans to rezone the area for high-rise development, a football stadium and the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, partly in a bid to lure the Olympics to New York in 2012. But developers are once again reducing rents and dangling free rent in front of tenants.
At Riverbank West, a 44-story tower with 418 apartments at 11th Avenue and 42nd Street, the landlord is offering one and two months' free rent, much as it did in the early 1990's, when the original owner lost the building to his lenders. A block away at 12th Avenue, River Place is also offering incentives, two years after it opened.
Brokers say that buildings closer to Ninth Avenue, where there are restaurants, supermarkets and hardware stores, have an advantage, although discounts are available there as well.
"I think it's going to last for a while," Ms. Packes, of Feathered Nest, said of the free rent and other concessions. "The problem here is pure supply and demand."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
StockIndexes And the Dollar Fall Sharply

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The worsening outlook for corporate earnings and the threat of a war with Iraq weighed heavily on Wall Street yesterday, as the three leading stock gauges fell more than 2.9 percent, giving the stock market its second consecutive week of losses.
 The dollar also sank, falling almost 1 percent against the euro and 0.3 percent against the Japanese yen. Analysts said the decrease, which continues the dollar's decline of 8.3 percent against the euro since December, can be attributed to geopolitical concerns and doubts about the strength of the American economy. 
 Gold prices, meanwhile, soared 1 percent, to a six-year high of $368.40 an ounce, also reflecting worries about an Iraqi war, as well as the fall in stocks and the dollar. 
It is hard to quantify how the threat of an Iraqi war is affecting the stock market. But some Wall Street analysts are saying that the growing split between the United States and its allies is not helping, especially because it makes it appear more likely that Washington could enter a war nearly alone.
"I think the market is having a Rolaids moment," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston. "It's not the going to war. The problem is that we don't have the support of many other countries."
Fane Lozman, chairman of Scanshift, a Chicago research firm, said that "until the war is over, there is no reason to buy this market."
The Dow finished the day down 238.46 points, or 2.9 percent, at 8,131.01, while the S.& P. 500 was off 25.94 points, or 2.9 percent, to 861.40. The Nasdaq composite index fell 46.13 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,342.14. The Dow is off 2.5 percent for the year and the S.& P. is down 2.1 percent, while the Nasdaq is up 0.5 percent.
The market was led lower yesterday by the American International Group, the insurer, which plunged 8 percent after it was downgraded by Morgan Stanley. The market was also dragged lower by 3M, Microsoft, I.B.M., General Electric and Intel.
The price of crude oil for March delivery rose $1.03, or 3.2 percent, to $33.28 a barrel, after Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said that it was "unacceptable" for Iraq to bar Iraqi scientists from talking to United Nations weapons inspectors. Despite the fall in the stock market and the tension over Iraq, bond prices were little changed.
The decline in the stock market over the last two weeks has pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index into negative territory after a strong start to 2003, with the Dow up as much as 6 percent for the year at one point. Now all three market gauges are at their lows for the year. The weakening of the market comes just ahead of next week's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers to decide if the economy needs another lift from a cut in interest rates. But most analysts do not expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate, which is at a four-decade low of 1.25 percent.
The outlook for corporate earnings in the first two quarters is clouding up quickly, as Wall Street analysts have been cutting their profit estimates based on the lukewarm forecasts that many companies gave when they announced their fourth-quarter earnings.
Microsoft cut its 2003 sales forecasts. Intel reduced its capital spending for the year. AT&T said it did not expect the telecommunications sector to improve in 2003 after a dismal 2002. Eli Lilly reduced its earnings forecast for the first quarter and the entire year. And I.B.M. said it still faced challenges. 
"Our fears that the slashing of first-half estimates would continue is coming true," said Chuck Hill, director for research at Thomson First Call, which collects Wall Street earnings estimates. "The first and second quarters are going to be lower then the fourth." 
The earnings growth forecast for the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2002, is down to 10.8 percent, from 11.7 percent on Jan. 1 and 17.4 percent on Oct. 1, according to Thomson First Call. The second-quarter forecast is down to 9.4 percent, from 10.9 percent on Jan. 1 and 16.4 percent on Oct. 1. Fourth-quarter earnings growth is expected to come in near 13 percent.
As for the dollar's decline -- to $1.0844 against the euro and 117.69 against the Japanese yen -- Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup, said Iraq was not solely to blame. He pointed out that the British pound, the currency of the United States' staunchest ally against Iraq, has been rising sharply against the dollar. Yesterday, it rose 0.8 percent, to $1.6336, and is up 4.9 percent since December.
So there is also "concern for the United States and the global economy," Mr. Sinche said, and that is making investors defensive. When currency investors are defensive, they usually turn their money back into their local currency to avoid losses or favor currencies, like the euro, that offer higher interest rates.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 3.93 percent from 3.94 percent Thursday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 3/32 , to 100 19/32

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INTERNATIONAL FORUM; 
Ashcroft Soaks Up a World of Complaints

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Attorney General John Ashcroft came here today to explain to the world's rich, powerful and just plain pushy the Bush administration's tactics in its campaign against terror. In the process, he faced a barrage of questions, not all of them from the usual suspects.
 Paul Sagan, an American technology executive from Cambridge, Mass., for instance, told Mr. Ashcroft after lunch in an luxury hotel: "I'm concerned about the way Americans are perceived. Why do you think we are perceived as being not on the right side by a lot of the world? Often we are seen on the wrong side." 
 Earlier, at a meeting of the World Economic Forum -- an annual gathering of some 2,000 business, political, religious and other leaders -- Kumi Naidoo, head of an umbrella organization of civil rights groups, took Mr. Ashcroft to task over the way America has conducted its antiterror campaign since Sept. 11.
"We are seeing large levels of alienation across this planet from the war on terrorism," he said in one of several sharp exchanges with Mr. Ashcroft. "What we are saying is that certain fundamental tenets of democracy are being violated."
Kenneth Roth, who is the head of Human Rights Watch U.S.A, said America's "unwillingness to be bound by international standards has bred distrust and is harming the U.S.'s standing in the world and the war against terrorism."
At a separate session yesterday, Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor at Princeton, said the central issue being debated in the world now was American power and the opposition to it.
Recalling that the World Economic Forum met last year in New York City in part out of sympathy following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, Professor Slaughter added, "The agenda has shifted." 
The response by American participants to the criticism today seemed to be that the Bush administration can live with dueling perceptions of the United States as both protector and persecutor. 
"There may be many people who don't like the pre-eminence of America," said David Dreier, a Republican congressman from California, another participant. "But they do like Americans to be there" in times of crisis.
"The U.S. is essentially a provider of most of the building blocks of international peace and security," said Richard Haass, a State Department official.
Or, as Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, added: "Nobody likes the big guy on the block. We are every country's problem and every country's solution."
As the United States prepares for possible war with Iraq, the challenge facing Mr. Ashcroft and other American officials is to counter the argument from critics in Europe and the Arab and Muslim world that the twin wars on terror and Iraq will create so much resentment that it will breed a new generation of anti-American terrorists.
While Mr. Ashcroft said that the American aim was to prevent acts of terror before they took place rather than prosecute the perpetrators afterward, Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia, turned to the attorney general across a stage and, in front of hundreds of participants, said, "To say you must do preventive actions irrespective of the causes is wrong."
The terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center "did it because they were incensed with something and we have to find out why they were incensed," Dr. Mahathir said. "We should try not to amplify the situation, anger them more and lead more people to join this group of people."
Mr. Ashcroft replied, "I am not prepared to say we have to give up values to appease the terrorist."
Critics from the United States, Europe and the Muslim world specifically challenged many of the Bush administration's antiterrorism measures, including its detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, its refusal to identify by name people detained in the United States and its decision to register foreigners from selected, mostly Muslim, nations.
It is, however, the looming possibility of war with Iraq that underpins a sense among some critics that Washington's overwhelming dominance as the world's only superpower has somehow lessened its standing in the world. "We expect more wise guy than big guy," said Amr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League.

HEADLINE: Police Worried About Recent Increase in Bank Robberies 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
It is a simple crime. A note that threatens violence, slipped to a teller, is all it takes to get a wad of cash. The average take is $1,700.
 Though surveillance cameras are watching, chances are they are recording onto videotape that has been used over and over, rendering images too blurry to be of much use to the authorities. The robber can often stroll away with hardly anyone knowing what has just happened and then run to a nearby subway station to make a clean getaway. 
 This scenario is playing out with increasing frequency in banks across New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday. While robbery overall is down in the city, bank robberies, particularly unarmed ones in which the robber uses a threatening note to get cash, jumped 14 percent over the past two years.
Since Jan. 1 there have been 36 unarmed robberies of banks. Last year at this date there had been 13.
The rate of armed bank robberies, which remained flat at 55 a year over the past two years, has also increased, slightly, this year, Mr. Kelly said.
The Police Department announced plans yesterday to counter the increase in robberies. It will put a system into effect for tracking and mapping bank robberies, using a program similar to the Compstat system that tracks major crimes in the city, Mr. Kelly said. The department will also call commanders to police headquarters each week to report on their progress and will use undercover detectives at banks it considers vulnerable.
Mr. Kelly said that while several factors had contributed to the increase in robberies -- the sluggish economy being the most obvious -- much of it may be attributable to a change in the way banks do business. 
"As the banks become more customer friendly, they become more robber friendly," Mr. Kelly said. 
Many neighborhood bank branches have done away with shields that once separated tellers from customers, and counters now are often lower.
Banks have extended their hours, closing later, and opening on weekends. There are more neighborhood branches, and a growing number in supermarkets.
Poor surveillance equipment also makes it harder to catch thieves. Many branches use outdated video gear and reuse tapes, making the images they capture all but worthless.
At the same time, Mr. Kelly said, banks are hiring fewer armed guards. All of these factors make banks inviting targets, he said.
Part of the problem is that the banks themselves do not seem to take these robberies very seriously, Mr. Kelly said. 
Police officials are meeting with bank security officials to urge them to buy new high-quality digital cameras and use standardized description sheets to help identify robbers. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to send letters next week to the chief executive officers of banks, asking them to cooperate in addressing the robbery problem, Mr. Kelly said. 
Those in the banking industry defended their efforts, saying they take robberies very seriously. 
"Bankers and their customers and employees are victims in these situations," said John Hall, spokesman for the American Bankers Association. "They do all they can to prevent robberies."
Mr. Hall said that the fact that arrests are made in 7 out of 10 bank robberies in the city shows that banks are helping police. 
But John W. Kennish, a consultant who has worked with banks on robbery prevention, said upgrading security equipment is simply not a priority for many banks. 
"The mission of a bank is to make a profit, and the actuaries show that internal crimes at a bank are where they lose the high numbers," Mr. Kennish said. "Computer theft, employee theft, embezzlement and loan fraud -- that is where they lose a lot of money."
The police arrested a man Thursday night who they believe was responsible for four bank robberies last year, and are searching for several other serial bank robbers.
One is a man they believe has robbed 32 banks since August 2001 using a note that says he will shoot customers if the teller does not hand over money. 
The police are seeking two men who the authorities say have robbed seven banks in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, including one yesterday. The method the men use is to walk in, fire a shot in the air and jump over the counter to take cash.

 BODY:
Federal Pension Agency Said to Disclose Big Deficit
The federal agency that insures the pensions of 44 million Americans has been pounded by a succession of big corporate bankruptcies and has burned through its entire $8 billion surplus in one year.
 Though it can continue to make its current payments, the agency is expected to disclose a deficit of $1 billion to $2 billion at the end of this month. Its soundness is likely to deteriorate further in the coming months. Page A1. 

Democrats Introduce Stimulus Plan
Senate Democrats took on the administration's tax-cut plan in earnest with the release of a sharply different economic stimulus proposal, calling for a $300-a-person rebate check and $40 billion in aid to states and cities. A1.

Reality TV Paves Way for Revamping
Executives from the big networks watched in awe as reality shows won 15 of 18 half-hour network time periods on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, and finished second in the other three time slots. The success of shows like "Joe Millionaire" on Fox, starring Evan Marriott, was so impressive that numerous executives said they were ready to embrace plans for a radical restructuring. A1.

HealthSouth to Appoint Outsiders
HealthSouth is expected to announce on Monday that four outsiders, including some well-known shareholder advocates, will join three HealthSouth directors in advising the company on corporate governance matters and the selection of new independent directors, according to people briefed on the decision. C2.

Federal Deficit Increases Sharply
New government data show that from last October through December, the federal government ran a deficit of $109 billion, nearly three times as big as the year before. The new shortfall has already complicated the calculations behind Mr. Bush's budget proposal for 2004, which he is to announce on Feb. 3. A14.

Good Showing for Weapons Makers
Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, reported an 11 percent increase in 2002 sales. Raytheon, which makes Stinger and Tomahawk missiles, reported that its fourth-quarter operating profit doubled. C2.

Mexico Keeps Eye on U.S. Indicators
Few people watch every economic indicator from Washington more closely than Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, and his economic team. That is because Mexico needs United States growth to jump-start its own sluggish economy. C3.

Medicare Outreach Efforts Halted
Running short of money, the government has told Medicare contractors to halt outreach and education activities, intended to inform millions of beneficiaries of their rights under the federal health insurance program. A12.

G.E. Creates Asia Post in Reshuffling
As it looks to reverse lackluster results, General Electric appointed chief executives at two lagging industrial units, plastics and transportation systems, and created a position in Asia. G.E. created a similar post for Europe, the Middle East and Africa more than a year ago, winning praise from customers and company business units. C2.

American Electric Posts Big Loss
American Electric Power reported a fourth-quarter loss of $837 million and said that it would cut its dividend to preserve cash. The company also said it had eliminated 1,300 jobs in the quarter. C4.

Mattel Wins Damages in Patent Suit
Mattel won $1.9 million in damages when a jury found that a rival, Safety 1st, had infringed patents for portable bassinets and baby bouncers. C4.

Profit at Stanley Works Triples
Stanley Works, a leading maker of hand tools, said fourth-quarter profit more than tripled, to $21.9 million, as sales increased, helped by the acquisition of Best Lock. C4.

 CORRECTION:
An article and an entry in the News Summary on Saturday about an ethics investigation concerning Lloyd Ward, chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, referred imprecisely to a report on the case by a panel headed by Kenneth M. Duberstein. On Jan. 13 the panel found that Mr. Ward had "created the appearance of a conflict of interest" by directing a staff member to help advance a business proposal by a company run by his brother, and that he should have disclosed what he had done. Mr. Ward was not "exonerated" -- either by the ethics panel or by Mr. Duberstein personally.

HEADLINE: Council Says M.T.A. Can Put Off Fare Increase 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, said yesterday that financial statements from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority appeared to show that it had several hundred million dollars in surplus money that could be used to fill its projected budget gap and defer a fare increase for at least another year.
 Transit officials immediately denied that any such surplus existed, saying that the money -- about $670 million shown as extra assets on its 2001 balance sheet -- is almost completely committed in a variety of ways, from paying debt costs to buying spare subway parts to providing change for token clerks. 
 "There's virtually nothing there you could use," said the authority's budget director, Gary G. Caplan. "You'd basically be selling off the system to raise cash." 
Several City Council members held a news conference yesterday to discuss their analysis of the authority's financial statements and to denounce plans for a fare increase to $1.75 or $2 by the spring.
"Will it someday be necessary?" Mr. Miller said. "Of course. But this is not the time." He added that many Council members were suspicious that a fare increase was simply a way for Gov. George E. Pataki to try to help the state's ailing finances by reducing state aid to the city's transit system.
Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman and a Pataki appointee, issued a terse statement questioning the accounting skills of John C. Liu, chairman of the Council's transportation committee, which has been pressing the authority for better explanations of its finances. 
"Councilman Liu simply cannot understand financial statements," Mr. Kalikow said. 
City Council members conceded that much of the surplus money was probably not immediately accessible. But they added that at a time when the city was facing huge fiscal problems, high unemployment and rising property taxes, extreme measures should be made to keep fares level.

Mexico Is Struggling Under New President

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Few people watch every economic indicator from Washington more closely than Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, and his economic team.
 That is because Mexico, probably more than any other country in the world, needs United States growth to jump-start its own sluggish economy. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's export industries have become deeply integrated into United States manufacturing and are the country's most dynamic. About 90 percent of what Mexico sells abroad goes north of the border. 
 Because of the sputtering United States economy, Mexico's economic performance during Mr. Fox's first two years in office has been bleak. The economy shrank 0.3 percent in 2001, and analysts expect that the figures from last year will show growth of just over 1 percent.
This year, the government's target is a modest 3 percent, based on forecasts that the United States economy will expand, increasing demand for exports from Mexico and driving investment in Mexico's export industries.
Continued anemic growth will worsen Mexico's social inequities and push more people to migrate to the United States. More than a million young people enter the work force each year and 53 percent of the population lives in poverty. The government and private analysts agree that steady growth of at least 5 percent is needed to meet job demand and begin to raise the standard of living for Mexicans.
During his campaign, Mr. Fox promised 7 percent growth. But he cannot wait for the elusive United States recovery to propel his economy. Analysts say he needs to carry out major structural changes -- of the tax code, of the electricity industry and of the labor laws -- that will raise Mexico's productivity and attract more investment from abroad.
So far, however, despite Mr. Fox's efforts, those measures have been stuck in Congress. And with congressional elections set for July, few believe that legislators will approve the controversial changes.
"Mexico could be one of the two or three most dynamic places on the globe," said Gray Newman, senior Latin America economist for Morgan Stanley in New York. "Where else do you have the largest capital market on one side and a huge labor market next door?"
Even when the United States does begin to recover, Mexico will have to compete for investment capital with countries that offer cheaper labor. Mexico has already lost some jobs in the apparel and electronics industries to China.
"The failure of Mexican policy makers to move forward on the reform agenda has limited their ability to take advantage of their next-door neighbor," Mr. Newman said.
As an oil exporter, the only bright economic spot for Mexico right now is the current high price of oil. But even that is a mixed blessing, because high oil prices will crimp a United States recovery.
The proposed structural changes are important because Mr. Fox does not have room to maneuver to raise spending or to cut taxes -- common prescriptions for economic stimulus in developed countries. He cannot risk losing Mexico's coveted investment-grade rating, earned through years of prudent fiscal discipline and debt reduction.
"The best stimulus that the Mexican government can give to reactivate the economy is to maintain macroeconomic stability and certainty based on monetary and fiscal discipline," said Raul Martinez-Ostos, a spokesman for the finance ministry.
But that discipline can hurt. The peso fell to record lows against the dollar this week, in what Wall Street analysts say is an overreaction to the dollar's fall against the euro. Still, that raises inflationary pressures in Mexico by increasing the price, in pesos, of imports.
Analysts say that the Bank of Mexico, which has already tightened monetary policy once this year, may raise it again to rein in inflation fears. And tighter monetary policy could hamper domestic investment by raising interest rates.
Many say that the failure to pass reforms is a casualty of Mexico's new democracy. After Mr. Fox, of the center-right National Action Party won the 2000 elections and ended 71 years of single-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, both he and the divided Congress have lurched toward democratic policy-making.
"Mexico at this time of change is going to spend more time oiling the structure of making decisions than actually making decisions," said Eduardo Cepeda, president of the Mexican subsidiary of J. P. Morgan Chase. 
Mexico needs tax changes that will raise the tax take, now a paltry 11 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 20 percent in the United States and almost 18 percent in Brazil.
There is little debate about where the government needs to spend more money: education, infrastructure and security.
Congress rejected a tax overhaul that Mr. Fox proposed at the end of 2001, passing a much-diluted version instead. Few expect the issue to come up again this year.
A proposal to pry open the state-run electricity industry languishes in the legislature. The government estimates that some $50 billion in private investment is needed to meet electricity demand over the next decade. Opponents argue, however, that the bill is a disguised move to privatize the energy sector and would be the first step to privatizing the state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos. Energy, particularly oil, remains a sacred cow to nationalists.
An expected bill that would increase the flexibility of employers in laying off and hiring workers may have more luck, thanks to negotiations among the government, Mexico's main labor movement and business groups.
"There is an increasing awareness that we cannot grow if we don't make these structural reforms," said Hector Rangel Domene, president of the Business Coordinating Council, Mexico's leading business group.
The government points to smaller measures it has been able to carry out, including the creation of a national mortgage bank and financial rules that expand the debt market.
Officials say that they are also spending what little they have in ways that will promote growth. For example, Mr. Martinez-Ostos said the government expected to grant some 530,000 subsidized mortgages for low-income housing and spend almost $700 million on roads this year.
"What we want to do is to strengthen the internal market and not depend so much on the United States," Mr. Martinez-Ostos said. "Our policy is not to put all our eggs in one basket."

HEADLINE: Exit Havel, to Muted Applause From Czechs 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Some days ago, student pranksters scaled a scaffolding at Prague Castle and, by covering the left half of an immense red neon heart hung as a kind of playful homage to President Vaclav Havel, transformed it into a giant and highly visible question mark.
 Mr. Havel, the former dissident who led this country from Communist dictatorship to democracy 13 years ago, is stepping down as Czech president next week and, given his stature and historic role, you might think that Czechs would unite in a rousing, even reverential send-off. 
 But as the prankish question mark suggests, such is not entirely the case in the Czech Republic, where Mr. Havel's image abroad as a kind of living saint is matched by a complicated and ambivalent view of him, one that mixes respect and gratitude with a good deal of doubt and criticism. 
Many Czechs, perhaps even most Czechs, seem to like Mr. Havel and to view him not just as a brave man of principle but as a man who has brought a kind of reflected glory to his country. 
His departure is the end of a remarkable era when a playwright and a humanist first defeated a totalitarian government and then led his country more by force of moral example than by conventional horse trading and arm-twisting.
Yet Mr. Havel has been in office longer than just about any other democratically elected leader, and the time has clearly left its stains on him and his reputation. 
In 1993 he watched as his old country -- Czechoslovakia -- split bloodlessly, but many still think needlessly, in two. He has about a 50 percent approval rating in opinion polls, not a disaster but low perhaps for a man who played such a role in local and world history. 
The Czech Parliament, divided into quarrelsome factions, has been deadlocked in its efforts to elect a successor -- the president is not chosen by direct popular vote -- and Mr. Havel's bitterest rival, Vaclav Klaus, who openly detests him, is a leading candidate.
Meanwhile, having over the years been drubbed by the very free press he helped to create and to safeguard, Mr. Havel himself is reported by friends to be tired and discouraged. Speaking last fall in New York, he described the experience of being a kind of fairy-tale king who learned what it was to take a hard fall to earth.
Last week Mr. Havel presided at the final session of a long series of informal meetings he has held at a hunting lodge called Amalie.
"He was a bit sentimental about leaving office," recalled an adviser, Jiri Pehe. "But he also repeated what he's been saying in speeches lately. It is that the older he gets, the more he feels powerless. He feels that civilization is not going in the right direction, that it's headed for catastrophe unless we change our ways, and even with all his influence, there's very little that he can do."
The president's younger brother, Ivan, said, "His power as president is in some sense less than it was when he was a powerless person." The younger Mr. Havel was giving voice to a refrain among the president's friends and allies, who note the irony for the author of "The Power of the Powerless," one of Mr. Havel's most resonant anti-Communist essays.
President Havel speaks such rich and inventive Czech that barely a speech passes without a memorable phrase, hard to translate and atypical in modern politics. This is a president who speaks of matters like "the magical intersection of both visible and hidden historical stirrings." 
In a country whose 19th-century thrust for independence was led by intellectuals and marked by a struggle to rescue the very Czech language from extinction, this evocative fluency strikes a chord.
"My most important feeling is that he elevated the country to a level way above its real importance," said Tomas Klavana, a journalist for Economia, a local daily, who has covered Mr. Havel for several years.
Mr. Klavana says some of Mr. Havel's luster has rubbed off in his own country precisely because some of his statements no longer ring true -- for example, that he is a reluctant president rather than a man who came to enjoy holding power. 
The very fact that he continued to speak the same moral language he used in the dissenting years lost some of its charm in a country where most people silently went along with dictatorship.
"Part of the ambivalence he inspires comes from the feeling that he's so different, that he's not like us," Mr. Klavana said. "He reminds people of their own deficiencies. He reproaches people precisely because he is above corruption."
In his speeches, he entreats his people to better behavior and scolds them for having won their freedom only to become indifferent to the sufferings of people in other countries.
"Surprisingly," he said in his annual New Year's address a couple of years ago, "freedom has given vent to a number of bad feelings and shown the depth of moral decline in our souls."
Among Mr. Havel's accomplishments was his steady and successful campaign for the Czech Republic to be among the first of the former Soviet bloc countries to be admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Next year, fulfilling another ambition to anchor the country firmly in the West, the Czech Republic will become a member of the European Union. Mr. Havel experienced something of an international apotheosis last fall when he played host to a NATO summit meeting in Prague, the very city whose streets were occupied by Soviet tanks in 1968.
What most here remember, of course, are the events of November and December 1989 when, beginning with student demonstrations and ending with Mr. Havel's elevation to the presidency, 41 years of Communist dictatorship came to an abrupt end.
Mr. Havel's former colleagues in dissent say that what made him the leader of the movement was a combination of determination, brilliance in summing up goals, organizational capacity and plain, simple bravery.
Mr. Havel spent more than five years in prison, at one time so severely afflicted with pneumonia that his wife, Olga, feared for his life. She died in 1996.
When he was not in prison, he was constantly followed and harassed by the not-so-secret police. The plays he wrote in the 1960's, which initially made his reputation here and abroad, were banned, and so, of course, were his dissident essays.
"He was always completely calm and quiet," remembered Eda Kriseova, another former dissident and, more recently, the author of a biography of Mr. Havel. "Many times the police came to his house and searched it. He was followed all the time. To live like that is very disturbing, but to see how he behaved, you had to appreciate him."
Jan Urban, a former dissident who is now a radio journalist, takes a more critical view of what Mr. Havel has done since.
"His main shortcoming is that he never created a political movement and therefore he leaves behind no political legacy," Mr. Urban said. "He was always a lone rider. He did not understand that governing is not about brilliant ideas but about building majority approval in Parliament for brilliant ideas, and he hasn't done that."
Mr. Havel came to power at the end of 1989 urging a "kindhearted revolution" -- the phrase Velvet Revolution was an invention of the Western press -- but kindhearted or not, he has had to play two contradictory roles. He has had to stand above politics as a ceremonial head of state and at the same time to make practical decisions, some of them less than popular.
When he first came to office, for example, he gave amnesty to a large portion of Czechoslovakia's prison population, ordinary prisoners and political prisoners alike.
The move was consistent with the concept of a fresh start for a new democracy, and with Mr. Havel's own years as a prisoner. But he has continued to issue presidential pardons -- of a woman who murdered her own child, for example -- without explaining them, and that has alienated many Czechs. 
One family has even filed suit with the United Nations, alleging that Mr. Havel's pardon of a drunken driver who killed their son was a violation of their human rights.
The last few years have been especially difficult. The now 66-year-old president smoked heavily for most of his life, is troubled by respiratory disease and tires easily. Certainly he can no longer ride the corridors of the Castle on a child's scooter, as in the early magical days of his presidency. In December 1996 he was operated on for lung cancer.
His lowest point in public opinion came after his wife, Olga, died. He married Dagmar Veskrnova, a striking, younger blond actress, and she quickly became the target of scurrilous stories in local tabloids.
"He was hurt very much by that," Ms. Kriseova said. "It was like under the old system: they always got to you by persecuting somebody you loved -- a child, a wife, a husband."
Mr. Havel was criticized again a few months ago when he failed to return from a trip abroad quickly after the worst floods in a century hit the country. And yet as his retirement approaches, a kind of anticipatory fondness is growing.
"My view of Havel is tainted by personal knowledge," Mr. Urban said, "by the fact that I've been very critical of his domestic performance since the beginning. But I'm sure we will miss him, because he was bigger than Czech politics. He aimed at concepts that cannot be discussed in television sound bites. 
"Call it morality. Call it philosophy. It doesn't matter what you call it, but the simple fact that he represented such a stark contrast to the rest of what we see in Czech politics will make him a historical figure."

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, picture captions on Saturday about the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, misstated the date of his state visit to Germany and the date when pranksters covered part of a neon sign on Prague Castle. Mr. Havel was in Berlin on Jan. 17, not last Friday. The prank occurred on Jan. 14, not last week.

HEADLINE: Why Bush Won't Wait 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
President Bush says he has not yet decided whether to go to war with Iraq, but this week the signs were that he had all but given up on peace. Administration hawks, who had been worrying that American resolve would dissipate during a prolonged game of inspection cat-and-mouse, are suddenly being sent forth to proclaim the weapons hunt a farce. State Department officials, who thought they had maneuvered us off the short road to war, seem resigned to the fact that they have probably failed.
 Maybe this is just another mood swing, or an effort to ratchet up the pressure again in hopes Iraqis will disarm themselves. But I suspect that the new official refrain -- "Time is running out" -- means the chief inspector, Hans Blix, should not count on the several more months he wants to do his job. The internal debate now is not war versus peace, or this year versus next year, but February versus March. 
 So what's the hurry? 
I can't claim to know what Mr. Bush thinks, but I have an idea what he is hearing. It goes something like this:
The detour through the United Nations looks more than ever like a dead end. Saddam's shuck and jive shows he will never come clean. The antiwar tantrums of France and Germany just encourage his intransigence. 
The only way to force the issue is to set war in motion -- but once you do, it can't be a false start. Saddam's nervous neighbors have watched America do that before, talk tough and back down, leaving them in the lurch. 
Perhaps if we give Mr. Blix a few more months to chase wild geese around Iraq, the U.N. will reward us by endorsing war, but we can already count on a substantial coalition: The gulf Arabs are on board (if they are sure we will see it through to the end), probably Turkey (which wants leverage over the future of its neighbor), the Brits, the Aussies, Italians, Spanish and all those dependable ex-Communists. The Russians and French might even jump on the train once it's moving, to protect their investments. Where's the unilateral in that?
The polls that show support for war steadily dwindling are not likely to get better. And while Americans may not be eager to go to war, at least they expect to go to war. Plus, once we are no longer worried about the Iraqis playing hide-and-seek with the inspectors, we are freer to lay out our evidence of Iraqi concealment -- though, frankly, Mr. President, that's something of a problem, since we can't agree among ourselves how conclusive the evidence is.
Delay means more time for other things to go wrong in the world -- more North Koreas. Delay, Mr. President, means the North Koreans wonder what you're really made of. Delay means that all this uncertainty continues to be a drag on the global economy. Delay means more time for Saddam to prepare nasty surprises for an invading force (or to help terrorists go for our back).
By mid-February, 150,000 American troops and at least four aircraft carrier battle groups will be deployed in the region around Iraq. You cannot park the Fourth Infantry Division in the desert for very long before the waiting erodes battle readiness and angers our hosts. And in summer the heat saps a fighting force. 
The fact that we are ready for a war is not, by itself, reason to fight one -- unless you are convinced that the non-war option has been closed off, that Iraq will never otherwise be rendered harmless. Which you are, aren't you, Mr. President?
This makes a tempting rationale, particularly to a president who worships decisiveness. But you do not have to be a peacenik to fear the cost of rushing in.
So far in its showdown with Iraq, the Bush administration has mostly done the right things, though often with a disheartening lack of finesse. Mr. Bush was right to identify Saddam Hussein as a menace, right to mobilize our might to prove we mean business, right to seek the blessing of Congress and the Security Council. A credible demonstration of will has produced tangible results. The inspectors are at work. Arab neighbors are looking for ways the Iraqis can solve their Saddam problem short of an invasion. (The prospect of a coup or an asylum deal for Saddam may be remote, but give them credit for creative thinking.) Saudi Arabia was moved, first, to propose a peace plan for Israel and Palestine, and second, to suggest a charter for political and economic reform in the Arab world.
There are compelling reasons for war with Iraq. Mr. Bush has been wise to emphasize the danger Saddam poses because of his unrelenting campaign to acquire weapons of horrible power. His mere possession of such weapons would give him daunting power in a vital region.
Many Americans and some of our allies have mistaken inspection for an answer to this problem. In fact, inspections have always been a way to buy some time, during which the regime might crumble, or Iraq might shock us all by really surrendering its weapons, or Iraqi non-compliance would exhaust the patience of even the French. Eventually, though, the inspectors go away, and if Saddam is still in place his quest for the nuclear grail resumes, presumably with fiercer motivation than before.
This is to my mind the administration's best argument for going to war, but it is not a terribly persuasive argument for going right now. On the contrary, at this moment, a mere nine weeks into inspections, Saddam seems to most people a less immediate threat than he was when inspections began. The presence of 200 inspectors and American technical surveillance is not exactly a lockdown, but it limits what he can get away with. Moreover, we have not yet given the inspectors time to check out our shared intelligence, or to push the demand that Iraqi scientists be interviewed in private. Pulling the plug at this point tells the world that Mr. Bush was never very serious about the U.N. route in the first place. 
The second justification for war is that this is a beastly regime, chronically brutal and episodically genocidal. This is true and not irrelevant. Saddam's reign of terror weakens his claim to sovereignty, and suggests that many Iraqis will welcome us as liberators. But this was a stronger argument for ousting Saddam 15 years ago, when he was actively engaged in mass murder.
A third argument for war is that replacing Saddam offers the hope of a (somewhat) more democratic Iraq. This could begin a political and cultural reformation of a region that has been an incubator of anti-American pestilence. I'm somewhat less optimistic than the romantic interventionists about America's ability to do for Iraq what we did for Japan and Germany after World War II. Re-engineering that misbegotten region is a noble undertaking, but will the impatient Mr. Bush and his successors have the attention span for a decade of nation-building? In any case, this is another argument without a deadline. On the contrary, delay might allow us to invest more of our authority in resolving the neglected, bloody impasse between Israel and Palestine, which is a sinkhole for American credibility. 
The fourth reason for wresting Iraq from the hands of Saddam is oil. I don't share the cynical view of many war opponents that this whole adventure is nothing more than a giant oil grab. Big oil companies (my father ran one until 1989) have always been much more in sync with the order-loving sheiks than with the boat-rockers touting upheaval and democratization. But oil is a big prize, and in the hands of a new Iraqi government it could be either a force for stability or a lever for rattling OPEC and undermining other Arab tyrannies, depending on your preference. It will be no less a prize if we hold off. 
All of these are reasons to want Saddam gone. None are reasons not to wait -- especially if haste further alienates the nations whose partnership we need to rebuild Iraq, to fight the terrorism that will surely escalate in response to our war and, incidentally, to sort out other messes that arise on our new imperial watch.
What Mr. Bush has failed to do over these months of agitation is to explain his urgency to the American public or our allies. In the year since the "axis of evil" speech, popular support for war has declined by at least 10 points. It's not that people doubt Saddam is a danger. They just think Mr. Bush is in too much of a rush. They want to see the evidence the president claims to have. They would like to know what costs and dangers we're in for. Most of all, they want the world, as much as possible, with us. 
Presidents should not make decisions of war and peace based on polls. (Mr. Bush's father launched the last war against Iraq with less support than the current president has.) Nor should our national interests be decided by the faintest hearts among our allies. But the dwindling of support here and resentment abroad represent a failure to persuade, and persuading is worth taking some time.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KOREA; 
Be Patient With North, Seoul's Kim Urges the U.S.

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Amid a flurry of diplomatic maneuvers over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, President Kim Dae Jung, the retiring lion of South Korean politics, advised the United States today to try patience and respect in dealing with the North.
 "President Reagan talked with the Soviet Union, which his government deemed the empire of evil," Mr. Kim, 76, recalled in a farewell news conference before he steps down next month. "Sometimes you need to talk with the other party, even if you dislike the other party. 
 "I definitely think North Korea should give up its nuclear development," Mr. Kim continued. But he added, "There is no other way but dialogue to settle this issue."
Asked if he was disappointed that North Korea's Communist leader, Kim Jong Il, never kept his promise to visit South Korea, the president responded evenly: "When we look at past leaders of North Korea, Chairman Kim Jong Il is the most intelligent person. Many leaders of the West who have met Kim Jong Il also share this opinion."
Such glowing praise may open doors for two South Korean envoys who are to arrive in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, on Monday carrying a personal letter from President Kim.
Roh Moo Hyun, who is to be inaugurated as President Kim's successor on Feb. 25, today proposed a summit meeting with the North Korean leader to resolve the peninsula's nuclear crisis.
"It is important to meet in person without any precondition to have dialogue," he told CNN. "I will propose to meet with Chairman Kim Jong Il, even if I lose face in the eyes of my people."
An advocate of Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine" policy of engagement with the North, the president-elect said optimistically of talking with the North's leader, "It will solve the difficult problem."
President Kim, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his ice-breaking visit to Pyongyang that year, seems reconciled to not seeing the two Koreas united in his lifetime.
"Peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the two Koreas has to precede the reunification of the two Koreas, something that will only happen in 15 to 20 years," Mr. Kim, who survived jail, kidnapping and a death sentence before becoming president five years ago, said today. "The world knows that there is no other alternative than the sunshine policy on the Korean Peninsula."
Having chosen a successor from Mr. Kim's own party in last month's election, many South Koreans have now tempered their criticism of the president for corruption scandals that swirled around close aides and landed two of his sons in jail.
"The record is actually quite impressive," said Michael Breen, an American author here who is writing a biography of President Kim. "He stabilized the country after the financial crisis, led Korea to the forefront of the international stage and began the reconciliation with North Korea."
With North Korea's relations with the outside world at a low ebb, foreign diplomats were busy today, with Americans and Russians diverging on whether to take the issue of North Korea's nuclear programs to the United Nations Security Council. The Council has the power to punish Pyongyang with economic sanctions or even military action.
In Moscow today, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov condemned the Security Council route.
"To refer the North Korean problem to the Security Council would be seen by North Korea as an attempt to put pressure on it," said Mr. Losyukov, who held high-level talks in Pyongyang this week. "If sanctions are introduced by the Security Council it will be considered by North Korea as a declaration of war."
The American under secretary of state for arms control and international security, John R. Bolton, told reporters in Tokyo today that the Bush administration was optimistic that the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency would vote "a resolution to take the matter to the Security Council." But he added, "The question of sanctions is not something we have any immediate intention of seeking."
Japan, which is within striking distance of North Korea's 100 or so short-range missiles, also wants to avoid sanctions. Hatsuhisa Takashima, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, said today, "Sanctions should not be promptly implemented or declared."
In Vienna, where the International Atomic Energy Agency is based, a spokesman said the board of governors might meet on Feb. 3 to decide the matter. The board wants to allow time for continuing South Korean and Russian mediation efforts.

HEADLINE: Pataki Aligns Himself With Bush Tax-Cut Plan to Stimulate Economy 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: PLAINVIEW, N.Y., Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Facing a deep deficit in the state budget, Gov. George E. Pataki today hitched New York's financial recovery to the Bush administration's plans for healing the national recession: a swift new round of tax cuts.
 Specifically, the governor singled out for praise a proposal to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends paid to taxpayers, the centerpiece of the plan President Bush announced on Jan. 7 for kick-starting the stalled economy. 
 "The president's new economic stimulus plan will help New Yorkers, specifically his proposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends," Mr. Pataki said in his first public statements since the Bush announcement. "This element of his stimulus package will help a financial industry in New York that is hurting." 
But Mr. Pataki was noticeably silent on the question of whether New York, whose income tax laws are tied to the federal laws, would enact changes to keep it from automatically following the federal government's lead.
Some state officials, mostly Democrats, have said that the Bush proposal will hurt New York at a time when it faces a cumulative deficit of $12 billion and needs every source of revenue it possesses.
Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, said that if the state piggybacks on the federal plan and decides it will also stop collecting a dividend tax, it could lose $551 million in revenues in the fiscal year that begins April 1, and $2.5 billion over four years.
Mr. Pataki's remarks, delivered in a speech to business leaders, community groups and politicians here, were the first he has made about an issue that has reignited a battle between Republicans and Democrats that traces back to the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980's.
Politically, such strong support for the president aligns Mr. Pataki more closely with the fiscal conservatives in his Republican party who believe it is unfair to "double-tax," first by taxing corporate profits and then the money sent to shareholders.
But beyond putting him in a better position to bid for national office, if the opportunity arises, the governor said the proposal meshed with his philosophy that low taxation and job protection were the way to help the state overcome its deficit this year and next.
"Ending the punitive double taxation of dividends will help lift and rally the stock market, will help rationalize corporate finance decisions, strengthen investor confidence and protect retirement income for seniors," Mr. Pataki said in a speech at the Vanderbilt, a white-columned catering hall in Nassau County.
"It will help our major financial institutions here in New York, and as a result, the president's plan will help New York more than any other state in America because we are the financial capital of the world," Mr. Pataki continued. "It will mean New York jobs for New York families."
Mr. Pataki's speech was similar to one he delivered in Manhattan two days ago. A third speech is planned for Syracuse on Monday before the governor's budget address on Wednesday in which he will lay out exactly how he intends to close the gap.
At one point in his speech, Mr. Pataki said his budget would include tax incentives for small businesses, particularly those in the high-tech field, who add jobs in the state.
But the speeches, despite their tone of optimism, reflect how deeply Mr. Pataki feels he must prepare the public for a painfully austere budget, his aides said.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was critical of the lack of details in the governor's speech today. He also laced into decisions by the State University of New York to raise tuition and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to possibly raise subway fares. Both are agencies the governor controls.
"Overall, the few specifics contained in the speech provide little comfort to the state's working families facing back-door tax increases," said Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver.
Mr. Pataki, who spoke to an audience of about 700 suburbanites, acknowledged that he understood that county and local governments were now feeling the effects of the national recession and hoping for fiscal relief from the state.
The only insight he would offer was a reference to Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor and whose costs are shared with localities. Mr. Pataki said he would include a Medicaid cost-containment package in his budget proposal that would "generate tens of millions of dollars for Nassau and Suffolk."
Some in the audience applauded. But the governor did not say how he would cut Medicaid, the largest part of the state budget. Some people said later that they hoped the remarks would not translate into dramatic cuts affecting the state's growing elderly population.
"People are going to lose their health services," said Lisa Tyson, director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, a grassroots nonprofit group. "And also it is going to mean that local property taxes are going to have to be raised because localities are going to be getting less money for all different types of services."
Outside the Vanderbilt, a group of about two dozen students chanted in the cold, poking cardboard signs into the sky protesting the SUNY tuition increases.
"These sort of proposals are indeed job-killing tax hikes," said Miriam Kramer, the coordinator on higher education for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which organized the protest.

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek A Tax Rebate In Growth Plan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats took on the administration's tax cut plan in earnest today with the release of a sharply different economic stimulus proposal, calling for a $300-a-person rebate check and $40 billion in aid to states and cities.
 The one-year plan, announced in Cleveland by Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, would spend $141 billion to stimulate the economy, in contrast to the 10-year $674 billion plan proposed by President Bush. It would drop the administration's proposal to eliminate the dividend tax, an idea with diminishing support on Capitol Hill, and concentrate its tax relief at the lower-to-middle end of the economic spectrum, with few benefits for the wealthy. 
 Today's plan is likely to become the Democrats' most reliable political tool once the jockeying over tax cuts begins on Tuesday with Mr. Bush's State of the Union address, even though the party lacks the votes to pass it. Although some Democrats have slightly different ideas on how to stimulate the economy, the party appears to be more unified against Mr. Bush's economic ideas than it was in 2001, and its leadership has begun to take heart in the president's slippage in opinion polls, particularly on economic issues. 
The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate is in agreement on the populist appeal of tax rebates and are intended to draw the sharpest possible contrast with the administration's emphasis on cutting taxes on stock dividend.
"Economists tell us that the wealthy are far less likely to spend a tax cut than middle-income families," Mr. Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, said today in an address to the City Club of Cleveland. "In an atmosphere of economic weakness and tight budgets, should we be giving scarce dollars to the people who can afford to put them under the mattress?"
Mr. Daschle said in an interview today that Democrats believed that they had to join the tax-cutting bandwagon to create jobs and energize a listless economy. After an election last year in which the party's ideas failed to draw widespread support, resisting any further tax cuts could have become a serious political problem for the Democrats. But Mr. Daschle said his proposed tax cuts would not increase the deficit nearly as much as would Mr. Bush's plan.
Beyond its political usefulness, Democratic leaders say, the plan includes several ideas that could form the basis of a compromise with Republicans in the Senate, the chamber that will become the playing field in the tax cut competition. 
At the moment, Mr. Bush lacks the votes to pass his plan in the Senate, now that several moderate Republicans have sharply criticized the dividend tax cut and the resulting growth in the deficit. To win back those moderates and a few centrist Democrats, Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, are already talking about cutting back on the Bush plan and paring the dividend tax cut.
Today Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the finance panel, said he would consider a compromise with the Republicans if it contained several elements of the Democratic plan, in particular the aid to states, many of which are facing huge budget gaps.
Mr. Baucus said he was open to a compromise on cutting tax rates -- which the Daschle plan avoids -- but not at the highest levels. Last month, Mr. Baucus proposed dropping the income tax on the first $3,000 of taxable wage income, which is similar in effect to the rebate idea but would take longer to stimulate the economy. He also proposed $75 billion in aid to states.
"It's a very good start, and I don't disagree with anything in it," Mr. Baucus said of Mr. Daschle's proposals. "I think our goal here, however, is to get a broad-based bill and try to avoid a 51-vote partisan bill. So I want to work with Senator Grassley to come up with something that might get 60 votes or more, and to that end I'm open to talking about rate cuts, as long as the size of the package comes down."
Mr. Baucus's comments illustrate the continuing difficulty Mr. Daschle is likely to encounter in holding together his caucus. Democrats across Capitol Hill have spent the last month holding news conferences to announce various economic proposals, only some of which are in the overall plan released today. Earlier this week, Senators Jon Corzine of New Jersey and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana proposed a refund of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, and Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota proposed a rebate plan slightly different from Mr. Daschle's. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a centrist who is likely to be an influential swing vote on any tax plan, has not yet committed to any of the ideas, but aides said he wants a plan much smaller than the president's.
House Democrats, who will have less influence in the debate because of the more rigid Republican control of that chamber, issued a similar version of today's plan earlier this month. No Democrats have expressed support for the dividend tax cut, the largest component of the White House plan, and several Republicans have come out against it.
Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, ridiculed the multiplicity of Democratic voices today, saying it was impossible to tell which alternative would emerge as the party's plan. He also said the president was not interested in the tax rebate idea.
Mr. Grassley was only slightly less dismissive, saying he would consider the plan among many other proposals.
"Senator Daschle's announced plan appears very light on job creation, and very heavy on political theater," Mr. Grassley said.
Today's plan would extend unemployment insurance benefits to the one million workers whose benefits have run out but are still searching for a job. To encourage business investment, the plan would allow a 50 percent deduction for new equipment, an increase from the current 30 percent, and would permit small businesses to write off $75,000 in investments, up from $25,000. Small businesses would also get a 50 percent tax credit on the cost of employee health premiums.
Of the $40 billion in aid to states, $15 billion would be unrestricted, and the rest would be earmarked for domestic security, education, Medicaid and new public works. Mr. Daschle said the aid was intended to allay state tax increases that could undermine the effects of federal tax cuts.
Mr. Daschle said Democratic leaders chose the tax rebate method because of its immediate stimulus and because it was easier to understand and benefited far more people than the dividend tax cut. He also said it was more responsible than the president's "reckless" plan, and he predicted it would garner some Republican support.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WHITE HOUSE; 
U.S. MAY NOT PRESS U.N. FOR A DECISION ON IRAQ FOR WEEKS

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Seeking ways to defuse tensions with longtime European allies, Bush administration officials said today that they were considering a delay of possibly several weeks before pressing the United Nations for a decision about Iraq's compliance with Security Council resolutions.
 Administration officials said they were willing to accept a delay to allow inspectors to continue their work in Iraq after they report their findings on Monday. During that time, they said, the administration would try to make a more persuasive case to the allies for possible military action in Iraq. 
 But the officials made clear that they did not want the inspections to last three or four more months.
The change in tone came after a week in which the administration found itself in a growing confrontation with traditional allies like France and Germany, and opposed in the United Nations Security Council by China and Russia, permanent veto-bearing members. 
Faced with rising pressure to lay out the strongest possible case on Iraq, the administration is engaged in a fierce internal debate over how much intelligence information about Iraq's weapons programs to release to the public or to United Nations inspectors searching for incriminating evidence, officials say.
"We've battled the agency on this a dozen times over the last five years," an administration official said, referring to the Central Intelligence Agency. "But now it's more acute because the administration is telling everybody, 'We know more than you do,' and it's not enough. We just cannot get stuff declassified."
Senior officials at the Defense and State Departments point out that there are severe limits on what they can release to the public and still avoid compromising the people and methods by which they obtained the information.
Officials said they did not know whether President Bush had become involved in any decisions on what to release. But their assumption was that since little intelligence information had been released, the White House had approved the tight clamp on the sensitive information.
In pressing his case in the State of the Union address on Tuesday, White House officials said, Mr. Bush plans to make a vigorous argument against Saddam Hussein. But they said he would stop short of announcing that he is ready to send in troops. They declined to say whether Mr. Bush would present any specific new evidence that Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction. Even so, they said he was mindful that he must convince Americans that war is justified if Mr. Hussein does not comply with United Nations resolutions.
"This speech is not to declare war," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. "It's a speech to continue educating the public about why we're taking the course we are."
Mr. Bartlett added that the president "will make clear to the American people his reluctance, our country's reluctance, to go to war."
Despite Mr. Bartlett's words, the White House kept up its now-daily attacks on Mr. Hussein. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said this morning that the president viewed Mr. Hussein's refusal to allow the weapons inspectors to interview Iraqi scientists privately as "unacceptable." Mr. Fleischer branded the Iraqi decision a "willful act of defiance" and said Mr. Hussein was "making the end of the line come even closer by his unacceptable behavior."
At the United Nations, Hans Blix, a chief weapons inspector, expressed frustration today that Iraq had not come forward, during two days of meetings in Baghdad, with crucial evidence the inspectors need. Iraqi officials, he said, had provided only one new document that cast additional light on the status of its past secret programs to build prohibited weapons.
"They gave him virtually nothing, in fact," said a United Nations official with knowledge of the inspections.
The Los Angeles Times reported today that the United States and Britain were consulting over whether to extend the inspections in exchange for assurances from allies that they would not drag on indefinitely. But administration officials insisted that there was no specific proposal being discussed.
Administration officials did express a willingness to let the inspections continue for a short time but said this did not amount to a policy shift. "We've never said the inspections would cease on the 27th," a senior administration official said.
But officials also acknowledged that their hope was that the extra weeks might placate the allies, particularly the French, who have mounted a strong campaign to forestall an American attack on Iraq. Officials stressed that they had not approached the allies with any compromise, and it was unclear how the French would react.
The goal now, administration officials said, was to try to bring order to the international chaos before an attack. They said that the continuation of the inspections would merely be an exercise in the inexorable march to war, which could begin in late February or March, and that the inspections were proving useless.
The difficulty in presenting their case against Iraq, officials said, is that the evidence of its weapons stockpiles is heavily inferential and circumstantial, drawn from scores if not hundreds or thousands of tiny clues pieced together by the C.I.A.
This evidence, some officials said, is unlikely to be persuasive to people without an intelligence background, especially if only a half dozen or so pieces out of a hundred are disclosed.
"Much of what we know is akin to an impressionist painting," an administration official said. "It's a compilation of several different strands of information that are then triangulated to draw a conclusion. If you have an intelligence background, it's compelling. If you don't, you might say, 'There's no forest here. It's 400 unrelated trees.' "
As evidence of the sensitivity over the release of documents, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told the Council on Foreign Relations this week that he had been forced to substitute three words in his speech for "two rather stunning paragraphs, on the grounds that we would say too much about what we're observing even today."
The administration acknowledges that it has a major uphill effort to convince Americans -- not to mention the Europeans -- of the reasons for going to war, but says much of their case comes down to asking Americans to place blind faith in the administration.
"It really comes down to whether or not the country trusts President Bush's judgment, knowing that he knows a lot more than the country knows," a senior administration official told reporters on Air Force One this week.
A separate administration disagreement involves the integrity of the work under way in Iraq by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspections Commission, or Unmovic, which many officials fear has already been compromised by Iraqi agents.
Indeed, some administration officials said they had concluded that sensitive information about a suspected Iraqi weapons site, recently provided to United Nations inspectors, was leaked to Iraqi officials, allowing cleanup crews to be sent to the location.
The unfolding public campaign to persuade Americans, Europeans and others about the importance of disarming Iraq has taken on increasing urgency, with administration officials saying the case to be made on Iraq is their first priority in the next week or so.
Some administration officials acknowledge that their work will be difficult. "We have not convinced public opinion," Richard Haass, director of policy planning at the State Department, said today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "I sit here understanding all too well that we have yet to persuade the international community of where things stand."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is to give a major speech on Iraq to the forum in Davos on Sunday. 
In addition to the rhetorical offensive, officials said they were hoping for some new development that would indict Iraq for noncooperation with the the chief weapons inspectors , Mr. Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are to report to the United Nations on Monday.
A bit of doubt was thrown into what the Blix report would say after a spokesman for Mr. ElBaradei said in Vienna that Mr. Hussein would get a "quite satisfactory" grade for cooperating with nuclear inspectors. The spokesman, Mark Gwozdecky, told The Associated Press that "their report card will be a 'B' -- quite satisfactory."
White House officials were reported to be furious about this comment and pressing the Atomic Energy Agency to rescind it, officials said.

HEADLINE: Data Show Rapid Growth in Federal Budget Shortfall 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
New government data show that the federal government's budget shortfall has grown sharply in the last few months, even before Congress takes up President Bush's plan to cut taxes by $670 billion over 10 years.
 The new shortfall has already complicated the calculations behind Mr. Bush's budget proposal for 2004, which he is to announce on Feb. 3. With revenues sinking and outlays for the military and for domestic security rising, White House officials are searching for every possible way to trim social programs and muster support for their tax cuts. 
 In the three months from last October through December, the federal government ran a deficit of $109 billion, nearly three times as big as the year before and well on the way to setting a new record by the end of the fiscal year.
Administration officials have already conceded that the budget deficit for this year will be from $200 billion to $300 billion, not including the costs of a possible war with Iraq.
But other analysts think even that prediction may be too cautious. "The U.S. budget outlook continues to deteriorate," wrote William C. Dudley, an economist at Goldman Sachs, after analyzing the government's latest revenue data. "Our estimate of $300 billion for fiscal 2003 looks somewhat optimistic." 
Democrats on the House Budget Committee, hoping to upstage Mr. Bush when he releases his budget plan, have calculated that the shortfall could reach $306 billion this year, even if the costs of a possible war in Iraq are excluded.
The Democratic projections, which assume that Mr. Bush's tax proposals become law, predict that the government will run an unbroken string of deficits that would total $1.7 trillion by the end of 2011.
"This is not some hypothetical outline of what could happen," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. "This is what they are pushing."
White House officials say budget deficits pose little danger, because they are small in comparison with the size of the economy. The best way to reduce the deficit, they say, is to reduce spending while cutting taxes to increase economic growth.
"There's a risk that deficits could be that large over the next 10 years if we keep on this course -- if spending continues at this rate and if the economy continues to underperform," said J. D. Foster, chief economist at the White House Office of Management and Budget. "It's precisely because of that risk that the president chose the path that he did."
White House officials have said they want to increase "discretionary spending" by 4.1 percent, but most of that increase would be in military and homeland security programs. Other domestic programs are being squeezed wherever possible.
In a move that could be interpreted as trying to get more bang for the buck, administration officials also unveiled a plan today to give federal agencies more freedom to reward particular workers with more pay.
The proposal calls for a $500 million "performance fund," which would be divided up among federal agencies and be reserved for pay increases to favored employees. The measure, which would require Congress to change the existing law, would partly offset the more modest raises that White House officials are proposing for federal workers this year -- 2 percent, down from 3.1 percent last year.
By any measure, the government's fiscal condition has experienced a spectacular reversal since 2000, when the economic boom and the stock market generated a torrent of tax revenue and a surplus of $236 billion.
In early 2001, the Office of Management and Budget predicted an accumulated surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. By last July, in the aftermath of a recession and huge new outlays for the campaign against terrorism, the White House had slashed the projected surplus to $1.7 trillion.
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that forecasts the budget outlook, will almost certainly slash that projection even more next week when it releases its outlook for the year. 
The Congressional agency's forecast will show only part of the picture, because its projections are based only on existing law and are not allowed to include the effects of President Bush's tax proposals, the possible costs of a war with Iraq or other costly measures.
Even without any of those elements, the budget outlook has gotten worse. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government's deficit from October through December hit $109 billion, more than three times the $35 billion deficit experienced during same period last year. 
In October, a month when people make quarterly tax payments, revenues declined $33 billion from the year before and spending went up by $12 billion. November's deficit was slightly higher than the year before. And although the government ran a monthly surplus in December, which is common for that month, the surplus was about one-sixth what it was in the previous December. 
The latest data for January, another month for quarterly tax payments, is not encouraging. According to the Treasury Department's daily revenue reports, revenues from nonwithheld taxes totaled about $44 billion. For all of January last year, those taxes totaled $55 billion. 
Most experts say the biggest reason for last year's plunge in tax revenues, which declined by more than $100 billion, stemmed from the drop in stock market profits, executive bonuses and corporate profits.
But spending has continued to rise, mostly for the military and homeland security. Last year, total discretionary spending climbed 9 percent.
Democrats on the House Budget Committee say the long-term problems will not be solved just by a rebound to more normal economic growth of about 3 percent a year.
In addition to Mr. Bush's huge tax-cutting proposal, they say, the most recent proposal by House Republicans to offer prescription drug benefits to the elderly would cost more than $300 billion over 10 years.
Mr. Bush also wants to make last year's tax cuts permanent, rather than allow them to expire toward the end of this decade. He and Congressional Republicans also want to roll back what is known as the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is expected to take an increasingly big bite out of middle-income taxpayers over the next several years.
If one adds in all those proposals and about $85 billion for the cost of a war with Iraq, House Democrats estimate the accumulated deficit could hit $2.3 trillion by the end of 2011.
"Even before you get to those likely expenditures and costs, you have some pretty shocking numbers," Mr. Spratt said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a worsening of the federal government's budget shortfall in the last few months referred incorrectly in some copies to the amount of surplus foreseen last July by the Office of Management and Budget for the next 10 years. It was $1.7 trillion -- not billion.

Yields So LowThat a Mattress Might Do Instead

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
FACING the lowest interest rates since the introduction of money market funds in 1971, many fund sponsors have been cutting fees to keep investors from losing money.
 Money market rates have sunk close to 1.25 percent, the target rate of the Federal Reserve for overnight lending among banks. Standard fees for managing money market funds of all sizes average about seven-eighths of 1 percent. This means that many funds, mainly those with hefty marketing expenses, are operating at a loss. 
 To prevent negative returns for investors, many sponsors have been forgoing or deferring at least part of their fees and sometimes dipping into their own pockets to inject cash into the funds. Some have bought distressed securities at premium prices to bolster yields.
These efforts are intended to avoid "breaking the buck," that is, to prevent the net asset value of shares in a money market fund from dropping below $1, a level that has been sacrosanct. But it could happen if the yield -- the market return less expenses -- on a money fund's portfolio of short-term securities turned negative. 
"That's the cardinal sin among money market managers," said Jeff Tjornehoj, a research analyst at Lipper, which tracks fund performance. He noted that this had happened just once, in 1994, to the Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market, a fund with $82 million in assets that was available only to institutions. Its managers made losing bets on derivatives and had to liquidate the fund at 96 cents a share, so investors lost 4 cents on the dollar.
In addition, some money market accounts held within annuity contracts last year produced small losses of capital. These were recognized as less liquid than are traditional money market accounts, which are expected to return investors' capital on a moment's notice, and there has been relatively little reaction so far by investors.
With inflation negligible and the economy limping, the Federal Reserve seems to have no intention of raising money market interest rates anytime soon. But industry executives and analysts say that while skimpy returns are likely to persist, investors in money funds face little risk of losses.
"We expect all money market funds to maintain a positive yield," said Peter Crane, vice president and managing editor of iMoneyNet, publisher of Money Fund Report, which monitors the $2.3 trillion business.
Mr. Crane predicted that returns, after expenses, would settle at an average of about three-quarters of 1 percent in the next few months and that sponsors, while pinched, would not need to take significantly greater risks with fund portfolios to keep them in the black. For the week ended last Tuesday, rates averaged 0.82 percent, down from 0.84 percent the previous week. Investors poured an additional $6.95 billion into the funds during the week. 
Bruce R. Bent, chairman and chief executive of the Reserve Funds and a money market pioneer, agreed that investors' principal was not in jeopardy.
"It's not going to happen to anyone," Mr. Bent said when asked about the possibility that sponsors would let the share price slip below $1. "If expenses exceed interest, you reduce expenses." The John Hancock Money Market fund, like others, for example, has waived the fee paid to brokers who market its Class B shares. Some funds have gone so far as to put floors on yields, typically a quarter or an eighth of 1 percent.
Still, another reduction in short-term interest rates "would start cutting muscle" in the financial condition of sponsors, who would have to take bigger losses to preserve investors' capital, Mr. Crane said.
Mr. Bent agreed. "Rates have gone as low as they can possibly go," he said.
The lowest-yielding money funds are generally those with the highest expenses. "There's a nearly perfect negative correlation between high yield and low expense ratio," Mr. Tjornehoj said. The expense ratio of the John Hancock B shares, for example, is 1.39 percent, virtually wiping out any unsubsidized return to investors. Last week, the fund's yield was 0.11 percent. 
Some of the best performers are the largest money funds, which benefit from economies of scale. Those of Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, Fidelity and Scudder are among the leaders. Among these funds, the highest-yielding was the Vanguard Prime fund, with a yield of 1.20 percent and expenses of only 0.33 percent.
MR. BENT warns that managers of funds whose yields are flirting with zero may be tempted to become more venturesome to stay competitive.
"The only risk I see is if a fund manager decides he has to reach for yield in order to pay up," said Mr. Bent, whose company prides itself in avoiding the market for commercial paper, where defaults by Pacific Gas and Electric and others pressed sponsors to bail out portfolios. In 1997, Strong Capital Management bought Mercury Finance commercial paper from three of its funds to spare shareholders from a loss. In late 2000 and early 2001, Founders Fund, Zurich Scudder and Dreyfus were among those taking similar steps because of the California utility crisis.
Mr. Crane, for one, minimized this threat. "The recent trauma is fresh enough that a lot of people are gun shy," he said, alluding to the California crisis. "The No. 1 job for managers is avoiding headline risk," some disaster that the prudent could have been expected to avoid. Moreover, because money funds invest in short-term instruments, their funds must be rolled over often, limiting their exposure to any single company.
The greater, broader danger, Mr. Crane said, is that today's low rates are inducing consumers to spend their money instead of saving it, leaving them without a cash buffer against even a mild financial reverse.
That is the kind of atmosphere in which Mr. Bent and others are promoting what they say is the next money fund innovation -- adding the safety net of coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by creating a banking unit and sweeping cash into accounts there. Features like debit cards with rebates for purchases and online bill-paying can be added to these accounts.
"That's definitely where we're going," Mr. Bent said, pointing to billions of dollars pulled into such accounts at Reserve Funds and various major brokerage houses, including Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
Others, though, are skeptical that this is the wave of the future. Mr. Crane said he doubted that there was huge demand for insurance coverage and said that while there had been an early surge of inflows into the new accounts, much of this reflected relatively high "teaser" rates that would not be sustained when interest rates returned to more normal levels.
Mr. Tjornehoj said that advocating insurance protection might send the wrong message to consumers. "It will give the sense," he said, "that their investment is not all that safe."

So Many OnlineSales, So Little in Tax Revenue

BYLINE:  By NORM ALSTER 

 BODY:
STATE officials across the country have been keeping their eyes on two sets of numbers, and it is sometimes difficult to tell which is growing faster. One is their projected budget shortfalls. The other is online retail sales, which they would like to tax to help fill the gaps.
 Forecasters say the states may come up short next year by as much as $80 billion, which would create the biggest state budget crisis since World War II. A merry holiday season in cyberspace, meanwhile, has pumped up the receipts of online retailers -- to $78 billion last year, according to Forrester Research, an increase of more than 50 percent over 2001. 
 That does not count the larger categories of business-to-business online sales and catalog sales, for which sales tax is generally not collected. A study by the University of Tennessee estimates that sales tax is not collected on $234 billion in online business-to-business commerce. And tax on most of what the Direct Marketing Association estimates at $125 billion in annual catalog sales is not collected, either. 
The states cannot currently impose the tax because the Supreme Court has ruled that their multiple tax systems would impose an unfair collection burden on retailers that do not have a physical presence in their buyers' various states. Online buyers are actually required to pay sales taxes directly to their states, but they rarely do.
If the states can simplify and coordinate their sales tax systems, they may be able to convince Congress or the courts that collecting the levy will not be an unfair burden.
"Collection of online sales tax could plug 30 to 50 percent of state budget deficits this year and next," said Frank Shafroth, director for state and federal relations at the National Governors Association.
An effort to overcome the Supreme Court's objections made headway last November when 33 states agreed to narrow the differences in their sales tax rules and to provide retailers with software to collect taxes.
"We have developed a simplified process for collection of sales tax that meets the criteria of the Supreme Court and the Congress," said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a leader in the states' effort.
Maybe so. But it is not enough in the eyes of business interests that are lining up against online sales tax collection. Anti-tax groups, direct marketers and online sellers have long opposed efforts to collect online, but new opposition has emerged from broad-based business groups that want concessions on other tax issues in return for their support for the collection changes.
"Before Congress authorizes a mandatory system for sales tax collection, they need to resolve some outstanding issues," said Vincent Randazzo, director of public policy for the Business Roundtable, which represents the chiefs of 150 big companies.
The states are expected to seek a Congressional mandate to collect sales taxes after they win legislative approval for their new tax system in at least 10 states that represent at least 20 percent of Americans who pay sales taxes.
Governor Leavitt said that as many as 25 state legislatures would begin considering acceptance of the new system early this year. Neal Osten, a lobbyist with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Congressional legislation could be introduced this spring.
Expecting a lobbying showdown, the Business Roundtable has already begun "to touch base with the big players in Washington," said Mr. Randazzo, who declined to specify the chief lobbying targets.
Business groups fret that state officials will use the information they gather from collecting online sales taxes to become more aggressive in seeking income taxes from corporations that have sales but no physical presence within their states.
"Once you have a system in place for identifying out-of-state sales," Mr. Randazzo said, "the states will have all this information they can turn over to their revenue departments and say: 'They did $25 million in sales here -- we'll collect income tax.' "
Some state officials see the linking of the issues as part of a lobbying strategy by big business. "They want to get their pound of flesh, and they see this as an opportunity," said Mr. Shafroth of the governors' group.
Opponents of online sales taxes have other complaints.
Amazon.com participated in the deliberations that created the states' plan but is not satisfied with the results. "There's not enough simplification," said Richard Prem, Amazon's director for global indirect taxes.
Christopher M. Kelley, a Forrester analyst, said collecting sales tax would have a minimal effect on Amazon and other online retailers. He said they could compensate for the higher cost to customers by expanding free-shipping offers, though that would cut into already thin profit margins.
MOST large bricks-and-mortar retailers support online tax collection, but Frank G. Julian, operating vice president and tax counsel for Federated Department Stores -- parent of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, which sell through stores and over the Web -- said the collection process was still too complicated.
Sponsors of the tax-simplification process wanted a single tax rate for each state, but that idea was opposed by local authorities and some local businesses that were unwilling to forfeit tax breaks. Some states, for example, exempt "essentials" like food and clothes from the sales tax -- though the definitions of exempt catagories varies from state to state, with some areas including goods like candy and belts while others do not. Some states, like California and New York, also let local governments impose sales tax surcharges that only apply in their jurisdictions. The proposed compromise allows three rates per state.
Multiple rates make collection difficult, Mr. Julian said, noting that Federated already spent "tens of millions of dollars" to collect $1 billion a year in sales taxes.
But retailers that have stores virtually everywhere see universal online collection as a matter of fairness. "We're required to collect it," said Wayne Zakrzewski, an assistant general counsel for taxes at J. C. Penney. "Our rivals should also collect it."
Tripp Funderburk, policy director for the e-Fairness Coalition, which represents big retailers like Target, Wal-Mart and Circuit City, as well as real estate interests, said that retailers' profit margins are so thin that "when you give someone a 6 to 8 percent price advantage, that's the government favoring one sector over another."
As online sales eat into sales tax collections, local authorities will have to make up the difference, Mr. Funderburk added, and many are already raising property taxes.
The information technology industry has been very effective in its Washington lobbying, and it is not about to forfeit a tax break that has bolstered both e-commerce and the computer, communications and software sectors that support it.
Walter Hellerstein, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, said the simplification camp would have little trouble lining up 10 states -- Illinois, Wisconsin and North Carolina should be among the first -- but he said they would need "roughly half the states" to overcome lobbying opposition in Congress.
Opponents of the drive for online sales taxes worry that the states may bypass Congress and simply take nonpaying corporations to court, arguing that they have met the Supreme Court's objections and are now allowed to collect.
"Congress has never been willing to stick its foot into the sales tax nexus issue, and I don't see anything that's about to change," Mr. Shafroth said.

Is Digital Eclipsing The Moment At Kodak?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
AMERICANS buy 850 million rolls a year.
 For decades, rampant picture taking made Eastman Kodak, the world's biggest maker of film, an immensely profitable company. Film accounts for about 20 percent of the company's sales, but up to 50 percent of its profit. 
 But digital photography, heightened competition and the weak economy have cut into sales. And last week Kodak, which eliminated more than 7,000 jobs last year, said it intended to cut as many as 2,200 more. Investors, who have flocked into the stock the last year, unceremoniously dumped shares on the news. They ended at $32.08 on Friday. 
Benjamin A. Reitzes, imaging technology analyst at UBS Warburg, talked last week about the company's prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What caused Kodak's problems?

A. Film demand peaked in early 1999 and has been on a slowing growth and declining trajectory ever since. As consumer confidence began to wane in 2000 and digital camera sales began to become more meaningful, film demand began to slow really markedly.
Kodak has thrown out numbers that last year digital cameras cannibalized its film unit growth by three percentage points. I think that number is even higher, because digital camera sales have been even stronger than expected and sales of digital printers have been stronger than expected.

Q. Is film becoming obsolete and is Kodak responding rapidly enough?

A. We think more and more people are taking advantage of digital imaging. The biggest problem is that it is more expensive, it takes time and requires a good quality printer.
Film is still the best way to get durable prints, and Kodak has been outperforming the industry for the past three quarters in film. That is one of the reasons we were surprised by the magnitude of their struggles when they reported their results last week.

Q. How important are the megachains like Wal-Mart to the film business?

A. We estimate that Wal-Mart accounts for at least 20 percent of the U.S. film market. If you include Sam's Club, that rises to between 25 percent and 30 percent. The processing figures are very similar. In short, Wal-Mart is one of the most powerful companies in the photography industry.
One of the challenges for Kodak is that Wal-Mart has a contract with Fuji Photo Film until 2005 for providing paper, chemicals and supplies for onsite photo finishing.
Effectively, this deal keeps Kodak out of Wal-Mart in the United States. Kodak lost this contract in the mid-1990's, and it was one of the things that contributed to the company's problems in 1997.

Q. Kodak's stock went up nearly 20 percent last year. It was the best-performing component of the Dow Jones industrial average. Why?

A. The stock did well last year because of the major restructuring they undertook in 2001. We upgraded the stock at the end of last year with the view they would outperform because Kodak does very well when they get very serious about cutting costs. Also, we thought their traditional businesses weren't becoming outmoded as fast as others thought.
Those things helped to move Kodak's numbers, especially in the second and third quarters. And the stock also benefited from its high dividend yield.

Q. Last week Dan Carp, Kodak's chairman, said he expected the company's digital camera business to be profitable by the end of this year. Is that a realistic expectation?

A. They were supposed to be profitable earlier than that, but pricing continues to come down and there are a lot of competitors out there. This year they may meet that forecast because there is a migration to higher resolution cameras. But we have trouble envisioning this being a high-margin business.

Q. Are you worried about debt load?

A. I would like to see their debt-to-capital ratio trend down about 40 percent over the next year or two. Currently it is 48 percent.

Q. The stock price fell a lot after last week's announcement. Is it a buy at these levels?

A. First, I don't own any Kodak shares. And we have a hold rating on the stock. I have a $35 target on the stock, which puts Kodak at a level that is consistent with its traditional forward price to earnings multiple.

Q. What will Kodak look like in five years ?

A. You will see a lot more digital revenues and services. Kodak's future depends on its ability to enable its retail customers to process photographs from digital cameras.
Right now Fuji Film has digital minilabs that allow you to print pictures from digital cameras. Kodak has several products coming out in this area this year. But they are going to have to invest a lot in sales, marketing and promotion on the launch of these new minilabs.

HEADLINE: Before the Game, Bacchanalia XXXVII 

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Michael Irvin, the former Dallas Cowboy receiver and carouser, embraced the Bachelorette like a contestant the other night, clutching her tightly until he heard a familiar voice.
 "Mr. Irvin," intoned Neon Deion Sanders, his former teammate. "Could you leave that woman alone? More than 50 million are already trying to get at her." 
 In about an hour, the two former National Football League stars would make their way upstairs at the W Hotel, to a warm fire on an imported beach, where some clear, sweet, carbonated liquid called Smirnoff Triple Block Ice was being passed around liberally, and the bacchanalia of another Super Bowl week was about to begin. 
"It's already past my bedtime," Mr. Sanders said at about 9 p.m. "I don't go out like I used to. Nowadays, I just go home and go to sleep."
Nonetheless, he went upstairs. Mr. Sanders stood in front of the fire, his feet in the sand. On the W roof, one of those pre-pre-Super Bowl parties was beginning to grow with names.
Tara Reid ("American Pie") was there. So was Carson Daly ("Total Request Live"), who used to go out with Tara, but now they're just friends.
"We were engaged, but it didn't work out," Mr. Daly said. "Tara's still great."
O.K. 
Ms. Reid mingled with her good friend Pat O'Brien of "Access Hollywood," Mr. Daly hung out with his good friends, and ESPN anchors, everybody's good friends, milled about until they were recognized.
They came from all over this week: be-seen actors in need of upgrades in their Q ratings; professional athletes working the party circuit harder than they ever worked their games; sportswriters and fans competing for space and attention with more important people than themselves -- an amalgam of American party culture, crammed into a California seaport city. 
If the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers don't do it for you in Super Bowl XXXVII, there is always the Blue Tattoo or E Street Alley in the historic Gas Lamp Quarter. Or Maxim magazine's party on Saturday night, where the magazine has essentially turned San Diego's old Wonderbread factory into a community that would do Caligula proud. Did we mention the Playboy and "Girls Gone Wild" soirees? 
The National Football League can do nothing but blush and hope the revelry does not lead to an image blow like those from big games gone by. In 1999, the night before Eugene Robinson was to compete for the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami, he was charged with soliciting sex from an undercover policewoman.
Today's Raiders do not exactly pay homage to the partyers of the past, people like the late John Matuszak, who two decades ago drank like a fish, showed up woozy at press conferences and once hired a look-alike to be in his hotel bed at curfew. Earlier this week, trying to find a party-hearty player scheduled to suit up Sunday amid the shrill of the Gas Lamp Quarter, a PG-13 version of the New Orleans French Quarter, was fruitless. In fact, you had to go back in time.
Marcus Allen, the most valuable player in the 1984 Super Bowl, was holding court in a bar called Magnet in the bottom floor of the W Hotel on Wednesday. Mr. Allen was eventually joined by Mr. Sanders, Mr. Irvin and Mr. O'Brien.
The next night, Jeremy Shockey and Tiki Barber of the New York Giants made their presence known, along with Terrell Davis, the former Bronco running back. Yes, Mr. Shockey said, he was going to the Playboy party.
"Hey, it's not like we sit around and think, 'Let's go to a party and look suave,' " said Mr. O'Brien, sipping a glass of cabernet sauvignon on a couch at Magnet. "It's the only thing to do here. Am I going to the San Diego Aquarium? I'm not going to look at some orca. I'm coming here."
"In the early 90's, it got out of hand," Mr. O'Brien added. He has made it to 22 Super Bowls. "You'd get four and five thousand at a single party. It was just too much excess."
But a struggling economy begets low advertising revenue, and low advertising revenue begets lower profit margins, and when all the trickle-down effects kick in, suddenly you've got a half-empty club in the middle of Super Bowl Week. The days of private helicopters and entire sales teams taking weekend junkets are dying, along with the multimillion-dollar parties.
On Thursday night, E Street Alley was home to the EcoBowl party -- a $170-a-ticket benefit that goes toward Ecolution, the pollution-education charity based in Los Angeles. It actually outbid Nike and Cadillac for the club. 
Ms. Reid was a host, along with another of the "American Pie" cast, Shannon Elizabeth, and Rosario Dawson, the New York actress currently starring in "25th Hour" with Edward Norton. 
Ms. Reid was wearing a very low-cut satin dress, with side slits. It would need another foot of fabric to graze her knees.
"Am I trying to get noticed?" said Ms. Dawson, laughing. "Not with Tara dressed like that. I'm in the background. I might as well be a bodyguard."
Ms. Dawson went on to say she was happy to lend her name and stature to a cause she believed in. "I know most of this week is about nothing particularly real, but if I can get some people to look at why they really need an S.U.V., then it's for a good cause."
She went on to say that making the rounds at Super Bowl week could have its downside on celebrity, too. "If you show up at too many things, people start to wonder if you're more about yourself than what charity you're promoting. You could do the organization detriment if you don't pick your spots. Oversaturation is bad. After a while, no one cares about your cause. They want to know who you're sleeping with, how long it took to put on your makeup and what dress you're wearing."
(For the record, Ms. Dawson wore a black flower-print gown designed by Diane Von Furstenberg. "She was responsible for the wrap in the 70's," she explained, helpfully. "I just thought it was sexy." No word on whom she's sleeping with.)
But it was Trista Rehn who drew the most attention. She is the star of ABC's "Bachelorette," a former Miami Heat cheerleader who was rejected on national television in the last week of the first season of "The Bachelor." As her revenge, Ms. Rehn now has a truckload of men to choose from in her own show. If the Match.com crowd was having a rough go finding mates on the Internet, poor Ms. Rehn has been looking for a husband on television for more than two seasons.
She was congenial enough, chitchatting her way through promotional interviews with local affiliates, careful not to give up any of her suitors. But her handlers were intent on scurrying her away from the crush -- not because Ms. Rehn could at any time be approaching her 16th minute in America's celebrity consciousness. No, it is a much more pressing matter, the public relations man said. "Trista wants to watch herself tonight. She whittles it down to about five, I think."
A few blocks from the W, Mark McLemore, the veteran Seattle Mariners ballplayer, drove up Fifth Avenue in a metallic silver Ferrari 360. He parked as admirers scurried around to look at his shimmering vehicle under the street lamps. Mr. McLemore looked like the John Milner character from "American Graffiti" -- he and his car, joined in coolness till their pink slips do them part.
"You could say I'm showing off a little," Mr. McLemore said, smiling.
He and his passenger were told that Marcus Allen, Michael Irvin and Deion Sanders were at the W. 
"They're all has-beens, not like you, still a real player," a reporter said.
"That's cold," Mr. McLemore said, looking at his passenger. "Have you met Michael Allen, yet?" he said. "He's Marcus's younger brother."
Oh.
Mr. McLemore and the Allens are a few of a number of San Diego-born and -bred athletes who made it back for the big party. Another native, Ricky Williams, the Miami running back, gave his own party at the Blue Tattoo on Thursday. Donovan McNabb, the Philadelphia quarterback, was one of the bigger luminaries on Wednesday night, along with the linebackers Bruce Smith and Marcellus Wiley.
 Most of the fans find their way to the Gas Lamp Quarter at night. Their revelry begins at a sort of restaurant row at 7 p.m., continues as the streets pulse with people and music around 10 p.m., then falls into disrepair after 1 a.m., when the most serious carousers start to take the streets. Six rickshaw companies work the late shift, pedaling the inebriated home.
Mark Shadinger, a Raider fan called Spike, traipsed out of a bar on Wednesday night, waiting for more of Raider Nation to join him. Someone asked him where the fan widely known as Violator was this evening.
"We don't baby-sit each other," Mr. Shadinger grunted, unsmiling. Mr. Shadinger is a scruffy, hairy man, with actual spikes protruding from his shoulders, across from the skull with the eye patch. He looks more rugged than a Hell's Angel, but the effect wears off after he reaches into his wallet and presents you with a business card and his very own Spike trading card.
"Here, want one of these?" he said, sheepishly.
Jennifer Martin was not sure what to make of it all. She is a second-grade teacher from San Diego, taking in the madness with her two friends.
"There is more of an L.A. scene than a San Diego scene here this week," Ms. Martin said. "You come back next week and it'll be a lot more laid back. You got too much of this L.A. vibe right now, people in black and worried about what they're wearing. By next week, the town will be back to flip-flops and jeans."
Brook and Paula, Ms. Martin's friends, were chatted up at the W by Mr. Sanders and Mr. Irvin, who referred to each other as their personal assistants. 
"They've been hitting on my friend Paula for a while," Ms. Martin said. "I've decided if nobody's there, Deion will hit on himself."
Mr. Sanders, now a television com mentator, was almost incredulous when the three San Diego women did not know who he was. It was not clear whether Mr. Sanders, the two-sport athlete once simply known as Primetime, was actually upset or putting everyone on.
But it did not help when, after the commotion subsided, Ms. Martin wondered aloud, "So which one is Deion?"
He is the guy who said it was past his curfew several hours ago, the former player -- nursing a drink by a faux cabana in the imported sand, trying to stay incandescent for as long as old Super Bowl legends can. 
"Oh, you got me," he said, closing in on 1 a.m. at the Magnet. "I guess it's not time to go to sleep."
The week of the big game, Bedtime for Primetime always comes late.

HEADLINE: At the Beating Heart Of an Export Machine 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China 

 BODY:
THE giant maroon, blue and white cranes here hoist 40-foot-long steel freight containers onto four container ships, each as long as two football fields. The cranes work around the clock, yet lines of trucks bearing containers keep coming, and vessels often crowd a nearby anchorage waiting to be loaded at Yantian port.
 The port, open less than eight years, is just one of a half dozen in the Pearl River delta in southeastern China, including the world's busiest container port, Kwai Chung in nearby Hong Kong. Together these ports now handle almost as many containers as all the ports in the United States combined, and are growing much more swiftly. More than a third of the electronic goods, clothing and other products that flood through here are headed for America. 
 With 3,000 miles of navigable waterways and hundreds of barges that bring containers full of parts right to factories' docks and take away assembled merchandise, the delta is turning into a Venice of manufacturing. The region has led the way in China's extraordinary transformation into a global trading power, producing fully 40 percent of China's exports. 
Yet in recent weeks, the delta has also been the scene of an acrimonious struggle over who will control the highways, bridges, tunnels and ports that transport an ever-growing river of goods.
The fight has been pitting some of Asia's wealthiest tycoons, like Sir Gordon Wu and Li Ka-shing, against one another. The tussle is also a contest over the delta's political future, as increasingly assertive municipal governments here and in other cities of Guangdong Province try to seize control of logistics and shipping businesses long controlled by Hong Kong.
The delta region is slightly larger than Connecticut, extending from Hong Kong and Macau, at the mouth of the delta, to Guangzhou, 80 miles upstream, and to Huizhou to the east and Foshan to the west. It exports nearly the same value of goods as all of Mexico or South Korea.
The rising trading power of China -- its exports leaped 22 percent last year, and it now trails only the United States, Japan, Germany and France -- has been especially important for transportation companies and port operators. Countries that are more developed rely heavily on exports of high-value products that are either small, like computer chips, or that require practically no shipping, like banking and insurance services. But China's ascendancy is in manufactured goods, from shoes and furniture to fax machines and electric fans, and these tend to be bulky products for which shipping and logistics account for a considerable portion of the final price.
EACH city in the delta is now trying to capture as much of this business as possible by outbuilding its neighbors, often with wasteful and duplicative results. Five international airports were built in the late 1990's in a 60-mile radius, and a similar boom is starting for ports and bridges.
"The Pearl River delta has already become one metropolis," said a recent report from CLSA, the investment bank, and Civic Exchange, a nonprofit research group in Hong Kong. "Administratively, it remains a nightmare with many jurisdictions."
Several Hong Kong developers, led by Sir Gordon, chairman of Hopewell Holdings, want to build a bridge from Macau to Hong Kong's Lantau Island and a new deep-water container terminal port at the western end of it. That would allow factories on the southwest bank of the Pearl River, which lacks deep harbors, to send goods by truck to the new port for loading onto ocean-going ships.
But Shenzhen officials want a tunnel farther up the river, connecting Zhuhai to Shenzhen. That would mean more goods going through Shenzhen's ports. And Guangzhou officials want to build an immense new container terminal farther upstream.
Guangzhou is also replacing its airport with an enormous new one, to compete with Hong Kong's four-year-old airport and recently opened airports in Zhuhai, and is brushing off criticism from Hong Kong that it is all unnecessary. "We are not asking Hong Kong not to develop," Lin Shusen, the mayor of Guangzhou, said recently. "In the same vein, there are some projects that we need to develop, and we hope Hong Kong will not expect us not to."
Even before any construction can begin, trade in the delta will be in for some big changes. On Feb. 2, the United States Customs Service will start levying penalties on any shippers that send containers to the United States without first complying with a 14-item checklist intended to reduce the risk that weapons of mass destruction are concealed inside. The new rules apply to exporters all over the world, but may particularly be a problem here, where exporters take pride in their ability to minimize inventory costs by sending goods to ships hours before sailing time. 
Concerns about security rules, port construction plans and other logistics issues are no minor matter here in the delta, where as much as a fifth of Hong Kong's economy depends on the processing of goods for export.
Ports, bridges and tunnels do not just create jobs for dock workers and truckers. Garments and pairs of shoes that cost $2 to make in the delta sell for many times that in the United States, partly because many tasks must be done between the factory gate and the store shelf overseas. These include sorting and inspecting merchandise, packing it into containers, and financing and insuring the goods. Computer printers, VCR's, telephones and other electronic goods are the delta's biggest exports, followed by textiles and apparel, with 36 percent of the shipments going to the United States and 23 percent to the European Union. 
The world's largest multilevel industrial building is an immense complex in Hong Kong owned by an American company, the CSX Corporation. The 14-story building at the Kwai Chung docks has 16 miles of roads inside, mostly of three lanes, and handles 10,000 trucks bearing containers each day. Companies like Adidas, Wal-Mart, Target, Next and Liz Claiborne all lease space in the building for various tasks, like inspecting garments.
In one room, lacy white women's vests from the Next brand are loaded into a container in exactly the order they will need to be unloaded at a British department store -- eliminating the need for warehouse and sorting space in Britain. Each vest is already on its hanger and has a tag with a price in British pounds.
But packing and loading containers is not cheap. Especially expensive are the handling charges the shipping lines have levied on exporters in recent years. The shippers contend that they are only passing on what they describe as unusually steep fees collected by port operators in China.
In suggesting a new port, Sir Gordon has played on the anger that many exporters here feel at the handling charges, which are highest in the delta. American and European importers, not Chinese exporters here in the delta, typically pay all freight charges except for initial loading fees. Many shippers contend that the port operators form an oligopoly that overcharges the shipping lines for loading containers.
"Hong Kong has got the highest charges of anywhere in the world for terminal charges," Sir Gordon said. "And you know where the second highest is? Yantian, the same management."
The port operators dispute this, especially Hutchison Port Holdings, the world's largest, which manages more than half of Kwai Chung and all of Yantian. John F. Meredith, the company's group managing director, contended that other ports had even higher charges although they used different names for them. He also accused the shipping lines of charging customers much more than they are paying the ports.
"The shipping lines are desperate to get income into their systems, with freight rates so low," he said. Shipping executives deny that they are padding the charges.
HUTCHISON is a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, which in turn is controlled by Mr. Li, Hong Kong's wealthiest tycoon. Mr. Li has more than most at stake in the debate over a bridge across the Pearl River, as he also controls two-thirds of the many shallow-draft barges with cranes operating on the river. The barges collect containers up and down the river, then sail to the mouth of the delta and load the big boxes directly onto ocean-going ships.
Hong Kong's port operators question the insistence of Guangzhou officials that a huge port at Nansha is even feasible. The muddy Pearl River is too shallow to accommodate modern container ships, and shipping lines are planning even bigger vessels.
Guangzhou's plan is an enormous dredging operation to deepen the Pearl River's shipping channel to 48 feet from 30 feet all the way from Nansha to the ocean.
Environmentalists are appalled but have limited influence. Hong Kong port operators say that the port in Buenos Aires has not been able to accept the larger container ships despite continuous dredging, and question whether the Pearl River can ever be deepened.
"When you go up the Pearl River, you're going up one of the world's largest gravel conveyor belts," said William McHugh, CSX's chairman of Asian terminals.
The shallowness of the Pearl River makes it attractive for bridge builders, however. Of all the projects pending, the bridge seems to have the most momentum, having received a strong endorsement on Jan. 8 from Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive, while provincial officials in Guangdong have toned down some of their objections. "It's one of the most obvious things that should have been built, but because of the lack of coordination over the last 20 or 30 years, it wasn't," said Franklin Lam, a Hong Kong equities analyst at UBS Warburg.
Hanging over every debate about future civil engineering projects, and over the future of the delta itself, is the region's growing competition with Shanghai and the Yangtze River delta.
The Pearl River delta still has a slightly greater economic output and exports. But the Yangtze River delta is attracting more domestic and foreign investment. It is also far ahead in growth industries like heavy manufacturing, computer chip fabrication and financial services that Beijing sees as more important to China's future than the light industry that dominates the Pearl River delta.
Yet the Pearl River delta could have considerable growth ahead. Its southwest bank has less than a quarter of the output of the cities along the northeast bank. Investors have put most of their money into factories within a three-hour drive of Hong Kong -- allowing entrepreneurs in chauffeur-driven Mercedeses and BMW's to make the trip to their factories and back in a single day. A bridge from Hong Kong to Macau would open up large areas of farmland for development.
Fully developing the other side of the delta is likely to produce another flood of exports from what is already becoming the world's workshop. "Does that mean double the trade?" asked Michael J. Enright, a business professor at Hong Kong University. "Not necessarily, but not much short of that."

HEADLINE: The Revolution That Wasn't 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
EXACTLY 10 years ago today, I.B.M. announced that John F. Akers, its chairman and chief executive, would soon leave. Institutional investors, furious at the company's gigantic losses and stunning decline in value, had for months clamored for his head. Finally, the I.B.M. board blinked.
 The ouster came just three months after the board of General Motors had pushed out Robert C. Stempel, its chief. And it was soon followed by a flurry of headline-grabbing departures at American Express, Kodak, Westinghouse, Apple Computer and other blue-chip companies. 
 The so-called Year of the Sharp Knives seemed to signal a new era, one in which directors would act solely in the interests of shareholders. No longer would they adhere to the gentleman's agreement that poor performance was no reason to kick a chief executive out of office. 
Yet 10 years later, it looks very much as if the corporate governance revolution of 1993 is back at Square 1. Boards are quicker to punish incompetence -- but no more apt to spot criminality. They will howl when quarterly numbers are depressed, yet shut their eyes when the numbers are squishy or even fraudulent. They will use stock grants and options to align management's interest with that of shareholders, yet ignore the temptation the options create for management to drive up stock prices with false promises, take the money and run.
"It now seems that what we had in 1993 was sporadic and random action by high-profile directors at high-profile companies, but no countrywide improvement in corporate governance," said Peter C. Clapman, the chief counsel of TIAA-CREF, the huge pension and mutual fund manager that has long fought for better boardroom vigilance.
No one is satisfied with the status quo. Investors have fled the market. The New York Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress -- all are scrambling to pass laws and write regulations detailing what committees boards must have, what credentials their members must possess, what work they must do. And even with the new strictures, disappointed governance experts worry that, when the economy rebounds, directors will be lulled into complacency yet again.
"I'm just mildly optimistic that the latest reforms will stick if we go into another bull market now," Mr. Clapman said.
This isn't how it was supposed to be. Just as World War I was the war to end all wars, the battle waged by the shareholder advocates of 1993 -- people like Dale M. Hanson, then chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System; Richard H. Koppes, its general counsel; Robert A. G. Monks and Nell Minow at Lens Inc., an activist investment fund; and Ralph V. Whitworth, who founded the United Shareholders Association -- was supposed to be war to end bad governance.
Fed up with "poison pills" that prevented badly managed companies from being acquired, with regulations that made it illegal for shareholders to band together without first notifying the S.E.C., and rules that allowed boards to keep executive compensation policies secret, they waged battles company by company. Many boards and regulators responded, opening corporate policies to public scrutiny and making heads roll. Supine boards and management malfeasance were to be things of the past.
INSTEAD, the nation got blowups at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco International, Adelphia Communications and myriad other corporate scandals since late 2001.
"I was naively hopeful back then that institutional investors would continue to have a scouring effect," said Mr. Whitworth, who now heads Relational Investors, an investment firm that has teamed up with the California retirement fund -- known as Calpers -- to buy large stakes in companies that they want to change. "It just didn't happen."
What did happen is not insignificant. At shareholders' urging, more boards are now made up of outside directors whose independence is not compromised by personal ties to the chief executive or business ties to the company. Pay and pay policies are listed in proxy statements, and shareholders can join forces in everything short of a proxy solicitation without notifying the S.E.C.
Institutional investors, activists and the news media increasingly are placing board activities in a glaring spotlight, too. The Corporate Library, a research group that follows boards, will soon start rating them as if they were bonds -- "from triple-A to junk," as Ms. Minow, a co-founder of the group in 1999, put it. 
Directors, meanwhile, now take more seriously their fiduciary duties to regularly evaluate the chief executive's peformance. "They replace the C.E.O. before the company tanks, not six months after," said Gerard R. Roche, senior chairman of the executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International.
Yet the last year's events certainly prove that good governance is lacking at many companies. What went wrong? Several things, governance experts suggest:
* Shareholders were lulled into believing that the growing use of stock options as part of executive pay would align management's interest with theirs; instead, it tempted executives to push up share prices with accounting tricks. "One of the great drivers of the scandals we've seen in the last few years was executives trying to preserve paper wealth," said Warren L. Batts, an adjunct professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
* There is a growing scarcity of qualified auditors to spot those manipulations. "When I was running the S.E.C., 20 percent of Wharton School graduates wanted to become accountants," recalled Roderick M. Hills, a lawyer who was chairman of the S.E.C. from 1975 through 1977. "Nowadays, the accountants and auditors don't even have M.B.A.'s."
* There is an even greater lack of qualified directors. "The feeling has long been that directors should restrict the number of boards they sit on," said Thomas J. Neff, the chairman of American operations of Spencer Stuart, the executive recruiting firm. "One result is that there just aren't enough good directors to go around any more."
* The boom market of the 90's had a numbing effect on corporate ethics and shareholder vigilance. "We were all doing pretty darned well, and that made it easier to turn away from the egregious self-enrichment of many corporate chieftains," said Anthony M. Maramarco, managing director of the investment firm David L. Babson. 
In fact, some experts now say that the executive suite purges of 1993 may have set the governance cause back a bit by letting the boardroom pendulum swing too far. That, they say, led some directors who had once refused to punish chief executives for anything to punish them for everything.
"A lot of chief executives were turned into scapegoats," said Jay W. Lorsch, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
No question, even the companies that dismissed their chiefs a decade ago, and many of those who followed their lead, have had mixed results. Revenue, profits and stock prices rebounded strongly at I.B.M. after an outsider, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., replaced Mr. Akers. And American Express definitely did well after Harvey Golub, a long-time American Express executive, was moved up into Mr. Robinson's chair, even if Professor Lorsch may argue that the cause and effect is blurred. 
But Eastman Kodak, whose stock plunged last week when its earnings came in below analysts' estimates, is only now figuring out how to make money from digital photography -- and only after George M. C. Fisher, the technolgy guru brought in from Motorola to replace the ousted Kay R. Whitmore, himself ceded the reins to Daniel A. Carp, who had been with Kodak many years.
General Motors has only recently regained its bearings in the automotive market, and its stock still underperforms the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple Computer, 10 years after John Sculley left, is still an also-ran in personal computers. And Westinghouse Electric does not even exist any more -- Michael H. Jordan, a former McKinsey consultant who replaced Paul E. Lego as chief executive, broke up the company, parceling its industrial and broadcasting operations out to disparate buyers.
"With the possible exception of I.B.M., I'm not sure that anything really improved at any of these companies," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, who runs the investment firm Ghriskey Capital Partners.
MAYBE not. Nonetheless, the bloodbaths of a decade ago left a positive legacy in some respects.
Back then, for example, many pundits were shocked when I.B.M. hired a "cookie man" -- as Mr. Gerstner, then of RJR Nabisco Holdings, was disparagingly referred to by some entrenched I.B.M. insiders. Today, companies routinely bring in expertise from outside their industries.
Shareholders, meanwhile, are armed with more information and -- as they routinely take advantage of the right they won in late 1992 to meet freely and act in concert -- with more authority to use it. "We have windows into compensation plans now," Mr. Whitworth, the shareholder advocate, said. "And pressure for change no longer comes solely from shareholders who are well-heeled enough to stage a proxy fight."
Directors have much more at stake now, too, thanks to proposed rules that would make them culpable for malfeasance that takes place on their watch. Mr. Koppes, the former Calpers general counsel, remembers having to threaten directors with public embarrassment to elicit action.
"Today, they are worried about personal liability and criminal charges," said Mr. Koppes, who is now of counsel to the law firm Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
Board members are also worried about their bank accounts. They increasingly own stock in the companies on whose boards they sit. Enron, in fact, may have been the exception that just might prove the wisdom of that rule. In November 2000, the Corporate Library checked out director stock ownership at more than 1,000 companies. "Enron tied for last place," Ms. Minow recalled. "Institutional investors should have been looking at that, and calling them on it."
Washington action may yet make shareholder involvement moot. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, intended as a sweeping overhaul of corporate securities, accounting and fraud policies, is just starting to kick in. The new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board should be up and running in a few months. And the S.E.C. has promised to adopt stricter governance rules.
But snags are already cropping up. S.E.C. staff members have suggested that the oversight board, which was late in starting, defang proposed rules that would have prevented lawyers, companies and accountants from using client or employer confidentiality to keep evidence of misbehavior from shareholders.
In the end, the success of a governance revolution rests with shareholders -- and maybe the market.
"Investors don't usually get really mad if honest capitalists are making a lot of money," said Mr. Maramarco, the investment firm executive. "But throw investors a spitball, and they will charge the pitcher's mound every time."

Is There Such a Thing as a Jobless Recovery?

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
A WALL Street maxim holds that the difference between recession and depression is that a recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression? When you lose yours.
 That saying goes a long way toward explaining the disconnect between recent statistics showing that the economy as a whole is in decent shape, and polls finding that economic anxiety is gripping many Americans. 
 After falling into recession in 2001, the economy did indeed recover in 2002, hard as that is to believe. Despite a sluggish fall, most economists believe the United States expanded at close to 3 percent last year (final statistics are still being compiled). 
But because productivity -- the amount of goods or services produced for each hour worked -- is climbing relatively fast, last year's relatively tepid expansion created almost no new jobs. Instead, businesses are finding ways to get more production out of each current employee. In fact, the unemployment rate has risen from 3.9 percent in 2000 to 6 percent today.
"The single most important statistic that looks ugly and is concerning people is jobs, and we've created no jobs, in the aggregate, in this 11month recovery," said Donald Straszheim, the president of Straszheim Global Advisors and the former chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "For most people, it's about a paycheck, and if you've got a job, you're O.K. And if you don't, you're not."
The lack of job growth is the downside of the productivity boom that began in the mid-1990's and still seems to be continuing today, said Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. In the long run, higher productivity should be good for the economy, leading to broad increases in wealth. But in the short term, it means that 2.5 percent annual growth, which in the late 1980's or early 1990's would have created lots of new jobs, now does not, he said.
"The kind of growth that previously gave us a rising employment environment now gives us a rising unemployment environment," Mr. DeLong said.
THE possibility of war with Iraq and of new terrorist attacks is also depressing confidence levels, said Delos Smith, senior business analyst for the Conference Board, a nonprofit group that assesses consumer confidence each month. (Mr. Smith said much the same thing occurred before the Persian Gulf war, when the board's confidence index fell from 102 in July 1990 to about 55 in January 1991, when the allied bombing campaign began. After Iraqi forces surrendered and oil prices plunged, the index rose 22 points in a single month, an unusually large gain.)
The index now stands at 80.3 and is expected to fall into the mid-70's when January figures are released on Tuesday. This would be lower than at any point since November 1993, at the outset of the long boom of the 1990's. 
What role consumer confidence plays in the economy is a more complicated question. Even Mr. Smith called the board's survey more of an "ambiance index" than a concrete guide to consumer spending. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is known to believe that consumer confidence is of minimal importance to the economy. He and others believe that, regardless of how they say they feel, most people will spend almost all the money they make.
But Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and one of the most bearish forecasters, said the increasing pessimism of consumers is troubling. Mr. Roach has repeatedly warned that the United States faces the threat of deflation, which has gripped Japan's economy for the last decade.
"The American consumer has been the last gasp for the U.S. economy," Mr. Roach said. "If the consumer weakens further, there's not a whole lot left."
Most mainstream economists, however, are more optimistic than Mr. Roach and expect continued moderate growth this year. But unless growth accelerates, Mr. DeLong said, "2003 doesn't feel good at all for the unemployed, and it doesn't feel very good for the employed."
In other words, this recovery is, to a lot of people, merely a statistic -- several consecutive quarters of economic growth that, nonetheless, leave many people feeling as if they are in the midst of a recession.

HEADLINE: Out, Damned Spot 

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
IT'S not exactly an urban mystery. More a case of mass denial, or a lack of anthropological curiosity. Whatever the reason, only some New Yorkers, including, now, the mayor, know that the black blobs stuck to pavements around the city are not part of the concrete mix, not stray bits of asphalt, not hardened drips of roofing tar. No, the splotches, some amoeba-shaped and some round as half dollars, are pieces of discarded chewing gum.
 "Those little black dots on the sidewalk," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called them in November during his regular radio program, lamenting their ubiquity and confiding that he had always wondered what they were. 
"That's gum," he told his listeners. Twice, as if it were hard to believe. 
 The mayor urged property owners to turn this discovery into action. "Hire a company to come and clean your sidewalk," he said. 
 As it turns out, the available arsenal to battle the gum now includes a new weapon: a solvent that vaporizes the splotches. Gumbusters of New York, the company that deploys the mixture, has served about 300 clients, including the Statue of Liberty, since its founding three years ago. Perhaps it's high time for all this attention, because there is evidence that New York's hefty new cigarette tax may be producing a city of even more gum chewers -- and potential gum litterers. 
 True, a smear on the sidewalk is not crime in the streets. It's not an act of terrorism. It's not a battered school system, a rising homeless population, a buffeted economy or the specter of shrunken city services. 
 But hardened gum underfoot is undeniably an urban hallmark. And of course, the bigger and denser the city, the more the gum, which may make New York the gum splotch capital of the world. 
 Like artifacts at a dig site, these splotches can be found where they were abandoned. Many land outside restaurants, stores, subway stations, subway cars and anyplace people have been standing in line. Others, in a sign of good intentions, pile up near refuse baskets on street corners. 
 Who knows? Among the millions of gum blobs on New York's 12,500 miles of pavement may be a fragment from the era of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, who ran a campaign to reform gum litterers in 1939. "Mayor's Gum Drive Off to Fast Start -- Two Companies and a Flood of Volunteers Join Up," read a headline in this newspaper at the time. 
 "It's one of those things that has become a fact of city life," said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District. "I think, on a core level, most people are used to it." 
 Historically speaking, New York may deserve all its abandoned gum. In an odd tale that touches on the Alamo by way of Staten Island, it was here, in the late 19th century, that the world's first chewing gum factory was built. But if the city gave birth to modern chewing gum, it once again has a few forces, not least a mayor, who want to take it off the streets. 

How New York Got Its Spots
 The chewing gum industry got its start in New York because chicle, a rubbery substance produced by the tropical sapodilla tree, found its way to Staten Island. It was carried here, as a chew, by General Santa Anna, the Mexican dictator who prevailed at the battle of the Alamo in 1836. Santa Anna came to Staten Island as an exile, after he was defeated by Sam Houston and after Texas became a state. There he met Thomas Adams, a local inventor.
 In 1869, Adams tried, unsuccessfully, to make tires from Santa Anna's stash of chicle, then gave it a chew himself and liked it better than the paraffin-wax or spruce-resin chewing plugs that New Yorkers were buying from pharmacists at the time. (Today's gums are made mostly with a synthetic-polymer gum base.) By 1876, according to The Encyclopedia of New York City, the inventor had opened Adams Sons & Company on Vesey Street in Lower Manhattan, the first gum factory. Its packages featured a drawing of City Hall and the slogan "Adams' New York Chewing Gum, Snapping and Stretching."
 The Adams company, long a part of Pfizer and now slated to be sold to Cadbury-Schweppes, dominated the gum business that grew up in the early 20th century, making Chiclets, Tutti Frutti gumballs and other brands. Gum spread throughout America, then throughout Europe, as G.I.'s in both world wars enjoyed and distributed the gum supplied in their rations. 
 Gum also spread all over the sidewalks of New York. In a 1939 New York Times article headlined "Bogged in Chewing Gum," a hotel executive complained that "the city of New York may become totally enveloped in refuse chewing gum in the course of time." 
 That same year, Mayor La Guardia embarked on his public education campaign against gum litterers. He pressured gum companies to print warnings on their wrappers about proper gum disposal and announced a search for a "catchy" advertising slogan for a cleanup. His final choice? "Don't Gum Up the Works." As part of the campaign, "some 20,000 wads were scraped from one spot on Times Square alone," wrote Robert Hendrickson, author of "The Great American Chewing Gum Book" (Stein & Day, 1976). 
 So it continued in New York: a lot of gum spit out, a little gum removed. And some gum immortalized. In 1972, a self-defined "disposable artist" named Les Levine who lived on Mott Street cast about 30 pieces of freshly chewed gum in gold. The resulting works, called "Solid Gold Chewing Gum," were shown at the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan; the sculptures are a comment about art, "about the making process," Mr. Levine said in a recent interview.

The Bull's-Eye Stratagem
 These days, discarded gum is practically part of the city's infrastructure.
 "When you think about doing something special, a nicer type of sidewalk or something," said Mr. Tompkins of the Times Square BID, "you have to consider the gum issue." 
 Although gum spots are found throughout the city, the problem is understandably worse in more congested areas. The Grand Central Partnership, another large business improvement district, struggles daily against the litter in its gum-heavy neighborhood. "It's a disgusting sight," said Alfred C. Cerullo III, president of the partnership. 
 And it may be worse below street level. For a time in the 90's, the Transit Authority set up targets at selected gum-encrusted stations and invited passengers to hurl their gum at bull's-eyes instead of dropping it on the ground. The program was discontinued because it was not cost-effective. 
 Many subway riders are inured to the splotches. "It's so dirty, I just block it out," said Eneas Soares, a Hunter College student, pointing to the heavy gum deposits along the downtown subway platform at 96th Street and Broadway.
 That's assuming they know it's gum in the first place. "It's too much to be chewing gum," said Lenora Jones, a retired customer service representative, who sat nearby eyeing an unbroken line of splotches along the platform's edge.
 Too much, indeed. Americans chew about $2.8 billion worth of gum every year, according to a report by Packaged Facts, a market research company. Using Wrigley's 25-cent pack as a measure, that adds up to about 56 billion pieces annually. And there's no reason to think that New Yorkers chew less than their share. "As far as I can tell, gum consumption is pretty uniform across the United States," said Jim Echeandia, a Texas-based confectionery consultant. 
 The city's recently increased cigarette tax, which raised the price of a pack to about $7.50, may mean that New Yorkers will chew even more as they try to reduce their smoking or quit. At the United Grocery at 94th Street and Broadway, Anna Khan, whose family owns the store, now orders six boxes of gum a week instead of the two boxes she ordered before the tax took effect on July 1. "One customer, he used to buy two packs of cigarettes a day," she said. "Since the price went up, he buys five to six packs of gum a day instead."
 New Yorkers -- unlike, say, the residents of Switzerland -- are not famous for their neatness. But it is unclear why depositing gum on the ground became acceptable, especially given that it is officially prohibited as littering or spitting under city regulations.
 "It would be a good graduate student project," said Mr. Tompkins of the Times Square BID, laughing. "'The Rupturing of the Social Contract With Respect to Gum Disposal."' 
 The reduction of subway graffiti got a big boost from new technology that made it easier to clean the trains. For their part, gum makers are trying to devise a gum that does not adhere to pavements. 
 "There are a number of encouraging developments, but no new products ready for consumer testing," said Amy Chezem, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Chewing Gum Manufacturers. The companies also say they have made progress toward a gum base that breaks down over time, but, she added, "The prospect is still a way off."

Scraping, Slicing, Steaming
Until then, gum removal will remain a constant struggle. 
 Sanitation crews for the Grand Central Partnership routinely remove gum from news boxes and phone booths in eastern Midtown. "They scrape it, they use solutions," Mr. Cerullo said. "Every day, seven days a week. It's an ongoing battle." Periodically, he also hires power washers to remove gum stuck to the sidewalk. 
 At Grand Central Terminal, three "degummers" -- employees wielding broom handles outfitted with razor-sharp blades -- patrol the concourse every night at 1 a.m. as part of the general cleanup. The floor, made of Tennessee marble, resists nicking "and allows the gum to come up," said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North Railroad, which operates Grand Central. 
 But perhaps the organization taking the most focused aim at the problem is a small Queens company called, appropriately, Gumbusters, headed by Brad Fields, a trim 32-year-old entrepreneur with a low-key manner and high aspirations.
 So far Gumbusters of New York, one of the American franchisees of a Dutch company, has vaporized gum spots from 500,000 square feet of the city, Mr. Fields said. But that, he knows, is just a tiny clearing here in the petrified-gum forest, and the underbrush can grow back fast. The new McDonald's at 42nd Street hired Gumbusters last September, and needed it to return just weeks later. 
 The nature of his work has turned Mr. Fields into something of a gum anthropologist. "I walk with my head down now, like most New Yorkers, but I do it for business knowledge," he said. He can explain why some wads are huge ("Kids chew four pieces at a time"), why some are just larger than average (probably bubble gum), why some have tails (someone stepped on them when they were fresh, pulling them along the street before they hardened), and how long it takes for a pink, white or green confection to become a grimy stain that stubbornly stays put ("I'd give it about 24 hours").
 Gumbusters has cleaned gum from the sidewalks of Carnegie Hall, the sidewalks of the Magic Johnson Theater in Harlem and Arthur Ashe Stadium. (Pavement cleaning is the duty of property owners, not the Department of Sanitation.) In November, Mr. Fields degummed 100 square feet of pavement in City Hall Park to demonstrate his system to the Parks Department. 
 Bill Tai, who as chief of the department's Manhattan operations branch arranged for the display, was noncommittal about the chance for any Parks Department business. "I don't know what will come of it," he said. "We don't have a lot of extra money in our budget." 
 Around the same time, Mr. Fields demonstrated his company's steam-and-solvent system at the Gumbusters headquarters in Long Island City. With two of the company's five employees, he climbed into a Gumbusters truck painted with smiley gobs of colorful gum. He hopped out at a nearby corner and hooked up a small, portable "gumcart" to a surprisingly quiet generator. "No point in trading gum pollution for noise pollution," he said.
 Then the three men, using a long brush attachment, handily evaporated 25 black blobs from the pavement before moving to another spot. "Probably Juicy Fruit," Mr. Fields said, as one splotch liquefied and dribbled away. "We can smell the gum sometimes. The flavor wafts up."
 The low-pressure system, Mr. Fields added, uses less water than high-pressure power-washing, which must be done at night when pedestrians are absent.
 His prices depend upon gum density, but customers generally pay 35 cents a square foot plus $18 a gallon for the patented solution. His clients can buy their own gumcart from the company for $5,900, as managers for Pennsylvania Station and the Statue of Liberty have done.
 Given the expense of gum removal and the entrenched habits of gum chewers, is cleanup worth it? After all, a gum splotch poses no health hazard, according to Andrew Tucker, a spokesman for the Department of Health. 
 But Mr. Cerullo of the Grand Central Partnership believes that discarded gum should be removed, "whether on public or private property." And Tony Regno, facilities manager at Carnegie Hall, said a degummed sidewalk can make all the difference. After the Gumbusters visit, he said, his pavement looked much brighter without the black spots, making the entire location appear well maintained. 
 Personally, however, Mr. Regno discards his gum in his usual good-citizen way.
 "I swallow it," he said.

Waiting for War Weighs Down Economy

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
CORPORATE executives are reluctant to build new factories. Small business owners are hesitating to hire more workers. Investors are unwilling to put more money in stocks. 
 In ways large and small, the economy has come down with a bad case of the jitters, and one big reason is concern about the increasing likelihood of war with Iraq and the effect it might have on everything from oil prices and air travel to consumer confidence and international financial markets. 
 Weighed down by such worries, the economy has throttled way back after showing signs last year of accelerating toward a reasonable cruising speed, and it could even be at risk of stalling. The stock market is swooning once more, giving up the gains of its rally early this year. Corporations are cautiously predicting lackluster earnings. 
On Friday, the stock market fell to its lowest point this year, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 238 points.
"It has affected sentiment, absolutely," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, an investment firm. "If you're at a management committee meeting, it tends to influence whatever you're talking about. Can I hire somebody? Can I make that investment commitment? The best thing that can happen is to get it out of the way."
While there is no evidence that the economy is driving his decisions about whether to go to war or when, President Bush is aware of the issue. It came up last week during a meeting at the White House with 15 economists.
"What was said -- and he didn't disagree with this -- is that uncertainty hampers investment decisions, and that markets don't like uncertainty," said Brian S. Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago, who was at the meeting.
A quick military victory, economists said, could bring sighs of relief in oil and financial markets, and help bolster business, investor and consumer confidence. A drawn-out diplomatic standoff could leave the economy and markets suspended between fear and hope. A prolonged or bloody conflict would hold the risk of damaging the economy.
Success in the war would also strengthen Mr. Bush's hand on Capitol Hill, where he faces opposition from Democrats and a few moderate Republicans to the centerpiece of his economic plan, $670 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, including an immediate repeal of the tax on stock dividends. A less positive outcome in Iraq could weaken Mr. Bush's dealing with Congress. 
The political perils of the relationship between Iraq and the economy were reflected last week in a New York Times/CBS News poll. While Mr. Bush's overall approval rating, at 59 percent, remains high, his approval rating on foreign policy has dropped to 52 percent from 68 percent last summer and 75 percent right after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Approval of his handling of the economy, at 44 percent, is down from a peak of 64 percent 15 months ago. Perhaps more worrisome for Mr. Bush, his disapproval ratings on the economy nearly doubled, to 49 percent, over the same period.
Mr. Bush and his aides have long asserted that the right way to think about the economic implications of confronting Iraq is to consider not the costs of action, but rather the costs of inaction. Failing to remove a despot with the means to create havoc in a critical region would leave the United States open to potentially calamitous losses of all sorts, including economic ones.
Whether war cost $40 billion or $80 billion or $200 billion (all figures that have been bandied about), it would be well worth it if the threat of weapons of mass destruction were removed from Iraq, White House officials said, even if it meant a temporary increase in the already ballooning budget deficit.
But while such an infusion could provide a not-inconsiderable jolt to the economy, the administration is intent on keeping overall government spending far below levels of the last few years by limiting or cutting budgets outside of the military and domestic security, an effort that the Republican-controlled Congress seems willing to take seriously. As a result, the fiscal stimulus from any war is likely to be limited, though Mr. Bush is still pressing for a big tax cut to help the economy.
THE attempt to tamp down the fiscal effects of a surge in military spending is just one way in which this war is likely to be different from World War II or Vietnam, when huge increases in defense revved up the overall economy. Another is the greatly increased importance of national psychology in determining the strength of financial markets and the economy, and vice versa.
"Capital market risk of the sort caused by the prospect of war reaches the heart and the wallet of the individual now like it's never done before, because he's got a mutual fund instead of a C.D. and a 401(k) instead of a defined benefit pension," said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pimco, a bond trading firm. "This war, which by definition begets risk aversion, also happens at a time of post-bubble disorder in the corporate sector, which has made companies disinclined to invest anyway."
Yet if winning a quick war would help lighten the mood in the markets and the executive suites and the shopping malls, it would not eliminate the broader threat of terrorism and would still leave Mr. Bush to confront the next threat posed by his axis of evil, North Korea. So the relief rally from even a decisive military victory over Iraq might prove short-lived.
"The risk of something unexpected and bad happening has never been higher than it has been since 9/11," Mr. Paulsen said. "That will remain whether we go to war with Iraq or not."

HEADLINE: RESPONSIBLE PARTY/HARRY MILLER; 
A Practical Economics Of Growth

BYLINE:  By JUDY TONG 

 BODY:
INCHWORMS, shoes that grow with your child, could help make many a weary parent a little less footsore. Instead of hitting the shoe store again every few months for your child, you can stay home and stretch the Inchworms. The shoes expand by two half sizes, giving you, and your wallet, a little breathing room. 
 Harry Miller, 43, is co-inventor of the Inchworm and president of the Harry Miller Company, an industrial textile manufacturer in Boston started by his grandfather and now the parent of a shoemaking subsidiary, Inchworm Inc. 
Before Mr. Miller joined the family business, he was vice president for business development at K2 Inc., a sporting goods company that makes, among other things, several brands of athletic footwear. 
 So shoes were not a big reach for Mr. Miller when, shortly after he took over as president of Harry Miller in 1998, a friend in South Korea, Kwon Dong Chil, sent him the prototype of what would become the Inchworm.
 "The first shoe he sent me was 'Frankenstinian,"' Mr. Miller recalled, but over two years he and Mr. Kwon refined the prototype. In the summer of 2001, Mr. Miller moved to Pusan, South Korea, for nine weeks and, working out of Mr. Kwon's shoe factory there, the two hammered out the final details. The shoes have been in stores for about a year.
 "People have said to me, 'Why hasn't someone done this before,' " Mr. Miller said. "The reason is it's not easy to do."
 To expand an Inchworm shoe, one presses a button on the outside and then pulls the ends of the shoe until it clicks into the next half size. In the unlikely case of a shrinking foot, the process can also be reversed. So a size 1 to 2 Inchworm, for example, would fit a child whose foot was size 1, 1.5 or 2. An accordion-like plastic molding in the middle of shoe expands or contracts, while an inner sole equal to the middle size of the shoe, like 1.5, does not change.
 Inchworms, which sell at retail for $45 a pair, are available in stores nationwide as well as on the company's Web site, www.inchwormshoe.com. Only four styles are available so far, but new ones will be introduced at the 2003 World Shoe Association trade show in Las Vegas.
 "We're expanding the expanding shoe," Mr. Miller said with a chuckle.
 Of course, the real question may not be whether parents will buy the shoes but whether children will wear them. After putting his shoes to the ultimate test, Mr. Miller is confident they will.
 "My middle child, Max, is 5, and he is a tough customer," he said. "And he loves our shoe. I would bring him a prototype, and he didn't care that my financial future may ride on them. When you're 5, man, you tell the truth." JUDY TONG

HEADLINE: Happy Endings Start Here 

 BODY:
For weeks, during the 91st campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Times readers have been able to glimpse the lives of people they help through the fund.
 Carolyn Braddy, who has raised her four children despite multiple sclerosis, received help with her rent. Vinod Gupta, who has a heart condition and a brain tumor, now has beds where his family can sleep. Roy Lantigua, 11, blessed with intellect and ambition but born with underdeveloped legs and no arms, has a new computer to help him discover a world that has been beyond his reach. And there is Caryll Adderley, whose cancer has given her about a year to teach her 16-year-old son, an aspiring chef, how to survive without her. His chances look better now that he has received the equipment he needs to learn his craft. 
 These New Yorkers remind us how unexpected circumstances can ruin the most modest expectations. So many readers have helped with donations, with apartments, even jobs. Others sent checks to the fund's seven participating agencies. While total contributions are short of last year's level, this campaign has been remarkable for the number of people responding: 2 percent more than last year, many of them first-time donors. Despite the economic hard times -- or perhaps because of them -- these generous people animated Thomas Jefferson's belief that "every human mind feels pleasure in doing good to another." Their donations mean that thousands of other stories may have happier endings and brighter new beginnings.
To add your contribution, you may donate online at www.nytimes.com/neediest or at CharityWave .com; write a check, made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and send it to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245; or give by telephone at (212) 556-5851 (Extension 7). To delay may mean to forget. The current campaign ends on Friday.

Fiscal, and Physical, Belt-Tightening

BYLINE:  By CHARLES L. P. FAIRWEATHER 

 BODY:
In perhaps another measure of consumer confidence in the economy, or lack thereof, more Americans say they would rather reduce their debt than their weight when given a choice of the two goals for 2003.
 About 37 percent of the 1,012 adults questioned in a random-sample telephone survey this month said that they planned to concentrate on their fiscal fitness this year, while 29 percent said they would focus on physical fitness. 
About one-quarter were equally focused on both, with the rest focused on neither, or undecided.
 Those trying to pay off debt wanted to wipe out $10,911, on average. The respondents trying to lose weight said they wanted to shed an average of 22 pounds. The poll was commissioned by Bankrate Inc. and conducted Jan. 3-5. CHARLES L. P. FAIRWEATHER

HEADLINE: U.S. Supports Anticrime Group In the Caucasus and Central Asia 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BINDER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
With concern growing about the dangers worldwide of organized crime and terrorism, the United States will provide financial support for law enforcement to a regional group of countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia, officials from the United States and participating countries said this week.
 The five -- Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova -- formed their regional group four years ago and are planning a law enforcement center linking their police forces, border guards and customs authorities. 
 Their model for coordinating law enforcement is based on a center in Bucharest, Romania, that links Balkan governments to combat international crime. It has been in operation for two years under the auspices of the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative, which also has substantial American support. 
Underscoring the increasing American interest in the wider region, John F. Markey, director of regional law enforcement programs at the State Department, said in a speech here this week, "Assistance to Southeast Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus in 2002 is approximately $1.8 billion -- a large percentage of it focused on rule of law and good governance." 
He said "the ability to control or interdict items of contraband and weapons of mass destruction" was a priority in supporting these efforts.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage helped initiate the joint dialogue between the regional group and the United States three years ago.
The United States has already committed $6 million for customs and border control improvements by the five-country grouping and is supporting World Bank loans for further enhancements.
The five countries, formerly part of the Soviet Union, are members of the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States, the grouping that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union. But their joint regional efforts are entirely separate.
"Russia is not a member," said David Soumbadze, an official of the Georgian Embassy here, "but it is not an anti-Russian alliance." 
"Our group has common problems, a common threat perception and, I hope, a common vision." 
A State Department official said efforts were being made to interest Armenia -- and eventually Russia -- in participating, or at least to send observers to the group's meetings.
Officials of the five countries will meet next month in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to begin constructing a "virtual center" -- in cyberspace -- with a data bank integrating law enforcement information dealing with both conventional crime and terrorism. 
Meetings are also scheduled next month for customs officials in Kiev, Ukraine, and for border protection officials in Tblisi, Georgia. Overall strategy will be discussed in Yalta, Ukraine, in March.

 BODY:
Controversial Bishop Fights On in Retirement
 He really worries, he says, about "the soul of America." 
 In 1989, the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr. retired as the Episcopal bishop of New York, ending a 17-year, often controversial tenure as an eminent embodiment of theologically and socially liberal Christianity. 
He ordained an avowed lesbian as a priest in 1977, the first ordination of a declared homosexual in the Episcopal ministry. He was an outspoken advocate of civil rights laws, antipoverty programs, nuclear disarmament and socially responsible behavior by corporate America. 
He could be blunt. In one Easter Sunday sermon, he declared that businesses that moved out of New York City while it struggled with severe fiscal problems were "like rats leaving a sinking ship." He also took on public officials, clashing repeatedly with Edward I. Koch, then the mayor, over issues involving homelessness. 
The bishop's supporters saw a cutting-edge clergyman guiding his church to a modern outlook and socially relevant role. Conservative Christians and other critics saw a "limousine liberal" in ecclesiastical vestments driving his church down a deviant road of endless left turns.
Fourteen years into retirement, Bishop Moore, who wrote a 1997 memoir, "Presences: A Bishop's Life in the City" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), maintains the same perspective as when his views drew a spotlight. In some cases, he says, his concerns have grown, as they have about homelessness in the city. "I think things are so much worse now," he said of the matter last week.
And the clergyman who ardently opposed the Vietnam War maintained that an American attack on Iraq would be "horrendous, killing thousands, even millions." 
In his retirement, several causes, including independence for East Timor, have been among his priorities. Formerly under a repressive occupation by Indonesia, East Timor became independent last year.
Bishop Moore, 83, has also taken part in efforts to preserve the battlefields on Guadalcanal, where, as a young Marine officer in World War II, he was gravely wounded by a bullet that narrowly missed his heart. His motive, he said, is to "help the economy" of the island by maintaining it as a draw for visitors.
These days, Bishop Moore said from his Manhattan home, he is in an uphill battle against an aggressive cancer. But he focuses on positives. "I feel I had 60 extra years," he said, citing his close call on Guadalcanal.

This Pioneer in Spaces Never Quite Took Off
In April, a resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Theodore Angelus, turned on the ignition on a business idea: charging fees to bring together those seeking parking spaces in the area with those vacating them.
As Mr. Angelus, a former owner of a shaving implements company, outlined it, someone who paid $22.95 a month to his Street Parking Exchange was to call it a half-hour before leaving a space, and another member calling in search of a space would be told about the coming vacancy.
The scheme got press attention, but today it is as lifeless as a dead battery.
"It ran about six months," Mr. Angelus said last week. About 500 people signed up, he said, with about 100 giving him their credit card information to pay the fee. But he said he did not complete any transactions because the venture never seemed to be gaining traction.
"The basic problem was not enough callers who were leaving spaces," Mr. Angelus said. He reported losing about $5,000 in promotional costs.

HEADLINE: Trying to Put Mexico First, With No U.S. In the Way 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
U.S. out of Mexico!
 This is, in so many words, the cry rising in this country's Congress, where some are trying to change the nation's official name. That name is the United Mexican States. They prefer plain old Mexico. 
 The implications, it should immediately be clear, are large.
"The official name is a fawning imitation," said Ignacio Burgoa Orihuela, the nation's premier constitutional scholar. "It is wrong."
If so, it has been wrong since 1824.
When the United Mexican States came into being, its ministers had just won liberation from Spain. They took the name because, in part, they liked they way the white-wigged Americans had made a federal republic out of states. The Mexicans did things a little differently: they created their own states out of provinces, and a nation out of the states.
"The only model they had was the United States," said Lorenzo Meyer, a leading historian and social critic. "They wanted the past to disappear. The idea was to erase it."
But the admiration that created the United States of Mexico definitely diminished after the Americans took half of the country during the war in the 1840's. It is arguably still dwindling. 
Few in Mexico support a war with Iraq. Once friendly relations between President Vicente Fox and President Bush have cooled. In fact, it was the leaders of Mr. Fox's own party who moved the name change forward in Congress this week.
The tension between the word Mexico and the other official names that have appeared on maps and pesos has a long history. 
Mexico is a Nahuatl word, from the people who were here before the Spaniards came in 1519. Its origins are misty. It means "navel of the moon," and may derive from the reflection of the full moon in the great lake that once surrounded this capital. 
The Spanish sacked the city, drained the lake and changed the name to New Spain. The name stuck for three centuries, until the United Mexican States was coined.
The tension persists. "Maybe we should just erase 'Mexico' and keep 'United States,' " Mr. Meyer said. "That's the sad truth: we are an extension of that country."
A decidedly unscientific sampling of public opinion found some recognition of Mr. Meyer's "sad truth."
"In some ways we are almost part of the United States already," said Regina Solis, 34, a chemist in the city of Guaymas with two teenagers working as farmhands in the United States. "They invade us more and more, not with weapons, but in our daily lives. Soon we'll be using dollars instead of pesos.
"The government, instead of inventing idiocies like this, should be working to save our culture, our customs, our identity," she said.
But Congressman Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, the man behind the name- change movement, passionately believes that preservation is precisely what he is doing.
"For me, the name of our land is Mexico," Mr. Calderon, the leader of the National Action Party in the lower house of Congress, told a radio audience on Thursday. "People tend to forget that the official name is the United Mexican States. And when they remember, a great sinking feeling, a great restlessness, washes over them."
Mr. Burgoa, the constitutional scholar, said the idea's time had come.
"We are subordinated economically, politically and socially to the gringos," he said. "Nevertheless, the name must change. Legally, by definition, it is the wrong name."
