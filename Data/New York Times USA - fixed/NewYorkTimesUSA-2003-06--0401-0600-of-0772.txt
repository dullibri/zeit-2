Technology Elite Are Focusing Next On Human Body

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 14 

 BODY:
With his consent, Richard Saul Wurman's personal medical data was discussed, dissected, and portrayed in multicolored graphs and 3-D images before an audience at the first "Tedmed" conference here this week.
 The data did not come from any standard physical exam. Its sources included an analysis of Mr. Wurman's genetic profile, an armband that monitored his physical activity, a "life shirt" that recorded his stress level and a full-body scan taken last month. 
 "People want to know," Mr. Wurman's refrain went, and one of the main themes of the four-day gathering that he organized focused on exactly that: with the aid of a growing number of technological tools, people can now know far more than ever before about the state of their health. 
Mr. Wurman, 68, founder but no longer organizer of the two-decade-old TED conferences in Monterey, Calif., for leaders in technology, entertainment and design, says his conviction that technology's next big wave will arise from its intersection with medicine (the "med" in Tedmed) may be tinged with wishful thinking.
Still, it is a view echoed by many of the scientists, technologists, doctors, entrepreneurs and drug company executives who assembled here to assess and perhaps accelerate the melding of technology and biology. If the first phase of the information age celebrated an assortment of virtual realities, the next phase may be all about using technology to reconstitute the body that it never quite succeeded in allowing us to transcend.
Stephen M. Case, the founder of America Online, who spoke at the conference, remarked: "I have the same instinct I had when I got involved with the Internet world 25 years ago, which is that something is bubbling. And it's pretty darn interesting."
Mr. Case, who described his efforts to spur the search for brain cancer treatments after the death of his brother Daniel from the disease last year, attributes some of the new buzz over biotechnology to the aging of his technology industry peers. As people like Mr. Case, 44, who recently stepped down as chairman of AOL Time Warner; Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates; Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison; and other Silicon Valley leaders encounter health problems in the lives of people they know, it seems natural for them to look to technology to address a growing sense of mortality.
"It's starting to dawn on them that in the grand scheme of things, these laptops with a new wireless connection are not the main event," Mr. Case added. "And a new generation of 19-year-olds who 10 years ago might have said 'Internet,' or 20 years ago might have said 'PC's' are going to be heading in this direction too.' "
If the past is a fair indication, the opportunity to make money will be at least as persuasive as the potential to enhance people's lives. It may bode well for this nascent field that even at a time when raising money is extremely difficult, leaders of some of the medical technology start-up firms represented at the conference said they were managing to attract lots of interest.
CapMed, based in Wilmington, Del., has joined in a partnership with Cigna HealthCare to distribute key chains that store a person's health records and plug into the USB port of any computer to display the information. CapMed will begin selling them for $35 in a trial in Lancaster, Pa., this summer.
Similarly, Astro Teller, chief executive of BodyMedia, said that Roche Diagnostics this summer would begin selling his company's armband, a small computer with a processor and sensor, for $300 to $400 as a weight-management tool. BodyMedia says the device can measure how many calories its wearer burns. Users enter a list of what they eat each day into the accompanying computer program, and the computer displays the gain or loss in calories.
The logic behind the device is the same as that underpinning many of the current and future technology tools invoked at Tedmed: a much larger chunk of the $1.4 trillion that Americans spend annually on health care can be attributed to behavior than to genetics.
Most people know, for instance, that they should eat better or exercise or not smoke, but they don't. Technology can help, the argument goes, by allowing more precise self-monitoring or enabling patients to transmit the information to health care professionals. People are more likely to change their behavior, this idea has it, when they know someone is watching them.
"To change people's behavior you need body awareness," said Mr. Teller, whose company is near closing its second round of venture capital financing after initially receiving $15 million from underwriters, including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
As promising as it may sound, Mr. Teller managed to banish any hope that a medical information age would be less laden with hyperbole than the Internet era that preceded it. Products like his, Mr. Teller predicted, "will be the tipping point for public health and health care that the microscope was for scientific biology and disease."
Still, while many casualties of the Internet boom offered cures for nonexistent problems, the state of the health care system in the United States seems to cry out for change. With health maintenance organizations raising rates, more companies are transferring more and more responsibility for health care costs to their employees, who sometimes seek new solutions.
"People are fed up with health care," said Stephen Barrie, founder of the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory in Asheville, N.C., which specializes in genetic testing. "And the Internet has whetted their appetite to get real answers to their questions."
Dr. Barrie said the laboratory's test on Mr. Wurman, for instance, showed that he was taking a common medication for high blood pressure that was unlikely to be effective for him and for about 10 percent of the population with a similar genetic profile. People must be referred to the laboratory through a doctor to receive these tests, which cost $200 to $300 and are based on technology developed during the sequencing of the human genome.
Small companies are not the only ones who see financial opportunity in all this. Pharmaceutical companies regard personalized drug treatment as a potential windfall, and technology companies see new customers in the need to process vast amounts of data to find the needed new drugs. Scientists, too, may profit. Mr. Case was cornered in the lobby after his talk by Joseph Penninger, a geneticist seeking financing for a biotechnology company to pursue his research on cancer.
Still, some barriers to achieving the kind of interdisciplinary harmony that could significantly improve the health and longevity of Americans were apparent at the conference. Pharmaceutical executives complained that scientists were providing them with too much data and technologists were not coming up with the right tools to sort it. Scientists complained that pharmaceutical companies let financial concerns stand in the way of applying their work, and technologists wished doctors and drug companies would adopt their new products more quickly.
"We're in the middle of a real convergence of biology and information technology," said Caroline Kovac, general manager of IBM Life Sciences. "But we're from different worlds. We need to create a new generation of scientists that can put these things together, and there's a real urgency because this is about people's lives."
If the futuristic vision of what Richard Satava, program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, called the "biointelligence age" sometimes seemed to recede during sweaty conference breaks in the lobby of a theater without air-conditioning, those attending were at least not in danger of forgetting their fleshbound reality.
Enthusiasm generally prevailed, even in the face of humidity.
"We have reached the inflection point in information technology where we've moved from revolution to evolution," said Dr. Satava, whose projects include developing cyborg moths and robot surgeons. "But there is another revolution fomenting, and if we master it, we will be the first species to control our own evolution." 
Linda Stone, a former vice president at Microsoft and veteran of many TED conferences, had a less lofty prediction:
"For the last 20 years, we had an ideal that was all about having these exciting virtual connections that enhanced our productivity, our connectivity, our opportunity," said Ms. Stone, who is working on a book about how social cycles affect business. "The next 20 years are going to be much more physical."

HEADLINE: A New Sign on Harry's Forehead: For Sale 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
When the fourth book in the wildly popular Harry Potter series went on sale three years ago, children, parents and bookstore clerks contrived homemade robes, glasses and wizard hats to dress for the occasion.
 This time, merchandisers are leaving nothing to the imagination. When the next installment, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," goes on sale midnight Friday, fans can buy officially licensed paraphernalia like a Harry Potter robe with built-in "fiber optic lights," ($55.99), a battery-powered magic wand with flashing lights and sound effects ($12.99) and forehead-scar makeup ($7.49). 
 J. K. Rowling, the author of the series, has often said she wanted to protect her stories from becoming encrusted with marketing pitches and merchandising plugs, but she may have finally lost the battle. Her fifth novel is the first to arrive since Warner Brothers began making Harry Potter movies and selling the licensing rights. Out of deference to Ms. Rowling, the licensing agreements try to block toy or candy companies from tying their products directly to the books. But retailers are capitalizing on the anticipation of the new novel to push everything from Harry Potter video games to bubble bath. 
Officially under wraps until the day of release, the new book is setting off an unprecedented marketing melee. Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us will stack copies of the book alongside piles of DVD's, Legos, action figures, candy and stuffed toys.
Bookstores large and small are defending their turf with elaborate spectacles, including a miniature golf course, a human chess game, a functioning railroad train and carnivorous plants, owls, rats and lizards. Other publishers are hoping to ride Harry Potter's coattails, with one even pushing a Marxist critique of the marketing of Harry Potter.
Scholastic, which publishes the Harry Potter books in the United States, says it expects early sales of the new book to double the record-breaking sales of the last one, even though it is nearly 900 pages long and has a $29.99 cover price. Judy Corman, a company spokeswoman, said it planned two initial printings totaling 8.5 million hardcover copies of "Order of the Phoenix," compared with an initial printing of 3.8 million for the previous volume, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." (There are 11.5 million hardcover copies of "Goblet of Fire" in print, at about 760 pages with a $25.95 cover price.)
The movies now account for much of the growth in the already extraordinary popularity of the books. Barbara Marcus, president of children's books at Scholastic, said that more than half of the 80 million Harry Potter books in print in the United States were sold in the last three years, when film versions of the first two books were released. The biggest jump, she said, came with the release of the first film, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." 
"In our world, not everyone is a reader first," she said. "There are people who go to movies and then realize there is a book."
Although Ms. Rowling knowingly sold the film and merchandising rights to Warner Brothers, a unit of AOL Time Warner, she has often worried aloud that movies and merchandising might overshadow or cheapen her stories. "I would do anything to prevent Harry from turning up in fast-food boxes everywhere," she said in an interview three years ago. "I would do my utmost. That would be my worst nightmare." (He is not in fast-food boxes yet, but he is in Coca-Cola ads.) 
Even some young fans now roll their eyes at the flood of Harry Potter products, from lunch boxes to souvenir stones. "None of the kids are crazy about it," said Emma Bradford, 9, of Brattleboro, Vt. "Some people say how stupid it is that they are coming out with Harry Potter toothbrushes and things like that. I think they should just stop with the books and movies, otherwise it just goes sort of overboard into a more Disney thing."
Diane Nelson, the senior vice president of Warner Brothers in charge of marketing for Harry Potter, said the studio would deliberately lay low during the book's publication "primarily out of respect for Jo Rowling's wishes to keep the movies and the books separate so that the books can be appreciated for their own integrity."
For example, the toy makers Mattel, Hasbro and Lego encourage stores to promote their products along with DVD's of the Harry Potter films by including coupons for the toys or by displaying them together, but agreements with Warner Brothers preclude any coupons or toy promotions tied directly to the books.
Still, that does not stop retailers from doing anything they can to sell Harry Potter knickknacks and candy along with each book. Discounters, toy stores and retailers that do not specialize in books now account for the majority of sales of many blockbusters like Harry Potter.
Chains like Wal-Mart, as well as the major bookstore chains and online stores, all plan to sell the new book at discounts of as much as 40 percent off the cover price -- nearly the same as the wholesale cost -- in part because they hope to sell shoppers other goods. And almost all will be displaying the new books surrounded by Potter paraphernalia. 
Roughly 1,300 Wal-Mart stores, for example, will hold special midnight events for the release, including food from the stores' bakeries decorated with a Harry Potter theme and coordinated displays of Harry Potter toys, clothing and DVD's, said Karen Burke, a spokeswoman for the chain. 
The flagship Toys "R" Us store in Times Square has already arranged two designated Harry Potter zones near its entrance piled high with Legos, action figures, candy, DVD's and copies of the previous books. It, too, will reopen at midnight with an event for the new book's release.
Jim Dale, who narrates the audio editions of the Harry Potter books, will read there and Scholastic has provided exclusive signed editions of a Harry Potter poster by Mary GrandPre, who illustrates the books.
At the Jelly Belly Candy Company, which makes a version of Harry Potter's magical Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans -- flavors include ear wax, vomit, "boogers" and grass -- salesmen have reminded retailers that the publication of the new book is "a tremendous opportunity to have our product on their shelves," said Pete Healy, vice president of marketing. He said Jelly Belly has expanded its business by selling Bertie Botts beans to hundreds of bookstores for sale in tandem with the books.
Jenie Carlen, a spokeswoman for the bookstore and music chain Borders, said its stores have sought "creative ways" to sell the products while respecting Ms. Rowling's wishes. For example, she said, in some stores it uses three-sided displays, with Harry Potter books on one side, CD's of the soundtracks and audio books on another, and DVD's on a third. Its stores sell the Bertie Botts beans in its cafes. But at Scholastic's behest, she said, Borders does not mention any other products in its advertisements featuring the book.
Amazon.com, which offers over 480 Harry Potter products, has reaped a windfall of publicity by beginning to take orders in January, posting a Harry Potter countdown and an hourly total of the orders. Barnes & Noble, the largest bookstore company, and its Web site, bn.com, are raffling off a five-night trip to England, and its stores will hold their own midnight events.
Other authors and publishers are also hoping to take advantage of the publicity, even some who might be suspicious about the Harry Potter marketing juggernaut. Verso, which recently published "The Irresistible Rise of Harry Potter," a Marxist analysis of the phenomenon by the British scholar Andrew Blake, is writing to stores and setting up interviews for Mr. Blake to coincide with the release of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."
Richard Abanes, whose "Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick," argued that the books can lead children toward the occult, says he is seeking interviews and is meeting with Christian booksellers to promote his follow-up, "Fantasy and Your Family."
Facing competition from the large chains selling copies of the books at discounts they often cannot afford, independent bookstores are resorting to increasingly theatrical events to get attention. 
The Northern Lights Books and Gifts store in Duluth, Minn., is holding a party in a defunct train station, where a working train will pull in at midnight loaded with books. The Book House in St. Louis is creating a haunted house in its Victorian building.
In Manhattan, the Books of Wonder children's bookstore, on 18th Street, has arranged for a magician and two live owls. At Community Bookstore in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the owner is making her own chocolate frogs and bringing in her four-foot-long pet iguana.
Perhaps the most elaborate event is in Oak Park, Ill., near Chicago, where the Magic Tree bookstore has enlisted two dozen local businesses and organizations and more than 30 volunteers to turn its neighborhood into a giant homage to the books. Some attractions include tours of a local bank's vault by clerks dressed as goblins, giant chess games where humans move as pieces on command, and a campy miniature golf course billed as an exhibit for the study of "muggles" -- nonmagical people in the parlance of the books.
Thanks to promotion it received on Mugglenet.com, a Web site for Harry Potter fans, the Magic Tree expects more than 5,000 people to turn up, said Debbie Mitchell, the employee organizing the event.
"It is getting harder and harder for us," Ms. Mitchell said, noting that a Borders store had recently opened up a few miles away. "That is part of the reason we are doing this, to help us stand out."

Fate of Tax Credits Rests With Houses Divided

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
Representative Bill Thomas of California, who can accelerate from disagreement to outright scorn faster than anyone on Capitol Hill, had a characteristically withering remark this week for a provision he disliked in a Senate tax bill.
 "Sounds like a Senate product," said Mr. Thomas, a Republican and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, not bothering to conceal his contempt for legislation sent his way by the upper house. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, all Midwestern modesty and manners, practically rolled his eyes today when asked why the Senate and the House were so far apart on tax credits for low-income families and the issue's impact on the deficit. 
"It's the orientation of the two houses," said Mr. Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee. "One says if you get anything done, it's got to be done in a bipartisan way. And in the other house" -- nodding his head toward the House of Representatives -- "it's a tradition to do things more in a partisan way."
These two men must now spend the next few weeks negotiating whether to provide child tax credits to 6.5 million families who make the minimum wage. To say that they dislike each other, as staff members acknowledge, is almost beside the point; they represent two chambers that have drifted so far apart on the issues of taxes and the deficit that there is almost no chance of their resolving the low-income issue on their own.
For Mr. Grassley and most other senators, it is important,morally and politically, to provide poor families with the same $400-per-child increase in the tax credit as middle-class families get, while not increasing the deficit to do so. For Mr. Thomas, who helped take the credit for poor families out of the tax law President Bush signed last month, it is not a high priority to give tax refunds to people who do not pay income taxes. The point of tax cuts is to stimulate economic growth, he and other House Republicans have said, not to redistribute income; with such stimulus, they say, the deficits will eventually disappear.
Usually, when House and Senate negotiators of the same party meet to iron out a bill, they have the same general goal in mind, but with different approaches or needs. Typically, such conference committees split the difference, and members walk away satisfied if not pleased.
This conference committee, if it meets at all, will be different. Because the two sides do not share the same goal, their differences are harder to reconcile. A senior Senate Republican aide said he expected the tax credits to die in a deadlocked conference, which he said appeared to be the intention of House Republicans. Unless the White House steps in and demands that the House leadership back off its hard-line stance to silence the Democratic catcalls on the issue, this aide said, the credits will follow the party like a black cloud.
Democrats have made it clear they will push that cloud from place to place.
"These working and military families pay taxes just like everyone else and are struggling to make ends meet in today's stagnant economy," wrote Senator Tom Daschle and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders of their chambers, in a letter to President Bush today, urging him to break the deadlock. "On behalf of the families of the 12 million children now waiting for this tax relief, we ask you to correct this callous omission as quickly as possible."
It is not certain, however, that even White House intervention can make a difference. 
Earlier in the week, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, urged the House to pass a Senate bill that provided the credits. The request was not only ignored but dismissed with a sneer by Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas and the House majority leader. Mr. DeLay then led the House in passing a bill on Thursday that included the credits in a much larger tax-cut bill that provided 96 percent of its benefits for middle- and upper-class taxpayers.
"This president is not held in particularly high regard by House members like DeLay and Thomas," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who will be the only House Democrat on the tax conference. "It doesn't mean anything to them to embarrass him, because they'd rather have a political showdown."
Mr. DeLay said in floor debate that the bill "crystallizes the differences" between the two parties, but it more precisely illustrates the differences between the two chambers on how to cut taxes in an era of big deficits. House members are still smoldering over the Senate's decision this spring to limit the year's tax-cut legislation to $350 billion over a decade, which is hundreds of billions less than House leaders would have preferred.
If senators think they can solve the short-term problem of the child credits without agreeing to the House's long-term goals of much bigger tax cuts, Mr. Thomas said, they should think again.
"This is raw politics," he said, referring to the try by Senate Democrats to make use of the child credit issue. "Someone figured out a way to get prime-time television in an impassioned way at virtually no cost between now and the election."
The Senate bill would cost the treasury nothing, paying for its $10 billion cost by raising customs fees the same amount. The House bill would cost $82 billion. The two chambers will not simply meet at $41 billion and shake hands, because House leaders will not accept any revenue increases, and the Senate, particularly Democrats, will not agree to increase the deficit to pay for tax cuts. 
Until the issue is resolved, however, Senate Democrats have said they will try to attach the child tax credits to unrelated bills -- from Medicare to energy -- in the hopes of forcing the House to surrender to bad publicity for stalling needed legislation. But under the House's current management that seems unlikely. Asked about the political consequences of holding out indefinitely, Mr. Thomas responded with his customary bravado.
"Is it politically risky that we have enough time to really expose the politics behind their strategy, and be willing to leave that open?" he asked. "It's up to the Senate. It can be a one-hour conference, or it can be a forever conference."

An Aversion To Smoke And Parties

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
GIVE credit where due. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is consistent.
 He says that he's doing what he thinks is right, that the polls will take care of themselves, that New Yorkers will eventually catch on. And maybe they will, especially if the economy improves and Mr. Bloomberg again spends generously on himself if he runs for re-election in 2005. 
 But with his approval rating at a record low of 24 percent in the latest New York Times poll, even some close supporters of the mayor are wondering if his Mike-knows-best style is the right approach for a city struggling through such a hard time.
The smoking ban in bars and restaurants and its unintended consequence of crowded, smoky sidewalks has not endeared him to all, and now there's another claim on his political passions -- nonpartisan elections.
Mr. Bloomberg is embracing the idea, appointing a second charter commission to devise a proposal for the public's consideration. The idea is to break the power of the city's Democratic machine, says the mayor, a Democrat who switched to the Republican Party to run for mayor.
Mr. Bloomberg is calling not only for change, but for quick change. Civic groups, some editorial writers and even some Bloomberg advisers have recommended that any proposed change go into effect after 2005, so it would not appear to be tainted by Bloomberg self-interest. Democrats are already saying that the mayor's motivation is a selfish one in overwhelmingly Democratic New York.
Not true, says the mayor, who is openly impatient. "If you believe that it's a good idea, what possible argument could there be that the public should not take advantage of a good idea?" he asked in an interview on NY1 News last week.
One argument: If the new system were to go into effect in 2005, Mr. Bloomberg's re-election year, opponents could make the vote about him, rather than about a major change in the political system. "He made himself the issue," a Bloomberg adviser said.
A second argument: It might be too difficult for the commission to examine the complexities of nonpartisan elections in just a few months. 
Under nonpartisan systems, candidates who used to be nominated in party primaries instead have to get a certain number of signatures on nominating petitions. Ballots do not cite party affiliation.
Theoretically, insurgent and independent candidates would have a better chance to succeed than they do now, and supporters say, voter turnout would grow.
But it has not always worked out that way. Critics say turnout actually has gone down in many places because parties and political supporters like union leaders have little motivation to turn out the vote.
"There are serious voting rights implications because party label is an important informational cue to some voters," particularly the poor and members of racial minorities, said Douglas Muzzio, a professor at the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College. He said studies have shown that nonpartisan elections tend to be more race-driven and favorable to incumbents.
Dick Simpson, political science professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, said the impact of nonpartisan elections nationwide was not yet clear.
CHICAGO, which also has an entrenched Democratic tradition, elects its City Council and mayor in nonpartisan systems. Of 50 aldermen, 49 are Democrats, and in the two nonpartisan mayoral elections held so far, the Democratic incumbent, Mayor Richard M. Daley, won re-election overwhelmingly.
"Our nonpartisan mayoral elections might have worked the same way if they'd stayed partisan," Professor Simpson said, suggesting that the details are critical. "You cannot change the basic political power by monkeying with electoral techniques, but you can set goals."
Critics of the system in Chicago are already suing for change, complaining that because so many signatures are required on petitions, independents are losing out to candidates with better-organized support.
New York has another complication: its campaign finance law. Participating candidates abide by contribution and spending limits. Now, spending by a party on behalf of its candidate is subject to the same limits as other contributions. What would happen in nonpartisan elections?
Mr. Bloomberg is presumably counting on the charter commission to sort things out. Last year, his commission turned out to be truly independent and, saying it needed more time, did not put a proposal on the ballot. This year, Mr. Bloomberg's new commission chairman, Frank J. Macchiarola, has already said that the issue "will be put forward."
The unintended consequences come later.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
A Diplomatic Success, And Cheney's Daughter

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Liz Cheney, a deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Near East bureau who also happens to be the daughter of the vice president, slipped quietly into her Foggy Bottom office a little more than a year ago and has kept her head down since. Like her father, Ms. Cheney rarely gives interviews, doesn't like to have her picture taken and thrives in the background.
 But in recent weeks, Ms. Cheney's State Department portfolio -- the economic development of the Arab world -- has become a central part of the White House strategy for remaking the Middle East. And she herself has stepped, briefly, out into the light. 
 Her project, a $100 million collection of 40 programs called the Middle East Partnership Initiative, will be a focus of an economic conference in Jordan that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is set to attend this week.
President Bush threw his weight behind the initiative in a speech last month at the University of South Carolina, where he promised that it would promote literacy and democratic reform. Many of the programs are directed at educating women, teaching them their legal rights or helping them run for office.
"There's a great Egyptian poet who said that if you educate a mother, you educate a nation," Ms. Cheney said yesterday in a very careful telephone interview, in which she agreed to talk about the program but not herself.
Although the program provides only a small part of the $1 billion in annual economic aid that the United States gives to the Arab world, its goals are an unusual amalgam of ideas usually associated with liberals, such as improving the status of women in the developing world, and with neo-conservatives like Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, who argue that the United States has an unparalleled chance to spread democracy throughout the Middle East after the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
Ms. Cheney, 36, finds herself at what she considers the natural confluence of those two forces. Despite the enormous resentment of the United States in the Arab world and the hurdles in promoting American-style reforms, she speaks with optimism. 
"The Moroccans just held elections in which significant numbers of women were elected," she said. "The Omanis have announced that they'll allow women to vote for the first time. And women ran for office in Bahrain for the first time last year." Ms. Cheney also pointed to economic reforms in Jordan and Egypt. "The United States," she added, "wants to do whatever it can to help support those changes."
One of the first of Ms. Cheney's programs brought 55 Arab women who are political leaders to the United States to observe the 2002 midterm elections and to meet with Mr. Powell as well as James Carville, President Bill Clinton's former political operative. Another program will showcase Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who in September will lead an American delegation to Bahrain to discuss judicial ethics and the selection and training of judges with jurists in the region.
Friendssay that Ms. Cheney got her drive and focus from her mother, Lynne Cheney, who worked while Liz and her sister, Mary, were growing up. "Her mother, regardless of whether anyone agrees with her ideology or not, has a long history of accomplishment in the public arena," said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the United States ambassador to Morocco, who has known Liz Cheney for years. 
Ms. Cheney, Ms. Tutwiler said, "is forceful, but in a way that's nonabrasive."
Ms. Cheney, who grew up as the daughter of a man who was White House chief of staff, a Wyoming congressman and a secretary of defense, was raised in Wyoming and Washington. She graduated from McLean High School in suburban Virginia, then from Colorado College in 1988. In 1989, when her father was the first President Bush's defense secretary, she went to work at the United States Agency for International Development, eventually as an officer at the agency's office in Budapest, where she worked to develop small businesses in Hungary.
By 1992, Ms. Cheney was working on economic development projects for Richard L. Armitage, who was then a State Department coordinator of aid to the former Soviet republics. When Mr. Clinton became president, Ms. Cheney went to work for Mr. Armitage at his consulting firm, Armitage Associates, where her work included analyzing the status of the financial sector of Kazakhstan.
Ms. Cheney then went to law school at the University of Chicago, graduating in 1996, at which time she joined the Washington office of the law firm White & Case. She worked there in international finance and, in 1999, moved to the International Financial Corporation, a private-sector arm of the World Bank. There, she worked on investments in the Middle East and central Asia.
In March 2002, Ms. Cheney went back to the State Department, where she immediately began working on the Middle East initiative. She was initially reluctant to take the job, friends say. "She was concerned: how could she be treated normally?" Ms. Tutwiler said. "Her father is not just the sitting vice president, but an extremely influential one."
Ms. Cheney's colleagues were at first not sure what to make of her, but they say now she has won them over. "She is completely a team player," said Catherine A. Novelli, the assistant United States trade representative for Europe and the Mediterranean who works with Ms. Cheney. "She is somebody who wants to be recognized on her own merits."

Subway Shaves List Of Candidates to Four

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
Subway Restaurants has narrowed a review for the creative and strategic planning parts of its account to four finalists. Although billings were not disclosed, Subway spent $218.6 million to advertise in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 Chris Carroll, marketing director at Subway, which is based in Milford, Conn., identified the finalists as: Deutsch in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group; and the New York and Portland, Ore., offices of Wieden & Kennedy. 
 Four agencies were eliminated from the review. Two are also part of the Partnership division of Interpublic, Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York and the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va. The third is McCarthy Mambro Bertino in Boston, which is creating a commercial for Subway on a project basis. The fourth agency eliminated was not identified.
Euro RSCG MVBMS in New York, the incumbent agency since March 2000, withdrew from the review on Tuesday. Euro RSCG MVBMS is part of Euro RSCG Partners, a division of Euro RSCG Worldwide, which is owned by Havas. Joanne Davis Consulting in New York is helping manage the review, which is being overseen by the Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust. A decision is expected in mid- to late-July.

HEADLINE: The Terminator and the Hulk Help Build a Career 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 15 

 BODY:
"This should give you an idea about how clear a director's vision can be," the film producer Gale Anne Hurd said as she pulled a small painting off a shelf in her Beverly Hills office one day last week.
 There, airbrushed in muted shades of brown and black, was Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title character in "The Terminator," one red eye glowing as half his scalp had been peeled away to expose a metal plate underneath. The image, a conceptual rendering for use by the makeup and costume designers, was painted more than 20 years ago by her husband at the time, James Cameron, who co-wrote the 1984 Schwarzenegger science-fiction epic with Ms. Hurd and directed it. 
 Mr. Cameron moved on to other spouses and other films, including the 1997 blockbuster "Titanic." But Ms. Hurd is still specializing in science-fiction action spectacles like "Hulk," which opens on Friday. Special effects, though, have come a long way.
Bruce Banner, the film's protagonist, turns from an impassive scientist, when threatened, into an angry green monster. And rather than airbrush renderings, the monster was created solely on a computer. Long before filming began, the movie's director, Ang Lee, donned an electronic suit and acted out a number of scenes to provide the basis for what became the on-screen character, Ms. Hurd explained.
"With Jim, he had to draw," recalled Ms. Hurd, one of four producers on "Hulk." Mr. Lee, on the other hand, had "the opportunity to make anything he can imagine in his mind real," she said. 
Even as filmmaking technology has evolved, though, Ms. Hurd's interest in movie storytelling has been consistent throughout her producing career, which has focused on the supernatural and the fantastic, including the outer-space horror film "Aliens" (1986), the undersea adventure "The Abyss" (1989) and the earth-threatening asteroid spectacle "Armageddon" (1988), on which she was one of three producers. 
Only with rare exception does she stray from this path, as with the 1999 wacky comedy "Dick," a film she produced about a teenage girl with a crush on President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate period.
"It's arrested development," said Ms. Hurd, who is 47. "You have to go back to the literature that consumed me as a child." That would include the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, Ursula K. Le Guin's "Wizard of Earthsea" fantasy series and action-hero comic books like "Hulk," "Spider-Man" and the "Fantastic Four."
"I liked books that took me places," she said. "I liked being transported." 
As a result, she has been willing to exercise enormous patience in waiting for her projects to hit the screen. "Hulk," she explained, was initially set up with Universal Studios in 1991. And the third installment of the Terminator series, "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," of which she is an executive producer, is due in theaters next month -- 12 years after "Terminator 2" and 19 years after the original. 
"Perhaps the lesson in Hollywood I should have learned is not to resist, that when the wind is blowing in one direction you go with it," she said. But after pondering the notion, she added, "I don't want to learn that lesson." 
Ms. Hurd was born in 1955 and graduated from Palm Springs High School in 1973 before heading off to Stanford, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa four years later with majors in communications and economics. 
She started in the industry working for Roger Corman, the B-movie maker, through whom she met Mr. Cameron. They were married for three years, but even after the divorce they collaborated on several films, including "The Abyss." 
Ms. Hurd's business and personal life are seldom separate. She is now married for her fourth time, to Jonathan Hensleigh, who is a screenwriter and will direct the crime thriller "The Punisher," which Ms. Hurd is producing. (She met Mr. Hensleigh before they started working together, she said.) 
One of her other former husbands is the director Brian De Palma, with whom she shares custody of their 11-year-old daughter, Lolita, who is named for Ms. Hurd's mother. 
Ms. Hurd and Mr. De Palma met in 1990, when she invited him to dinner to try to persuade him, without success, to direct a film she wanted to make. 
In all, she has produced 28 films for, among other studios, Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures.
"She has been down so many roads so many times that nothing fazes her," said Mary Parent, the president of production at Universal Pictures. "It's all in a day's work." 
Ms. Hurd says it would be difficult to get a movie like "The Terminator" made today. "They would think of it as an $80 million film -- not a $6.4 million film, which is about what it cost," Ms. Hurd said. "With a first-time producer and director" -- as she and Mr. Cameron were then -- "it would be much harder to get people to believe we could do it." 
And audiences and studio executives have grown to expect flashier, more spectacular special effects. She attributes that partly to the proliferation of video games and the stylized editing popularized in music videos on MTV, which she said, has left moviegoers wanting a more vivid experience. 
"The intensity has changed the tone and the type of movies which get made," she said of today, compared with the early 1980's, when "The Terminator" was released. "The bar has been raised higher than ever, so even though the special effects hold up for its time, those effects would not have been good enough today." 
But technology has also proved a threat to the studios, as it has gotten easier to appropriate those images and circulate them on the Internet. Recently, an early version of "Hulk" began circulating online, and several people who saw it panned the computer-generated image of the angry monster, saying it was too cartoonlike. 
"The problem is, it is more difficult for us to safeguard prints," Ms. Hurd said. With digital editing and distribution, copies can too easily be siphoned off the network stream. "With anticipated films," she said, "this is going to happen a lot."

HEADLINE: Beyond the Bulbs: In Praise of Natural Light 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LIBBY 

 BODY:
Joel Loveland and G. Z. Brown are self-described evangelists of natural light.
 As directors of the Better Bricks Daylighting Labs, nonprofit centers devoted to helping architects maximize natural light in their buildings, Mr. Loveland and Mr. Brown consistently preach the benefits of the sun's illumination. 
 "Daylighting is as old as architecture itself," said Mr. Brown, who is also a professor of architecture at the University of Oregon. "But with the invention of efficient electric light, it's something we've gotten away from."
Until recently, the rationale for using daylight was predicated largely on economics and altruism: greater reliance on natural light reduces energy consumption and costs. Now, a new generation of research is providing additional justification, including improved human performance.
Among the most significant are two studies conducted by Heschong Mahone Group of Sacramento, Calif. One involving 20,000 students in California, Colorado and Massachusetts in 1998 and 2002 found that standardized test scores among comparable students could be as much as 26 percent higher when they attended classes in buildings illuminated primarily by natural lighting, compared with those who relied mainly on artificial light.
Another Heschong Mahone study, conducted in 1995 at a Wal-Mart store in Lawrence, Kan., showed 40 percent higher sales at checkout counters underneath skylights.
At the Lighting Research Center, part of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, environmentally conscious architecture and human biology are being analyzed together. The goal, said Dr. Mark Rea, the center's director, is to move beyond experiments that look at light's effect in existing settings to determine how and why natural light affects humans on a biological level. The center has drawn from previous studies of the relationship between seasonal depression and natural light, particularly those of Dr. Alfred Lewy of Oregon Health Sciences University, to determine that human performance is improved by natural light. A comprehensive research study is due to be released this summer.
Electric illumination replicates light levels the human body needs to see, but for the rest of the body "it's ineffective compared to something as simple as waking up and looking out the window at the blue sky," Dr. Rea said.
Artificial light exists primarily in the long wavelength, the red region. But the body's circadian system, governing waking and sleeping patterns, prefers light in the blue region of shorter waves, which suppress the natural hormone melatonin and stimulate the horomone seratonin. The combination leads to greater alertness.
In a 1971 study of employees at a power company running day and night, the British researchers Robert Aldsworth and D. J. Bridgers showed that unvarying electric light led to low-level sensory deprivation, thereby reducing productivity. People need variability in their view, easily provided by a window, to give the eyes and mind a rest.
A psychological element is also involved. "People like to know what's happening outside," said Mr. Loveland, a professor of architecture at the University of Washington, even if it is just to get information about weather and the time of day.
A study at a Colorado software company, conducted by the Lighting Research Center, found that programmers in offices with natural light spent more time at their computers than those in windowless offices. For them, social interaction replaced the suppression of melatonin that occurs naturally with sunlight.
While the benefits of natural light may seem obvious, planners have sometimes been reluctant to provide it in their buildings. Many school classrooms, for example, have been designed without windows, in some cases to eliminate distractions and in others to cut costs.
And when natural lighting is provided in office buildings, the coveted window space is often designated for a handful of executives, while most employees are forced to rely on glaring, flickering, buzzing light tubes hanging from the ceiling.
In his lectures, Mr. Loveland often cites a New Yorker magazine cartoon in which an employer touring a series of cubicles with a colleague explains that "dim fluorescent lighting is meant to emphasize a general absence of hope."
Still, architects seeking to bathe buildings in natural light can create as many problems as benefits. Simply adding windows is not necessarily the answer. "When we work on a project in the daylighting lab we often spend more time taking them out than putting them in," Mr. Loveland said. If a window is added to a space, the designer must determine how to balance the room's luminosity by spreading that light around.
Mr. Loveland calls architecture "a profession in denial" when it comes to evaluating how design will affect light levels. According to a study conducted by the power company PG&E of San Francisco, 90 percent of architects interviewed said they used daylight as a consistent design element. But fewer than 3 percent investigated the effects of different design decisions involving daylight.
To reverse that trend, Mr. Brown's and Mr. Loveland's laboratories in Portland and Seattle offer architects a variety of design tools. Some, like the heliodon, evaluate an existing design. Architectural models are placed on the heliodon, a rotating apparatus, to measure simulated light levels inside throughout the day and year.
But Mr. Brown stresses the importance of a series of formulas and calculations that help designers devise lighting solutions before their first blueprints are completed.
Some strategies are as simple as measuring the length and height of windows in relation to the depth of a space. Others rely on material suggestions like louvers and window coatings that allow indirect sunlight while minimizing windows' unwanted heat gain and glare.
Even a small design change saving energy can have a huge effect on the bottom line, Mr. Brown said.
"We know people are healthier and more productive with daylight," Mr. Loveland said. "Now it's just a matter of putting it into practice."

An article in Science Times on June 17 about the use of natural light in building design misidentified one state in which researchers studied the effects of lighting on student performance. Besides California and Colorado, the study was carried out in Washington State, not Massachusetts.
The article also misstated a finding. Over the school year, test scores rose as much as 26 percent more in classrooms with natural light than in those without windows. Twenty-six was not the percentage difference in the groups' test scores.
The article also misstated the scene of other research by the same consulting firm, the Heschong Mahone Group of Sacramento, Calif. That research, which found that sales were 40 percent higher at checkout counters under skylights, was conducted in a large retail chain whose identity was withheld, not in a Wal-Mart store.

Those Taxing Layovers
 If you've ever made a long summer car trip, you know that the actual driving is often relatively painless. It's fighting the crowds at the highway rest areas that can really drain the energy out of you. 
 For migrating birds, too, the biggest energy cost is not the flying itself, but the stopovers en route. That's the conclusion of a team of researchers led by Martin Wikelski of Princeton, who measured how much energy thrushes use during their northward migration in spring. 
Unlike earlier studies, which used birds in wind tunnels, this one measured free-flying birds (of two species) during their actual migration, with the researchers capturing them daily over part of the route in the Midwest. 
To measure energy consumption they used the doubly-labeled water technique, in which a small amount of water containing different isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen is injected into the bird each morning. By taking blood samples and determining the proportion of the isotopes in the blood, the researchers could determine how much oxygen, and energy, was consumed.
The team reported in the journal Nature that in flights of up to 350 miles the birds used about 15.5 kilojoules (or slightly less than 4 calories) per hour. But at rest, birds also consume energy to stay warm in the cool spring weather. The researchers found that on a cool day, a nonflying bird could consume as much additional energy as if it were flying for two and a half hours.
The researchers also estimated total energy consumption for a typical six-week migration from Central America to Canada, with 18 flying days and 24 stopover days. Energy used during actual flight accounts for only 29 percent of the total. More than twice as much energy was used when the birds weren't on the move.

Fuel Cells' Flip Side
Proponents of a hydrogen economy talk of a day when fuel cells are the dominant energy source and the nitrogen oxides and sulfur pollution of fossil fuels are a thing of the past. 
Fuel cells are a clean energy source, oxidizing hydrogen in a controlled way and creating only water as a waste product. But if fuel cells proliferate, a system for producing, storing and distributing hydrogen will need to be developed as well. And that could affect the environment, according to a study in the journal Science by researchers from the California Institute of Technology.
The scientists worked under the assumption that any hydrogen distribution system would involve some losses to the atmosphere, which has been the experience with other gases. The researchers estimated these losses -- from leaks or during transfer, for example -- at 10 to 20 percent, which in a completely hydrogen economy could mean up to an eightfold increase in the amount of the gas entering the atmosphere.
To gauge the effect of all that hydrogen, the scientists modeled the atmosphere. For one thing, when it reached the stratosphere, some of the hydrogen would be oxidized, producing water. That would make the stratosphere cooler and cloudier. And that, according to the model, would indirectly affect the ozone layer, making it larger and more persistent.
The researchers acknowledge that there are a lot of unknowns in their study, particularly the amount of hydrogen that might be taken up by soils.

Which Starry Night?
Van Gogh was a man of many mysteries, but one of them has now been solved: the date he painted "Moonrise," which depicts the moon emerging from behind cliffs in Saint-Remy.
Researchers from Southwest Texas State University dated the painting by traveling to Saint-Remy and taking elevation readings and other measurements of the landscape. Writing in the July issue of Sky & Telescope magazine, they describe their calculations that determined that the moonrise Van Gogh witnessed and painted could only have been the one that occurred on July 13, 1889, at 9:08 p.m. local time.

HEADLINE: Emirates Airline to Buy 41 Airbus Planes 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 16 

 BODY:
Emirates Airline signed a deal today at the Paris Air Show to buy 41 new planes from Airbus Industrie, including 21 A380's, the new 500-to-650 seat behemoth that the European consortium is now building. The order is valued at $12.5 billion, making it one of the largest civil aircraft orders ever placed.
 The order for the A380's was a significant sign of support for the plane, which has been heavily criticized by the Boeing Company, a rival of Airbus, as being too big for the needs of the world's airlines. 
 Emirates is trying to transform itself into a globe-circling airline that will carry passengers between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas through its hub in Dubai. The aircraft order fits into that business model. 
All the jets in the order are long-range aircraft built for use in transcontinental hub networks. In addition to the A380's, Emirates ordered 18 A340-600's and two A340-500's, and it agreed to lease 2 more A340-600's and a pair of A380's from the International Lease Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the giant insurer American International Group.
Emirates has ordered a total of 110 planes from Airbus, making it the consortium's largest Middle East-based customer. All told, it has ordered 45 A380's, the most of any airline. The first of the A380's in the new order are due to be delivered in the spring of 2009. 
Singapore Airlines will get the very first A380 to be delivered, in 2006. 
The new aircraft order "will enable us to continue development of our network around the world," said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman of Emirates. He added that the limitations on landing slots at the airports where Emirates wants to operate required the use of large planes. 
Noel Forgeard, chief executive of Airbus, said, "Emirates has now decided where it wants to be in the coming decade." As for Airbus, he said, the order is "vital for us." 
The two men signed the contract before dozens of photographers and news camera operators, the closest thing to a papparazzi mob seen so far at the air show. 
Emirates' fleet now consists of 48 passenger planes and 3 freighters, about evenly divided between Airbus A330's and Boeing 777's. The airline filled an average of 74 percent of its seats with paying customers in 2002, up from 71.5 percent in 2001. 
Emirates, which started out mainly serving the Middle East, has been profitable for 17 of its 18 years, though not hugely so. Last year, it reported a profit of $2.9 million on $2 billion in revenue. It is owned by the government of Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates, and Sheikh Ahmed also serves as head of the emirates' civil aviation department. 
A third of the airline's revenue comes from flights between Europe and Dubai, with the highest frequency of flights being between London and Dubai. It is adding service rapidly to African cities; its longest nonstop flight links Dubai with Perth, Australia. The airline plans to start daily service between Dubai and New York in April 2004. 
Sheikh Ahmed said that the latest order of planes would be financed in a variety of ways, partly through leasing and partly through using "our own resources." 
Emirates also said today that it would lease 14 Boeing 777's from General Electric's aircraft leasing subsidiary and 12 from International Lease Finance. The leases are valued at $6.8 billion, with the first plane to be delivered in 2005. 
Sheikh Ahmed said that leasing the jets minimized his company's financial burden. 
Although Boeing organized the news conference for the leasing announcement, the new leases will not add to the American jet maker's order book. All but 4 of the 26 planes involved are already in the lessors' fleets; the 4 exceptions are already part of G.E.'s backlog of orders with Boeing. 
Randy Baseler, vice president for Boeing's commercial aviation arm, said today that the Airbus A380 goes against the growth pattern of air travel, which he argued was moving away from giant aircraft on long multistop routes and toward smaller point-to-point flights. He estimated demand for planes the size of the A380 at just 320 aircraft over the next two decades, or 11 percent of the total market.
The Emirates order is expected to be the largest announced at the Paris Air Show, which is the biggest in the world and takes place every two years. Qatar Airways is also close to completing a deal for Airbus aircraft, but it is unclear whether there will be an announcement this week. Executives at the show say that this is a fairly quiet year for orders because of the dismal financial state of the air travel industry.

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Tuesday about plans by Emirates Airline to buy 41 planes from Airbus Industrie misstated the 2002 results of the airline's parent company, Emirates Group. It posted a profit of $285.7 million on revenue of $2.8 billion -- not $2.9 million on revenue of $2 billion.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong And China To Sign Pact EasingTrade 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 16 

 BODY:
Top officials from mainland China and Hong Kong will sign a free trade agreement on June 30 that will eliminate all tariffs on many goods and remove restrictions on trade in many services, Hong Kong's leader announced this evening. 
 Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive, said that in addition to wiping out many tariffs, Beijing would give Hong Kong companies greater access to mainland China's markets for management consulting, legal and accounting services, real estate services, wholesale distribution, construction engineering, medical services, transportation, logistics, tourism, banking, insurance and securities. 
 At a news conference here this evening, Mr. Tung said he had come "close to reaching a consensus" on the pact's details during meetings this morning with Chinese officials in Shenzhen, a nearby mainland city. But he declined to provide any details on the crucial question of how the agreement would identify which businesses qualify as Hong Kong companies. 
He also refused to discuss the extent to which goods would qualify for duty-free treatment if they were produced elsewhere, received some extra processing in Hong Kong and then were shipped on to mainland China. 
"These are issues that many are very concerned with," Mr. Tung said. "We have fully taken into account Hong Kong's position as an international city and the present circumstances, adopting rules that are both flexible and easy to monitor." 
Foreign business executives say that unless the agreement excludes Hong Kong subsidiaries of multinational corporations, mainland China may not provide significantly greater access to its service industries than it promised upon joining the World Trade Organization in November 2001.
Hong Kong became a member of the trade organization before Britain returned the territory to China in 1997. It is now a special administrative region of China, but it remains a separate W.T.O. member with its own legal and economic system and separate trade regulations. 
If the new free trade agreement were to provide broad new concessions and encompass the subsidiaries of multinationals, China would effectively be opening a huge back door to its market.
But China and Hong Kong cannot easily restrict the agreement, known as the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, to purely local companies without breaking the trade organization's rules. These rules discourage countries from discriminating among companies based on the nationality of their owners or the location of their headquarters, but the rules are not very detailed and are subject to some interpretation. 
James Thompson, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, said that his understanding was that Beijing ministries would set separate definitions for each industry to determine which entities would qualify as Hong Kong companies. He predicted that China would not provide much greater access for the multinational companies that dominate Hong Kong's financial sector and have much more experience than their potential Chinese rivals. 
Mr. Tung conspicuously mentioned banking, securities and insurance at the end of his list of industries today, even though the financial sector here, like the logistics and shipping industry, is very important to the local economy. By contrast, manufacturing accounts for only 5 percent of Hong Kong's output, said Joan Zheng, the chief economist for greater China at J. P. Morgan. 
Ms. Zheng said that she had seen a draft definition of a Hong Kong company from the negotiations and that it would include only those that are owned and controlled by permanent Hong Kong residents, have been doing business in Hong Kong for at least five years, derive a certain percentage of their revenue from Hong Kong and mainland China and pay Hong Kong taxes. Ms. Zheng cautioned that she did not know if the final agreement would use such a definition. 
If it does, Western governments and foreign companies would be likely to complain. Henry Tang, Hong Kong's secretary of commerce, industry and technology, said on Friday that Hong Kong would abide by its commitments to the trade organization. 
Hong Kong is already a free port that generally does not impose tariffs on any imported goods, nor does it put restrictions on foreign companies providing services. Mainland China still has many such restrictions, although it pledged in November 2001 to reduce some of them by the end of 2006 as part of its entry into the World Trade Organization.
Even at the end of 2006, however, China's tariffs on many goods will still be much higher than American tariffs, and it will still have many more restrictions on foreign access to its service industries. 
Uncertainty about the new agreement's terms has made it hard to estimate how much it will help Hong Kong rebound from the devastating effects of this spring's outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and a World Health Organization advisory against travel here that lasted nearly two months. The secrecy surrounding negotiations for the trade agreement all but guarantees that every large company with operations in China will have to reassess whether and how much it does business in Hong Kong. 
Mr. Tung was optimistic, predicting that the pact "will bring substantial business opportunities for the various sectors here in our community -- it will greatly help Hong Kong overcome its difficulties and achieve economic recovery as soon as possible." 
But Eden Woon, the chief executive of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, warned in a statement tonight that the agreement "will not be a magical pill for all our ills, and we still need to work hard to rejuvenate our economy."

HEADLINE: Brain Experts Now Follow The Money 

BYLINE:  By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
People are efficient, rational beings who tirelessly act in their own self-interest. They make financial decisions based on reason, not emotion. And naturally, most save money for that proverbial rainy day. 
 Right? 
 Well, no. In making financial decisions, people are regularly influenced by gut feelings and intuitions. They cooperate with total strangers, gamble away the family paycheck and squander their savings on investments touted by known liars. 
Such human frailties may seem far too complicated and unpredictable to fold into economic equations. But now many neuroscientists are beginning to argue that it is time to create a new field of study, called neuroeconomics.
These researchers are busy scanning the brains of people as they make economic decisions, barter, compete, cooperate, defect, punish, engage in auctions, gamble and calculate their next economic moves. Based on their understanding of how fluctuations in neurons and brain chemicals drive those behaviors, the neuroscientists are expressing their findings in differential equations and other mathematical language beloved by economists.
"This new approach, which I consider a revolution, should provide a theory of how people decide in economic and strategic situations," said Dr. Aldo Rustichini, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota. "So far, the decision process has been for economists a black box."
Dr. Jonathan D. Cohen, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Princeton, agreed. "Most economists don't base their theories on people's actual behavior," he said. "They study idealized versions of human behavior, which they assume is optimal in achieving gains."
To explore economic decision making, researchers are scanning the brains of people as they engage in a variety of games designed by experimental economists. The exercises are intended to make people anticipate what others will do or what others will infer from the person's own actions.
The games also reveal somefundamental facts about the brain that economists are just beginning to learn and appreciate:
*In making short-term predictions, neural systems tap into gut feelings and emotions, comparing what we know from the past with what is happening right now.
*The brain needs a way to compare and evaluate objects, people, events, memories, internal states and the perceived needs of others so that it can make choices. It does so by assigning relative value to everything that happens. But instead of dollars and cents, the brain relies on the firing rates of a number of neurotransmitters -- the chemicals, like dopamine, that transmit nerve impulses. Novelty, money, cocaine, a delicious meal and a beautiful face all activate dopamine circuits to varying degrees; exactly how much dopamine an individual generates in response to a particular reward is calibrated by past experience and by one's own biological makeup. 
*Specific brain circuits monitor how people weigh different sources of rewards or punishments and how they allocate their attention. A region called the anterior cingulate reacts when people make mistakes or perform poorly; some neuroscientists say it also registers gains and losses, financial and otherwise. A small structure called the insula detects sensations in the body. It is also involved in assessing whether to trust someone offering to sell us the Brooklyn Bridge. 
These structures and neurotransmitter systems are activated before a person is conscious of having made a decision, Dr. Cohen said. 
In a study published the current issue of the journal Science, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues, including Dr. Alan G. Sanfey of Princeton, took images of people's brains as they played the ultimatum game, a test of fairness between two people. 
In the ultimatum game, the first player is given, say, $10 in cash. He must then decide how much to give to a second player. It could be $5, the fairest offer, or a lesser amount depending on what he thinks he can get away with. If Player 2 accepts the offer, the money is shared accordingly. But if he rejects it, both players go away empty-handed. It is a one-shot game, and the players never meet again.
Most people in the shoes of Player 2 refuse to take amounts under $2 or $3, Dr. Cohen said. They would rather punish the first player than feel cheated. "But this makes no economic sense," he said. "You're better off with something than nothing."
Brain images showed that when players accepted an offer they viewed as fair enough, a circuit in the front of their brains that supports deliberative thinking was activated. 
But when they rejected an offer, the insula -- which monitors bodily states, including disgust -- overrode the frontal circuit. The more strongly the insula fired, the more rapidly the person rejected the offer, Dr. Cohen said. Moreover, the insula fired well before the person pushed the button to refuse an offer.
Economists can use this finding to quantify the contribution of emotion and deliberation in making decisions, Dr. Cohen said. It is possible to calculate how much emotion goes into evaluating the worth of economic activities and to study the neural underpinnings of bargaining when people don't want to let others take advantage of them.
Dr. P. Read Montague, a neuroscientist at Baylor University in Houston, is using gambling tasks to identify individual differences in willingness to take monetary risks. Bullish investors have different patterns of dopamine release compared with bearish investors, he said. And in a game of mutual trust, women's brains show a big dopamine or reward response when they are trusted by others; there is no such response in men's brains.
At other universities, neuroscientists are exploring brain activity aroused in various economic games. In the prisoner's dilemma, which tests a person's willingness to cooperate or defect, players show a particular pattern of neural firing before they betray another player. Cooperation is captured in dopamine flows. Similarly, it is possible to trace circuits activated when people anticipate making or losing money, decide to trust a stranger or punish freeloaders in a game of sharing public goods.
The brain is particularly responsive to unexpected or unpredictable rewards, said Dr. Gregory Berns, a neuroscientist at Emory University in Atlanta. When uncertainty is high, as in gambling situations, the brain can get high on dopamine and even become addicted to it.
Expectations alter economic experience. It feels better to get nothing when you expect $10 compared to getting nothing when you expect $90, researchers say. 
Dr. Montague says the brain seizes on patterns and deludes itself into thinking that short sequences predict long ones. For example, after flipping three tails in a row, many people expect the next toss to be heads. By contrast, if a stock does well two quarters in a row, they expect it to continue doing well. Such intuitions lead people to adopt a false sense of confidence and tolerate losses for longer than they should, he said.
Neuroscience may shed light on all sorts of economic behavior, said Dr. George Loewenstein, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "Under the influence of powerful emotions or drives, people often end up doing the opposite of what they think is best for themselves, even at the moment of acting," he said.
For example, many people will choose a small reward that arrives soon as opposed to a larger reward that arrives later. The future is uncertain. Why wait?
For now, neuroeconomic experiments tell more about individuals and small groups than about markets and economies, said Dr. Colin Camerer, an economics professor at the California Institute of Technology and author of a new book, "Behavioral Game Theory."
But plans are afoot to study the brains of many people in scanners linked by the Internet as they play economic games, Dr. Camerer said. The stock market is a reflection of decisions being made by millions of brains. Eventually it should be possible to study groups of brains to unravel mysteries about the formation of market bubbles and why they break. Or why people continue to spend money when the stock market falls. Or whether tax cuts will have a bearing on what people do.
"Your dopamine system plays off my dopamine system," Dr. Montague said. "You buy, I buy, I worry about you, our systems become entrained. You sell, I sell and so on. It may be possible to get to the bottom of this behavior."

Fashion's Pet Charity
 The Prasad Project, a relief organization founded in India in the 1930's, offers medical, dental and nutrition programs and services to impoverished areas of the United States, Mexico and India. It is also the style world's cause du jour. 
 Last Thursday evening, Prasad opened "Beyond Fashion 2003," its annual benefit. The cocktail party and sale of clothing and accessories showcased pieces from luminaries like Sean Combs, Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta and Marc Jacobs. Among the pieces offered at the four-day event, a feverish orgy of getting and spending, were Ms. Herrera's chalk-striped gray flannel suit ($600) and Calvin Klein's pink cotton raincoat ($350). Each item was donated, as was the space, Milk Studios on West 15th Street. 
The promise of Champagne combined with slashed designer prices drew the likes of William Hurt and Phylicia Rashad, an honorary chairwoman, as well as a klatch of young Vogue editors and celebrity models like Carmen Kass. The event was expected to raise about $225,000, roughly the same as a year ago. "Last year, the proceeds represented 26 percent of our annual income, Dermot Hurly, the chief executive of Prasad, said. 
"There is a lot of abundance in the fashion world, and people are willing to share it," said Anoushri Wagner, a New York pediatrician and Prasad volunteer. But others sensed a photo opportunity. Samantha Cole, a singer encased in a tomato-colored satin dress, stopped vamping long enough to volunteer, "I'm deeply committed to any cause that helps children." 
Irina Pantaeva, the ponytailed Siberian model, arrived with an entourage, a VH-1 crew on hand to film her biography -- and record her good works. Ms. Pantaeva was eager to speak out for her cause. "I personally am very impressed that the Prasad program has been actively helping in medical and dental care," she said. "Did you know, for example, that 70 percent of pupils in American schools have dental problems, which makes them miss a lot of school days?" Which of those programs most impressed her? Ms. Pantaeva hesitated, but only for a moment. "I'm sure they cure cavities" came her confident reply.

John Bartlett Goes Preppy
Earlier this month, at the annual awards dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Cynthia Rowley confronted her friend John Bartlett, demanding, "What on earth are you wearing?" The designer, who made his mark on the runways by embracing marginal cultures and espousing styles like police-blue harness-strapped shirts and leather wifebeater tops, was attired in, of all things, jeans and what passed for a Brooks Brothers shirt. "He was looking superpreppy," Ms. Rowley recalled in amazement. 
In an interview last week, Mr. Bartlett disclosed that he was indeed in the throes of a sartorial conversion. "I'm interested in the Brooks Brothers and the Paul Stuarts of the world," he said -- "the much more classic, perhaps more gentlemanly aspect of the business." 
Mr. Bartlett has parlayed that interest into a new fashion venture, his first since shuttering his business nearly a year ago. He volunteered few details, except to say he was embarking on a partnership to produce a line of men's wear. Khakis? Rep ties? Oxford stripe shirts? "It's going to be a single classification," Mr. Bartlett offered cryptically, "and I'm going to build on that."
It is his novel idea, he said, to "find and hire one great factory -- a great pants factory, for example" -- to make nothing but pants. His maverick scheme would allow him to avoid "being overwhelmed with a whole designer collection and an image campaign, which "can be pretty distracting," he said. The collection-oriented approach to fashion is an outmoded model, he suggested. 
Mr. Bartlett's strategy has him seeking out a variety of licensing partners to produce key wardrobe items with classic Ivy flavor. His designs would attract "not so much the fashion customer as the real guy who's interested in great quality," he predicted. "Creatively, my priorities are changing." But more to the point, Mr. Bartlett added, only half in jest, "I don't have anything to wear to an interview."

HEADLINE: Crime Stayed Flat in 2002, F.B.I. Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Crime in the United States remained relatively unchanged in 2002, dropping by a mere two-tenths of 1 percent, a report released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows.
 Despite a sharp increase in homicides in Los Angeles, 2002 was the third straight year that serious violent and property crime were essentially flat, after falling sharply in the 1990's. 
 But criminal justice experts warned that a number of factors could cause crime to start increasing again rapidly. Among those factors are the downturn in the economy, cutbacks in police forces and the courts because of budget shortfalls, a rise in the number of inmates returning from prison and a larger number of teenagers. 
In fact, in some cities, including Portland, Ore., and Seattle, crime is up sharply in the first five months of this year. 
The F.B.I. report also found an increase in homicide in some big cities last year, particularly Los Angeles, which led the nation with 654 homicides in 2002, up from 588 in 2001. Chicago had 648, down from 666, and New York City had 590, down from 660.
The report found that overall crime in New York City fell 4.8 percent last year, making New York one of the safest large cities in the country. Car theft and burglaries also declined significantly in New York. 
City officials released figures last week showing that major crime over all in New York had fallen 8 percent this year from the same period last year.
James Alan Fox, the Lipman family professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University, said the F.B.I. report could be seen as a case of "no news is good news."
"Given the fact that there are a lot of factors that could push crime upward and there was essentially no change, that is good news in itself," Professor Fox, an expert on crime statistics, said. 
But if the federal government, states and cities continue to cut spending for the police, prisons and the courts because of budget deficits, Professor Fox said, "This could create a worrisome picture."
"I wouldn't bet on crime remaining stable if things continue as they are," he said. "It may be just a matter of time."
The bureau's report measures the number of arrests by the police for seven serious crimes: homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Yesterday's report, part of what is known as the Uniform Crime Reports, is a preliminary one. The final 2002 report, to be issued in the fall, will contain figures on crime rates measured by population, a more accurate way to gauge crime.
The flat overall crime figures for 2002 obscured some changes in individual types of crimes, and some variations by region.
Homicide, for example, rose eight-tenths of a percent last year from 2001, and rape jumped 4 percent. Among property crimes, burglary rose 1.5 percent and motor vehicle theft increased 1.2 percent.
The more striking differences were among the four geographic regions the bureau uses to divide the nation.
Overall serious crime dropped 3.3 percent in 2002 in the Northeast, 2.1 percent in the Midwest and 0.1 percent in the South. But in the West, it showed a 2.9 percent increase.
The Northeast, led by New York, also had the biggest drop in homicides last year, falling 4.8 percent compared with 2001. But the report found that homicides rose 2.1 percent in the South and 5.2 percent in the West.
Overall crime also increased in suburban areas, where it rose 1.8 percent, and in rural counties, where it rose 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Rare Bosnia Success Story, Thanks to U.S. Viceroy 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 13 

 BODY:
A decade ago, Samira Hasanvasic said, her parents huddled in a nearby village as Bosnian Serbs hunted down Muslims, torching their houses and driving many into exile. Others they killed, dumping the bodies into the muddy shallows of the Sava River.
 This week, Ms. Hasanvasic, 17, completed her second year in a high school that integrates Muslims, Serbs and Croats -- children of the groups that fought so bitterly over the right to live apart. It is the only city in Bosnia where the three main ethnic groups are mandated to go to school together. 
 "At first, everyone was afraid because of what happened during the war," said Ms. Hasanvasic, gesturing to her friend, Romana Stjepic, a Croat. "But then we got to know each other, and the fear went away." 
Ms. Hasanvasic still dreams of leaving her hometown behind, but not because it was a killing ground. For her, Brcko (pronounced BIRCH-ko) is just run-of-the-mill boring.
Brcko's transition from deadly to merely dull is a remarkable success story -- one of the few in the years that foreigners have been trying to fix this broken land, and one that offers lessons for the United States as it embarks on its latest effort at nation-building in Iraq.
"This was a snake pit, the worst place you could imagine in Bosnia," said Mark Wheeler, director of the Bosnia Project at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "But the international community equipped people with enough authority to get their jobs done."
Today, this river port of 85,000 on the northeastern border of Bosnia has the highest per capita income in the country, a balanced budget and a skyline alive with construction cranes. Ethnic tensions, while not gone, seem to have been relegated to the status of a distraction for which the busy people have no time.
Some of Brcko's success is due to money. Treated as an international protectorate since the war, it has received $2 million a year in direct American aid, plus an estimated $65 million in other foreign aid.
Yet dollars alone do not explain the rebound. Bosnia as a whole has been flooded with anywhere from $5 billion to $15 billion -- more precise estimates are hard to come by -- and it still languishes.
The lesson of Brkco, Mr. Wheeler said, is that would-be nation-builders should install a powerful interim administrator, who is unafraid of defying the local political bosses. With a whip and some cash in hand, this proconsul can override ethnic loyalties and turn local attention to establishing the rule of law and business-friendly policies.
Henry L. Clarke, an American diplomat who became Brcko's third supervisor inApril 2001, turned the tide. He has imposed one law -- on integrating the schools -- over the objections of the city council. He has annulled two others, dismissed local officials and business chiefs, and rammed through reforms.
"The powers are broad, I won't deny that," Mr. Clarke said over dinner. "But the way you get reforms done is with the cooperation of the people. You don't get it by acting like a little Tito."
As for elections -- a perennial concern of American officials -- they have simply not taken place for local posts here. The people of Brcko have voted, largely along ethnic lines, in the four national elections that have been held in Bosnia since 1996. But they have not elected a single city official; instead, the supervisor appoints the city council.
"Thankfully it didn't happen," Senad Pecanin, editor of the weekly magazine Dani, said of local elections. 
"The worst mistake we made in Bosnia was insisting on early elections," he said. "They just confirmed the results of the war in political terms."
Brcko's progress has been so good that Paddy Ashdown, a British politician who last year became the latest European to take on the office of high representative of the international community, said, "I looked at Brcko and thought, 'That's what we ought to be doing,' and I used my powers in a similar fashion."
Bosnia as a whole, however, remains a ruin. Dragged down by old Communist structures and largely destroyed by the war, the economy suffers from mountainous deficit. Elections entrenched corrupt leaders, who stymied economic reforms.
Ironically, Brcko has avoided that general fate precisely because it was so disputed between Muslims, Serbs and Croats that its fate could not be decided at peace talks in 1995.
Finally, an international tribunal ruled that Brcko would be run as a separate district, with an appointed local government and an outside American supervisor who would be fortified with broad powers.
"The U.S. reaction was: 'Oops, we just took on one of the blackest holes in Bosnia. We can't let this fail,' " Mr. Clarke said.
The colony they took over was a shambles. More than 9,000 houses, a third of the total housing stock, had been destroyed during and after the war. The town's port was moribund, its food-processing plants were rusting hulks, and land mines lurked in the surrounding fields.
Perhaps because of his mild manner, Mr. Clarke has stirred little open resentment in Brcko. The Serbian mayor, Sinisa Kisic, describes him as an "adviser rather than one who orders." Only when he forcibly integrated the schools did he provoke a backlash among Serbs, some of whom dubbed the decision "Clarke's Law." Even then, they put up no violent resistance.
Mr. Clarke's latest project is the Arizona Market, a collection of sprawling, seedy stalls on the edge of town. When Arizona first sprouted after the peace accord was signed, it was hailed as hopeful because Serbs, Muslims and Croats met there for trade and business deals that had ceased during the war.
But now Brcko's city council has given control of the land to an Italian developer, who is investing more than $100 million to turn Arizona into a modern shopping center.
Critics have a cynical take on Mr. Clarke's activism: that he keeps inventing new jobs to avoid leaving. "The Americans don't want elections because they're afraid the bad guys will win," Mr. Wheeler said.
Mirsad Djapo, a local Muslim leader, noted that in the last national election, Brcko's citizens voted for the Serbian nationalist party in greater numbers than Serbs nationally. "We musthave elections, but there is always a risk," he said.
And Brcko remains awash in guns. American soldiers go door to door these days, selling raffle tickets for the chance to win a Volkswagen car in return for residents' handing in their weapons. On a recent morning, they collected five hand grenades.
Mr. Clarke said he would not be rushed into packing his bags. But he agrees in principle with Mr. Wheeler's suggestion that Brcko hold elections in October 2004 to coincide with local elections throughout Bosnia.
The debate over democracy stirs little interest among young people here. When Brcko devised a new curriculum for its schools, it scaled back history in favor of subjects like mathematics and computers.
"We're young, and we don't know anything about the war," said Marko Jurocivic, a 17-year-old Serb. "Our history class ends with World War II."

CHRONOLOGY
Brcko, Bosnia, in War and Peace

1992 -- Brcko, river port on the Croatian border with 54 percent Muslim population, comes under attack from Bosnian Serbs. Serbs establish camp where thousands of non-Serbs are killed.

1995 -- Dayton peace agreement divides Bosnia, but Brcko is exempted. City straddles a narrow corridor separating two heavily Serbian areas, and Serbs, Muslims and Croats are unable to agree on its fate.

1999 -- International arbitration creates special Brcko district, split between Bosnian Serb Republic and Muslim-Croat Federation, with American supervisor.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Surge as New York Factory Report Fuels Optimism

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday after a report on manufacturing in New York bolstered expectations of a resurgent economy. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 201 points in its strongest performance in more than two months, reaching its highest close in nearly a year.
 The three main gauges posted highs for 2003, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed above the 1,000 mark for the first time since June 20, 2002. 
 Analysts said that after a moderate decline on Friday, many investors were opting to jump in as they anticipated stronger profit growth. Mutual fund managers, in particular, don't want to miss the next big rally. 
"The people have been buying the dips," said Russ Koesterich, United States equity strategist at State Street in Boston. "The New York index came in above expectations, and there was an upgrade of Yahoo that's encouraging people."
The Dow closed up 201.84 points, or 2.2 percent, at 9,318.96, after a weekly advance of 0.6 percent. It was the Dow's largest one-day gain since April 2, when the blue chips closed 215.20 points higher. On Friday, it lost 79 points.
The Dow now stands at its highest close since it reached 9,379.50 on July 5, 2002.
The broader market also finished sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 40.09 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,666.58, after slipping 0.1 percent last week.
The Nasdaq is at its highest close since May 23, 2002, when it reached 1,697.63.
The S.& P. rose 22.13 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,010.74, after rising 0.1 percent last week. It was also the index's strongest advance since April 2, when the S.& P. closed 22.42 points higher. The index is now at its highest close since June 19, 2002, when it stood at 1,019.99.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its factory index for June rose to 26.80, the highest level on record, from 10.60 in May. It provided hope of a strong reading for the Philadelphia regional index, scheduled for Thursday. That index is seen as an indicator of national manufacturing activity.
All 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones industrials advanced, including Boeing, which increased $1.07, to $36.41, after it said it expected a $5.2 trillion market for new aviation services over the next 20 years.
General Electric, another Dow component, rose 69 cents, to $31.34, after it reached a tentative four-year agreement with two of its largest labor unions regarding wages, pensions and benefits.
Yahoo gained $1.94, to $30.66, after Soundview Technology raised the company's stock rating to outperform from neutral, citing good growth prospects.
Cell Therapeutics increased $1.73, or 13.3 percent, to $14.75, after it said it would get a faster review of its lung cancer drug Xyotax from regulators.
Decliners included ChevronTexaco, which slipped 11 cents, to $74.94, after Deutsche Securities lowered the company's stock rating.

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Reuters) -- Treasuries slid yesterday as a soaring stock market prompted traders to sell bonds after a voracious buying binge that had pummeled yields to historic lows.
But far from reflecting a broader shift in sentiment among bond investors, dealers said the drop was simply a mild correction after a spectacular climb in prices over the last month.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32, to 103 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.18 percent from 3.11 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond lost 15/32, to 118 17/32. Its yield rose to 4.24 percent from 4.17 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: At the Air Show, the U.S.-France Rift Shows 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 16 

 BODY:
Who would have thought that grounding fighter jets and pouring fine wine down the drain would amount to the same thing?
 But just as the latter became a symbol of American hostility toward the French during the Iraq war, the former is being seen by many at this year's Paris Air Show as America's latest contribution to trans-Atlantic tension. 
 The show, which opened Saturday and runs through this Sunday, was intended to celebrate a century of cooperation between the countries in the field of aviation. Instead, the United States is delivering several slaps to the Gallic face.
Not only will there be a notable absence of American fighter jet demonstrations, but the Defense Department has cut by half the number of its planes here, from the dozen it had in 2001. No officer above the rank of colonel is present. American military contractors and aerospace companies have scaled back their presence, with some saying that the Pentagon's cutbacks influenced their decisions. 
As a consequence, there is bound to be less business done between American and foreign companies, some industry analysts and executives said.
"This is one of those little telltale signs of a much broader drift in trans-Atlantic relationships that reveal the gradual breakup of the Western alliance," said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va. 
American officials, the show's organizers and some executives insist that the reduced American presence is because of the economic slump rather than the political rift that occurred when France became the most vocal critic of the United States-led invasion of Iraq. 
But the European news media and many executives on this side of the Atlantic are not persuaded. Liberation, a left-leaning French newspaper, wrote on Sunday that the economic explanation "doesn't convince anyone."
Over dinner, the chief executive of a European military contractor impatiently dismissed what he considers American posturing. "Some people have to make a political gesture, so they should make it, then move on," he said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
At the height of political sniping over the Iraq war, "we felt there was great risk, and we still feel there is some risk" to business interests, he added. "Someone needs to open up this dialogue again."
This event, held every two years along the runways of Le Bourget, where Charles Lindbergh landed after his trans-Atlantic crossing in 1927, is an air show only in the most nominal sense. Fighter jets thunder across the sky, but more omnipresent than pilots are executives from the world's major military contractors and aerospace companies. 
The exhibition halls are essentially souks for the global military-industrial complex: surface-to-air missiles and laser guidance systems sit in booths near commercial plane engines; Brazilian jet makers brush shoulders with Russian arms traders.
The show, now in its 45th year, gained prominence during the cold war, when significant deals often were struck on the premises. These days, it serves largely as a marathon networking opportunity for executives and military officials, punctuated by announcements of commercial jet orders for Boeing or Airbus that have long been in the works.
Nevertheless, the show, with its 1,700 exhibitors, can still make a difference for some companies, said Yves Bonnet, its director.
"Little companies have the ability to develop their business," he said after watching eight French fighter jets loop through the air. "It is an opportunity for them to meet everybody and begin the discussion."
If so, American industry could be losing out. American companies renting exhibition space number 280, down from 350 in 2001. Virtually all of those missing are small and medium-size companies. A few larger ones, like Gulfstream and Cessna, are also absent, said Fabrice Galzin, the show's marketing director.
The most prominent American contractors are here, but they have scaled back. Philip M. Condit, the chief executive of the Boeing Company, is not attending. Lockheed Martin has sent 125 people, half as many as at the last show and down from 450 in 1997, said Tom Jurkowsky, a company spokesman. Like Mr. Condit, Vance D. Coffman, Lockheed's chief executive, decided not to come.
Mr. Jurkowsky said the cutbacks were made to save money and not because of political pressure. But he added that "we certainly look to the customer, and if the customer sets a tone, we're going to fall in line with that tone." The customer, in this case, is the Defense Department, Lockheed's biggest buyer.
At a dinner at the Ritz in Paris on Sunday night, Robert H. Trice, Lockheed's senior vice president for corporate business development, said the company recognized "that the strains the alliance is experiencing are real and that they are serious." But he added that Lockheed saw virtues in a "single, integrated marketplace" for the military industry.
Jeffrey Bialos, deputy under secretary of defense for industrial affairs during the last two years of the Clinton administration, said that senior leaders in the Pentagon had "real questions about the future" of French-American relations.
"Plainly, the attitudes at the top trickle down in that world and create an environment that will not be particularly open" for executives in military contracting, he added.
Master Sgt. John Tomassi, a spokesman for the European command of the Defense Department, said that the absence of Pentagon brass from Le Bourget this year was a matter of tact. "To have generals wined and dined here at the show doesn't send the right message," he said, when "we have thousands and thousands of troops who are out in the field."
There have been several instances lately when companies claimed that nationalism colored a major military contract award. Last month, Pratt & Whitney Canada bristled when Airbus chose a European consortium, Europrop, to make the engines for its first military plane, the A400M transport jet. Pratt & Whitney executives said politics swayed the decision, though an Airbus spokesman said "the engine selection was purely commercial."
Dassault Aviation, the French aircraft maker, said that North American companies buying its Falcon business jet asked a lot of questions about its military contracting business during the Iraq war, though no customers canceled orders.
"Some customers were troubled because of the political atmosphere between France and the U.S.," said Vadim Feldzer, a company spokesman.
At a news conference Saturday, Charles Edelstenne, chief executive of Dassault, said that the renewed determination by the United States to assert its power "may change the hand dealt in certain markets which are more sensitive to politics than civil markets," according to Aviation Week. Mr. Feldzer said that Mr. Edelstenne was referring to military sales and that Dassault did not expect its civilian division to feel any serious impact from political tensions.
The trans-Atlantic rift could permanently change the nature of the Paris Air Show. Several members of Congress have been lobbying to start a rival event in the United States, possibly in Dayton, Ohio. Representative John L. Mica, a Republican from Florida and chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, recently added language to a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that would require studying the idea.
Asked about this, Mr. Bonnet, the air show's director, swept a hand across the air and said, "Good luck for them, if they succeed."
A few hundred yards away, a throng of aviation fanatics from Paris and other places were milling around a wooden replica of the plane that the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C. Crowds also swarmed the gleaming B-17 Flying Fortress farther up the tarmac, along with a Concorde, its tail fin painted in the colors of the French flag.
All are symbols of highflying cooperation between the United States and France, and all have been grounded.

HEADLINE: City to Miss State Deadline On Teachers 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
After three years of striving to meet a state mandate that all public-school teachers be certified by this September, New York City has concluded that it cannot meet the deadline and is seeking a two-year extension. 
 In a June 9 letter to Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, Chancellor Joel I. Klein said he expected to be short about 3,000 certified teachers for the 2003-04 school year, despite aggressive recruiting efforts. 
 Those efforts -- including hiring teachers from Europe and the Caribbean and creating a fast-track certification program for people with no teaching background -- have helped increase the city's percentage of certified teachers to 88 percent this year, up from as low as 60 percent in the recent past.
But even with creative recruitment, a steep raise for city teachers last year and a faltering economy that has made the profession more appealing, the school system has struggled to attract and especially to keep new recruits. Though Mr. Mills had been adamant about the deadline, several members of the State Board of Regents said yesterday that they expected to grant the extension as early as today. One said that Mr. Klein had worked with Mr. Mills to draft a plan for meeting the mandate by 2005, to ensure the commissioner's approval. 
"Obviously we would have all preferred if they didn't need to ask for this," said Merryl H. Tisch, a regent from New York City. "But as long as everyone is proceeding in a thoughtful, careful manner and it's not an open-ended extension, I think we are going to be O.K."
She added: "If anyone says we are backing down, that is an absolute misstatement. This is just a little adjustment."
Negotiations over the certification deadline were not always so friendly. In 2000, Mr. Mills and the Regents sued the previous chancellor, Harold O. Levy, to stop him from placing uncertified new recruits in the city's 100 lowest-performing schools. Under court order, Mr. Levy ended up assigning several hundred "teaching fellows" from the fast-track certification program in those schools. 
The teaching fellows program has helped increase the number of certified teachers more than any other effort: more than 3,000 recruits have come through the program over three years, and yesterday, 2,700 more reported for summer training.
But the program is a huge financial drain; the school system pays about $12,000 for each fellow to get a master's degree in education during the first two years of teaching. And critics point out that the program provides a watered-down version of certification, since the fellows do not spend nearly as much time preparing for the job as traditional recruits.
For traditional certification, teachers must take many courses in educational methods, complete student teaching and pass several certification exams. Many major in education as undergraduates.
None of the state's other school districts have requested a deadline extension, Robert Bennett, chancellor of the Regents, said yesterday.
Although the Education Department trumpeted in September that it had offered jobs to 8,300 certified teachers, the number of certified employees newly hired turned out to be closer to 6,000, a department official said yesterday. 
Mr. Klein expects to need an additional 10,000 to 11,000 new teachers this fall, partly because he anticipates an unusually large number of retirements. Two of his school improvement plans -- hiring math and literacy coaches for all 1,200 schools and reducing middle school class size -- will also increase the need, he said in his letter to Mr. Mills.
"Even if we have a 3,000-person shortfall" in certified teachers, he wrote to Mr. Mills, "that would mean that 96 percent or more of our 78,000 teachers would be certified."
Mr. Klein said that if he were granted the extension, he would hire uncertified teachers mostly in specific areas where there are shortages: math, science, special education and bilingual education. He proposed that Mr. Mills grant up to 3,500 temporary licenses in 2003-04 and 2,000 in 2004-05. 
In a memo to the Regents, however, Mr. Mills recommended limiting the number of temporary licenses to 3,000 in 2003-04 and 1,500 in 2004-05. He also recommended that uncertified teachers be prohibited from working in several hundred city schools that have been labeled "failing" or "in need of improvement" by the state and federal governments.
Significantly, Mr. Klein proposed that uncertified teachers must have passed the main state certification exam to get a temporary license. In the past, thousands of uncertified teachers have remained in the system for years despite having failed the exam many times. 
"This will not be a return to the 'any old warm body will do' method of staffing," he wrote.
Mr. Klein has hinted he will push for extra pay for teachers who specialize in shortage areas in the next contract, an idea the teachers union has long fought but that education experts say would help immensely. Asked about the idea yesterday, Randi Weingarten, the union president, said, "We are not opposed, but there are right ways of doing it and wrong ways of doing it."

HEADLINE: Short Supply of Natural Gas Is Raising Economic Worries 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 16 

 BODY:
The economy has been cool, and so has the spring in much of the country. Nonetheless, the United States is facing its most severe shortage of natural gas in a quarter-century. 
 Industries like fertilizer and ammonia makers, which use gas to produce their goods, are already laying off workers. And experts warn that a warming trend, in the economy or the weather, could send prices spiking for the electricity that cools homes and runs every sort of business. 
 "You would have thought that the last big upsurge in prices a couple of years ago was a tremendous wake-up call," said Gwyn Morgan, chief executive of EnCana, a Canadian company that is the largest independent natural gas producer and storage operator in North America. "But for most people it was not." 
The market manipulation by companies like Enron has been blamed for much of the price surge of 2000 and 2001, which led to brownouts in parts of California and price spikes for electricity in much of the West and some of the Northeast. But now, like then, most analysts agree, the basic law of supply and demand is at work.
With natural gas promoted as a cleaner-burning fuel than oil or coal, nearly all the electric plants built since 1998 are designed to be fired mainly by gas. So demand is up. And while drilling has increasedabout 25 percent in the last year, much of it has been confined to old, overworked basins that are not as productive as they once were. Supplies, therefore, have not kept up. 
In addition, analysts say that a failure to gauge supply needs and weather patterns accurately in an up-and-down economy has added to the squeeze on supplies.
Prices for natural gas have risen sharply in the last year, reaching a peak at more than $6 per million British thermal units, compared with about $3.65 a year earlier. Stored supplies of natural gas have fallen to the lowest level since the federal government began keeping records in 1976, with levels about 30 percent below the average for the last five years.
The effects of this latest surge in prices have led to renewed calls from the gas industry for the loosening of environmental restrictions on drilling and pipeline construction in the United States. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and the National Petroleum Council are convening a top-level meeting later this month to discuss the shortage and propose solutions.
Last week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee that short supplies of natural gas could contribute to erosion in the economy. Mr. Greenspan emphasized the potentially important role that liquefied natural gas, in particular, could play in American energy imports.
Yet with the richest overseas stores of gas in distant regions like West Africa and Southeast Asia and the energy industry under technical and financial constraints, the difficulty of increasing imports remains considerable. 
With few immediate answers at hand, industry executives and analysts talk of elevated natural gas prices for years to come.
"We're already facing the prospect of higher utility bills for consumers and higher energy costs for many businesses," Robert Allison, chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum, said in an interview. "The shortage is going to become a matter of exporting jobs to countries with cheaper natural gas."
The fertilizer industry has been particularly hard hit, since natural gas accounts for 90 percent of the cost of ammonia, the building block for nitrogen fertilizers. Robert C. Liuzzi, chief executive of CF Industries, a farm-supply cooperative based in Long Grove, Ill., said high natural gas prices were the most serious threat to the industry since the energy shocks of the 1970's. 
Ammonia manufacturers are not faring any better, with factory closings becoming common. Mississippi Chemical, an ammonia company based in Yazoo City, Miss., filed for bankruptcy protection last month. The company idled a plant in Ohio, cut production at another in Tennessee and shut down a factory in Donaldsville, La., resulting in the loss of 24 jobs.
Charles O. Dunn, the chief executive, cited the "extreme increase and volatility in the price of domestic natural gas" as contributing to Mississippi Chemical's mounting financial losses.
Power generators that are capable of switching their plants to fuels like oil or coal are doing so to mitigate their dependence on gas. But analysts say that this, in turn, is contributing to higher prices for those fuels. 
Over all, about 23 percent of the nation's energy needs are met by natural gas. The United States is a large producer of natural gas, second to Russia, and 85 percent of the gas used here comes from domestic wells. But many parts of the country remain off-limits for drilling for environmental reasons.
Gaining access to these areas is a top priority of the energy industry, foreshadowing a more intense struggle between conservationists and natural gas companies. "The sorry thing is that there is gas to be found in this country but we can't get to it," said Mr. Allison of Anadarko, the nation's most active natural gas driller.
Canada, with large reserves and geographic proximity, provides more than 90 percent of the natural gas exported to the United States. But Canadian imports are slowing, too, with some analysts expecting them to decline steadily in the next decade as demand grows at home.
That leaves the United States with the alternative of importing liquefied natural gas from other countries. Such gas, condensed into a liquid by chilling it, is transported by ship, and currently accounts for only 1 percent of the nation's gas imports. 
Yet even raising today's imports to 3 percent of the total is not expected to happen anytime soon, because only a handful of terminals in the United States are capable of processing liquefied natural gas. The largest are in Everett, Mass., near Boston, and Lake Charles, La.
The costs involved in building the terminals, and the reluctance in many coastal areas to have large gasification installations in their vicinity, have kept many such projects from getting off the ground. So have fears that terminals could become targets of terrorism and financial concerns about the health and transparency of energy companies in the business world after Enron's collapse.
For instance, the El Paso Corporation, an energy trader based here, has had to abandon an ambitious project to use buoys and shipboard gasification technology to receive liquefied natural gas at offshore locations.
Yet numerous projects for liquefied natural gas terminals are under consideration, ranging from plans to reopen mothballed terminals built in response to the energy crises of the 1970's to more fanciful ideas. One Houston company, Crystal Energy, wants to use existing offshore facilities to build a receiving installation on the Southern California coast.
Several other terminals could be built and functioning within the next three to five years. Then, the United States may face the prospect of increased dependence on large, but sometimes politically problematic exporters like Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Qatar, Venezuela and Indonesia.
"We're on the verge of discovering that natural gas is almost as important as oil for our energy supplies," said Amy M. Jaffe, associate director of Rice University's energy program. "Once we wake up to this, we'll have to deal with the geopolitical implications of importing natural gas from some of the more unsavory parts of the world."
In the meantime, about the only beneficiaries of the natural gas shortage are companies that can profit from the high prices for the fuel by producing or transporting it in North America. These include huge energy companies like BP, which are considerable gas producers, and a coterie of smaller companies that made a prescient bet on strong demand for natural gas. 
Every 10-cent shift upward in gas prices, for instance, translates into a 4 percent gain in cash flow next year for Burlington Resources, which is based here. For EnCana, based in Calgary, Alberta, the same increase results in a 2.5 percent rise in cash flow, according to a study by Deutsche Bank.
"This is the strategy payoff we have been anticipating for many years," Mr. Morgan, EnCana's chief executive, said.

HEADLINE: A Strong Yen Helps Tokyo Retain Status as Most Costly 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 16 

 BODY:
Defying notions about Japanese deflation, Tokyo is again the most expensive city in the world.
 A 4 percent drop in the exchange value of the dollar against the Japanese yen helped keep Tokyo in first place and place Osaka third in an annual cost-of-living survey of 144 major world cities conducted in March by Mercer Human Resources Consulting of Geneva, a Marsh & McLennan company. 
 With cab fares starting at $5, $10,000-a-month rents for apartments not uncommon and intercity rail travel expensive, Tokyo residents notice the 1 percent annual deflation rate of prices in yen. 
"Even though Japan is facing a deflationary situation, the yen appreciated against the dollar, which made the cost of living go up," Yvonne Traber, director of the survey, said from Geneva, which jumped to 6th place this year from 28th in 2002.
Last year, no European city was more costly than New York, which ranked in seventh place. But this year, with New York 10th, four European cities were more expensive -- London, Zurich, Geneva and Moscow.
For Americans planning to travel abroad this summer, a drop in the dollar against the euro of around 20 percent has made European destinations significantly more expensive.
Oslo rose to 13th place from 40th last year; Copenhagen to 15th from 62nd; Milan to 17th place from 63rd; and Paris to 23rd from 74th.
"Italy went up drastically, and that really reflects the euro," Ms. Traber said. For the same reason, she noted, Dublin jumped to 21st place, from 73rd.
Of the nine cities more expensive than New York in the new rankings, five were Asian: besides Tokyo and Osaka, they were Hong Kong (4), Beijing (5) and Seoul (8). 
Moscow, which has an extremely expensive housing market for foreigners, was the world's second most expensive city, unchanged from last year.
Hundreds of Americans, largely infinance and banking, are returning to the United States from Tokyo this summer, many of them ordered home by stateside executives who do not think that Japan's stagnant business climate is worth the high cost of maintaining employees there.
For those still in Tokyo, neither deflation nor a prospective softening in the housing market has helped much so far. Prices there were 26 percent higher than New York's.
Cities in Canada and South America ranked among the world's least expensive. Toronto, in 104th place, was 65 percent of New York's expense level, and Ottawa (127), 57 percent. Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal were in between.
Between Caracas, Venezuela (128), and Asuncion, Paraguay (144), were Quito, Ecuador; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro; Montevideo, Uruguay; Buenos Aires; and Bogota, Colombia.
Prices in the Brazilian cities were half those in New York. Asuncion, a place with an air of a provincial capital, was the cheapest major city in the world, with prices only 36 percent of New York's.
In the South Pacific region, Sydney, Australia, was 67th, up from 39th in 2002, and Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand, rose to 115th and 117th, respectively.
The survey, conducted during the first 10 days of March, is based on the cost of more than 200 items, including housing, food, transportation and entertainment. Many big companies use the figures to adjust pay for their employees sent overseas.
Any costs of private schooling are not included.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Tuesday about an annual survey showing cities with the highest costs of living referred incorrectly to a comparison with New York in last year's rankings. New York, which was seventh, was not more costly than all European cities; Moscow was second.

HEADLINE: Parents Divided Over Jamaica Disciplinary Academy 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: ST. ELIZABETH, Jamaica 

 BODY:
Tranquility Bay is a troubled paradise.
 A tightly guarded compound in a lovely Caribbean hamlet, it is the oldest foreign outpost in a booming network of behavior-modification programs for American teenagers. Tranquility Bay has a reputation as the harshest of them all. 
 Many who have been there describe a life of pain and fear. They say they spent 13 hours a day, for weeks or months on end, lying on their stomachs in an isolation room, their arms repeatedly twisted to the breaking point. Others say the program took them off a road to hell and saved their lives. 
Tranquility Bay's methods have spawned fierce supporters and critics, none more passionate than the children who have been through the program and the parents who sent them there.
The children say their parents have no idea what goes on behind the walls. The parents say program directors tell them to ignore all accusations of abuse.
"They tell your parents, 'Your son may say he's been beaten, but he's lying,' and that, to me, is the greatest manipulation they pull," said Andrew Emmett, 16, of Washington, Pa.
Enrollment at Tranquility Bay, founded in 1996, has grown in the past two years from 140 to 300 youths, most of them 12 to 19 years old. It is becoming a battleground for the warring camps of parents and children, a growing number of whom oppose the program.
That fight may shape the future of Tranquility Bay's parent organization, the Utah-based World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools, known as Wwasps, one of the biggest and most lucrative businesses of its kind.
In a statement sent to parents last month, Ken Kay, Wwasps' president, wrote: "The accusations are from students. The parents may believe them, but the parents weren't there." He continued: "The teens making the allegations generally have a long history of lying, exaggerating and dishonesty."
By telephone, he said that he did not welcome new requests for comment, as Wwasps had signed a television contract to tell its story in its own words.
Mr. Kay's son, Jay Kay, director of Tranquility Bay, said in an e-mail message declining a face-to-face interview that criticisms come from "one-tenth of one percent" of past clients -- a few people with "axes to grind."
There is little question that Wwasps programs -- including two in Mexico and at least eight in the United States, with a total of roughly 2,300 children -- fill a crying need for parents unable to cope with their children.
Many parents who strongly support Tranquility Bay, which costs more than $33,000 a year, see it as a near-miraculous crucible for changing defiant and delinquent teenagers. But others who sent their children say the program damaged their sons and daughters. A striking number of youths say that, while the program's goals may be noble, its methods are not.
In all, 32 children and parents spoke by telephone for this article, 23 others communicated by e-mail, and five face-to-face interviews took place in Jamaica.
"I got some good out of it," said Colin Johnstone, 15, of Louisville, Ky., who came to Tranquility Bay at 13. "But it is kind of like torture. It did me more damage than good."
He was not drinking or taking drugs, said his mother, Lisa Todd. He was "just immature." She said Colin had two teeth knocked loose by a staff member's fist and spent at least eight months in the isolation room. "They are very physically severe in Jamaica," she said. "For sure, they did things they couldn't do in America." But, she added, "I do think the program helps a lot of families that are desperate and don't know where to turn." 
Oliver Bucolo, 18, of St. Petersburg, Fla., spent more than two years at TranquilityBay. "You can't go there and not be changed," he said. "The program's intentions are good. They do help some people."
But, he added: "The staff has no training. They know how to restrain kids." 
Restraint, as practiced at Tranquility Bay, can be punishing. Many children, mostly boys, say staff members twist their arms behind their backs until their hands touch their heads, inflicting intense pain without bruises.
"You could hear kids screaming when they were getting restrained," Mr. Bucolo said. "It was horrible. They would do it behind closed doors. And say the kids were lying if they complained."
Jill Himmelfarb, 18, of Coral Springs, Fla., spent two years at Tranquility Bay. At Christmas, she graduated, as have one in every five enrollees. She grew to love the program. "The place saved my life," she said. But soon after leaving, she said, she was taking heroin and trying to kill herself with pills.
Deborah Stilwell, 49, of Lake Forest Park, Wash., one of the parents who supports the program, said it was "nothing short of miraculous."
"It was the best thing we've ever done," said Mrs. Stilwell, whose 16-year-old daughter is at Tranquility Bay, on Prozac, but off drink and other drugs. "Tranquility Bay is not cushy," she said. "It's harsh. But it saved her life."
Kristin Smith, 46, of Bradenton, Fla., said her son Zack, 18, had benefited greatly from Tranquility Bay. She said the program was not suitable for children with emotional or psychological problems -- although many youths with such problems are there -- but for those who had abused drugs and alcohol, like her son did.
"It was the hardest thing we ever did," she said. "It's tough. It's hard. And that's what he needed -- absolute strict rules."
Other parents call Tranquility Bay a Caribbean gulag. "It's like a communist regime," said Julie Wilkinson, 47, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., whose son, Winston, just returned home from Tranquility Bay. "The tragedy is that there is such a desperate outcry for help for kids, from parents who are at their wits' end and will do anything."
Christine Smith, 42, of Flemington, N.J., said she sold her home to pay tuition for her son, Thomas Owens, 16. "I was doing research on the Internet, and World Wide popped up everywhere. It looked good, it really did."
She said program officials led her to believe that her son would receive counseling and therapy, but instead, she said, he spent two-thirds of his time at Tranquility Bay in isolation. "They hurt my son," she said. "Dramatically."
"They say the kids manipulate, they lie, they embellish," she said. But so do the program's officials, she said.
"You're paying Harvard prices, and that's O.K. if it helps the child," she said. "But to beat the child, just beat them into submission? If you did this to your child, you would be arrested for child abuse."
Wwasps has sued some of its critics and threatened others. But it is braced for new suits from parents and children alike. One basis for those challenges was expressed by Alex Wolland, 18, of Miami, who spent a year at Tranquility Bay, "The parents have absolutely no clue what is going on."
In his statement to parents last month, Ken Kay, the Wwasps' president, wrote, "We run a tight ship and a tough program where inappropriate attitudes and choices are confronted and redirected and the living conditions are not as nice as the homes the parents had so kindly provided the teen before the teen sabotaged it.
"If these are the accusations, then we have no problem with the accusations. If the accusations are more than that, then there is nobasis for the accusations."
In a 1999 interview with The Rocky Mountain News, however, Mr. Kay, who at that time had left the Wwasps organization, criticized its programs and staff.
The staff was "a bunch of untrained people," he said, according to the newspaper. "They don't have credentials of any kind."
"We could be leading these kids to long-term problems that we don't have a clue about because we're not going about it in the proper way," he said. "How in the hell can you call yourself a behavior-modification program -- and that's one of the ways it's marketed -- when nobody has the experience to determine: Is this good, is this bad?"
That question remains unanswered. No long-term studies of the 1,500 youths who have been to Tranquility Bay, or the 300 who have graduated, have been done. Outside experts say the test will come after Tranquility Bay's youths become adults.
Patrick Quinn, 18, now a student at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, said: "There were kids there who needed psychiatric help. Professional help. And there are no professionals there."
Instead, he said, the staff inflicted pain on the children, mostly on the boys. Among those youths, he said, was Colin Johnstone. "Every night you heard him there, screaming at the top of his lungs," Mr. Quinn said. "There are a lot of kids there who will never be the same."
Some of the youths at Tranquility Bay have histories of drug and alcohol abuse; 15 percent to 20 percent have had a brush with the law, according to program officials.
Many others have never had encounters with the police, or with drugs. They are there, in large part, because of family crises, including the divorce or the death of a parent.
One such child was Tyler Marshall of Tazewell, Va. "Tyler was 12 when he went to Tranquility Bay," said his cousin, Gini Farmer Remines, "and he had never been in trouble with the law. Basically, he did not get along with the woman his dad was going to marry."
Ms. Remines won custody of her cousin and obtained a judge's order releasing Tyler from Tranquility Bay last year.
Tranquility Bay is the oldest of Wwasps' surviving overseas operations. Wwasps affiliates in Mexico and the Czech Republic have shut down under government pressure; its Costa Rica program closed after a revolt by students last month. In the United States, the organization has affiliated programs, some of which are brand-new, in Utah, Montana, New York, California, Iowa and South Carolina, according to public records.
With a payroll estimated at $1 million a year, and gross annual revenues approaching $10 million, Tranquility Bay is by far the leading economic power in St. Elizabeth, a poor parish on Jamaica's southern shore, where farms are failing and the sea is fished out.
It employs more than 150 Jamaicans, some of whom wear crisp white shirts emblazoned with a patch reading, "Tranquility Bay -- Working for the Future of the World." Several have been dismissed recently after being accused of assault or selling drugs, according to two parents and one government official.
Throughout the Wwasps network in the United States and Mexico, many youths say, Tranquility Bay is held out as a warning.
"They threaten you with Tranquility Bay," said Andrew Emmett, who said he was briefly transferred here after attending Carolina Springs Academy, a Wwasps program in South Carolina. "They tell you they can twist up and grind your body and never leave a mark."

HEADLINE: New York State Manufacturing Is UnusuallyBrisk 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manufacturing in New York State expanded more than expected this month as orders and sales increased the most since January, a Federal Reserve bank branch reported yesterday.
 A factory index compiled by the Buffalo branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rose to 26.8 in June, the highest since the gauge went into use nearly two years ago; the May figure was 10.6. Readings above zero mean a majority of manufacturers reported an improvement in business. 
 Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust in New York, said, "We are seeing the start of that pickup that many expected, now that the war with Iraq is out of the way." 
Economists had expected a New York survey reading of 10.1. Nationwide, manufacturing accounts for one-seventh of the economy and employs some 15 million people.
"Anything that's going to give us a positive outlook for industrial production and capital expenditures" will lift stocks, said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer of Boston Advisers, because that leads to higher profits. "There's no question," he said, "that there is additional strength above and beyond where we were three months ago."
A separate report showed that optimism among home builders rose for a second month in June as mortgage rates fell to another record. The National Association of Homebuilders' housing market index increased to 62 from 57 in May. A gauge of optimism for the next six months edged higher, to 70 from 69.
Manufacturers in New York State are the most optimistic they have been in a year. A measure of expected business conditions in the next six months rose to 58.4 in June, the highest since June 2002, from 55.6.
The New York Fed polls about 150 factories each month and typically gets 100 responses. The survey includes manufacturers in a range of industries with an emphasis on producers of durable goods.
It is not clear if the data from New York signaled improvement elsewhere. Some economists raised their forecasts for a manufacturing report scheduled on Thursday from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Privileged Life in Peril For 2 Mortgage Giants 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
Until last week, most Americans familiar with Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae probably had a vague image of benevolent government agencies helping young couples get their first mortgages. But after Freddie Mac replaced its top management, it became clear from the severance pay that this was no ordinary government work. Bureaucrats do not receive $24 million golden parachutes.
 Freddie Mac and its big sister, Fannie Mae, are government-sponsored enterprises in Washington that have become two of the largest and most profitable companies on Wall Street. They say that their special privileges promote the American dream and that their profits reflect sound management. Their critics say the companies promote what is more like the Washington dream: private benefits for the well connected, and potentially enormous public costs for taxpayers if either company makes the wrong bets when buying and selling mortgages. 
 Now critics -- from Alan Greenspan to Ralph Nader -- see an opportunity to challenge two institutions that have long been virtually untouchable. After the shake-up at Freddie Mac, which came during an internal inquiry of its accounting practices, outside investigations were announced by federal prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers. 
The Freddie Mac board fired David W. Glenn, the president, and forced Leland C. Brendsel, chairman and chief executive, and Vaughn A. Clarke, chief financial officer, to resign. Freddie Mac said today that it was preventing Mr. Brendsel and Mr. Glenn from selling restricted stock or exercising stock options until its regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, reviews their compensation packages. It is also preventing their unvested options, restricted stock and restricted stock units from vesting.
The power of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on Capitol Hill has stemmed partly from their importance to homeowners and the housing industry. Because they own or guarantee more than a third of the home mortgages in America, any threat to their operations could raise the cost of mortgages and hurt well-organized constituencies in every Congressional district.
Their power also stems from their political operations. The profits from Wall Street are used to recruit politicians from both parties as executives and to hire lobbyists -- 19 lobbying firms last year for Freddie Mac; 23 for Fannie Mae, according to PolitcalMoneyLine. Freddie Mac's chief internal lobbyist, Mitchell Delk, is known for having fund-raisers for members of Congress, though those are "personal activities" separate from the company, said Douglas Robinson, spokesman for Freddie Mac.
"The lobbying ability of Fannie and Freddie is second to none in Washington," said Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the companies. "They have not only unlimited financial resources but good personnel who maintain good relations with many members of Congress. When their interests are threatened, the response is almost armylike. They're tactical, and they're everywhere."
Besides helping the young couples in their advertisements pay for homes, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also helped pay for the purchase, renovation and upkeep of the headquarters for the Democratic and Republican Parties in Washington. Since 1999, PoliticalMoneyLine says, Fannie Mae has contributed over $2.5 million to house the parties' national and campaign committees, while Freddie Mac has contributed more than $6 million.
Fannie Mae has a tradition of recruiting government veterans with nongovernment salaries. Its chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, who interrupted his career there to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton, received more than $11 million in compensation last year, according to the company. The vice chairman of Fannie Mae's board, Jamie S. Gorelick, who was deputy attorney general until 1997, received more than $4 million last year.
Officials at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been frank about the need to manage what they call "politicial risk" just as much as they manage the financial risks of their portfolios. Chuck Greener, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee who is a senior vice president at Fannie Mae, said: "We're passionate about our mission and the public role it fulfills. Consequently, we feel it's important to communicate with Congress and policy makers."
The public mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to promote homeownership, especially among lower-income Americans. Although they do not directly write mortgages, they buy them from the primary lenders, sell them to other investors and guarantee them against default. 
Supporting that mission poses no direct strain on the federal budget, another reason the companies are so popular on Capitol Hill. The support takes the form of indirect subsidies worth more than $10 billion a year, according to a 2001 study by the Congressional Budget Office. Besides exemptions of $1 billion worth of local taxes and securities fees, the budget office found, the companies save more than $9 billion a year thanks to an "implicit subsidy": the ability to borrow money cheaply because of the widespread assumption that the federal government would cover any losses, even though it is not legally obligated to do so.
The budget office estimated that close to two-thirds of these annual subsidies were passed along to homeowners in the form of lower interest rates, but that still left nearly $4 billion in federal largess to be divided among the shareholders and employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Critics on both the right and left have called it corporate welfare.
"These are the most successful corporate hermaphrodites in world history," said Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate and former presidential candidate. "While there is a widespread need for affordable housing in America, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae report massive profits, provide their top executives with huge compensation packages and laugh all the way to the bank with government guarantees. It's a paradigm of how to influence Washington."
The companies dispute the estimates of their subsidies and say that their advantages over rivals stem chiefly from better management. Freddie Mac cites a study it commissioned from James E. Pearce, a former Federal Reserve Bank economist, and James C. Miller III, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, which concludes that any subsidies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are greatly exceeded by the benefits that consumers receive in the form of lower interest rates on mortgages.
The companies have many defenders. "America has the world's highest rate of homeownership because we're the only country that has a Fannie or Freddie," said Angelo R. Mozilo, the chairman of Countrywide Financial, a large mortgage lender. "Nobody wins if they're damaged or impeded. Housing is the only thing driving the economy right now."
But there are also many critics, especially among their rivals. "Fannie and Freddie always say not to do anything to them because you'll upset the housing market and the economy," said Mike House, the executive director of FM Policy Focus, a coalition of companies in the mortgage and housing industries. "But the events of the past week show that not properly regulating them can cause more problems. Nobody knows the long-term implications of this."
Last week's shake-up at Freddie Mac came as its auditors were studying whether it had properly accounted for its portfolio of derivatives. The accounting questions could well turn out to be a short-lived problem, but critics fear the possibility that Freddie Mac is hiding some long-term weakness in its portfolio. Because the two companies have grown so huge, a failure by either could be cataclysmic for the economy and leave the federal government with the prospect of a bailout. 
"We need to get a much stronger regulatory structure over Fannie and Freddie, and the reform efforts seem more likely than ever to succeed now," said Mr. Baker, who will hold House hearings into the companies. He said that Congress might create a new federal regulator to oversee the companies and that lawmakers might also start requiring the companies to follow the registration and disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That does not satisfy Peter J. Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute, editor of "Serving Two Masters Yet Out of Control: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac" (AEI Press). "Congress," he said, "should be talking about privatization -- removing their links to the government -- and splitting them up so that the errors of one or more managements will not threaten the country's economic health."
For now, though, the most radical change that appears possible would be stricter oversight. "We've always said we favor a strong and well-funded regulator," said Mr. Greener of Fannie Mae. "But we do not believe Congress will take any action that in any way changes our status or impairs our mission."

HEADLINE: French Verdict Will Resonate Throughout the Continent 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 16 

 BODY:
A French court is expected to hand down a verdict fraught with consequences for Europe's economies on Wednesday when it decides, in effect, whether the president of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet, still has a chance of becoming the next president of the European Central Bank. 
 A three-judge panel in Paris is hearing a criminal case against Mr. Trichet and eight other defendants stemming from the time in the early 1990's when Mr. Trichet was the director of the French treasury. They are accused of concealing problems at one of France's biggest banks, Credit Lyonnais, which was owned by the state at that time. 
 French prosecutors have accused Mr. Trichet, 60, of conspiring in a fraudulent concealment of the extent of the bank's losses and the provisions it had to make to cover them. They have asked the court to give him a 10-month suspended sentence. 
The French government has said that it has a gentlemen's agreement with the other 11 nations that use the euro that Mr. Trichet will succeed Wim Duisenberg as president of the European Central Bank. Mr. Duisenberg planned to retire in July, but he has delayed his departure to give Mr. Trichet time to fight the charges and be ready to succeed him. If Mr. Trichet is convicted, his chances of succeeding Mr. Duisenberg would be greatly reduced.
Testifying early in the trial, which began in January, Mr. Trichet said he harbored "no doubts about the sincerity of the accounts nor about the honesty and ethics" of the chairman of Credit Lyonnais at the time in question, Jean-Yves Haberer. Mr. Haberer is also on trial, and prosecutors have asked for an 18-month suspended sentence for him. All nine defendants have denied the charges against them.
Credit Lyonnais was taken over and bailed out by the French state after it collapsed under the burden of billions of dollars of bad financial dealings. It was reprivatized in 1999, and the French state sold the last of its stock in the bank in late 2002; it was acquired last month by Credit Agricole.
Credit Lyonnais also found itself in legal trouble in the United States, where officials in California have filed two civil suits against it related to its acquisition of a bond portfolio from a failed insurer, Executive Life. The Federal Reserve is also investigating whether the bank violated American reporting requirements in the deal. 
Should Mr. Trichet be convicted, even if his lawyers appeal the verdict, he would appear to be out of the running to succeed Mr. Duisenberg. Indeed, French officials have been quietly circulating names of alternative candidates in case that happens.
One name being mentioned is Christian Noyer, a former vice president of the European Central Bank, but his candidacy could be frustrated by a rule barring nominations of former officials of the European Central Bank.
Another name in circulation is Jean Lemierre, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is based in London and refinances projects in the formerly Communist states of Eastern Europe. Michel Pebereau, the chairman of the French bank BNP Paribas, has also been mentioned. 
Charles Wyplosz, a French economist who has written frequently about the central bank, said that if Mr. Trichet is convicted there will be a "struggle over succession, and the French would try to keep the door shut" to anyone but a French candidate. 
"Then," he added, "it would become a big political issue."
Yet even if Mr. Trichet is exonerated, it remains unclear how much his involvement in the criminal proceedings would affect his stewardship of the European Central Bank. The bank's fledgling years under Mr. Duisenberg, who is Dutch, have been viewed largely as a period of setting forth the anti-inflationary gospel of the institution that it was largely modeled on, the Bundesbank. Many experts say that Mr. Trichet, a forceful personality with sharp political skills, would seek to draw the European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt, from under the Bundesbank's shadow in some way.
"I think he is a heavyweight who would not shrink from doing what he thought was necessary," said David Begg, an economist at the University of London. 
Admirers of Mr. Trichet credit him with nudging France from a traditional soft-franc policy, in which the central bank was essentially a long arm of the treasury, to a new policy of low inflation and strong currency that allowed France to enter the monetary union that introduced the euro in January 1999. 
Yet others say that a glance back over Mr. Trichet's long career casts little light on what his future policies might be. Describing Mr. Trichet as "very ambitious and politically astute, though not technically oriented," Professor Wyplosz said it was "hard to guess where he might go." Still, he said, Mr. Trichet would probably be "much more of a chairman than Duisenberg." 
Trained as a mining engineer, Mr. Trichet ran the French treasury from 1987 to 1993 under four finance ministers of differing political persuasions. At the time, the French central bank was not independent, and Mr. Trichet essentially ran it as well as the treasury, Professor Wyplosz said. "He was not for low inflation" in those days, he said of Mr. Trichet. "He wanted easy money from the central bank." 
But with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, which laid the groundwork for the euro, France was compelled to assure the independence of the Bank of France, and in 1993 Mr. Trichet became the bank's president.
At the newly independent bank, Professor Wyplosz said, Mr. Trichet became a proponent of "competitive inflation, which meant less inflation than Germany -- he extolled the credibility of tough central bank policies." 
If Mr. Trichet became the European Central Bank president in Frankfurt, he said, "I assume he will do things differently -- but the past is a poor guide" to what exactly that might mean.

HEADLINE: House Discloses Itself to Be Poorer Sibling of the Senate 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
Compared with the millionaires' club in the Senate, many leaders in the House of Representatives have wealth more in line with that of successful middle managers, according to their financial disclosure forms.
 But the disclosure forms released today, for members of the House and the staff of the White House, also show that the upper echelon of the Bush administration includes several millionaires. 
 One of the newest members of Mr. Bush's team, Stephen Friedman, the chairman of the National Economic Council, reported more than $60 million in assets, most of it in cash and cash equivalents. 
According to the disclosures, other millionaires among Mr. Bush's top advisers include Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff; Joshua Bolten, the deputy chief of staff and nominee to become director of the Office of Management and Budget; and I. Lewis Libby, the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.
The disclosure forms require officials to estimate all of their assets and debts within broad categories, with only a few exceptions, like the officeholder's primary residence and mortgage, and credit-card debt of less than $10,000.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, worked hard at reducing his debts this year, paying off between $165,000 and $400,000 to banks with money apparently raised by selling his stake in an opera house and other properties, according to his financial disclosure form.
Mr. Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach, reported a pension from his days as an Illinois state legislator of $28,397. He listed assets as between $253,000 and $595,000, which includes bank accounts and a Bear Stearns mutual fund, and debts of $100,000 to $250,000.
The House majority leader, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, listed assets of between $66,000 and $166,000, including $50,000 to $100,000 of ExxonMobil stock.
Mr. DeLay also reported owing between $50,000 and $100,000 to Bracewell & Patterson, a big Houston law firm that defended him in a civil lawsuit concerning fund-raising tactics that was filed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and dismissed in 2001. Mr. DeLay reported receiving at least $48,900 last year in donations to pay for defense of the lawsuit, including $5,000 each from American Airlines and Reliant Energy.
Relatively few lawmakers in the House appear to have wealth that rivals the $10 million-plus fortunes enjoyed by many in the Senate, including Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, who reported family trusts and other assets worth at least $14 million on disclosure forms released on Friday.
Yet the Democrats' new leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi of California, owns vineyards, office buildings, resort and golf properties and stocks with her husband that, combined, are valued at more than $20 million and are potentially worth more than $100 million.
The disclosure forms allow the value of each asset to be described in wide ranges. For example, Ms. Pelosi listed her husband's stake in the Piatti Restaurant Company in Tiburon, Calif., as worth between $5 million and $25 million.
Nearly all of Ms. Pelosi's wealth derives from her husband, a successful investment banker, and the couple would benefit if the tax cut pushed by House Republicans passed, though she has argued against the plan. "She voted against it, and she's said in pretty strong language that instead of investing in our kids it indebts them," said her spokesman, Brendan Daly.
Like many members of Congress, Mrs. Pelosi also owns stock in companies that could be affected by other major legislation Congress is considering, including between $100,000 and $250,000 in Johnson & Johnson, the big pharmaceutical company that has a stake in the outcome of the fight over how to pay for prescription drugs through Medicare.
One of the Democrats' biggest earners last year was a freshman representative, Rahm Emanuel of Illinois. Mr. Emanuel, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, reported receiving $9.7 million in "deferred and defined" compensation from Wasserstein Perella & Company, the investment bank he joined after leaving the Clinton administration. 
Mr. Emanuel and at least three other members of the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, which is planning hearings into the operations and oversight of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, reported owning stock in one or both companies last year.
The hearings were called by the subcommittee's chairman, Representative Richard Baker, Republican of Louisiana, after Freddie Mac fired its president for failing to cooperate with an internal accounting probe. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae already faced scrutiny by lawmakers who question whether the two government-sponsored companies are adequately regulated.
According to the disclosure forms, Mr. Emanuel earned $27,280 from "prior years' " exercise of stock options in Freddie Mac, for which he served as a board member after leaving the White House. He also listed owning between $100,000 and $250,000 in Freddie Mac shares last year.
Others on the subcommittee who listed ownership in Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae last year include Representative Sue W. Kelly, Republican of New York, whose husband owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in Fannie Mae stock; Representative Judy Biggert, Republican of Illinois, whose husband owned $1,000 to $15,000 in Freddie Mac stock; and Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, who owned $6,819 worth of Fannie Mae at the end of the year.
President Bush's new assistant for legislative affairs, David Hobbs, listed owning between $50,000 and $100,000 in Fannie Mae. Mr. Friedman listed $287,695 in income from exercising Fannie Mae options, along with $46,826 in fees received for serving as a director.

HEADLINE: Texas Frees 12 on Bond After Drug Sweep Inquiry 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: TULIA, Tex., June 16 

 BODY:
In the same warm third-floor courtroom where she was convicted three years ago, Kizzie White was told this afternoon to go home. She searched the packed room for her son, Cashawn, 6, who had lived with relatives since she went to prison and who, for the rest of the afternoon, kept one small hand touching her -- her hand, her ear, her neck. 
 Joe Moore, 60, clutched a crumpled shopping bag. In it were gifts he had asked his lawyers to deliver like bubble bath, a toothbrush, cocoa butter and hair conditioner. Mr. Moore, a hog farmer, had been craving a long hot bath for the four years that he spent in a prison in Abilene, he said. 
 A third man left the courthouse and went home as fast as possible.
"I've got to get to my kids," he called out as he pushed to the exit.
They were among 12 inmates released on bond, most of the remaining people behind bars stemming from a drug sweep in 1999 that led to convictions against 38 people, most of them black. Lawyers and advocates have pointed to the case as an example of racism in law enforcement, and the narcotics agent who organized and carried out the sweep has been criticized for his tactics, racial comments and history.
Still, as the former prisoners and their families celebrated this evening with barbecued ribs and hot links in the basement of the Swisher County Memorial building, their lawyers warned that their legal troubles were not ended. 
Ron Chapman, a retired judge who has presided over hearings in the case, ordered the prisoners released after Gov. Rick Perry signed a special bill this month to allow that unusual step. The State Court of Criminal Appeals and the Board of Pardons and Paroles are reviewing the case. Those outcomes will decide whether any convictions stand and whether the 12 people might return to prison.
"It's a significant day, but it's not the end at all," said Vanita Gupta, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. "Our clients are walking out under the cloud of conviction." 
In fact, some defendants struggled before they went to prison. Some were unemployed, their lawyers said, and others had criminal records. At the hearing, Judge Chapman urged them to avoid trouble. 
"There are a great number of people who have a great deal of time, effort and faith in each of you invested," he said. "Your friends and loved ones are counting on you."
As they left the courthouse, some former inmates outlined plans -- for engineering school, for road trips, for a big first meal on the outside.
"I just want to go on with my life," said Mr. Moore, adding that he was not certain what that might mean. 
Since he was sentenced to a 90-year term for the delivery of cocaine, he said, he did not know what had happened to the 350 hogs that he cared for on 30 acres. 
"I don't know," he said. "I've been locked up. I want to go home, look at TV and stay out of trouble." 
Some of the lawyers said they planned to deliver a blunt message for their clients when they met with them privately, leave Tulia.
"It's going to be impossible to stay here," said JeffBlackburn, a lawyer from Amarillo. 
The prisoners will encounter the jurors who convicted them, Mr. Blackburn said, adding:
"These folks will have virtually no chance if they stay here. They will be arrested for spitting. They will be pursued to the ends of the earth."
If the prisoners had harsh feelings about Tulia, a dusty town of 5,000 between Amarillo and Lubbock, they were not saying so tonight.
"There's no doubt about it, we have great people here in Tulia," said Freddie Brookins Jr., who was serving a 20-year sentence for the delivery of cocaine. 
As lawyers, reporters and relatives gathered at the courthouse, far fewer white residents showed up. The cases have stirred deep racial tensions, and the reactions of the white majority were all but silent. Almost no one, not even officials, would offer opinions about race relations here. 
"It's a great community with great people," Sheriff Larry Stewart said. "That's it. That's all I'll say."
On nearby streets and in nearby stores, some white residents, all refusing to be quoted by name, questioned whether the defendants were not guilty of drug crimes and faulted the news media for unfairly portraying an entire town as racist by pinning the work of one troubled officer on an entire community.
Thomas Coleman, the former undercover narcotics agent who carried out the 18-month investigation as part of the Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force, was named the state's Lawman of the Year shortly after the arrests. But his credibility -- and the case itself -- have unraveled. In April, he was charged with lying under oath about his background at a hearing related to the drug cases. 
Mr. Coleman has an unlisted telephone number. His lawyer, Cindy Ermatinger of Waxahachie, did not return a call.
Early on July 23, 1999, as television cameras captured their images, the 46 people whom Mr. Coleman said he had bought drugs from were arrested. Thirty-nine were black. No drugs, weapons or large quantities of cash were seized.
At least two of the 38 people who were convicted remained behind bars this evening because of legal complications.
Mr. Coleman's methods raised questions. He did not record his purchases, and he worked alone. His notes sometimes consisted of his jotting down broad information about sales on his leg.
The cases had inconsistencies, too. Tonya White's lawyers proved that she withdrew $8 from a bank in Oklahoma on the day she was reportedly selling drugs here. 
"I knew something would come up to prove I was innocent," Ms. White said. But three siblings, including Kareem and Kizzie, went to prison. Both emerged today. 
In a crush of television cameras, Kizzie White, 26, stood with her son and a daughter, Roneisha, 9. Ms. White looked down shyly at the reporters and the constant questions. She said she had missed her children bitterly. 
"I wanted to be there for them," she said. She saw her children eight times in prison, she said. She was allowed to call them for a few moments every 90 days, and she wrote to them three times a week to remind them that she loved them, she said. Their names are tattooed in fancy script on her shoulder and neck. 
For now, Ms. White said, she will stay in Tulia. But she said she was thinking about moving to Houston, perhaps to attend nursing school. 
Sometime, she said, she will explain all that happened. 
"What I want to do now is to be the best mother I can," she said.
Roneisha turned to her mother, who was talking with a reporter, and asked, "After this, can we go now?"

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE PRESIDENT; 
In Speech, Bush Reiterates Threat Hussein Posed, but Makes No Mention of Weapons Search

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., June 16 

 BODY:
President Bush today swept aside criticism that the United States overstated the threat posed by Iraq as the work of "revisionist historians" and said there was no doubt that Saddam Hussein had been "a threat to the United States" for the past dozen years.
 But in a speech to small-business owners and employees that dwelt largely on the benefits of the recently passed tax cuts, Mr. Bush made no mention of the so-far fruitless search for Mr. Hussein's chemical, nuclear or biological weapons, which he almost never failed to mention in similar speeches when building the case for an invasion of the country earlier this year. 
 "This nation acted to a threat from the dictator of Iraq," Mr. Bush said in a hotel ballroom here. "Now there are some who would like to rewrite history -- revisionist historians is what I like to call them," he said.
He drew applause from a largely Republican, sympathetic crowd when he declared that "Saddam Hussein was a threat to America and the free world in '91, in '98, in 2003."
He cited Mr. Hussein's refusal to abide by the demands "of the free world" and added, "This is for certain: Saddam Hussein is no longer a threat to the United States and our friends and allies."
His decision not to delve into the question of unconventional weapons was notable, because only 11 days ago, addressing American troops in Doha, Qatar, Mr. Bush insisted that his concern about Mr. Hussein's weapons were justified, even while he trimmed back his assertions about what kind of weaponry Mr. Hussein had on hand. At that time, he argued that mobile laboratory trucks found in Iraq showed that the deposed government was "capable of producing biological agents." He did not go that far today.
Mr. Bush's aides insist that he is not backing away from the administration's assertions before the war about the weapons capacity of Mr. Hussein's government, statements that added urgency to his calls for military action. Now, the failure to find such weapons, at least so far, has led to several Congressional inquiries, and sent administration officials to the airwaves to argue that they did not exaggerate the threat.
At the same time, administration officials who said a month ago that they believed that Mr. Hussein was dead are beginning to revise their view, and say now that he may well be alive. In a television interview over the weekend, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, said he was leaning toward that view.
Mr. Bush's speech today was a taste of his approach to the early days of his re-election campaign, which begins this week with a series of fund-raising events. At the core of the speech is his contention that he has acted to protect America -- first by toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan, then by toppling Mr. Hussein's government -- and that he is acting simultaneously to protect the economy from a downturn that has so far defied government prescriptions.
Before speaking to the small-business owners today, Mr. Bush visited workers at Andrea Foods in Orange, N.J., watching them stuff pasta for frozen Italian meals. Mr. Bush used his visit to the ravioli production line to promote what he contends will be the job-creating effects of the tax cut he signed into law recently. Among other provisions, it allows businesses to write off $100,000 in new equipment purchases on an accelerated basis.
"We have had one of the shallowest recessions in our nation's history as a result of the tax relief plan," he argued.

HEADLINE: Neighbors Join Critics Of Burmese 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Tuesday, June 17 

 BODY:
Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors broke with precedent on Monday to chastise it publicly for its crackdown on dissent and its detention of the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
 Their criticism, at a regional forum here in the Cambodian capital, added to the growing condemnation around the world. 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in what the government calls protective custody since May 30, when military-backed thugs attacked her convoy as she traveled in northern Myanmar. Scores of people were killed and injured. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is leading an American campaign against the crackdown, is scheduled to meet in Phnom Penh on Wednesday with the foreign ministers of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, the former Burma.
Emerging from a closed meeting of the ministers on Monday, several participants said the group, known as Asean, had jointly told the Myanmar foreign minister of its concerns. In a further rebuke, they said reference to the issue would be included in a joint statement to be issued today.
The association has in the past held back from criticizing Myanmar, as part of its long-standing policy of noninterference in the affairs of member states. But analysts said the group's silence now, as the world rallies against Myanmar, risked making it appear ineffectual.
"We in Asean are now sharing in accountability to the world about the slow progress of the transition to democracy in Myanmar," said the Philippine foreign secretary, Blas Ople.
S. Jayakumar, the foreign minister of Singapore, said the point was made to the Myanmar foreign minister, U Win Aung, "that the recent developments were a setback not just for Myanmar but also for Asean."
He added: "The ministers urged the Myanmar foreign minister to stay on the course for national reconciliation." That would mean a return to long-stalled talks between the government and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and an easing of the current crackdown.
On Sunday, Mr. Win Aung repeated the government's assertion that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would be freed but declined to say when.
"Let us not call it detention," he said. "What we would like to say is that for the time being we protect her from personal harm."
He said the government was holding her because of rumors that assassins might try to kill her.
Mr. Powell, who will arrive in Phnom Penh along with senior officials of a dozen nations in the Asean Regional Forum, an Asia-Pacific security group, is expected to lobby for stronger action against Myanmar, which is already the target of economic penalties from a number of nations.
In Washington, Congress is preparing to toughen current American sanctions to add a ban on all imports from Myanmar. The European Union took a similar step on Monday, strengthening its current measures.
Myanmar was one of the last nations to be admitted to Asean, a loose political and economic grouping whose other members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
Since Myanmar was admitted in 1997, its fellow members have said they could modify its behavior in what they said was a tactful, Asian way, through a policy they called constructive engagement.
For the past three years, a Malaysian diplomat, Razali Ismail, acting as a United Nations envoy, has gently brokered confidence-building talks between the junta and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
In May 2002, she was released from 19 months of house arrest, and the junta promised to begin talking substantively about national issues. Those talks never materialized.
The attack last month and a wave of arrests signaled a return to the tough policies that were in place before Mr. Razali began his visits.
M. C. Abad, the spokesman for the Asean secretariat, said the grouping might have to reassess its policy of noninterference.
"What we would like to happen is a discussion of broadening the interpretation and application of that principle," he said.

HEADLINE: Opening Skies Over the Atlantic 

 BODY:
It may take some time, but air travel across the North Atlantic is likely to improve dramatically -- with more competitive fares and scheduling -- as a result of changes in the way the European Union regulates aviation. The European Court of Justice has rightly decided that it makes little sense for Europe's single economy to retain an airline system that dates from an age when airlines were owned by governments and treated like national symbols.
 The court struck down the old bilateral treaties between the United States and various European nations. The hope now is for an ambitious open-skies treaty that allows airlines to fly wherever and whenever they want, which could bring to trans-Atlantic travelers the same benefits deregulation has conferred on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 Unlike the old treaties that would only apply, say, to KLM from the Netherlands or Lufthansa out of Germany, an arrangement with the European Union could unleash competition. Air France would be allowed to fly between New York and Madrid -- which it cannot do now -- while Alitalia could fly to Los Angeles from Charles de Gaulle. 
America's outdated foreign ownership restrictions will likely remain one of the biggest obstacles to this needed deregulation of trans-Atlantic air travel. Currently, foreign shareholders can control only up to 25 percent of an airline's voting stock. Labor unions have long defended this senseless protectionism, a stance that has gone from being self-interested to self-defeating at a time when the nation's battered airline industry could use an infusion of overseas investment capital.
The Bush administration is rightly pressing Congress to raise the foreign ownership cap to 49 percent of voting shares, bringing our limits more in line with those of other countries. Doing so would strengthen the health of America's transportation infrastructure, and it would help smooth the way toward a desirable air deal with Europe.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
2 Towers Rise in Chicago Despite Weak Market

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 17 

 BODY:
Rents are falling, vacancies are rising and the economy remains in the doldrums. Normally, this would not be looked on as the most opportune moment to commence construction of millions of square feet of new downtown office space.
 But that has not deterred two major Chicago developers from starting two high-profile office buildings totaling more than 2.8 million square feet of space. 
 The buildings are the Hyatt Center and 111 South Wacker. The first is being developed by a partnership consisting of the Pritzker family and Higgins Development Partners while the second is being constructed by the John Buck Company. Both buildings broke ground in the last six months with the Hyatt Center expected to be finished in late 2004 and 111 South Wacker in mid-2005. 
In addition, a third developer, Hines Interests of Houston, has announced a tentative starting date later this year for a third high-rise.
Why build now? Why add 2.8 million square feet of space -- 3.6 million if the Hines building is included in the calculations -- to the more than 20 million square feet currently sitting vacant?
"If they were driven by economics," says Stephen Smith, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, a large real estate investment and services firm with headquarters here, "none of these buildings would be happening." 
Indeed, the fundamentals of the downtown office market are not very encouraging. The overall vacancy rate -- including space available for sublease -- stands at about 16 percent. Two years ago, the rate was about 10 percent. In addition, the rate is expected to increase to about 18 percent over the next year.
The crucial real estate measure called absorption -- the net of space that has become vacant and space that has been leased in a given period -- is also lagging. "We've had negative absorption for five straight quarters," said John O'Donnell, vice chairman and chief financial officer of John Buck.
And Mr. Smith of Jones Lang LaSalle said, "No one has been able to identify the next tech trend that is going to drive growth." 
A result is that rents are dropping after a run-up in the late 90's when they briefly peaked at just over $30 a square foot a year for Class A space, the most modern in the best locations. 
"Right now, landlords are doing whatever they need to do to lease space," said John Goodman, executive vice president and regional manager for Julien J. Studley Inc., a national tenant representative firm with offices here. 
He added that for Class A space, the current net effective rental rate is $17 to $22 a square foot. "That's where deals are being done," he said. 
The problem is a lack of tenants, at any price. "We've had almost no real growth -- except for bankruptcy firms and law firms -- among typical users," said John F. McKinney, president of JF McKinney & Associates, a large leasing firm that is handling leasing at Hyatt Center.
Paul Beitler, co-developer of Dearborn Center, a new 1.8-million-square- foot building at the corner of Dearborn and Adams Streets, said, "We haven't signed a lease in two years." The building, which was finished earlier this year, is 30 percent vacant, Mr. Beitler said. "Essentially, ever since 9/11, there has been no leasing."
The attacks on the World Trade Center and fears of future terrorism are also having a negative impact on the city's ultimate trophy building, the 110-story Sears Tower, the tallest in the United States. 
"Before 9/11, we had gotten to a point where we were commanding some really strong rates for a Class A building," said Stephen Budorick, senior vice president of New York-based Trizec Properties Inc., which has a controlling interest in the 3.4-million-square-foot building. "Afterwards, we were 25 percent off that."
The building has had several high- profile defectors in recent months, the most notable being Goldman, Sachs & Company. Goldman, which occupies 245,000 square feet on a long-term lease that does not expire until 2011, is leaving for smaller -- about 200,000 square feet -- space at the new Hyatt Center. 
According to Andrea Raphael, a Goldman vice president and spokeswoman, the reasons for the move are strategic. "We wanted to consolidate and get an amount of space that was more efficient for us," she said. 
Trizec Properties -- and much of the local real estate community here -- has a different interpretation. "The factor that put them in the market," Mr. Budorick said, "is 9/11."
Whatever the reason, Goldman's decision reflects the leasing strategy of the new buildings, which is to entice existing downtown companies to leave their current space with promises of being in new, technologically up-to-date buildings on one of Chicago's premier business streets. Wacker Drive, home to the Hyatt Center and 111 South Wacker, as well as the Sears Tower, is a broad boulevard that parallels the Chicago River on the north and west sides of the Loop business district. 
Over the last decade, as development has spread west, Wacker has challenged LaSalle Street as the city's financial center of gravity.
"This project was driven by the tenants," said Penny Pritzker, chief executive of the Pritzker Realty Group, a family-owned company. "It wasn't driven by us saying we want to go out and build a building today."
Mr. O'Donnell of the John Buck Company, the developer of 111 South Wacker, said, "We're 42.5 percent leased and are currently talking to three other tenants that will take it to 75 percent." 
Hyatt Center's anchor tenants are the Pritzker-owned Hyatt Corporation; Goldman Sachs; and the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw. The three will occupy two-thirds of the building's 1.8 million square feet. 
The 1.1-million-square-foot 111 South Wacker will be anchored by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, which is taking 425,000 square feet.
Both developers say they are asking for, and receiving, rents in the mid to upper $20's. "The size of our floors and the technological advantages we have to offer are enough to offset the rental differentiation," Mr. McKinney said.
Another factor developers are capitalizing on is the shortage of large blocks of space in the downtown market. "We use a lot of space," said Debora de Hoyos, managing partner of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, which is now in a 1980s-vintage high-rise on LaSalle Street. "And when you get close to 500,000 square feet, there's very few blocks of space to choose from."
Both projects promise to be striking additions to the local skyline. After a long trend toward retro-styled stone-and-concrete buildings, Chicago is returning to its modernist roots. Hyatt Center, designed by the New York-based architecture firm of Pei Cobb Freed at a cost of $425 million, is a dramatic ellipse-shaped steel-and-glass structure. As for 111 South Wacker, it has a lower price tag -- in excess of $260 million -- and is a more traditional glass box. The building's architect is Lohan Caprile Goettsch, a local firm.
In addition, a third new building, 1 South Dearborn, by Hines Interests of Houston, appears likely. That building, a 40-story, 825,000-square-foot tower designed by the Chicago-based DeStefano Keating Partners Ltd., has a tentative starting date of Dec. 1. 
"Somewhere between 50 and 60 percent leased is where you need to get to start building," said Greg Van Schaack, vice president of Hines Interests. "We're close" 
The good news so far is that interest rates remain low enough that developers are able to carry buildings with significant vacancy levels for longer periods of time without the threat of foreclosure from lenders. 
Real estate executives are also careful to draw a distinction between the current downturn and the one that occurred a decade ago. "In the early 90's," said Sam Zell, chairman of Equity Office Properties, a publicly owned real estate investment trust in Chicago, "you had five or six empty buildings just standing there. That's a lot different than starting buildings today in hopes of filling them two or three years from now."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Aforecaster lowers his projection for 2003 ad spending, but says it will break a record, barely.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TURNS out the bowl of cherries that greeted analysts and reporters as they gathered yesterday to hear a revised prediction of advertising spending from the dean of Madison Avenue forecasters was not a leading indicator.
 Instead, the forecaster, Robert J. Coen, who has been tracking ad trends since the Truman administration, revised downward his prediction for American ad spending this year at a presentation in Midtown Manhattan. The change, attributed partly to sluggish interest from local advertisers in certain media outlets, including newspapers, was the second time in six months that Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, had reduced his estimate for 2003. 
 Mr. Coen's predictions are closely watched because of his involvement in forecasting since 1948. He issues his predictions twice a year, in June or July and in December. 
Mr. Coen's new forecast for 2003 is for a gain of 4.6 percent from the $236.9 billion that is his final figure for ad spending last year. That compares with the 5 percent increase Mr. Coen predicted at a presentation in December. In July 2002, when he offered his first look at 2003, Mr. Coen forecast a gain of 5.5 percent from 2002.
The 2002 result represented a slim 2.4 percent increase from 2001, coming in slightly below an earlier estimate of a 2.6 percent gain.
"It was not a great year," Mr. Coen said, "but it was a lot better than the 6.5 percent decline in 2001" compared with 2000. That decline was the first since 1991 and the largest since 1938.
Mr. Coen's refiguring of his numbers for 2003 came soon after several Wall Street analysts slightly rejiggered their forecasts, some adjusting a bit upward and others adjusting a bit downward.
For instance, Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch lowered her estimate of ad spending growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent, while David Doft of CIBC World Markets increased his estimate to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent. And the entertainment and media practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers decided to stand pat, reaffirming this week a forecast made last year for 3 percent growth in 2003.
While Mr. Coen's predictions have tended to be a bit more optimistic than those of other forecasters and Wall Street analysts, his forecasts during the boom years 1998-2000 were a little less rosy than the actual results. Also, Mr. Coen was one of a handful of forecasters to predict that ad spending last year would increase from 2001.
The consensus among forecasters, including Mr. Coen, for 2003 calls for a gradual improvement in ad spending, which is closely watched as a harbinger of how the overall economy is faring. As a result, the news from Mr. Coen was not all gloom and doom, so perhaps half a bowl of cherries might have been more appropriate.
The total amount of ad spending in the United States expected this year by Mr. Coen, $247.7 billion, would exceed the previous record of $247.5 billion, set in 2000, even if the rate of growth is slower than had been hoped.
Also, Mr. Coen said he saw better results coming in the second half of the year, with the last six months on track for a gathering recovery that will accelerate in 2004 because "much better things for the economy seem to be ahead."
Mr. Coen attributed the downward adjustment to his previous estimates to somewhat weaker results than expected for the first half, caused by the sputtering economy.
"The trends were not quite as robust as they looked in December," Mr. Coen said, "so we're a little more cautious."
"There will be a little less growth in the first half," he added, "but a return to strong growth in the second half."
One reason for the drag on growth, Mr. Coen said, was the war in Iraq, and the buildup to it.
"It had more effect before it happened than probably while it was on," he said, referring to the decisions by many advertisers to postpone or cancel campaigns before the initial attack.
Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York who attended the presentation, summarized Mr. Coen's point succinctly.
"It was, 'We interrupt this recovery to bring you this war,' " Mr. Gottesman said, "and once the war was over, the recovery was back on track."
Another reason for the slower growth, Mr. Coen said, is a disparity between demand for commercial time and ad space on the local and national levels.
For example, newspaper classified advertising is still down, he said, adding, "It's a tough year." Demand for ad space in local media outlets from retailers is down because of a slowdown in sales.
As a result, Mr. Coen has knocked a full percentage point off his estimate from December of growth in spending in local media outlets, lowering it to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent. He called the trimming "a fairly significant reduction."
The variance between the local and national media can be seen in other categories. For instance, Mr. Coen is predicting that ad spending this year will increase on local television by 2.5 percent, in local newspapers by 3.5 percent and on local radio by 4 percent.
By comparison, his forecasts for the national counterparts of those media outlets are more robust: up 4.7 percent for television, 5.5 percent for newspapers and 4.2 percent for radio.
Mr. Coen also predicted better results for other national media, including magazines, up 7 percent; direct mail, up 6.5 percent; and the Internet, up 5 percent.
Analysts, including several who attended Mr. Coen's presentation, echoed his revamped outlook.
"The economy in the first half has not been what people thought," said Mr. Doft of CIBC, "but the second-half strength is still expected."
"There are definitely some good spending categories out there," he said. What investors will be "looking at is the auto category," he said, "which will be a big determinant of where the year is." Automakers, which typically spend more each year than any other advertising group, may be rethinking their ad plans as consumers send mixed signals about their intent to buy more cars, trucks and minivans.
Leland Westerfield, a managing director at Jefferies & Company, said: "We're making up for lost time if 2003 recaptures the height reached in the 2000 peak. But this time, we'd be on firmer ground because it would be built on steadier marketing categories than last time, when so much of the spending came from the dot-coms."
Fueling the gains in the second half, Mr. Coen said, will be national spending by major marketers like the automakers, movie studios, restaurant chains and sellers of cosmetics, drugs, food and toiletries. Those increases will, he predicted, offset spending cutbacks in categories like airlines, brokerage firms and mutual funds, insurance, resorts, telecommunications and tours.
For 2004, Mr. Coen offered an initial forecast for a gain of 5.6 percent from 2003. If that happens, it will be the largest percentage gain since 2000, a year when ad spending was stimulated by a summer Olympics and a presidential election.
By comparison, Ms. Fine at Merrill Lynch has revised upward her estimate of ad spending growth in 2004 to 6.2 percent from 6 percent, while PricewaterhouseCoopers cut its estimate to 6.3 percent from 7.3 percent. In his first forecast for 2004, Mr. Doft of CIBC is predicting a gain of 5.8 percent.
Turning to ad spending overseas, Mr. Coen predicted 2003 would end with a total of $222.1 billion, up 4 percent from his revised final figure of $213.6 billion in 2002. His initial forecast for 2004 is for an increase of 4.5 percent from 2003 to $232.1 billion.
Among countries expected to outpace others in ad spending growth this year, Mr. Coen listed China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and South Korea, which would compensate for smaller gains in larger markets like Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
Thus, the Coen estimated total for worldwide ad spending this year is now $469.8 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent from $450.5 billion in 2002. His estimate for 2004 is $495.9 billion, up 5.6 percent from 2003.
The bowl of cherries was placed on the table in front of the conference room in which Mr. Coen made his presentation, at the headquarters of the Universal McCann parent, the McCann-Erickson World Group. It was the first time in many years that Mr. Coen's midyear presentation had not taken place at the University Club.
Some attendees joked that McCann-Erickson, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the struggling agency company, had changed sites to save the rent. Mr. Coen joked that the real savings would be derived from not having to take taxicabs between the University Club and his office.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Trimmed Forecast"Robert J. Coen of Universal McCann, one of the most widely followed forecasters of advertising spending, has reduced his estimate for ad spending this year in the United States by about $1.5 billion. It is the second time he has revised his prediction downward, though he still expects spending to pick up in 2004 because of the Athens Olympics and the presidential election.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose in May, Easing Worries on Deflation 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy, had their biggest increase in nine months in May, the government reported yesterday, easing concern that deflation might sap the economic recovery.
 The core Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent, three times the median forecast, after holding steady in each of the previous two months. The Labor Department said the overall index was unchanged in May, tempered by a drop in energy prices, after falling 0.3 percent in April. 
 Industrial production increased in May for the first time since February, and housing starts rose, separate reports showed, supporting forecasts of faster growth in the second half of the year.
The figures may reduce pressure on the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed Reserve policy panel, to cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point next week to help avoid a broad decline in prices.
"The economy is not rushing headlong toward a deflationary environment that would push the F.O.M.C. to become extremely aggressive," said Joel Naroff, the president of Naroff Economic Advisors, in Holland, Pa. 
Production at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent last month after falling 0.6 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said in Washington. The proportion of industrial capacity in use held at 74.3 percent, the lowest since June 1983.
Economists had expected a 0.1 percent decrease in the Consumer Price Index. Core prices had been forecast to rise 0.1 percent.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said this month that central bankers were concerned about "corrosive deflation," a general decline in prices that feeds on itself.
Jade Zelnik, the chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Connecticut, said: "This should prove somewhat reassuring to Fed officials, helping to reinforce the view that outright deflation remains a remote possibility. However, the May C.P.I. results are unlikely to affect Fed officials' determination to cut rates at their upcoming meeting in order to prevent additional economic slack from developing."
Since November, Fed policy makers have held the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest since 1961.
Core prices were up 1.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the year ended in April, the lowest since March 1966. Core prices so far this year have risen at a 1.1 percent annual pace, down from 2.1 percent in the first five months of last year.
Demand for housing remained strong in May, the Commerce Department report showed, aided by the lowest mortgage rates on record. Builders broke ground on 1.7 million homes at an annual pace last month, up 6.1 percent from April, the Commerce Department said. Construction was completed on 1.8 million housing units at an annual rate, the most since January 1987.

HEADLINE: Hints of Upturn Begin to Ease Gloom at Ban ks And Businesses 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
To economists, the message from the last two years of economic weakness has been clear: It's the business sector, stupid.
 Consumershave kept up their spending, thanks to low interest rates on credit cards and mortgages. But the nation's job losses are unlikely to be reversed, economists say, until companies have the confidence to grow. 
 By one indicator -- changes in banks' commercial lending -- that is said to be a favorite of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, confidence may be starting to take hold. The overall trend in net lending -- new loans minus repayments -- has been dipping for more than two years. Yet, a change of direction in the demand for loans seems to be under way. 
"There's a cautious optimism," said Todd C. Moules, executive vice president for corporate banking at the National City Corporation. "There are people who have a vision of when they expect things to come back. They're seeing signs of improvement."
Six months ago, Mr. Moules said, his clients had no such hopes. Yet some recent data on the economy has suggested that better times are on the way for businesses.
Yesterday, the Fed reported that industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in May, exceeding analysts' expectations. The utilization of industrial capacity was unchanged from a revised April figure of 74.3 percent. 
The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose by 6.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, with permits for future construction increasing 3.7 percent. 
Together, the promising news, based on market interest rates, seems to have led investors to expect just a quarter-point cut in interest rates, rather than a half-point, by the Federal Reserve next week.
In commercial banking, hopeful signs could not come soon enough. Even as businesses have cut back in the face of higher spending by consumers, commercial lending has wilted while mortgages and credit card debt have bloomed.
Commercial and industrial loans held by the biggest banks, those classified by the Federal Reserve as those with $300 million or more in assets, have dropped steadily since March 2001 -- the month the most recent recession began, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The previous recession began in July 1990 -- about a month after the big banks' commercial and industrial loans started a downward slide.
A combination of factors has contributed to the drop over the last two years, said Richard A. Higginbotham, executive vice president and managing director of national commercial financial services at FleetBoston Financial.
"Spending for capital equipment and software has really been in a decline," he said. "That has been very marked, especially in the last year and a half. One of the other drivers has been less vibrant merger and acquisition activity in the U.S." Many fewer companies, he added, "are being bought and sold."
"Working capital has, in many companies, shrunk over the last couple of years," Mr. Higginbotham said, "to very low levels. Companies have become very efficient."
Large businesses have also taken advantage of low interest rates to pursue long-term financing outside banks, said John W. Clay Jr., vice chairman of SunTrust Banks in Atlanta. "The large public companies have all, to the extent that they have the ability to do so, taken advantage of the public debt markets," he said. "They've built liquidity, and they just don't need a lot of short-term bank access right now."
Mr. Higginbotham said that some banks had become more selective about their clients, trying to aim lending at those who might buy several types of financial services. 
"All of these have really added together to provide not only a sluggish demand in bank lending but a shrinking market in terms of actual usage," he said.
Though plunges in commercial and industrial loans may coincide with the beginning of recessions, the economy has typically resumed strong growth before loan activity picks up, said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. Increases in growth, he said, could speed repayment of old loans as well as new lending, so a recovery in net loans -- the figures kept by the Federal Reserve -- would lag behind an upturn in the economic cycle.
Indeed, loans did not start to recover from their last decline until early 1994, well after the economy had returned to a reasonable pace of growth. But Mr. Shepherdson said that banks' pronouncements about demand for new loans could hint at a turnaround soon in the economy.
"I normally ignore anecdotes," he said. But in this case, "the banks might actually be saying something interesting." Because the biggest banks hold such a large share of the total loan market, he said, their new loans could signal an acceleration in economic growth. According to Fed listings, the top 10 banks have more than 40 percent of the domestic assets of the next 1,300 banks combined.
SunTrust has recently had modest growth in loans, Mr. Clay said, largely from small and medium-size businesses. Because they cannot avail themselves of the securities markets for financing, they have continued to rely on banks for moderate capital spending, working capital and financing of inventories.
"The market is very bifurcated," Mr. Clay said. "In the middle market and the smaller end of the market, business conditions are very good, and our loan demand is strong." But he warned that employment would not pick up until companies began to invest more in new equipment and plants.
Mr. Higginbotham said he had already seen some strengthening in loans intended to finance equipment, an area, he said, where there was considerable pent-up demand.
"We finance a lot of equipment through our leasing company," he said, "either by directly calling on users or purchasers of equipment, or by providing financing to the manufacturer's sales force. That business has had two good months now."
In addition, he said, more companies are being bought and sold. "People are coming to grips with what the market thinks valuations are," Mr. Higginbotham said. "A number of investment shops are putting up for sale companies they own, to rebalance their portfolio or to give a return to investors."
Over all, Mr. Moules said, the demand for loans is increasing as businesses go ahead with projects delayed by the Iraq war, as well as more recent plans.
That change in fortunes may be showing up in the big banks' share prices. From March 12 -- about a week before the start of attacks on Iraq -- and yesterday's close, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's index of 24 leading banks rose 36 percent, compared with 28 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500.
Mr. Shepherdson said that increased spending on equipment would be one of the first steps back toward new hiring by businesses. For the economy to maintain momentum, though, there can be no strong economic shocks.
"In the second half of last year, capital spending by businesses rose reasonably quickly," he said. "The only reason they stopped in the first quarter of this year was the war."
If economic prospects brighten considerably in the second half of the year, long-term interest rates would probably rise as investors anticipated an increase in short-term rates. Large companies might then return to banks to finance their capital spending, Mr. Clay said.
"Once interest rates turn up, that will effectively signal the end of the rush to the public debt markets," he said. "We really could get a very nice lift when some of this excess liquidity burns off."
Mr. Shepherdson sees the economy poised at sunrise. "If I draw a piece of paper with the numbers I've been looking for to signal a recovery," he said, "most of them have been falling into place. This is it. This is the turning point."

HEADLINE: Calpers to Vote on New Health Care Rates 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The California Public Employees' Retirement System is expected to approve a big increase today in premiums for its 900,000 members insured by health maintenance organizations.
 The increase, of just over 18 percent for most, will be shared between employers and members; it is well below the 25.1 percent increase for 2003. 
 Rates at the California system, which plans to spend $3.3 billion this year on medical coverage, are widely viewed as an early indicator of national inflation rates in health care. But Wall Street analysts said industrywide increases for large private employers would be lower, 12 percent, on average, in 2004, compared with 14 percent in 2003. 
Of the 1.3 million state and school employees covered by the system, known as Calpers, 70 percent are members of H.M.O.'s. Two nonprofit H.M.O.'s, Blue Shield of California and Kaiser Permanente, are the system's main insurers. Calpers dropped H.M.O.'s operated by Health Net and PacifiCare last year, after they held out for 30 percent increases. Blue Cross of California, a unit of WellPoint Health Networks, administers a preferred provider network for the system.
Clark McKinley, a Calpers spokesman, said it had pared the increase by $385 million in negotiations. He said the H.M.O.'s initially sought increases averaging 31 percent. About a third of the reduction resulted from a multiyear contract with Blue Shield, reducing the number of H.M.O. companies to three from five, and delaying negotiations until the system could obtain recent information on actual spending, Mr. McKinley said. 
The Calpers staff recommended the 18.4 percent increase for Blue Shield, with 460,000 members, and 18.2 percent for the 422,000 members covered by Kaiser, Mr. McKinley said. Western Health Advantage, a small nonprofit health plan based in Sacramento, would raise rates 34.5 percent.
The system's rates "tend to be higher than those of other employee-based purchasers because our members are older, have a greater proportion of chronic health conditions, with higher utilization of hospitals, doctors and prescription drugs," Mr. McKinley said. 
"Calpers continues to offer a richer benefit than most private sector employees," said Matthew Borsch, a health care securities analyst at Goldman, Sachs. Charles Boorady, an analyst at Smith Barney, noted that many Calpers members were in unions that had resisted reductions in employer-paid benefits.
Calpers says it is the nation's third-largest purchaser of employee health benefits, after the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and General Motors.

HEADLINE: Camera Verite; 
A Peek Through Blue-Collar Lenses

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
In the vast convoy of vehicles that rumble through New York every day, Zu Rong Li's delivery truck is indistinguishable from the rest until he pulls to a curb and leaves the engine running and the driver's seat empty while he takes a photograph.
 Mr. Li stops his truck where others rarely stop, to shoot pictures of things others rarely see: beneath a bridge he saw a long row of columns that he considered an image of continuity and friendship; he stopped by the old Brooklyn Army Terminal one day to photograph a single railroad tanker car that suggested the history of power and war; and the American flag reflecting on a shiny wall made him stop because it seemed such a glorious symbol of freedom. 
 Mr. Li is the first to say he is no professional photographer. He insists he is a truck driver, nothing more. But over the last three months, he and a handful of other workers have been learning how to document their daily working lives, which by and large unfold invisibly against the backdrop of corporate New York. 
They are part of a project called Unseen America, which lends cameras to people society often overlooks, coaches them in the art of taking pictures that tell stories and then professionally exhibits their photographs in a gallery.
Esther Cohen, executive director of Bread and Roses, the cultural arm of 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, started Unseen America in 2000 to shed light on problems in health care, housing, education and employment.
"By making the issues of the lives of the working class visible, we can come close to resolving some of those issues," Ms. Cohen said.
Through the lenses of about 100 donated point-and-shoot 35-millimeter cameras, people can fill in the blank spots of their lives. Ms. Cohen said that when cameras were given to a group of homeless people, some of them shot houses and apartment buildings "because that is what they never had." And a Chinese garment worker recently explained that taking photographs of her life made her feel "like a frog that jumped out of a well."
These photographs can remind the rest of the city, and the nation, that the majority of Americans still belong to the working class.
"We have images of the working class trudging off to the factory carrying their lunch pails, or sitting on I-beams dangling in the sky," said Michael Zweig, a professor of economics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and director of the Center for Study of Working Class Life. "Because that's not the way working-class people look now, people tend to think that workers have disappeared, but they have not."
In previous Unseen America projects, including one on Long Island that Professor Zweig's center supported, Mexican migrant workers and Polish asbestos-removal workers took photos of their lives. A Mexican woman photographed ordinary chairs because she spends most of her working day on her feet and sitting is only a dream.
"The whole idea of these images and this process is to really allow and to encourage the humanity and creative impulse of working people to come out," said Professor Zweig, who in his recent book, "The Working Class Majority" calculated that 62 percent of the American labor force belongs to the working class, a group defined not by how much its members make but by their lack of independence on the job. In the New York metropolitan region, Professor Zweig found that 63 percent of the labor force can be classified as working class.
While working-class people are still a majority, they do not have the political influence their predecessors had after World War II, when unions built their own housing projects, like East River Houses, and ran their own health clinics. Today's working class is far less likely to be unionized, Professor Zweig said, and organized labor has lost much of its political power.
Ms. Cohen recently organized a series of Unseen America photography classes that brought together about a dozen Chinese garment workers and a dozen elderly Jewish men and women, including some whose parents had worked in the garment industry years ago.
"Each culture had different ideas about what is an appropriate image to photograph," Ms. Cohen said. The Chinese workers were reluctant to take pictures of anything but happy moments, she said, and the Jewish seniors were more accustomed to expressing themselves in words than in images. Two professional photographers, Matthew Septimus and Teddy Fung, taught the class on the Lower East Side, and Mr. Fung translated.
While most of the students had owned cameras, the idea of shooting photographs of their day-to-day lives was foreign.
"You have to go out, be bold," Mr. Septimus encouraged his students.
Mr. Fung told them, "When you take a picture, don't close your mind."
Ping Lam, a cutter in a garment factory, said he was reluctant to take pictures at work because he didn't know whether his supervisors would object, a common concern in the group. So he quietly photographed only people working near him, taking black-and-white snapshots of women cutting bolts of cloth and a master stitcher attaching trim pieces by hand.
"When I work hard I want to remember it," said Mr. Lam, 40, who went to work at the factory soon after arriving in New York from Hong Kong 13 years ago. Mr. Lam said he also thought that if others saw what it was really like in the factory, they would better understand how Chinese workers lived.
As the classes went on through the spring, many Jewish students stopped coming, but those who continued were focused on their work. Adriana Paulian, who said she was "39 plus 39," came to the United States from Romania about 12 years ago. She took a picture of a vest-pocket park on Delancey Street that made it look like a rain forest. "It was a little piece of paradise in the middle of a very busy, very noisy area," she said. 
Then there was Mr. Li, 52, the truck driver, who came to New York from China seven years ago. He photographed the entire process of making clothing, starting with cutters, then seamstresses and pressers and finally packers.
Mr. Li said he was especially impressed by the fact that his company makes military uniforms. When his truck is filled with the uniforms, all pressed and wrapped in plastic, their creases sharp and their buttons gleaming, he said, he no longer feels invisible. 
"When I carry them in my truck," he said, "I think I am doing something important for this country, and I feel good."
A selection of the photographs will be exhibited at the Bread and Roses Gallery at 310 West 43rd Street in Midtown Manhattan starting on Labor Day.

HEADLINE: Coke Confirms Product Test Was Rigged 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Coca-Cola acknowledged yesterday that employees manipulated the results of a market test of Frozen Coke at Burger King restaurants, confirming one of the accusations raised by a former executive who has sued the company.
 Burger King, a major Coke customer, said it was disappointed by Coke's conduct and was conducting its own review. Coke, meanwhile, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had issued an informal request for documents regarding the executive's assertions. 
 Coke's audit committee, which began investigating the complaints by the former executive, Matthew Whitley, in May, also found that the company's fountain division had improperly valued some equipment. Coke said it would take a $9 million pretax write-down to correct the error, resulting in a reduction in second-quarter earnings of 0.25 cent a share, which it called insignificant. 
But the committee, whose members include the financier Warren E. Buffett and the Home Depot chief executive Robert L. Nardelli, said it had found no evidence to support Mr. Whitley's accusations that Coke had discriminated against minorities or women and said there was no evidence that the fountain division had improperly shifted revenue to a project to develop a new beverage dispensing system last year.
Mr. Whitley, a former finance director in the fountain division, sued Coke in May for $44.4 million in damages. His lawsuit says that the unit engaged in $2 billion in accounting fraud, created slush funds and manipulated its inventories.
Coke did not respond to all of Mr. Whitley's assertions yesterday. In a memo to employees, Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, said that Coke took accusations of inappropriate conduct seriously and would take corrective action when employees' conduct was inappropriate. He also said it would vigorously defend itself in court.
Investors knocked $1, or 2 percent, off the price of Coca-Cola shares yesterday; the stock closed at $47.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Coke officials have described Mr. Whitley as a disgruntled former employee who threatened to take his charges to the news media if he was not paid. Mr. Whitley, an 11-year employee of Coke, was laid off earlier this year when the company imposed 1,000 job cuts in its North American units.
In his lawsuit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta, where Coke is based, Mr. Whitley says that members of the Burger King account team at Coca-Cola persuaded Burger King to run a three-week test of Coke's frozen carbonated beverages in restaurants in Richmond, Va., in 2000. Coke's marketing plan was to offer customers a coupon for a free frozen drink with the purchase of a value meal, in hopes of increasing traffic at Burger King and persuading the fast-food company to invest more heavily in the frozen beverages and extend the promotion nationally. 
When the tests appeared to be going poorly, Coke officials paid $10,000 to a Virginia man to take hundreds of children to Burger King to buy value meals, according to the lawsuit.
Coke officials, who did not dispute the details of the Virginia promotion, said yesterday that the employees involved were disciplined in 2001. But it denied Mr. Whitley's assertion that it used the beverage promotion to try to influence Burger King's thinking about expanding the promotion. Rather, it said, Burger King had already introduced Frozen Coke in 1999 in more than 75 percent of its restaurants, based on market tests in other cities a year earlier.
Steven J. Heyer, Coke's president, sent a letter yesterday apologizing to Bradley D. Blum, the chief executive of Burger King. "These actions were wrong and inconsistent with the values of the Coca-Cola Company," it said.
Marc Garber, Mr. Whitley's lawyer, said yesterday's disclosure proved that his client's accusations were on target. "My client has been vindicated in good measure," said Mr. Garber, adding that Mr. Whitley intended to go forward with the lawsuit. "Coke had this information almost six months ago; it wasn't until they were confronted by the possibility of a lawsuit that they decided to investigate," he said.

HEADLINE: Boston Archdiocese, Hurting Financially, Warns of Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 17 

 BODY:
Underscoring the financial difficulty facing the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston as a result of the sexual abuse scandal in the clergy and a sagging economy, Bishop Richard G. Lennon warned his parish priests today that because almost 100 churches were withholding money from the archdiocese, he would order them to start laying off employees or cut their health benefits.
 Bishop Lennon, who took over as the interim administrator of the archdiocese after Cardinal Bernard F. Law resigned in December, told the priests that "this may well be painful for some," but that the archdiocese had to bring its costs and resources into balance. 
 The shortfall averages about $15,000 a parish, the Rev. Christopher Coyne, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said. It now amounts to a $9.4 million budget gap. 
The money is supposed to be paid by Boston's 360 parishes into a central trust fund and then returned by the archdiocese to help individual churches pay for the pension benefits and health insurance of its lay employees and the insurance costs for its buildings, Father Coyne said.
"We just don't have the available funds to make these payments," he said.
If the 100 parishes do not start making payments by July 1, Father Coyne said, Bishop Lennon will send out a "letter of termination," meaning the lay employees could lose their health insurance, their jobs or both.
The 360 parishes employ about 9,000 laypeople, including teachers.
About 300 representatives of the parishes attended the meeting today with Bishop Lennon. The warning about terminating lay employees is only the latest sign of financial and morale problems in the archdiocese. 
Father Coyne said the archdiocese had raised only $4.5 million of a projected $9 million annual giving campaign that is crucial to operating its schools and charities in Boston. Last year, before the scandal became public, the goal for the annual campaign was $17.4 million.
Moreover, an ambitious capital campaign started by Cardinal Law to raise $300 million is now likely to fall $100 million short, church officials here said.
The archdiocese's budget this year has been cut by 20 percent, following a 30 percent reduction last year. 
In 2002 alone, the number of active priests fell by 10 percent, caused mostly by the removal of those accused of sexually molesting minors. That leaves the Boston archdiocese with 505 priests, according to the archdiocesan directory, down from 1,072 priests two decades ago. 
Even these figures do not fully describe the troubles facing the Boston Archdiocese. For example, each parish is also supposed to contribute 1 percent of its weekly offerings to the Boston headquarters, in what is known as the cathedraticum, an amount that can reach anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 a year. 
But many priests say they have stopped sending their weekly offerings to protest how the church hierarchy handled the sexual abuse scandals and out of concern that the money will be used to pay legal settlements.
The Rev. Bernard P. McLaughlin, pastor of the St. Gerard Majella parish in Canton, a southern suburb, said he had not sent his share of offerings in two years.
"We're in good shape here," Father McLaughlin said. "The reason, I think, is that people here are happy and they are giving."
If his parishioners thought the money was going to the archdiocese, he said, "they would back off." 
Father McLaughlin was invited to today's meeting with Bishop Lennon but did not attend.

HEADLINE: G.E. Union Cites Deal to Curb Workers' Share of Health Costs 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With details of a tentative agreement beginning to emerge, the president of General Electric's largest labor union said yesterday that it had achieved its goal of ensuring that workers would not shoulder a higher percentage of company health costs.
 Ed Fire, the union's president, said that at the end of the four-year deal, G.E.'s 17,000 unionized workers would continue to pay, as they pay now, 18 percent of company health costs. "We held the line on a critical issue," said Mr. Fire, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers-Communications Workers of America. 
 Before talks began in May, the company said its goal was to have workers shoulder 30 percent of overall health costs. One G.E. official said yesterday that workers would pay 18 percent of health care costs at the end of the proposed contract, although in the second year that would temporarily climb to 19 percent.
Shortly before a Monday morning strike deadline, G.E. reached agreement with Mr. Fire's union as well as with the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America.
Early in the talks, executives at G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., argued that it was only fair for workers to absorb more of the health costs because the company's health bill soared to $1.4 billion last year, from $965 million in 1999, a 45 percent increase. The cost of health care per worker will rise to $6,500 this year, from $4,140 in 1999, the company said.
But union officials asserted that the workers should not pay a higher percentage of health costs because General Electric, one of the world's most profitable companies, earned more than $45,000 in profits per employee last year.
"The agreements provide good wages, pensions and benefits to G.E. workers while allowing our business to compete in tough markets," said William J. Conaty, G.E.'s senior vice president for human resources. "We faced difficult issues -- a challenging economy and rising health care costs -- but everyone at the table remained focused on doing the right thing for our employees and G.E."
The agreement calls for a 3 percent raise in the first year, 2.5 percent in years two and three, and 3 percent in year four. With the typical G.E. union member earning $21.70 an hour, a union flier said that at the end of four years, that union member's pay would rise by $3.52 an hour, including cost-of-living adjustments.
Other unions and companies were looking to the General Electric talks to see what pattern it would set because many companies, facing skyrocketing health costs, were pressuring their unions to shoulder a higher percentage of health outlays.
Echoing Mr. Fire, the United Automobile Workers said yesterday that it would oppose any efforts by the Big Three to shift more health care costs to their 292,000 auto workers.
Ron Gettelfinger, the union's president, said at a Detroit news conference that his union would not agree to such cost shifting in contract talks next month with General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. The companies' four-year contracts expire on Sept. 14. 
G.E. and Mr. Fire said that while the percentage workers contributed to health costs would remain the same, employee payments for health premiums would rise during the contract, with G.E. predicting that its health costs would rise by at least 30 percent over the four-year contract. The union's delegates are to vote on the contract today, with members of individual locals scheduled to vote early next week.
In a flier sent to union members, the International Union of Electronic Workers said that the settlement would cost the company $1.7 billion over four years and that the typical worker would receive $15,272 more in net pay over four years, after accounting for higher health outlays.
"Small premium increases for members and their families will be more than offset by a wage and cost-of-living package that is considerably higher than other recent national contract settlements," the flier said.

HEADLINE: Venting at Rent Hearing Is Long, Loud and Personal 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
One after another, the landlords and the tenants in New York City's vast and byzantine rent-regulated world marched to the microphone yesterday at Cooper Union and offered their opinions about the largest rent increases since 1989.
 Woefully inadequate: That is what landlords like Christopher Athineos said about the increases of up to 8.5 percent recommended by the city's Rent Guidelines Board for the one million apartments under rent stabilization. Double-digit increases, Mr. Athineos said, would be more equitable for landlords who have shouldered soaring insurance and property taxes. "Anywhere in this country, the free market works," he said. 
 Criminally steep: That is what tenants like Judy Cheng said about the predicament that her retired parents, who have a combined income of $850 a month, would face if they had to pay more than their current rent, $600 a month. A reduction or a freeze, she suggested, would be more appropriate. "Why don't we evict landlords?" she said, to raucous applause.
And so the verbal sparring went, from early morning until late evening, as dozens of speakers tried to sway the nine members of the board in the first, last and only public hearing before a final vote on Thursday.
On May 5, the board tentatively approved rent increases of 5.5 percent for one-year leases and 8.5 percent for two-year leases, citing a surge in property taxes and fuel and insurance costs. The board has sometimes altered its initial recommendations in the final vote, though usually on the order of only a percentage point or two.
But for all the passion and heartache yesterday from people like Mr. Athineos and Ms. Cheng, the consensus was that the hearing was a bit more muted or even somber than in years past for one very big reason: many people were distracted by what was happening in Albany.
There, state leaders passed special legislation yesterday, for the third time in a week, to keep the rent laws from lapsing. The laws, which were last modified in 1997, were to expire at midnight on Sunday, but the Democratic-led Assembly and the Republican-led Senate have been at odds over the issue of vacancy decontrol, which allows landlords to eliminate rent regulations on vacated apartments after the monthly rent reaches $2,000.
The new deadline is today. But many landlords, tenants and legislators believe that Albany may not reach a deal until Thursday, the last day of the session. They are increasingly cynical about whether Albany will have the political will to overhaul the laws. That cynicism has been directed toward the city's rent board, as well.
State Senator Carl Kruger, Democrat of Brooklyn, seemed to tap into a sense of futility when he told the rent board yesterday, "Year after year, this board, with reckless disregard of the facts, has moved forward with an agenda -- an agenda that says that the tenant can drop dead, and the landlord has to survive."
His comments elicited thunderous applause from the tenant-dominated crowd of more than 200 people.
Mr. Kruger continued, "If that is not vaudeville, that's a kangaroo court."
Of the city's three million dwelling units, about two million are occupied by renters, though nationally only about a third of dwellings are rental units. Of the city's two million rental units, about one million are stabilized units subject to the board's decisions. About 350,000 more are rent-controlled apartments, public housing and other government-related residences, while only 650,000 units are not regulated, according to the Rent Guidelines Board.
Every spring, the board wrestles with how much to change rents for the million regulated apartments. For the better part of the last decade, rents have risen by a few percentage points, in keeping with low inflation. Last year, for instance, the board approved increases of 2 percent for one-year leases, and 4 percent for two-year leases, though the price index of operating costs, which summarizes landlords' expenses, showed a decrease for the first time in history.
This year, though, the preliminary vote -- the first by a rent board appointed mainly by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- came against a bleak backdrop of budget cuts, pending tax increases, a subway fare increase, the city's struggling economy and the lingering effects of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. Hence the biggest increases in 14 years.
Besides proposing increases for apartments, the board on May 5 proposed increases on lofts of 4 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year renewals. For residential hotels, the board proposed an annual increase of 4 percent. The increases would apply to leases renewed between Oct. 1, 2003, and Sept. 30, 2004.
Many of the dozens of people who spoke in three-minute intervals yesterday were familiar faces from years past. The testimony got personal at times, as some tenants criticized the board's nine members -- two landlord representatives, two tenant representatives and five public members appointed by the mayor -- as being an elite crowd that did not represent the working class or the poor.
Some landlords offered a detailed accounting of building finances in arguing that they were the true victims of rent regulation.
J. Allison Crockett, a former Wall Street broker, said she bought a building in Brooklyn's Williamsburg section four years ago.
Of the building's 30 units, 16 rent for less than $500, she said. Her building had 70 code violations when she bought it, she said; now, it has none. But because she has been unable to raise rents to market levels, she has been late in paying her taxes.
"Did Bloomberg say everyone has to share the pain except the tenants?" she said, after being booed by the crowd. "It can't be that way. This is my retirement. This is my fixed income."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Belgium: Competition Rankings 

BYLINE:  By Paul Meller (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Europe's competition regulators rank fourth in the world, behind the United States, Germany and Britain, according to a new survey by the British trade journal Global Competition Review. The commission was considered weaker in economics than its American counterparts. 
This weakness was highlighted last year when the European Commission lost three court cases. The commission was also seen as more instinctively interventionist than the American authorities, according to the survey, which covered 500 executives, lawyers and competition officials. Last year the commission levied about 944 million euros ($1.11 billion) in antitrust fines. American officials levied $102 million in fines. American antitrust procedures, however, were regarded as less open than European procedures and more prone to political interference, the survey said. Paul Meller (NYT)

HEADLINE: Making Trinkets in China, and a Deadly Dust 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHUANG TU, China, June 15 

 BODY:
With his handsome smile and full head of black hair, Hu Zhiguo hardly looks 44, much less gravely ill. The giveaway is his wispy voice, faint from clotted lungs.
 One doctor told him he had tuberculosis. Another guessed it was cancer. The final diagnosis, based on the cumulus of gray that clouds his chest X-rays, is a severe case of silicosis, a disease Chinese workers call dust lung. 
 Mr. Hu got the illness making cheap necklaces and bracelets from iridescent stones like opal, sold by the containerload to United States retailers. Working long days at a factory in booming Guangdong Province, he probably inhaled more quartz dust in 10 years than China's own safety standards would permit in a thousand. 
Mr. Hu has now retreated to his hometown here in the rugged hills of Sichuan, where he tried, and failed, to help his wife run a dry-goods store.
"I cannot lift a bag of rice," Mr. Hu whispered one recent evening in the back of the family shop. "I am a wasted man, waiting for death."
China has emerged as Asia's leading exporter of manufactured goods to the United States, but the workers who produce those goods are victims of a surge in fatal respiratory, circulatory, neurological and digestive-tract diseases like those American and European workers suffered at the dawn of the industrial age.
China in that sense is not only recreating the industrial transformation that brought prosperity to Europe, the United States and some East Asian nations. It is also reliving its horrors.
Even by its official count, China already has more deaths from work-related illnesses than any other country or region, including the industrialized economies of the United States and Europe combined.
Last year, 386,645 Chinese workers died of occupational illnesses, according to government data compiled by the International Labor Organization.
The statistics may understate the situation in China's thriving east coast industrial centers, where tens of millions of migrant workers like Mr. Hu produce the bulk of China's exports for well under a dollar an hour without employment contracts, health care plans or union representation.
The company where Mr. Hu worked, called Lucky Gems and Jewelry, is now based at a multibuilding site in Huizhou, about two hours north of the mainland Chinese border with Hong Kong. It employs 3,000 workers, almost all of them from far away provinces, living in dormitories inside a gated campus or in the harsh residential community that lines the unpaved streets and construction sites surrounding the factory. 
Its owner, a Hong Kong businessman named Wang Shenghua, was a pioneer in bringing jewelry manufacturing to southern China in the mid-1980's, when he opened his first factory in the mainland's experimental economic zone of Shenzhen. 
With Lucky and hundreds of small-scale rival manufacturers, China dominates a labor-intensive industry once scattered widely around East Asia and the Middle East.
Lucky says it takes safety seriously. While the owner, Mr. Wang, declined a reporter's request to talk with him and visit the factory, he appointed a lawyer to answer questions about its safety record. The lawyer, Kang Ziying, said the company has always protected its workers and invested heavily in equipment to prevent workers from contracting silicosis, though he acknowledges there have been some cases of the disease among its employees.
"We have always met the government's standards for safety," Mr. Kang said. "Otherwise, they would not let us operate." 
Mr. Hu was a 30-year-old peasant farmer eager to earn a worker's wage when he left his home in northern Sichuan in 1990. He traveled for four days, by train and bus, to Shenzhen. There, he landed a job at Lucky, introduced to the company by a distant relative.
He learned how to cut and sand semiprecious stones like opal, topaz and malachite into hearts, stars, pearls, and diamond shapes that are strung together to make rings, bracelets and necklaces.
Mr. Hu sat shoulder to shoulder with other cutters and polishers in confined workshops. Often working 12- and even 18-hours days, they generated clouds of dust that hung in the air even when windows were wide open and the fans were set to high.
"It was always like dusk inside the factory, no matter how much sunlight there was outside," he said. "It was like a heavy fog. We got used to it."
By the late 1990's, Mr. Hu began having trouble climbing stairs and lifting rocks. He came to dread winter, when a common head cold caused prolonged torment. "If I walked quickly, I would run out of breath right away. If I got a cold, I felt like I was suffocating," he said.
If anyone at Lucky was aware of the risks that workers might acquire diseases from exposure to quartz dust, Mr. Hu says that information was not shared with him. Local doctors first told him he might have tuberculosis, then lung cancer. By late 1999, he felt too weak to continue and took a low-paying job selling fruit on the muddy street in front of the factory. 
A short time later, when numerous colleagues began developing similar symptoms, Mr. Hu joined them on bus trips to the provincial capital, Guangzhou, to seek a diagnosis. There, a doctor at a hospital that specializes in occupational diseases suspected that jewelry workers might be developing silicosis in large numbers.
The pulmonary ailment comes from overexposure to silicon dioxide trapped in quartz, minerals, rocks and sand. Though it is one of the oldest known occupational diseases, it has only recently become a priority for Chinese authorities, who now consider it a leading work-related illness.
Despite what Lucky workers described as a campaign by the company to deny the problem, provincial authorities eventually ordered all of Lucky's workers to undergo X-ray exams. How many workers showed signs of the disease is uncertain. At least 50 people claim to have fallen sick at Lucky. What is clear is that the company began battling dozens of workers over medical claims, while installing equipment to improve ventilation.
Mr. Kang, the lawyer, said some of the people seeking compensation were fakers and opportunists who either never worked there or who did not really have chronic illnesses. He acknowledged that the company invested $1 million to improve ventilation at the factory after 2001, but said those were not the first steps the company had taken to clean up the work environment.
Workers tell a different story. In the shadows of the Huizhou plant, where the ear-splitting whine of stonecutting machines pierces the air, about two dozen old friends and colleagues of Mr. Hu rent tiny rooms in restaurants, shops and private homes. They spend their days petitioning the government and gathering evidence to use against the company in court.
"Our boss cares only about the money in his pocket," said Liu Huaquan, a 39-year-old former craftsman at Lucky. In 2001, he was the first worker at the company to have silicosis formally diagnosed, but he is still fighting for compensation.
"You would think he could share a small part of his profits with the workers who got sick," Mr. Liu said. "But he uses his money to deny that we exist."
Two former Lucky managers, Chen Xingfu and Yuan Tianhui, say that shortly after they were told they had silicosis, Lucky demoted them, cut their salaries in half and assigned them to haul rocks to and from a warehouse. The demotions, both men said, were intended to force them to leave the company so it would not be obligated to pay their medical expenses. 
They said they resigned because their silicosis made it impossible to do heavy manual labor. They are now suing. Mr. Kang, the company lawyer, said their demotions were performance related.
The company has denied compensation to others who worked for Lucky before 1997, the year the company opened its Huizhou plant. Lucky's old Shenzhen factory has no legal tie to Lucky even though it had the same owner and many of the same workers, the company argued in court.
The Huizhou factory does appear to have improved internal air quality, though workers said the main ventilation system was installed only after the first cases of silicosis were confirmed. Work stations now have vacuum tubes to suck up dust, which is spewed outside through exhaust valves. A light frost of silica crystals covers the factory grounds.
Even so, stonecutters and sanders can be easily spotted at the end of the work day because their company-issued navy blue crew shirts have turned gray from the dust.
The factory failed a safety inspection by the Huizhou Center for Disease Control as recently as last summer. The center's report shows that some work stations had ambient silica concentrations as high as 70 times the standard allowed by the Chinese safety code, which is less strict than related American and European standards by a factor of 20.
Lucky rejected the results of that inspection and arranged a new test by another safety agency last October, which it passed. Workers say the company, informed in advance of the inspection, shut down some work stations before inspectors arrived. The company denies that.
Any improvements came too late for Mr. Hu. Doctors eventually confirmed that he had third-degree silicosis, the most severe form, and he was told that the only way to extend his life was to stop working.
He stayed in Huizhou for two years, living on borrowed money, to force the company to pay his medical expenses. It refused, but eventually agreed to a one-time settlement proposed by the Huizhou government that gave Mr. Hu 200,000 yuan, about $25,000. He returned home. 
Half a year later, most of the money is gone. Mr. Hu spent several thousand dollars to open a small grocery to generate income. But he found he could not even stock the shelves without collapsing from exhaustion. When he began coughing up blood this spring, he turned the store over to his wife. 
Mr. Hu said he had spent most of the severance on hospital visits and intravenous injections of glucose and sodium chloride, which help relieve the pressure on his chest. 
One day last week he called his 16-year-old son to his bedside and told the boy that he had to find a job instead of attending high school as planned.
"I am on the threshold of death and this family must have income," Mr. Hu said. "He cried when I told him and I cried, too. But we are going to run out of money in a few months. There is no other way."

HEADLINE: Canada Builds a Large Oil Estimate on Sand 

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
This year's rankings of oil reserves included a surprise that grabbed the attention of some industry experts: Canada had leaped into second place, increasing its reserves from 5 billion barrels to 180 billion barrels.
 The rankings, both private and government, are far from scientific. In this case, the new assessment of Canada's reserves was promoted by a Canadian energy trade group and, upon further examination, turned out to be highly questionable. 
 Canada's case is not unusual, oil industry experts say. Much of the oil reserve data from other countries also comes from oil producers and their industry allies, who have a stake in painting a rosy picture. Yet the reliability of oil data is crucial because of the fundamental role oil plays in American energy and foreign policy. 
One expert who seized on the Canadian numbers was Daniel Yergin, the author of "The Prize," a respected history of the oil industry.
Canada's jump could have had important implications for President Bush's quest to reduce American dependence on unstable oil suppliers: the 175 billion barrels represent more than 50 years worth of American consumer gasoline consumption. 
"Although almost completely overlooked, something very important has just happened," Dr. Yergin told a Senate committee in April, namely, "a significant decline in the Persian Gulf's share of total world oil reserves," the first such decline in 60 years.
Canada's new ranking and Dr. Yergin's analysis prompted the Energy Department to undertake a study of the potential of Canada's oil sands, according to a senior department official. The sands are impregnated with oil, but extracting that oil is a much more difficult and expensive process than traditional drilling. 
The study may discover what Canadian officials and petroleum experts have said in interviews: Canada's proven reserves are not as high as the 180 billion barrels listed in the rankings.
The new Canadian estimate, which was greatly increased by counting so much of the oil sands as reserves for the first time, grew out of a 1999 study by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board.
Andy Burrowes, a board official, said that estimate was based on "a lot of guesswork." It will be revised next year after a more rigorous examination.
The number was not adopted by private or governmental rankings until late last year, when the Oil and Gas Journal, at the urging of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, included it in its annual listing of world oil and gas reserves. That, in turn, led the Energy Information Administration, the independent analytical arm of the United States Energy Department, to adopt the figure. 
Matthew Simmons, a Houston investment banker for the energy industry who has advised President Bush's campaign and the secretary of energy, says that many widely used oil references significantly overstate the amount of oil, leading to flawed decisions.
For example, he said oil prices plummeted in the late 1990's after the International Energy Agency's widely followed monthly oil market report said that hundreds of millions of barrels of oil were missing from the world's oil markets.
"The so-called missing barrels of the I.E.A. led to the a widely held belief of a massive oil glut," Mr. Simmons said, adding that "a major industry was on the verge of collapse, all because of bad data."
Moreover, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which helped persuade Dr. Yergin and the Oil and Gas Journal to adopt the 180 billion barrel figure, lists Canada's oil reserves at just 12 billion barrels, because, officials there said, it uses a more conservative methodology for its own publications.
Dr. Yergin, in an interview, said that efforts to measure Canada's reserves were complicated by the inclusion of oil sands, but that his consulting company "based the reserve number on the reporting Canadian body." He added, "There are standards, but no world supreme court or global accounting body for determining reserves."
In "The Prize," Dr. Yergin pointed out how thelack of "timely, credible, reliable, widely accepted data" was a significant cause of oil price spikes in 1979.
The Bush administration backs an international effort for a more "comprehensive and timely world oil data reporting system" under the auspices of the International Energy Forum. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham recently announced American support for the forum's new permanent offices in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
"I favor more transparency on oil data," said the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, in an interview in Riyadh earlier this year, adding that "we need better data on production and supply."
But Mr. Naimi demurred when asked whether Saudi Arabia would publish production data field by field, which oil experts say would shed light on how fast Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, the world's largest, are being depleted.
"I'm not in favor," he said. "It allows you to figure out reserves."
Some people say that reluctance calls out for more stringent reporting standards.
"There's a tremendous lag" in publication of Saudi production numbers because "they are not very transparent," said Edward Porter, research manager of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. He said that "this is an area that is in desperate need for some standardization," but "there is not a lot of progress being made."
So, for now, global energy markets and the news media, including The New York Times, rely largely on public and private databases, and their limits are illustrated by Canada's sudden rise to second place.
Marilyn Radler, the journalist responsible for the listing in the Oil and Gas Journal, said she included the 175 billion barrels in oil sands reserves estimate, which originates with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, after the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers endorsed it.
"CAPP presented the figure to me," Ms. Radler said in an e-mail message, and "CAPP uses this estimate and considers it to accurately represent the volume that is recoverable using current technology and present and anticipated economic conditions."
Gregory Stringham, CAPP's vice president, said, "We were pushing for it to be used," and "Now that it is there, it's more real."
Cal Hill, the executive manager of the Alberta energy board's resources branch, said a new, more authoritative estimate would be completed next year. The 175 billion "likely is in the ball park," he said, "but it doesn't meet the strict definition of a reserve."
Harry Jung, the chairman of the reserves definition committee for the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, said that "the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board is talking about resources, not reserves" because "you can't classify future projects without any immediate plans for development as a reserve."

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM SOUTH AMERICA; 
Now the Dirtiest of Wars Won't Be Forgotten

BYLINE:  By Larry Rohter 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 17 

 BODY:
In an inaugural address notable for its promise of change, it was President Nestor Kirchner's insistence that he intended to exercise power "without rancor but with memory" that most struck Argentines. "I am part of a decimated generation," he said, referring to the victims of the 1976-83 military dictatorship here, "and I do not believe in the axiom that when you govern you trade convictions for pragmatism."
 In less than a month in office, Mr. Kirchner has proved as good as his word, forcing the long-dormant issue of justice for the estimated 30,000 people who disappeared during that "dirty war" to center stage. Not only has he purged the military high command, he has also announced his willingness to allow the extradition of human rights violators wanted in other countries and made it clear that he wants the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a series of amnesty laws and pardons that have been in effect for more than a decade. 
 The new government's determination has left the relatives of the disappeared and human rights groups here and abroad surprised, gratified and even a bit baffled. Mr. Kirchner, a 53-year-old Peronist who became president by default when former President Carlos Saul Menem withdrew from a runoff vote, has acute political instincts and would seem to gain nothing by picking at a scab that refuses to heal.
"You are not going to win an election in Argentina by invoking or using these issues," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch in Washington. With the country still struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis in its history, he added, "human rights questions are not at the top of the agenda, or even popular."
"On the contrary," he said.
But Mr. Kirchner seems to be responding to a growing clamor for what is known here as "an end to impunity." That means honesty, accountability and transparency in government and the liquidation of a system of privileges and corruption that has allowed the relatives, friends and political associates of those in power to steal and even kill without fearing the consequences.
In the presidential election, two other candidates who performed strongly also emphasized the importance of probity in power. One, Elisa Carrio, was on the left, while the other, Ricardo Lopez Murphy, was on the right. But like Mr. Kirchner they came of age during the military dictatorship and have emphasized clean government and the rule of law.
"This is not just any generation" that is coming to power for the first time in the person of Mr. Kirchner, said Horacio Verbitsky, a prominent writer and human rights campaigner here. "It is one that wanted to change this country, rebelled against what was rotten, made mistakes, paid dearly for them and after all that still wants to govern on an ethical basis."
The devastation inflicted on that generation, and on Argentina, by the dirty war is hard to overstate. A large proportion of the 30,000 who "disappeared" were bright and idealistic young people who were often singled out because they were leaders, and therefore the most threatening.
As a result, the long-term damage done to Argentina far surpassed that in neighboring countries like Brazil, Uruguay and even Chile. Argentines complain of a lack of fresh and capable leaders in their country and look enviously at the new government in Brazil. But the harsh reality is that Brazil's left-leaning president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and his advisers would probably have been killed had they lived here.
To redress the terrible wrongs, Mr. Kirchner, a former student radical who was briefly jailed himself by the dictatorship and had friends disappear, must overcome society's resistance and indifference. During the mid-1970's, the obelisk here that is Argentina's equivalent of the Washington Monument was draped with a large banner containing the Orwellian phrase "Silence is health," and even today there are those who talk approvingly of a campaign to perpetuate that silence.
"It's not by chance that television, with its mass audience, hasn't touched this subject, because it is a forbidden theme there, even though a mini-series would draw high ratings," said Marcelo Pineyro, the director of "Kamchatka," a recently released movie that tells the story of a family forced into hiding in the early days of the dictatorship. "The French have examined their own behavior during the Nazi occupation, but we haven't done the equivalent here because there are still forces in society that don't want that to happen."
With the passage of time, the events of "The Process," as the dictatorship liked to call itself, are also starting to fade into history. There is now a whole generation of people in their 20's and 30's who grew up under democracy, were educated in schools that step gingerly around the dirty war, and thus know relatively little about what happened and may not even care.
After the dictatorship fell, Argentina's civilian government started with great energy to identify and punish those responsible, convoking an investigatory commission and putting members of the military junta on trial. But then as now, the country was soon plunged into a series of economic and political crises and the focus of attention shifted.
By the time Raul Alfonsin left office in 1989, a pair of laws decreeing an amnesty for human rights violators had been approved, followed by Mr. Menem's pardon of those found guilty in the earlier trials. The statute known as "the law of due obedience" went so far as to put into effect the defense that had been rejected at Nuremberg: "I was only following orders."
Both laws were "extorted with a bayonet at our throats and a gun to our chest," said Estela de Carlotto, a director of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a leading human rights group here. As a result, Argentina was never able to finish confronting its past and settle accounts in the manner that Mr. Kirchner and others clearly yearn for.
"So long as justice is not obtained and we do not know what happened, this is not just an issue of the past," Mrs. de Carlotto said. "We are also talking about the present."

HEADLINE: Ex-Pataki Aide to Lead Trade Center Rebuilding 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Kevin M. Rampe, a lawyer and former aide to Gov. George E. Pataki who also represented Kuwait in claims against Iraq stemming from the Persian Gulf war in 1991, was appointed yesterday to lead the agency overseeing redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
 Mr. Rampe was appointed president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation by Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg roughly 15 weeks after he was named interim president of the agency. He replaced Louis R. Tomson, a longtime Pataki aide who retired at the end of February. 
 Mr. Rampe's appointment to the permanent position came after weeks of wrangling by Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, who are at odds on several points concerning the future of Lower Manhattan. Each man has his eye on the $1.3 billion in federal money that remains in the development corporation's accounts: Mr. Bloomberg for housing and other development projects in his own plan for downtown and Mr. Pataki for transportation and other uses that he has set as priorities.
Both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg praised Mr. Rampe yesterday as someone who has been involved in the redevelopment effort almost since it began. Before joining the development corporation in February 2002 as an executive vice president and general counsel, Mr. Rampe was first deputy superintendent and chief operating officer of the New York State Insurance Department. And before joining the Pataki administration in 1996, Mr. Rampe was a litigator at Shearman & Sterling, where he represented Kuwait in its claims of environmental and health damage against Iraq. 
Yesterday, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation also released the draft versions of two documents. The first, the general project plan, lays out the objective and methods of the redevelopment plan, as well as duties of the development corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The corporation also issued a document known as the "draft scope" for the environmental impact analysis. That document offers details on the planning of the rebuilding effort, estimated to take 15 years, and the conditions to be studied in the environmental impact analysis.
According to the document, the study will assess the environmental impact of redeveloping the World Trade Center site into the mixed-use center envisioned in Daniel Libeskind's plan, and will compare that impact with current conditions at the site and with what was there before Sept. 11, 2001. 
Twopublic meetings for discussion of the documents and the environmental study are planned for July 23 at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. The meetings are scheduled for 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Written comments can be sent directly to the development corporation through Aug. 4. Development corporation officials said the documents would be posted on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com.

HEADLINE: Bushworld And Hillaryland 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Once toast in this town, Hillary Rodham Clinton is now the toast of the town. (Or at least the Venus part.)
 At a Clintonista deja vu party last night, Hillary was honored for her sensational debut as the fastest-selling nonfiction author ever. (More than Howard Stern even.) 
 The Mars brigade stormed a Bush-Cheney re-election fund-raising kick-off at the Washington Hilton -- $2,000 a head for hot dogs, burgers and nachos. The White House wants fat cats to pony up $170 million for the run -- a small price to pay for the cut in taxes on dividend income.
The 1,200 Bush donors and White House motorcades snarled evening traffic downtown, perhaps a Machiavellian attempt to prevent Hillary doters from making their way out to the Maryland manse of Lissa Muscatine for Hillary's party.
Ms. Muscatine was chief speechwriter for Hillary when she was first lady, and part of the team that toiled for two years helping the senator stitch together her own account of her own life. With le tout hacks, flacks and Hill pols eager to munch on miniature sirloin burgers and Champagne, many guests were discouraged from bringing spouses. (A celebration of a book about marital rifts should not cause them.)
Even with her "spouse problem," as she wryly refers to it in her book, Hillary's polls have shot up since the publication of her sisterhood-is-powerful political manifesto, cleverly masquerading as confessional victim and self-actualization literature.
Once Hillary was in the White House, besieged with questions about deception and secrecy, and beset by cascading investigations.
Now, George W. Bush is in the White House, besieged with questions about deception and secrecy, and beset by cascading investigations.
This president has weapons of mass destruction problems, whereas the last president had weapons of massself-destruction problems.
W. must persuade doubters why he knew Saddam was an imminent threat before he made a pre-emptive move on Iraq, even as Hillary must persuade doubters why she did not know that Monica was an imminent threat who made a pre-emptive move on Bill. (If only a drum of chemicals were as easy to spot as a black thong.)
With her book, Senator Clinton is dropping a handkerchief in the 2008 race, signaling another amazing roundelay between the two first families of American politics, the fancy Republicans who strain to be common folk, and the Democratic common folk who strain to be fancy.
The Bushies dismissed the Clintons as "means justify the ends" types, who did as they liked and left a mess for others to clean up.
The Clintons saw themselves as audacious warriors for good, ingeniously grappling with intractable problems like health care.
Now the Democrats want to hold open hearings to see if the Bushies are "means justify the ends" types, who did as they liked and left a mess for others to clean up.
The Bushies see themselves as audacious warriors for good, ingeniously grappling with intractable problems like remaking the Arab world.
Just as the Bushies think Mr. Clinton dropped the ball on Osama and terrorism, the Clintons think the Bushies dropped it on the economy and the disenfranchised. And don't get either side started on Whitewater and Halliburton.
In her book, Hillary writes that the right wing considered her husband illegitimate, then goes on to imply that Mr. Bush is, saying of William Rehnquist: "As the country would later learn in the election-deciding case of Bush v. Gore, his lifetime tenure as a Supreme Court Justice did not inhibit his ideological or partisan zeal."
Just as Bushworld is a macho preserve with a tight uber-loyal circle, so Hillaryland is a female preserve with a tight uber-loyal circle.
Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Newt Gingrich and others have been trying to banish the if-it-feels-good-do-it, McGovernick, hippie ethos of the 60's. In her book, Hillary defends the era: "Some contemporary writers and politicians have tried to dismiss the anguish of those years as an embodiment of 1960s self-indulgence. In fact, there are some people who would like to rewrite history to erase the legacy of the war and the social upheaval it spawned. They would have us believe that the debate was frivolous, but that's not how I remember it."
Yup, she's running, and if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.

HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates Assail Bush Across a Wide Spectrum 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards today denounced President Bush's tax-cut program as the "most radical and dangerous economic theory to hit our shores since Socialism." Mr. Edwards, a Democratic presidential candidate, proposed his own program of lower- and middle-income tax cuts, to be financed by rolling back Mr. Bush's tax cuts for wealthiest Americans.
 Mr. Edwards, in a speech that bristled with the populist language that has come to characterize his campaign for president, said Mr. Bush's policy was designed to cut taxes on unearned income, such as capital gains and dividends, and shift more of the tax burden onto regular wages. 
 To counteract that, Mr. Edwards proposed exemptions on some capital gains and dividends taxes paid by lower- and middle-income families, , a tax credit of up to $5,000 on first-time home purchases, and a subsidized retirement savings account program for lower-wage earners. He said the proposals would cost $160 billion over 10 years.
"It's time to end the failed conservative experiment and return to the idea that made this country what it is," Senator Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, said in a speech to business students at Georgetown University this afternoon. "Instead of helping wealthy people protect their wealth, we should help people build wealth." 
Mr. Edwards, referring to the Bush administration, said, "Their economic vision has one simple goal: to get rid of unearned income and shift the tax burden onto people who work." He said, "This crowd wants a world where the only people who pay taxes are people who work hard for a living."
Mr. Edwards's speech came on a day when Democratic candidates were delivering remarks on all kinds of topics in all kinds of places.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, speaking to a group of moderate Democrats, the New Democrat Network, in Washington, also attacked Mr. Bush's economic policies, saying they had contributed to rising poverty in the country. Mr. Lieberman promised that if elected he would reduce the rate of poverty in his first term to the lowest in the nation's history, though he offered scant details of how he would accomplish that. 
"The Bush administration has mounted an unprecedented attack on the federal safety net of poor Americans," Mr. Lieberman said, adding, "When a million of our neighbors fall into poverty in the first year of the Bush presidency, that is a real scandal."
In California, Representative Richard A. Gephardt called for making the United States independent of foreign oil supplies within a decade, and offered a blistering attack on Saudi Arabia, according to a transcript of his prepared remarks released by his office in Washington.
"The president is right to begin withdrawing American troops from Saudi Arabia," Mr. Gephardt of Missouri said. "But what good will it do if our government remains shackled to Saudi oil producers? That's why this administration tolerated Saudi silence when we struck back against the Taliban. It's why this administration never spoke out about the clear evidence that Saudi citizens were funding Al Qaeda."
The White House tonight declined to comment on the Democratic critiques.
The speech by Mr. Edwards today echoed, if with a sharper edge, the language and proposals of Bill Clinton in 1992 and served as a reminder of the extent to which Mr. Edwards is modeling his campaign after the one his fellow Southerner ran more than a decade ago.
Two of Mr. Clinton's top White House advisers -- Gene Sperling, who was one of Mr. Clinton's senior economic advisers, and Bruce Reed, his domestic policy adviser -- helped Mr. Edwards draft the speech. And he delivered it on the same campus where Mr. Clinton sought to define himself through early speeches.
Mr. Edwards' speech came at a time when even some of his supporters have been expressing concern about his low standing in polls in early primary states. It presented what was probably the most extensive tax-cut plan offered by any of the Democratic candidates, as well as some of the toughest-worded attacks on the president.
"America is not a nation of kings and commoners, masters and servants," Mr. Edwards said to his audience, which sat in silence until he had completed his speech.
Mr. Edwards took aim at Mr. Bush's political values and ethics. He said that Mr. Bush tonight began a fund-raising tour that would bring in "special-interest money more quickly than any administration ever."

HEADLINE: Decision Seen Soon on Maker Of Calvin Klein Women's Line 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The battle for America's women's clothing market is heating up.
 As early as today, Phillips-Van Heusen, the new owner of the Calvin Klein business, will announce the producer of its new Klein sportswear for women set to appear next year in major department stores. Phillips predicts annual sales will eventually reach $1 billion. 
 Yesterday, Phillips was keeping mum. But retailing executives and analysts following the situation said the front-runner was Kellwood, with the Jones Apparel Group still in the running for the license, potentially worth millions of dollars a year to the company chosen to oversee manufacturing and distribution of the line. 
Kellwood? Jones?
Kellwood, a clothing marketer and manufacturer based in Chesterfield, Mo., is hardly a household name. But, in fact, with annual revenue of more than $2 billion, it is one of the largest apparel companies in the world. Kellwood owns Sag Harbor ($600 million annual sales) and 13 other clothing companies, and holds licenses for segments of Emme, Gerber, Nautica, Oscar de la Renta and Liz Claiborne, to mention a few of its 25 apparel licensing agreements.
And Jones, perhaps best known through its branded Jones New York apparel, is double the size of Kellwood in terms of annual sales, and owns Easy Spirit, Nine West, Gloria Vanderbilt and many more labels.
At first glance, the two seem miles apart.
According to the industry stereotype, Kellwood makes clothes for department stores like Macy's and discount merchants like T. J. Maxx and Kohl's, while Jones is known for its own labels and, until recently -- and painfully -- as thelicensee for Polo Ralph Lauren's lucrative Lauren line.
Yet within the last six years, Jones has quietly been diversifying its holdings by reaching lower into the market to snap up a series of budget shoe, accessories and sportswear lines. Meanwhile, Kellwood has been striving upward, with its pursuit of the likes of Emme and now, its efforts to capture the new Calvin Klein line. 
"They come from different places, but they're ending up in the same place," said Marshal Cohen, a senior retailing analyst with NPD, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. 
But because the retailing business has been so enamored of acquisitions lately -- Tommy Hilfiger recently announced that it, too, would be prowling for companies to buy -- Kellwood and Jones are now bumping heads in the takeover market. "Everyone is in an acquisition mode now." Mr. Cohen said, "So they end up competing for the same businesses."
Jones hit the mainstream news media this spring with its feud with Polo over the $548 million-a-year Lauren license, which Polo claimed was its to take back, a premise Jones disagreed with -- and still disagrees with. (And it has now sued to prove it in court.) Nonetheless, after intense negotiations, Jones just handed the license back to Polo, leaving Polo to scramble to produce it for spring, and leaving Jones with a major hole in its empire.
"It's natural they're in a panic," Kellwood's chief executive, Hal J. Upbin, said in an interview this week. "They've got to fill a big void." Peter Boneparth, Jones's chief executive, refused to be drawn into a slugging match with Kellwood or to show panic. Despite a run of acquisitions that last year alone totaled $400 million, Mr. Boneparth said, "I'm not opposed to ending the year with a lot of money -- it's not like it's burning a hole in our pocket."
Industry executives and analysts say Kellwood appears to have the inside edge on the Calvin Klein license, partly because of Mr. Boneparth's role in the messy Jones-Polo divorce. "Who would feel comfortable doing business with him after he filed a $550 million lawsuit?" said Jennifer Black, a retailing analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. 
This is not the first time Jones and Kellwood have gone head-to-head. Just last week, Kellwood appeared to win out on the purchase of Kasper ASL, a company operating under bankruptcy protection. Kellwood's bid was accepted -- tentatively -- with a $151 million cash-and-stock bid for Kasper and its potentially lucrative brand name, Anne Klein. But published reports have suggested that Jones may jump into renewed bidding, permitted under the bankruptcy provisions.
And Jones is the company most frequently linked with Hilfiger. Reports that Jones wanted to buy the troubled Hilfiger company were rife in the spring, with Kellwood's name briefly mentioned as a potential spoiler. Although Tommy Hilfiger himself subsequently vowed to remain independent, with the Lauren business gone, talk of a Hilfiger purchase by Jones has resumed. But several executives who work for the companies said a deal was still unlikely with either Jones or Kellwood. 
Mr. Upbin of Kellwood, at 64 the elder of the two men, seems delighted with the new glare of publicity.
"We're in the buzz -- you got it!" he said on Monday. "And we don't mind more buzz."
Mr. Boneparth, 43, the chief executive at Jones Apparel since May 2002, seems less delighted.
"I'm completely indifferent whether I'm in the news or not," he said yesterday. "I could live the rest of my life without ever being in print, but I realize it's part of my job."
In recent years, more and more clothing companies have acted like hungry jungle creatures, devouring every small company in sight. Mr. Upbin says his company, which made its first acquisition in 1985 with Cape Cod-Cricket Lane, has ramped up its acquisitions the last five years in response to the consolidation pressures in the declining apparel economy. 
Increasingly, only the strong survive. Paul R. Charron, chairman of Liz Claiborne, is generally praised for bringing Claiborne back from the edge, largely through the purchase of more than 30 other brands. VF, another giant apparel company, which was also named as a potential Hilfiger suitor, grew from a lingerie company to a healthy marketer of jeans and other clothing lines. 
Then there is Kellwood, which just announced its tentative deal with Kasper. That, and the hoped-for Klein license, reflect Kellwood's up-market aspirations.
Jones, meanwhile, is leaning in the opposite direction. In 1997, Jones's sales came 90 percent from "better" apparel -- higher-priced clothing that is still cheaper than designers' collections. The other 10 percent was Jones New York stores.
But in the company's projections for 2003, Jones has only 34 percent of its clothing in the "better" segment. A nearly equal share is expected to come from "moderate" apparel, like its Gloria Vanderbilt label. Retailing -- Nine West stores and outlets, and Jones New York and other brand outlets -- is to make up 15 percent. And 20 percent of Jones's business is now devoted to shoes and accessories.
Whatever happens with the Calvin Klein's women's license, Mr. Boneparth will have his hands full. He is developing a new Jones New York "lifestyle" line to compete directly with the lost Lauren license -- at 15 to 25 percent lower prices.
And that, as much as the combat with Kellwood, seems to have energized Mr. Boneparth. The loss of the Lauren line has "actually had an uplifting effect," he said. "People like to win, and there's now a competitive spirit around here, which I think is healthy."

HEADLINE: Bush Raises $3.5 Million for His Re-election Campaign 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
President Bush kicked off his re-election campaign tonight with a fund-raiser that took in an estimated $3.5 million from a hotel ballroom full of people with a personal, financial or ideological stake in keeping him and the Republican Party in power.
 Nearly 200 co-chairmen of the event, each of whom promised to raise up to $20,000 selling tickets to the $2,000-a-person reception, mingled with more than 1,000 other supporters who were served hot dogs, hamburgers and nachos while hearing Mr. Bush begin making a case for four more years in the White House. 
 "Your support is laying the groundwork for a strong nationwide effort next year," Mr. Bush told his audience. "Your support is going to help us achieve a strong nationwide victory." 
Saying the political season "will come in its own time," Mr. Bush cast himself as focused on "the people's business" but made clear he would run on his record in the fight on terrorism and on his efforts to revive the sluggish economy. "On issue after issue we acted on principle," he said in his half-hour speech. "We kept our word. And we made progress for the American people."
The fund-raiser was the first of seven Mr. Bush is to hold in the next two weeks, a period of concentrated money solicitation that the re-election campaign expects will put at least $20 million in the bank.
Tonight's take of $3.5 million -- by some accounts the largest amount on record for a single campaign fundraising event -- is likely to be surpassed by a reception in New York next week that is expected to bring in at least $4 million.
The White House said today that Mr. Bush would hold three more fund-raisers in July, two in Texas and one in Michigan. Vice President Dick Cheney and Laura Bush are also hitting the road in the coming weeks as part of a plan to raise $170 million or more, breaking the record of $100 million Mr. Bush set in 2000.
Tonight's reception, at the Washington Hilton Hotel, had a guest list that included nearly every Republican lobbyist, fund-raiser and former government official in town. The names of the co-chairmen on the invitation ranged from Kenneth W. Starr, the former independent counsel, to Kenneth J. Kies, a prominent tax lobbyist, to Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff in the Reagan White House.
Republicans involved in the campaign said White House officials had some concern about the event being portrayed as Mr. Bush milking interest groups and lobbyists for cash.
While the event was attended by more than 1,000 people, the White House kept most journalists out, instead allowing access only to a small "pool" of reporters typically used when space is limited or when security is a concern.
Mr. Bush's potential Democratic rivals, struggling to raise a fraction of the money that the president seems certain to amass, kept up their portrayal of the administration as a tool of the groups that contributed to the campaign. 
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a Democratic presidential candidate who has relied on trial lawyers for his fund-raising, suggested that the Republicans were focused on the needs of corporations, saying "a president and vice president who have doled out special privilege more quickly than any administration ever will begin a two-week sprint to collect, in return, more special interest money more quickly than any administration ever."
Several Republicans said that the sheer number of people who had pledged to raise money for tonight's event meant that it was harder to find donors who had not already agreed to give money to the campaign. As a result, they said, fund-raisers were forced to go deeper into their Rolodexes and try to expand the pool of people willing to give money to Mr. Bush.
One fund-raiser said he had sold $2,000 tickets to people from California, Illinois, Delaware and Wisconsin, as well as to people on the regular Washington fund-raising circuit. 
Republicans said the Bush fund-raising operation was looking well beyond the $2,000 donors who attend presidential receptions. They said that since Mr. Bush became president, the Republican Party had received nearly 900,000 donations, most of them contributing less than $100, indicating a breadth of support that extends past the business executives and investors who make up the bulk of the big-money donor list.
A war chest of $170 million or more would allow the campaign to begin advertising on television later this year at a time when the Democratic candidates are battling among themselves, and to continue to advertise next spring and summer, when the Democratic nominee is likely to be all but out of money following the primaries.
It could also help pay for an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort, which many strategists say helped propel the party to its strong showing in the 2002 Congressional elections and is intended to counter the support Democrats typically get from labor unions. 
Republicans involved in the Bush campaign said it was too early to decide how to use the money, though they suggested that a bigger portion would go to get-out-the-vote efforts and a smaller part to television commercials than is typical for a presidential race.
"We believe strongly in the ground game," said one Republican who is involved in the campaign.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: FOOTNOTES; 
Word That U.S. Doubted Iraq Would Use Deadly Gas

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
American intelligence analysts reported to the Bush administration last year that Saddam Hussein's government had begun to deploy chemical weapons but that Baghdad would almost certainly not use them unless the government's survival was at stake, United States officials said today.
 In a wide-ranging report in November, the Defense Intelligence Agency said it was unlikely that Iraq would use unconventional weapons as long as there were United Nations sanctions against the country. President Saddam Hussein would turn to the weapons only "in extreme circumstances," the D.I.A. report concluded, "because their use would confirm Iraq's evasion of U.N. restrictions," according to the report, portions of which were read to a reporter by an intelligence official. 
 The November D.I.A. report, which remains classified, indicates that most analysts believed at the time that Iraq had some illegal weapons, but that Mr. Hussein was not likely to use them or share them with terrorists. 
The report also provides fuller context for statements made last fall by George J. Tenet, director of central intelligence, in a letter to Congress in which he said Iraq might use its weapons, but only if attacked.
The D.I.A. report and Mr. Tenet's letter do not dispute that Iraq had chemical and other weapons.
The existence of the November report was first made public in U.S. News & World Report on Friday, prompting American officials to defend pre-war intelligence assessments that indicated Iraq possessed illegal weapons.
In their public comments before the war, senior Bush administration officials portrayed Iraq as possessing illegal weapons that posed a threat to the United States, either directly or because they might be supplied to terrorists.
Some intelligence analysts, government officials and Democratic critics of the Bush administration have alleged that the administration exaggerated the nature of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq's weapons and of suspected ties to Al Qaeda. 
President Bush and his advisers have defended their statements on Iraq's weapons. Today, appearing in Virginia, Mr. Bush said: "We made it clear to the dictator of Iraq that he must disarm. And we asked other nations to join us in seeing to it that he would disarm, and he chose not to do so, so we disarmed him."
The D.I.A. report suggests that while, before the war, there was something close to a consensus in intelligence agencies that Iraq still had a program to develop illegal weapons, there was debate about whether Iraq intended to use them against the United States.
The report, titled "Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and missile programs," also stated that the United States had evidence of "munitions transfer activity in mid-2002," suggesting that "the regime is distributing chemical warfare munitions in preparation for an anticipated U.S. attack."
That tactical intelligence suggested that Mr. Hussein was planning to deploy chemical weapons to his most elite military units in case of an American invasion. As a result, the American military prepared ground forces for chemical attacks, requiring troops to frequently don chemical protective suits. Chemical weapons were never used during the war.
But short of an all-out invasion of Iraq, the D.I.A. analysts did not see many situations in which Mr. Hussein would turn to unconventional weapons, the report shows. 
"Iraq's chemical agent use against Iran and the Kurds suggest that Baghdad possesses the political will to use any and all" illegal weapons, the report said, but only if "regime survival was imminently threatened." 
The report shows that the D.I.A. was in agreement with the C.I.A.'s assessment, made public last fall by Mr. Tenet in a letter to Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who was then the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
In that letter, Mr. Tenet stated that "Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks" with conventional or illegal weapons, but that "he probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist actions" if convinced that an American-led attack could not be deterred. Those assessments were also included in an overview on Iraq's weapons programs produced by the entire United States intelligence community in October. 
Earlier this month, a portion of a September 2002 D.I.A. report that dealt with Iraq's weapons programs was declassified, largely because D.I.A. officials wanted to dispel the idea that its analysts did not believe that Iraq had a chemical weapons program before the war. In that September report the D.I.A. stated that it did not have "reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons, or where Iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said some accounts of the September report had been misleading because they stopped there and neglected to cite the part of the report that said Iraqi military units had received chemical weapons. Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Powell said, "The very next sentence says that it had information that weapons had been dispersed to units."
D.I.A. officials say that the document was prepared for operational military purposes, and was intended to inform war planners at the United States Central Command, and that it did not have much information that would be useful for targeting weapons facilities in case of war. 
The analysts were still convinced that something was there. "A substantial amount of Iraq's chemical warfare agents, precursors, munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998," the September report stated. "Nevertheless, we believe Iraq retained production equipment, expertise and chemical precursors and can reconstitute a chemical warfare program in the absence of an international inspection regime." Since major combat ended, however, evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its program has eluded the United States.

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
Beckham Is Newest Star in Real Madrid's Galaxy

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
David Beckham is leaving Manchester United for the Spanish League after all. But he is not going to Barcelona, whose new president desperately wanted him on the field, but to rival Real Madrid, which may not need him.
 Soccer skill, however, seems less the reason for the $41 million transfer than marketing, meaning Beckham may be more valuable selling shirts than scoring goals. 
 Even with his splendid crossing passes and deft free kicks, the 28-year-old Beckham may not start regularly in midfield for Real Madrid, the nine-time European club champion. Still, the team is seeking to heighten its visibility, particularly in Asia, and it has now added the sport's highest-profile player to a marquee that already includes the former world players of the year in Zinedine Zidane of France, Ronaldo of Brazil and Luis Figo of Portugal. 
"I know that I will always regret it later in life if I had turned down the chance to play at another great club like Real Madrid," Beckham, who was traveling in Japan on a promotional tour, said yesterday in a statement.
He is expected to earn about $7 million a year, in addition to bonuses, with Real Madrid, according to Reuters.
When Manchester United and Real Madrid, the world's two most popular soccer clubs, met recently in the European Champions League quarterfinals, officials of the Spanish team denied any interest in Beckham. Real, however, apparently reconsidered after Barcelona reached a tentative transfer agreement with Manchester United last week. The deal was contingent on Joan Laporta's winning an election on Sunday to become Barcelona's club president, which he did.
Beckham had complained about becoming a pawn in Barcelona's political maneuverings, and he expressed no desire to play for the club. Real Madrid is another story. It has won the Champions League, Europe's premier club championship, in three of the past six years and has craved the world's top stars, who are referred to as Galacticos. 
Real apparently has no problem with Beckham's celebrity. His wife, Victoria, is better known as Posh Spice, and Beckham, as captain of England's national team and a fashion plate, is a pop idol in his own right, something that seemed to grate on Alex Ferguson, the coach of Manchester United.
With a recent upper hand on the field, Real Madrid now hopes to challenge Manchester United for worldwide popularity and value in commercial terms. In the United States, only the Yankees have such a similarly strong identity and broad appeal. Real has an estimated 100 million fans and official fan clubs on every continent.
"Fundamentally, it's a merchandising coup," Diego Torres, who covers Real Madrid for the Spanish newspaper El Pais, said in an interview with a reporter from The New York Times in Madrid. "Both Manchester and Real Madrid want economic domination of the soccer business, and the keys to that are the stars. Madrid has sought to unite a series of personalities, whose fame stretches far beyond football, people who are celebrities of pop culture, and they needed Beckham. He is the king, the most famous soccer player in the world, along with Ronaldo."
Ronaldo, the Brazilian star, scored two goals in the World Cup final last June in Yokohama, Japan, to give Brazil soccer's premier championship in a victory over Germany.
"But Ronaldo appeals most to people in poorer countries, while Beckham is most popular in the richer nations, in Asia, in Japan," Torres said.
In leaving Manchester United, Beckham leaves the team that groomed him since he was a youngster and the club he helped lead to 8 English Premier League titles in the past 11 seasons, along with the 1999 Champions League title.
Reaction was mixed in England. Some have grown weary of his celebrity, and the breathless way that his actions, including his preferences in fashion and hairstyle, are reported in the news media.
Manchester United is expected to use the hefty transfer fee to buy several players as it seeks to reinforce its scoring, defense and goalkeeping in an attempt to regain supremacy in the Champions League.
"In any company or team anywhere, you might be big at the time, but you can always be replaced," Dushyantkumar Patel, 46, a sugar exporter and Manchester United supporter, told a reporter from The Times at the Platinum Bar, a pub in north London.
David Upton, a 36-year-old manager of the bar and a Liverpool supporter, said Beckham's departure from Manchester United was "inevitable" after an apparent personality clash with Ferguson.
Beckham, he said, "has a big impact on sports, but that's why Real Madrid want him, not only to boost their image in Spain, but around the world."
Dave McWilliams, a 33-year-old security guard playing pool in the Platinum Bar, called the transfer "disgusting."
"At the end of the day, Beckham is still the England captain and he's got to be in the country," McWilliams said. "It's going to ruin England."
In the Spanish capital, Jorge Valdano, sports director for Real Madrid, told Radio Marca that the club was thrilled with the acquisition of Beckham, saying that his image was so popular "people sometimes forget what a great footballer he is."
Asked about the club's hoarding of stars, Valdano told Radio Marca: "On the one hand we try to bring in the best in the world, and they come with commercial possibilities. They bring depth to the club and reinforce our brand."
Real Madrid fans had warmed to Beckham during the recent Champions League series when he acknowledged their applause, a signal, many believed, that he wanted to join the club.
"We are very happy," Esther Diez, a Real Madrid supporter, told a reporter from The Times in Madrid. "He has everything: he is a great sportsman, a very attractive personality, and I think he connects very well with people. He is very elegant -- as a player I mean."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Results decline at Vivendi's entertainment units, but analysts focus on coming bids.

BYLINE:  By Geraldine Fabrikant 

 BODY:
JUST days before the French conglomerate Vivendi Universal plans to accept formal bids for its American entertainment assets, the company announced lower operating profits yesterday for its Vivendi Universal Entertainment unit and a decline in both revenue and operating income for the Universal Music Group.
 But analysts said prospects for quick improvement in Vivendi Universal Entertainment's movie and television operations made the fiscal first-quarter results a less important indicator than the amounts of the coming bids, due next Monday. 
 Together, the music and other entertainment assets are expected to fetch $18 billion to $22 billion, although they may not be sold as a single piece. But in a conference call with analysts yesterday, Jacques Espinasse, Vivendi Universal's chief financial officer, said that if the bids for the entertainment assets were not acceptable, the company -- eager to reduce its staggering debt -- might try to raise money by spinning off 25 percent to 30 percent of the entertainment businesses to the public. 
Vivendi, based in Paris, has said that it has six buyers interested in buying all or part of the entertainment properties, which besides Universal Music include the Universal film and television studios, the cable channels USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel, and the Universal theme parks business.
While the company was not specific, the bidders are said to include the NBC unit of General Electric; Liberty Media; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; Viacom; a group led by the entrepreneur Marvin Davis; and another led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., who arranged the sale of Seagram and the Universal properties to Vivendi in 2000. 
In Paris trading yesterday, Vivendi shares closed down 1.5 percent, at 17.01 euros. In New York, the company's American depository receipts closed at $19.95, down 68 cents. 
Over all, the company, which uses French accounting standards, said that it had narrowed its net loss for the first quarter to 319 million euros, from 815 million euros a year earlier. Revenue fell to 6.2 billion euros from 14.6 billion euros in the quarter a year earlier. But the 2002 figure included results of the Vivendi Environnement unit, which was sold last year. Excluding those figures, revenue was 6.9 billion euros in the period a year earlier.
More relevant to the pending bids, however, were results of the Vivendi Universal Entertainment units, or V.U.E., which comprises the nonmusic American entertainment assets. The company said operating income for the unit rose 76 percent, to 213 million euros on a constant-currency basis. But that figure included the one-time benefit from the purchase of USA Networks last year. Without that one-time benefit and excluding exchange rate fluctuations, V.U.E.'s operating income was down 6 percent, to 213 million euros, while revenue fell 5 percent, to 1.4 billion euros. 
The company attributed the profit decline at V.U.E. in part to increased spending on original programming by the Universal television unit and to lower theme park attendance because of the soft economy. 
Michael Nathanson, who follows Vivendi Universal for the investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the lower numbers were also a result of Universal's thin lineup of movies in the first quarter. 
"Universal got only 1 percent market share in the quarter, and there has been very little follow-through on DVD sales," he said.
But he agreed with a statement from the company that the recent releases of "Bruce Almighty" and "2 Fast 2 Furious" as well as the release of "The Hulk" this coming weekend could help the company significantly. 
He added that the company's cable networks, USA and Sci-Fi, could have better results in light of the improving advertising market. "That means that bidders can look for some near-term improvement," Mr. Nathanson said. 
Problems at the Universal Music Group, the industry leader, may be more systemic. CD sales are down throughout the industry. Universal Music's revenue fell 9 percent, to 1.1 billion euros on a constant-currency basis, and operating income swung from a profit of 27 million euros a year earlier to a loss of 28 million euros. But the company said its share of the album market had increased to 30.9 percent. 
Mr. Nathanson said that his firm was generally ignoring the quarterly figures, waiting instead to see what bids Vivendi's entertainment operations actually attract. 
In recent weeks, NBC has come to seem a more serious bidder than it was previously viewed as being. NBC owns several cable networks, including CNBC, MSNBC and Bravo, and could seek greater economies of scale by adding Vivendi's USA and Sci-Fi channels.
NBC might also find value in owning Universal Television, the studio that produces the three "Law and Order" series, all of which are the top-rated shows in their time slots. NBC and Universal are set to renegotiate the contracts for the series. 
After Vivendi receives all bids, they will be evaluated by the company and its lead bankers, Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs. A person close to Vivendi said the company hoped to make a final decision by mid-July. 
As for Vivendi's European businesses, the most important ones turned in strong first-quarter performances. Revenue at the Cegetel telecommunications business edged up 4 percent, to 1.78 billion euros, while operating income jumped 30 percent, to 465 million euros.
The Canal Plus pay-television business reported lower revenue -- down 2 percent, to 1.16 billion euros -- but an upswing in operating income to 158 million euros, in contrast to a loss of 68 million euros a year earlier. Vivendi Universal said much of Canal Plus's improvement resulted from a doubling in operating income by its Pay-TV France unit.

HEADLINE: Film Brute Who Cries Still Lives In Queens; 
Mailbox Overflows After Recent Roles

BYLINE:  By LOLA OGUNNAIKE 

 BODY:
His name may seem better suited to the hip-hop magazine Source than to a movie marquee, but Franky G. is no budding rap star. "The only thing I wrap are presents," he said on a recent afternoon.
 Franky G. is a film actor who embraced the initial years ago when he found that there were too many actors in the Screen Actors Guild named Gonzalez. He has no regrets. 
 "They love it in Hollywood," he said.
And they apparently love more than just the name. In less than a year Franky G., who reluctantly revealed that he is in his "late 30's," has gone from a no-name actor kicking around "off, off Broadway," as he put it, to a promising new talent sharing screen time with big names in the movies. He plays Dustin Hoffman's dimwitted henchman in the gangster flick "Confidence"; he is a mechanic in "The Italian Job," the high-octane ode to the Mini Cooper starring Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton; and he will star as a rookie detective opposite Val Kilmer in "Wonderland," a true crime tale due in September. His mailbox, once empty, now overflows with scripts, he said.
"I don't think the Hollywood world has ever seen someone like him," said the director Eric Eason, who cast Franky G. as the lead in the family drama "Manito," which opened on Friday. "He has these action-star good looks, but he can do comedy, and he has a rare ability to really tap into his emotions."
Franky G. was lounging at a park in Flushing, Queens, where he has lived since he was 17. The swing sets were rusted, and the basketball hoops had no nets. Dressed in his standard baggy jeans, sweatshirt and Timberland boots, he looked less like a Hollywood "it boy" than like a neighborhood guy looking for a pickup game. Nothing about him screamed star.
But one need only read about Franky G.'s turn as an ex-convict named Junior in "Manito" to know that he has something. In his review in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called Franky G. "the volcanic center of the movie," adding that he had "undeniable star power."
"His acting may be rough and unmodulated at times," Mr. Scott wrote, "but he shows the the complexity of Junior's temperament with furious economy."
The film, set in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, follows the lives of Junior Moreno, a conflicted ex-convict trying to mend his broken life, and his brother, Manny, the first in his family to attend college. As Junior, Franky G. is at once a sweet-talking philanderer, a tortured son, a struggling father and a loving big sibling. One moment he is a volatile brute, wielding punches, the next he is crumpled and crying, a victim of unforeseeable circumstances.
"I love the role because it shows I have range," said Franky G., an animated man whose hands punctuate every statement. Tapping his chest, he continued: "As soon as I read the script, I felt Junior. I felt his pain, his emotion."
This much was evident to Mr. Eason, who said he cast Franky G. immediately after hearing him read for the part. "I must have seen over a hundred people, but I had no question in my mind that he was the guy," Mr. Eason said.
Born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as the middle child of seven, Franky G. found acting late in life. His first love was football, and after studying criminal law investigation at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, he became a running back for the Long Island Tomahawks, asemiprofessional team. Then a knee injury cut short his career.
"I loved the game, and I was good at it," he said wistfully. "But I guess the big man had other plans for me."
It took him years to discover what those plans were. The only thing clear to him, he said, was that he "didn't want to work 9-to-5 jobs" for the rest of his life. Instead he took jobs as a strip-club bouncer, a security guard, a construction worker. He became a body builder, competing in events like Mr. Metropolis and Mr. Queens. (At the height of his beefcake days, he said, he could squat 510 pounds.) And he enrolled in acting classes. It was then that he happened upon an ad for a New York casting call for "Manito" in the magazine Backstage. He figured he had nothing to lose, he said.
Though "Manito" would be his big break, Franky G. contemplated quitting acting after filming was complete. "You hear so much negative feedback," he said. "Some people were supportive, but a lot of people would shoot me down like a clown."
Those days may now be over, but Franky G. has no plans to move west. He continues to live at home in a Flushing row house with his mother, older sister and nephew and spend time with his girlfriend of three years. (His father lives a block away.) "My sister and I take care of my mother. She went through a lot with my family, and I like to give back."
When he is in Los Angeles, he stays at places like Best Western, he said. No Mondrian for him. "I keep it real, real cheap," he said. He is given to Velveeta-like lines like that. Ask him about Hollywood, and he replies: "Nice people. But it's filled with phony baloneys." Ask him about himself: "I don't play games. Tricks are for kids." One gets the impression that Franky G. would rather talk sports scores than Strasberg. Still, he takes acting seriously.
In fact the suggestion that he would make a great action hero is not taken as a compliment. "I don't want to be seen as a muscle head," he said. He even tries to play down his formidable biceps, preferring long sleeves and roomy sweatshirts to tank tops and snug-fitting T-shirts. He has turned down a batch of roles that would require him to be nothing more than a walking bottle of creatine, uttering lame one-liners like "I'll be back" between well-choreographed explosions. 
Despite his efforts he can not escape comparisons to Vin Diesel, who has fashioned a lucrative acting career by playing the muscular gun-toting hero in action adventures like "XXX." 
"I respect Vin Diesel immensely, but me and Vin Diesel are two different people," Franky G. said.
"I don't want to be limited," he added later. "I want people to know that I am an actor."
He does not want everyone to know, however. Franky G.'s bench-press buddies at Gold's Gym in Queens still have little clue about his celluloid life, he said. He plans to keep it that way. "They always ask me why I'm out in California," a grinning Franky G. said. "I tell them I'm on vacation."

HEADLINE: Biological Hazards Ahead 

BYLINE:  By David M. Lodge; David M. Lodge is a biologist at the University of Notre Dame.

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind. 

 BODY:
The recent arrivals in North America of SARS and monkeypox have understandably alarmed us all. But they should not have surprised us. We already knew that an inevitable side effect of globalization is that emerging infectious diseases can spread more rapidly. We already knew that many human diseases have their origin in close contact between people and domesticated animals. Those considerations have informed public health policy for decades. 
 What hasn't been adequately considered -- despite persistent warnings --is the dramatic increase in global trade in alien animals and plants, and the accidental transport of other species in ships and planes. Once here, such alien species pose not only a threat to humans, but can destroy our crops, wildlife and natural ecosystems -- and may be far more costly in the long run than most forms of pollution. Unlike air and water pollution, which are often correctable, biological invasions are usually irreversible, for the simple fact that alien organisms reproduce. 
 Thus the Fish and Wildlife Service and other federal agencies can no longer afford to ignore the dangers posed by Chinese carp being sold in live food markets in major American cities, and by Gambian rats and prairie dogs being sold in Midwestern pet stores. The recent embargo by Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, on the importation of rodents from Africa is only a reactive step. What is required are broader preventative policies.
The problem is that the left and right hands of the federal government are uncoordinated. The Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Agriculture do an admirable job of protecting us and our crops against obvious and direct health threats. However, other branches, like the Interior Department, have not yet awakened to the more insidious dangers that alien species pose to wildlife and natural ecosystems. Think, for example, of how Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight wiped out our native elm and chestnut trees last century, or of how our native oysters have been devastated by alien predators and disease. In aggregate, the cost of alien species to the United States economy has been estimated at $137 billion per year.
In 2001, the government's own National Invasive Species Council -- with input from the invasive species advisory committee on which I serve -- produced an ambitious plan to correct these problems, including steps to develop screening protocols to prevent the importation of harmful species. Unfortunately, the council has little authority to push through the plan. Instead, its recommendations have become bogged down in federal bureaucracy and few have been implemented. Congress needs to increase the authority of the council, and to pass legislation like the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003 to move forward urgent research and governmental efforts to prevent future invasions.
Surprising or not, the arrivals of SARS and monkeypox are nothing short of a screeching alarm. We can no longer separate human health from the health of other organisms and our ecosystems. Every day, the pet trade and unintentional pathways like the ballast water of ships bring thousands more hitchhiking species into our country. Unless government agencies work together, SARS and monkeypox could be just the beginning.

Oil Prices Decline as Inventories Register Biggest Rise in 2 Months

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell yesterday after the Energy Department reported the biggest rise in oil inventories in two months, as high prices attracted imports at a near-record pace.
 Oil stockpiles in the United States rose 3.9 million barrels, to 288.3 million barrels, in the week that ended Friday. Six of nine analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected a decline. 
 The inventory increase, the fourth in five weeks, occurred as imports rose 4.2 percent, to 10.3 million barrels a day, which was close to the record set in April.
"OPEC and other producers are obviously trying to cash in on $30 crude," said John Kilduff, senior vice president for energy-risk management at Fimat USA Inc. in New York. "There is no evidence that production is being limited. The bull market we have seen recently has probably come to an end."
Crude oil for July delivery fell 71 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $30.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price since June 4.
Oil, down 6.2 percent in the last week, is still up 20 percent since late April because of disruptions to output in Iraq and below-normal United States gasoline supplies.
"Imports continue to be extremely high," said Tom Bentz, an oil broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. "There is a lot out there, and it is headed this way. Inventories are still low, but they are improving and concern is fading."
The nation's supplies last week were down 11 percent from a year earlier, according to the report from the Energy Department. The inventory increase was the biggest since the week ended April 18. 
Middle East exporters have shifted crude oil shipments to North America from Asia, Morgan Stanley said in a shipping report.
In other markets, natural gas futures fell to a six-week low as scant air-conditioning use in the Northeast sapped power demand, allowing fuel brokers and utilities to add to depleted winter reserves. The energy-weighted Goldman Sachs commodity index fell 2.68, to 229.53, which was its lowest close since May 12.
Gas for July delivery fell 13.1 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $5.581 for a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price for a contract closest to expiration since May 6. Prices have dropped 17 percent in the last eight sessions from a three-month high of $6.719.

Vertical integration worked well in its day; now companies thrive by turning to specialists.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel (vpostrel@dynamist.com) is the author of "The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness," to be published in September by HarperCollins.

 BODY:
SEARS is selling its credit card division, almost certainly to a specialized financial business. To let customers charge their purchases, retailers no longer have to run their own credit operations. Dell Computer doesn't make its own hardware. It assembles circuit boards and disk drives from specialized manufacturers.
 From payroll management to movie special effects, vertical integration is out. Specialization is in. 
 Does your company need a new product? You can hire an industrial design firm like IDEO to create it. Want to set up shop online? Buy the services and software from Amazon. Are you selling electronic systems? Get Solectron and Flextronic to assemble them.
"Wal-Mart is less integrated vertically than Sears at the turn of the 20th century," the economist Richard N. Langlois of the University of Connecticut wrote in an e-mail message, noting that Sears once "even manufactured some of its own products in its own factories." Amazon is less integrated still, and eBay even less so.
Meanwhile, vertical mergers increasingly look like bad bets. The AOL Time Warner vision of combining editorial content and Internet services under the same corporate roof has turned out to be an expensive folly.
Other media mergers based on the same theory, like Disney's acquisition of ABC, haven't done much better. Content and delivery don't need common owners.
It's more flexible and efficient to specialize in one activity and then buy from or sell to a number of outside companies.
Since the 1980's, American corporations have been disintegrating -- not falling apart, but becoming more specialized. Revenues or production volumes may be as large as ever, but even big companies tend to combine fewer stages of production under the same corporate ownership.
This trend presents a puzzle. As the business historian Alfred Chandler famously chronicled, the modern corporation succeeded in large measure by bringing many different stages of production under central ownership and control.
In Mr. Chandler's account, "the visible hand of managerial coordination had replaced the invisible hand of the market," Professor Langlois explained in an article in the journal Industrial and Corporate Change.
Why did vertical integration seem like the way to efficiency, predictability and riches? Was Mr. Chandler wrong?
In his article, titled "The Vanishing Hand," Professor Langlois argues that Mr. Chandler's managerial revolution "was an organizational solution appropriate to its time and place." The Chandlerian corporation did not supplant specialization forever. It was essentially a stopgap measure, a way of reducing uncertainty in an underdeveloped economic environment.
In high-volume operations like those that developed in the late 19th century, every part of the system has to operate reliably.
"You want to make sure the ore gets to the smelting plant, that the metal gets to the steel mill, and the steel gets to the automobile factory -- that all of this happens fast, and it happens at the right time," Professor Langlois explained in an interview.
"To do this, you've really got to make sure there are no uncertainties in these various parts of the system. In the beginning, the easiest way, the cheapest way to do that was to use management as a buffer -- to put people in charge and have these things under common control."
Markets simply weren't thick enough to meet the new corporations' needs. In some cases, stages of production were entirely missing. In others, they weren't developed and competitive enough to be reliable.
"What happened in the Chandlerian era," Professor Langlois said, "was that the need for buffering grew fast, but marketing-supporting institutions weren't able to cope with that, so you had to come up with a kind of second best, which was the large, vertically integrated firm."
Over time, however, new companies and specialized institutions arose to provide once-missing services. Meanwhile, markets grew through trade and increasing populations. This growth allowed more and more specialized businesses to find niches -- the process Adam Smith first identified in "The Wealth of Nations."
To operate a meatpacking business in the 19th century, Gustavus Swift "had to own the company that made the railroad cars," Professor Langlois said. "He had to own the ice company. He had to own the distribution, the refrigerated warehouses." In today's developed markets, by contrast, Michael Dell could devise a similarly efficient logistics system using existing contractors.
Similarly, Sears customers no longer need a special Sears credit card. They can use Visa and MasterCard. If Sears wants to offer its own branded card, it can contract with a financial services company to handle those operations.
Today's companies combine "specialization of function" with "generalization of capabilities." Shippers are good at shipping things in general; credit card companies are good at managing credit risks, regardless of where customers buy; electronics assemblers are good at all sorts of assembly. Businesses specialize more in skills than in end products.
This form of specialization provides a more reliable buffer against uncertainty. "Since a general specialist is not tied to a particular product or brand, but takes in work from many purveyors of products and brands," Professor Langlois wrote, "it can diversify its portfolio more effectively. This smooths demand and facilitates high-throughput production."
He expects the trend toward specialization and vertical disintegration to continue as long as "markets continue to grow and globalization doesn't get sidetracked."
But there's one caveat to that prediction: "If there were some kind of major systemic innovation that nobody's anticipated, then there might be a lot more vertical integration as people try to cope."

HEADLINE: McGreevey And G.O.P. Are at Odds Over Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 18 

 BODY:
With New Jersey legislators scheduled to begin a series of crucial budget votes on Thursday, Republican lawmakers and the McGreevey administration accused each other today of advocating spending plans that would lead to higher property taxes for homeowners.
 Republican legislators on Monday released a list of $1 billion in proposed cuts to Gov. James E. McGreevey's $23.7 billion budget and today snubbed his invitation to meet in his office and negotiate a compromise. 
 Instead, the Republican State Committee began broadcasting a radio advertisement that criticized Mr. McGreevey for proposing tax increases, spending taxpayer money on patronage jobs and overseas junkets and using a state helicopter for personal business. 
Democrats, meanwhile, were criticizing the Republicans' proposal as unrealistic because it did not account for spending increases that the Republicans had advocated. The Republican plan also repeats spending cuts that have already been included in the governor's budget calculations, the governor said.
Mr. McGreevey's treasurer, John E. McCormac, also entered the fray, saying that the Republicans' proposed cuts in administrative aid to poor school districts would violate a court order and predicting that their calls for decreasing aid to New Jersey cities would lead to sizable property tax increases.
"There is a $110 million cut in urban property tax relief and another $120 million in education property tax relief in their plan," Mr. McCormac said in an interview. "And until they provide us with a full picture of where they want to increase spending, there's not much here to work with."
The rhetoric is likely to escalate between now and June 30, the constitutionally mandated deadline for a balanced budget. The Senate Budget Committee is expected to receive an assortment of bills from the McGreevey administration calling for $740 million in new taxes and fees on cigarettes, casinos, hotels, billboards and telephone bills.
With the Senate committee evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, however, those bills are not expected to win passage, and their rejection would mark the final round of budget negotiations.
Democratic legislative leaders reached their own budget agreement with the governor on Sunday and have warned that they could be forced to shut down government operations if Republicans do not agree to a deal.
But Republicans have dismissed such talk as political brinkmanship. State Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon, said the administration was irresponsible in calling for tax increases when the economy was sputtering. In the radio ad, which began running today, Republicans criticized the governor for increasing business taxes last year and seeking another round of tax rises without eliminating questionable spending.
"Cut the $20 million in new political jobs," the ad states. "Cut the millions in taxpayer dollars you are spending to promote yourself on TV and radio. Cut the millions being spent for expensive helicopters and overseas trips and vacations." 
Because Democrats have a majority of 42 to 37 in the General Assembly, the budget debate will be fought in the State Senate, which is split 20 to 20. One particularly divisive issue is the administration's plan to reap tens of millions in new taxes from Atlantic City casinos, which has been vociferously opposed by Senator William L. Gormley, Republican of Atlantic County, who sits on the budget committee.
The casino association began broadcasting radio advertisements several weeks ago, calling the proposal an assault on the economy of South Jersey and warning that it would lead to thousands of layoffs. Mr. McGreevey returned fire by appearing in radio ads paid for by the State Democratic Committee that accused casino industry executives of shirking their responsibility to pay taxes and shifting the burden to working families and the elderly.
Administration officials say the governor, whose original budget called for $135 million in new casino taxes and who has lowered that to $90 million, is unwilling to make more concessions to the industry.
As the battle drags on, however, there are indications that Mr. McGreevey's approval ratings have been harmed by the budget problems he has been forced to contend with since taking office in January 2002. A poll released today by Quinnipiac University found that 35 percent of voters viewed him favorably, while 47 viewed him unfavorably.

HEADLINE: Best Buy Reports Much Narrower Loss 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, June 18 

 BODY:
The Best Buy Company reported a substantially narrower first-quarter loss today as increased consumer confidence brought strong revenue gains. 
 Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics chain, said the net loss for the three months was $25 million, or 8 cents a share. 
That compared with a loss of $333 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier, when Best Buy took a $308 million charge associated with the reduced value of Musicland and a charge of $40 million associated with its Magnolia Hi-Fi chain. 
 This year's results included a loss of $24 million from discontinued operations stemming from the sale of the company's interest in the Musicland Group. 
Best Buy said Monday that it was turning over its troubled Musicland Group to Sun Capital Partners, a Florida-based private investment company. Musicland operates about 1,100 Media Play, Sam Goody and Suncoast stores across the country. 
Excluding one-time items, Best Buy recorded a profit of $70 million, or 22 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $79 million, or 25 cents a share a year earlier. 
"Earnings from continuing operations came in above our expectations, after the war in Iraq ended and increased consumer confidence during the quarter sent more shoppers to our stores and to our Web sites," the chief executive, Brad Anderson, said. 
Revenue in the period, which ended May 31 and was the first quarter of Best Buy's fiscal year, increased to $4.67 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier. The increase was driven by the addition of 79 stores over the last year and a gain of 2.2 percent for stores open at least 14 months, the company's measure of comparable-store sales.

Lights Out Again for Gray Davis? A Wealthy Californian Leads a Recall

BYLINE:  By CUAUHTEMOC ORTEGA 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Feeding off frustration with California's economic crisis, a Republican-backed effort to recall Gov. Gray Davis has gained steam in recent weeks. One poll indicates 51 percent of Californians want to get rid of Mr. Davis, whose approval ratings have plummeted to 21 percent.
 Although the dour Mr. Davis has never been particularly loved, the key to the dissatisfaction is the state's fiscal problems, which have led to a projected $38 billion in budget cuts. Among the most painful possibilities are a billion dollars less for public schools, increases in university student fees, layoffs and tons of new taxes. 
 During his campaign for re-election, Mr. Davis failed to warn voters about the breadth of the budget problems around the corner. Now many people want to hold him accountable. They are justified in their criticism, but wrong in their proposed solution. The recall effort is disturbingly dishonest. It is not oriented in favor of healing California's crisis, but is driven by wealthy individuals seeking to advance their own careers by exploiting a political disaster.
Leading the pack is Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican multimillionaire businessman who failed to win his party's nomination for the 1998 California Senate race. Mr. Issa, who has been a congressman for only three years, would like to be Mr. Davis's successor -- under California law, voters supporting the recall will simply check off their choice for a new governor from among a long list of volunteer candidates. Bill Simon, who was defeated by Mr. Davis in last year's elections, and Arnold Schwarzenegger have also expressed interest in running.
So far, none of Mr. Davis's prospective replacements have come forward with a comprehensive plan for how to steer California out of the red. California Republicans and potential candidates haven't provided meaningful alternatives to Mr. Davis's plans for closing the budget gap aside from further unpopular public service cuts. They've devoted much more energy to exonerating themselves for any role in creating the current crisis.
Mr. Davis may have provided less than impressive leadership during the state's doomed energy deregulation project, but deregulation was, after all, the Republicans' idea and the creation of Gov. Pete Wilson, Mr. Davis's predecessor. Mr. Davis was forced to use state funds to purchase energy for the state when the utility companies went bankrupt, but it was representatives of the Bush administration who resisted his pleas for some controls on excessive profit-taking by the energy industry. And in Washington, Republicans have been very reluctant to help bail out floundering state governments. When President Bush was busy planning for tax cuts, Democrats proposed an alternative economic plan that included large amounts of financial aid to troubled states. Mr. Issa should have been lobbying for that plan rather than collecting signatures for a recall.
Some pro-recallers argue that there's always a possibility of stumbling on a candidate possessed with the genius to save California from bankruptcy while simultaneously sparing tax hikes and public service cutbacks. It's worth the risk, they say, since there's not much more to gain by keeping Mr. Davis.
But there is. California is already well known for the influence of money in state policy -- those with the most money, not necessarily the most sense, usually win the state's endless string of proposed ballot referendums. The proposition to recall Mr. Davis has become a realistic threat only since Mr. Issa started pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own fortune into a larger-scale campaign, making the traditionally expected -- but usually ignored -- gubernatorial recall effort a forefront issue. Allowing money to popularize and influence recall efforts the way it has other propositions is not good policy or precedent.
The status quo may not look promising, but entrusting the world's fifth-largest economy to a relative stranger through a recall effort led by people who have often been part of the problem is not any more comforting. Despite romantic delusions of popular upheaval against a disliked leader, a sounder method of keeping leaders accountable already exists: voting. Mr. Davis well knows his political future is riding on his actions in the coming weeks. If he cannot deliver a balanced budget or avoid taking unpopular steps toward achieving it, he's done politically. No coup d'etat a l'argent necessary.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Population Is Rising Swiftly, Census Bureau Says 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18 

 BODY:
The Census Bureau released new figures today indicating that growth in the Hispanic population continues at a dizzying rate, having increased by nearly 10 percent in the first two years of the new century. 
 The number of Hispanics, which totaled 38.8 million as of July 2002, indicates a continued growth in immigration in recent years, even under less favorable social and economic conditions than those of the 1990's. According to the Census Bureau, the Hispanic population increased by 9.8 percent from the April 2000 census figures. Immigration, the new report concludes from estimates of both legal and illegal migrants, accounts for roughly 53 percent of the increase. 
 "It suggests a demographic momentum so powerful," said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Institute, "that the immigration flow is somewhat impervious to the economic downturn or fears over national security." 
The report, released today at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., confirms earlier census predictions that Hispanics had overtaken blacks as the country's largest minority group. 
As stark as the numbers themselves, is the conundrum they highlight: the growing difficulty of classifying racial and ethnic categories in an increasingly fluid and multi-ethnic society.
The 2000 census allowed respondents for the first time to choose more than one race in identifying themselves, a change that produced a wide array of possible racial classifications. And since Hispanics can be of any race, a census question allowed people to declare whether they were of Spanish, Hispanic or Latino origin. 
Previous census estimates, released in January, predicted that Hispanics had edged past blacks in terms of population, but only if the black population totals excluded blacks who checked more than one race or who checked black and Hispanic origin. 
The newest figures, according to census officials, put that discrepancy to rest. The population generally identified as black or African-American totaled 36.7 million as of July 2002. After adding the population that identified as black, in combination with one or more other races, the number rose to only 38.3 million, still less than the general Hispanic total of 38.8 million. 
"It can seem a bit like comparing apples and oranges," said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman for the census bureau. "but now under every conceivable comparison, the Hispanic population is the largest."
That still left other tricky comparisons for the Census Bureau to clarify. While Hispanics remain the largest growing group, census officials took pains to point out that Asians, whose numbers rose 9 percent to roughly 13 million in 2002, experienced the highest rate of growth among racial group, because Asians are considered a racial group and Hispanics an ethnic group. The raw numbers and percentages convey little about overlaps in race and ethnicity, many demographers say. Filipinos, for example, can identify as both Asian and of Spanish origin. 
So far, the Census Bureau has not devised a way for people to identify themselves as Arab-Americans or of Middle Eastern ethnicity. 
"What we end up with is a slightly convoluted set of concepts and little uniformity in the way we all think about the concepts or classify the data," said Professor Larry Hajime Shinagawa, director for the Center for the Study of Culture, Race and Ethnicity at Ithaca College in New York.
While the wording of the census questionnaires pushed Hispanics to further classify themselves by race, a recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center showed that when respondents were asked to declare themselves by race, 46 percent identified themselves as simply Hispanic or Latino. Another 20 percent responded "other."
"More than half of the Hispanic population doesn't see itself fitting into any of the standard American classifications" said Mr. Suro. "It's not that they are colorblind or beyond racism. They just don't see the world divided into such stark boxes, and that has to be a real engine for change."

HEADLINE: Cablevision Finds Flaws In Accounting And Fires 14 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
The Cablevision Systems Corporation said yesterday that it had fired the president of AMC Networks and 13 other employees after an internal review of the company's Rainbow Media subsidiary found accounting irregularities.
 Cablevision, which has three million subscribers and is the nation's sixth-largest cable operator, said it had notified regulators of its findings. But the company added that the irregularities were insignificant financially and would not require the company to restate its results. 
 The company, which owns Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the New York Knicks in addition to its cable properties, said the review, which covered 1999 through 2002, determined that about $6.2 million of expenses for this year were accelerated and improperly booked last year. All but about $1.7 million of that amount was identified and reversed before the release of results for 2002, the company added.
Cablevision said that its review had found that similar amounts of improper bookings of expenses were made in 2000 and 2001.
The company said that the review found that some employees of the national services division of Rainbow Media -- which also includes the Independent Film Channel and WE: Women's Entertainment -- accelerated marketing expenses and fabricated invoices in some cases. The marketing expenses generally included payments made to other cable systems to promote the various cable networks.
The company did not provide a motive for the acceleration of expenses, but a person briefed on the situation said making them larger in earlier years would reduce future budgets. "If you have accounted for your expenses in 2002, instead of 2003, it makes it easier to make your profit numbers in 2003 because your expenses are lower," this person said.
Among those fired at AMC was the president, Kate McEnroe. The company did not elaborate on the situation at AMC.
In a statement, Cablevision's chief executive, James L. Dolan, said, "The company cannot tolerate any improprieties related to financial matters."
The company said it had retained William R. McLucas of the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering to conduct an investigation and to use forensic accountants in the review.
The amounts of the improperly booked expenses are not financially significant because Rainbow Media is likely to generate this year about $175 million in cash flow, or earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Matthew Harrigan, who follows the cable industry for Janco Partners in Denver.
Analysts said yesterday that the developments at Cablevision, which were released after the close of regular stock trading, were likely to have little effect on the company's share price. But they said it was a signal that Cablevision needed to impose tighter accounting controls.
"It sounds as if they need to get a better grip on their control process, but there is no way it is material economically," Mr. Harrigan said. "This is an environment where you find anything is irregular, your best tactic is to be extremely open as soon as possible, even if it is not material."
He added, "Wall Street has always been concerned about accounting issues with cable companies, and specifically with Cablevision, given the Dolan family ownership and their propensity to get into unrelated businesses, like sports teams and satellite ownership."
Before the results of the review were announced, shares of Cablevision closed at $22.54, down 31 cents.

HEADLINE: Among Film's Ghosts, Its Future 

BYLINE:  By ERIC A. TAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD 

 BODY:
MISGUIDED tourists regularly troll the seedy sections of Hollywood Boulevard for bits of film industry lore, unaware that the stars and studios left decades ago. But hidden among the homeless and the sex shops is a structure that is as much a part of Hollywood's future as its past.
 Behind cast-iron gates lies the Hollywood Pacific Theater, an Italianate palace originally built (but finished too late) for the 1927 premiere of "The Jazz Singer," the first sound film with some spoken dialogue. It has been closed for years, but recently reopened as a test bed for the motion picture industry's next great technical revolution: digital projection. 
 Where thousands once congregated in ornate halls, today a handful of film executives and technicians use cellphones to communicate across the dark, ghostly space, awaiting the next screening of test images in the otherwise empty theater. On any given day, Shrek and his friends might be gamboling across the screen or Obi-Wan Kenobi might be dueling with his light saber as experts work to devise standards for the movie theater of the future. 
 The tests are being conducted by the Digital Cinema Laboratory, an organization set up by the University of Southern California's Entertainment Technology Center. A consortium of seven Hollywood studios have contracted with the laboratory to choose the specifications for the equipment and software with which the industry will one day distribute and project feature films without any film at all.
 Some of the testing is scientific, designed to measure, for example, the brightness and sharpness of a digitally projected image on a screen. Experts with the Entertainment Technology Center use a 25-foot-tall crane fitted with sensors to measure both transmitted and reflected light as it hits various points on the screen as small as one pixel. "We're still in the calibration stage," said Charles S. Swartz, executive director and chief executive of the Entertainment Technology Center. "We're defining the parameters that are important to measure." But because the movie-viewing experience can be a distinctly subjective one, the Digital Cinema Laboratory is also using "expert viewers," motion picture industry professionals, to evaluate picture quality and is considering forming a viewing panel of college students, too. "Picture quality is not a simple question of numbers," Mr. Swartz said. "We need to understand better how our brains fill in parts of a picture to improve its perceived quality, even if that data is not literally on the screen."
 Digital projection potentially offers many advantages over today's film-based system. For the moviegoer, digital prints look as good after the 100th showing as after the first. They appear rock-steady when projected, and don't get scratched or covered with dust and hair. 
 There are also big economic advantages for the studios. They stand to save $1 billion each year if they no longer have to produce and ship film prints to each of the world's 150,000 screens but instead can transmit them as electronic files through a high-speed data link, or physically deliver them on a hard disk or other storage medium. 
 At the multiplex, films will be stored on a drive, and an operator will simply issue a set of keyboard commands to a server computer to send a film to digital projectors in as many theaters as warranted. Splicing and threading huge rolls of film will be a thing of the past.
 But digital projectors are much more expensive than conventional ones, and the computers and other equipment needed are an additional expense for theater owners. Only about 150 theaters in the world are now equipped to show films digitally. While some blockbuster films (including, most notably, "Star Wars: Episode Two -- Attack of the Clones," released last year) have been shown digitally, industry executives and engineers regard these as little more than early-technology demonstrations.
 "Today's digital cinema systems are not ready to be rolled out," said Michael Karagosian, technical consultant to the National Association of Theater Owners, an industry trade group. "They don't yet produce an image equal to that of film. I thought the 'Star Wars' digital showing looked very bad."
 The average viewer might not share that conviction. But with wide-screen high-definition television now available to consumers, there is no question that the technical bar has been raised, just as it was when color television first appeared in the 1950's. Simply reproducing the quality of today's HDTV broadcasts or film while using digital technology is not worth the effort, industry executives agree. Instead, an entirely new level must be achieved. "For digital cinema to succeed, the viewing experience must be better than what customers can see today with 35-millimeter film," said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners.
 How much better the image must be, and even how "better" is defined, "remain the $64 questions," said Chuck Goldwater, chief executive of Digital Cinema Initiatives, the movie industry consortium created to help set standards. Among the issues that his group and the Digital Cinema Laboratory are addressing are the contrast ratio, color saturation, and lines of resolution needed to give viewers a unique experience when they watch a digitally projected film. 
 Even the exact point in the theater from which subjective judgments should be made is up for grabs. Does a digitally projected film need to be sharper than a conventionally projected film when a 15-year old views it from the first row, or only when an older person watches from the 35th? While there is still no decision, "consensus is that sharpness should be evaluated only when you're sitting at least as far away as the height of the screen, and most think you should be sitting 50 percent farther away than that," said Mr. Swartz.
 "When evaluating picture quality, I tell people to sit where they normally sit," said Doug Darrow, a business manager at Texas Instruments, which created a technology, digital light processing or D.L.P., used in all commercial digital projectors. "Cinematographers often sit two to three screen heights away, but then I've seen grain sniffers who put their nose on the screen to look for picture artifacts."
 Theater owners and studios agree that today's digital projectors, which can generally display about 1,300 lines of resolution, are not sufficient. D.L.P. uses special chips that consist of hundreds of thousands of tiny movable mirrors that reflect light according to a digital signal. At a recent trade show, the company demonstrated a new chip capable of displaying a film with a resolution of 2,000 lines. 
 "The picture was stunning -- the audience stood and applauded," said Nick Dager, publisher of the Digital Cinema Report, an Internet trade publication. "Still there was no 'wow' factor there; it was as good as 35-millimeter film, but no better."
 Mr. Darrow said that the prototype chip offered a higher contrast ratio, higher resolution and the same number of colors as a film print. "It creates an image that looks like a print struck from the original negative," he said. "The average viewer would perceive it to be sharper than film, with more detail and more colors." 
 For those filmgoers who tend to wait a few weeks to see a movie, the difference could be even more striking. Over time, most prints get dirty, scratched or gnarled, lowering the perceived sharpness. "Some say a film print is equivalent to 5,000 lines of resolution, but by the time it's been shown a lot, its effective resolution may be no more than 800 lines," Mr. Darrow said.
 In addition to determining what constitutes a sharp-enough picture, the Digital Cinema Laboratory is testing different compression and encryption methods to reduce the size of the digital files and developing standards to ensure that the digital picture will be free of flaws and secure from theft when it is transmitted by the movie studio to the server that routes it to theaters. 
 Executives are concerned about theft because a pristine image presents a tempting prize for movie pirates. A film that is decrypted in a local server before it is sent to a projector sitting just a few feet away could easily be diverted into a thief's laptop simply by rerouting a cable. To prevent that, one idea that is being considered is to keep the film encrypted, decoding it only within the projector as it is being shown. But this could substantially increase the complexity and cost of the projector. So another idea under consideration is to decrypt the film in the server, then re-encrypt it with a simpler coding before it is sent to the projector.
 Digital projectors and digital transmission will not replace standard movie projectors and film cans anytime soon. The Digital Cinema Laboratory doesn't expect to complete testing until the end of this year. Digital Cinema Initiatives hopes to establish specifications sometime next year, and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, an experts group, will then be asked to codify the actual technical standards. 
 Once the studios and theater owners agree that the conversion is worth the cost -- and, more important, agree on who will pay for it -- the rollout can begin.
 "It's impossible to know when all this will happen," said Mr. Fithian of the National Association of Theater Owners. "But whenever it does, it will be the biggest technological transition in our industry's history."

HEADLINE: City Seeking to Rezone Brooklyn Waterfront 

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 BODY:
City officials yesterday announced a rezoning plan that would open the crumbling East River sections of Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn to housing and recreation.
 The plan is the first concrete step that the Bloomberg administration has taken since it announced last month that it would oppose a proposed 1,100-megawatt power plant on the Williamsburg waterfront. The city's plan calls instead for housing and open space on the 1.6-mile stretch of Brooklyn riverfront between the Williamsburg and Pulaski Bridges, and increased residential and commercial zoning in a 170-block swath inland. 
 Community groups that had long opposed the power plant applauded the city's plan, which includes zoning for residential towers along the waterfront and provisions for low-income housing among market-rate apartments. 
"It's historic," said Adam Perlmutter, a lawyer for the Greenpoint-Williamsburg Waterfront Task Force, which opposed the plant. "It's an opportunity to put a waterfront out there worthy of Sydney, Seattle, and San Francisco."
The area has been largely zoned for manufacturing for 42 years. In recent decades, as waterfront industries were replaced by residents and stores, the area took on a patchwork of uses. 
"We walked block by block, street by street, and it became clear that a standard rezoning was inappropriate," said Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission. 
The commission's 18-month study used community input to come up with a combination of residential, mixed use, and commercial zoning. The proposed zoning map is full of indentations where the zoning was fine-tuned to fit in with current use. The proposal includes low-to-middle-income housing, legalization of lofts, extensive public access to the waterfront, and a riverside esplanade with adjacent recreational space. In line with a request to protect existing industry, the plan preserves manufacturing in currently industrial areas like the Domino's Sugar factory. The most striking change would be the erection of 150- to 350-foot-high residential towers in a landscape that is nearly as flat as it was a century ago. 
Community groups and elected officials praised the plan yesterday. "They seem to be determined to make this a centerpiece of a very unique waterfront community," said Christopher Olechowski, the chairman of Community Board 1's rezoning task force.
Supporters cited the plan's designation of a state park at an 8-acre riverfront site at North 12th Street where TransGas Energy has applied to the state to build a power plant. David Flanagan, a spokesman for the State Public Service Commission, said that it is very early in the state approvals process but that " zoning will be a key issue for the case."
The park would be financed by the Olympics and used for beach volleyball and archery if the Games come to New York in 2012. A few blocks south, New York University plans to build playing fields, which would also be used for the Games. A spokeswoman for the City Planning Commission said that the plan calls for open space on the site, even without the Olympics. 
Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said that the area should remain recreational space. The TransGas application, he said, is not consistent with the city's proposal. 
Over years of industrial use, parts of Greenpoint and Williamsburg have suffered from environmental contamination. Adam Victor, the owner of TransGas, said it would cost at least $35 million to clean the North 12th Street site enough to use it as a park. But Mr. Doctoroff said there was no study to back that figure and added that cleanup would be paid for by corporations that had caused the contamination. The city also plans to offer up to $200 million to help developers clean up the sites.
Last night the city presented the plan to a Community Board 1 zoning task force, and on Tuesday it will present it to the public. In coming months, the department will review the plan with Community Board 1, business, neighborhood and civic groups, and elected officials, with final approval required by the City Council.
Some residents have fought new industrial plants and new residential towers. But Steve Hindy, owner of the Brooklyn Brewery on North 11th Street and a member of Community Board 1, said allowing towers was necessary. "There's a pretty large number of people in the community that are opposed to anything above five or six stories," he said. "But 30 years of saying no to housing proposals on the waterfront is what brought us the proposal for a garbage transfer station, which we were very lucky to defeat, and it's what brought us the proposal for the power plant, which we hope to defeat. So I hope people realize that they've got to say yes to something here."

HEADLINE: Fatal Police Chase Ignites Rampage in Michigan Town 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich., June 18 

 BODY:
When they threw the bricks and smashed the windows, when they set the blazes that devoured a dozen buildings over the past two harrowing nights, the people of this depressed city on Lake Michigan were not just angry about the 28-year-old motorcyclist killed early Monday in a high-speed police chase.
 They were still simmering, many said, over 7-year-old Trent Patterson, who died in a police chase a few years back, and Arthur Partee, who was strangled by police officers only two months ago. They said they were still seething over a teenager's mysterious drowning in the St. Joseph's River in 1991, and the man who was shot in the back by an officer the year before. 
 "We're just tired, we're sick of them killing us," Bonita Bulger, 28, said this afternoon as she stood at the corner of Empire and Pavone Streets, opposite where the motorcyclist, Terrance Shurn, crashed to his death and the smoldering remnants of an apartment building burned in the riot.
"Our backs are against the wall," Ms. Bulger added. "The jobs are low. Our kids have nothing to do. You know what's the highlight of our day? Standing on the four corners right here."
Tonight, some 250 police officers from surrounding communities, in riot gear and armored vehicles, patrolled this city of 11,000 people, nearly all African-American and poor, 100 miles around the lake northeast of Chicago. The neighborhood that had been roiled by violence for two nights was eerily quiet as scores of state police cars with lights flashing, but sirens silent, slowly snaked through the streets.
Several hot spots were blockaded, and officers shined flashlights into oncoming cars and warned them sternly to turn around. City officials vowed to enforce an existing 10:30 p.m. curfew for children 16 and under but declined to extend the curfew to older teenagers or adults or to ask the state to match their declaration of a state of emergency. 
Fifty ministers also patrolled the neighborhood, after a candlelight prayer in Mr. Shurn's memory.
Residents and some community leaders said the violence started on Monday night after a tense City Hall session that was disbanded when an outraged resident used profanity. By Tuesday night, rioters were chanting "no justice, no peace" as they overturned vehicles, tossed small firebombs into houses and shattered windows with bottles and rocks, injuring 12 people.
Capt. Roy Bell of the Benton Harbor Fire Department said 13 structures, 4 of them occupied, were burned, 11 of them to the ground. Twelve people were arrested, said Joel Patterson, the city manager.
This afternoon, some here shook their heads at the self-destructive nature of the rioting, while others applauded it for bringing national attention to festering complaints about the criminal justice system. 
"I hate to see this happen, but sometimes you have to get your message across," said the Rev. Edward Pinkney of the Bethel Christian Restoration Center. "I believe this: There's never change without conflict. Read your history."
A resort town in the 1930's and 1940's, Benton Harbor is now a dilapidated backwater, with a median household income of $17,000, and a third of households earning below $10,000, according to the 2000 census. It remains the headquarters for Whirlpool, but most of the factories that lured African-Americans from the South have long been closed. Census figures show that 17 percent of residents are unemployed. 
The city of four square miles -- nestled among the Harbor Country villages where Chicago's wealthy and powerful, including Mayor Richard M. Daley, have weekend homes -- is governed by a black city commission, mayor, city manager and police chief. But there has been racial strife for decades between residents of Benton Harbor and the authorities in rural Benton Township, and the 95-percent-white beach community next door, St. Joseph.
The contrasts are abundant. Newspapers fill the windows of the Main Street Cafe in Benton Harbor. The Kitchen Mart Home Center looks as if it has been shuttered for decades. The siding is peeling from a long-empty office building at 133 West Main.
"It's like two different Americas," said Alex Kotlowitz, whose 1998 book, "The Other Side of the River: A Story of Two Towns, a Death, and America's Dilemma," examined the 1991 drowning of a 16-year-old Benton Harbor boy who was either running from the police after breaking into a car or lynched for dating a white girl, depending on where you live.
"It's completely -- economically, spiritually and geographically -- isolated," Mr. Kotlowitz said of Benton Harbor. "I'm not surprised at the anger; I felt it. You could tell it had a lot more to it than one individual's death."
As with past incidents, details remain murky over the circumstances of Mr. Shurn's death, which is being investigated by the Michigan State Police. City officials and residents say that Mr. Shurn, who lacked a driver's license and registration for his motorcycle, was chased through a residential area at speeds of up to 100 miles an hour by a white officer from the Benton Township police. 
Captain Bell, of the Fire Department, said the buildings were left burning the past two days because fire trucks were barraged with bricks as they entered the area, injuring a driver. A man with a sawed-off shotgun also fired at one engine, he said. "I just laid down and screamed at police that we're under heavy fire," Captain Bell recalled. "I started shaking the lieutenant and he gunned it. We got out of there."
The city's two fire engines sustained $40,000 in damage, and one of the 22 firefighters, a 20-year veteran, quit in disillusionment. 
"We couldn't do our job last night; we don't let buildings burn to the ground," said another fireman, Tim Robertson. "9/11, we're heroes. Now, we're the enemy."
City leaders, along with representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who came from Detroit, begged for peace this afternoon. Steven McCoy, a city commissioner, said: "We, as a people, must stand up, but not in anger, not in violence. We can march on the township. We can march on the courthouse. But let's not destroy our city."

HEADLINE: Developer With Stealth Reputation Changes Tactics to Build Syracuse Megamall 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
Big-time real estate developers tend to come in two basic packages. There is the extroverted visionary who seduces the public with elaborate renderings and boundless enthusiasm and who plays mayors and other politicians against one another for tax breaks. 
 Then there is the clandestine operator who consorts with silent partners, buys up land in tiny parcels and eventually maneuvers his project past environmentalists and neighbors. 
 For most of his long and lucrative career, Robert J. Congel, the Syracuse founder of Pyramid Management Group, has hewn to the stealthy stereotype. He has built a small empire of more than two dozen shopping centers and malls in the Northeast, including the 4.3-million-square-foot Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack, N.Y., with its 220 tenants. 
Risking his own capital to get his malls finished and to retain control, Mr. Congel has kept a low profile, though he has left a trail of lawsuits wherever he has gone.
The strategy has made Mr. Congel rich, with assets of $700 million, according to an estimate last year by Forbes magazine, which ranks him among the 400 wealthiest Americans. 
Now, working on his grandest project ever, Mr. Congel, 67, has changed tactics. He has thrust himself and his proposed supermall, called DestiNY USA and planned for Syracuse, into the political spotlight on a statewide level. 
Mr. Congel has asked Gov. George E. Pataki to embrace the project by pushing through the Legislature a bill to guarantee certain tax breaks for years ahead in a manner that could help Mr. Congel secure less costly financing. According to some drafts of the bill, now before lawmakers in Albany, the developer would be able to use as collateral the tax rebates owed him by the state under the Empire Zone program, even if the state decides to end the economic development program.
The request has generated political heat, as Democrats are beginning inquiries into the lobbying efforts of well-paid political allies of Mr. Pataki. Mr. Congel and his companies have spent more than $100,000 in the past two years to hire lobbyists: Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator who was Mr. Pataki's mentor; John O'Mara, a former judge who has been the governor's special counsel in negotiations with Indian tribes; Kieran Mahoney, Mr. Pataki's top political consultant; and Thomas Doherty, a former Pataki appointments secretary, according to state lobbying commission reports.
Some critics also note that Mr. Congel and his family have donated more than $37,000 to Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign in the last two years. 
At the same time, questions are being raised about the viability of DestiNY USA and whether it truly is, as billed, a salve for some of upstate New York's economic troubles.
"Why does he need public money?" asked Matthew L. Ostrower, an analyst at Morgan Stanley who covers retail-oriented real estate investment trusts. "He's going to put it across as a benefit for a place that wouldn't otherwise get it."
Whether a megamall in Syracuse can generate enough traffic to sustain itself is another matter.
"What he's probably not being as forthright about is that, certainly in this location, in this market, it doesn't make economic sense," he said.
Mr. Congel began his development career in the late 1960's, when shopping centers and office towers were financed by commercial banks and insurance companies. Wall Street did not invest in real estate in any significant way, and a developer was often described as either a hired manager or an independently wealthy, self-proclaimed visionary. He was neither of those.
Instead, Mr. Congel gathered partners, including Michael Falcone, who has gone on to become a prominent office developer, and he started with small shopping centers. An early break, according to articles published in 1987 in his hometown newspaper, The Post-Standard of Syracuse, came when the partners began working with a former executive of J. C. Penney. That helped Mr. Congel and Mr. Falcone secure the big department store tenants that are crucial to obtaining financing for a shopping center. As Mr. Falcone turned his attention to office development, Mr. Congel went on to build larger and more expensive malls, often on unattractive lots.
"He looks for pieces of land that can get rezoned, and they usually have environmental problems," said Lynne B. Sagalyn, director of the real estate program at Columbia University's business school.
Instead of going public, as many of his contemporaries did, Mr. Congel kept forming partnerships, pulling together private equity capital and quiet, institutional financiers. For each of about two dozen mall projects, there was a new general partnership. For each new general partnership, there was a so-called sponsoring partner, a public face to handle publicity and controversy.
Along the way, he drew a scolding from a state ethics panel that investigated his campaign contributions. The records also show a history of lawsuits from environmentalists and from his own contractors, and a judge's order to pay punitive damages to joint venture partners.
"He's going to get his way no matter what, through politics or his connections or by being a 900-pound gorilla," said Steven G. DeRegis, a member of the Syracuse Common Council, who has battled Mr. Congel over his mall contract.
"If you sign a contract with him, you'd better read the fine print. If you don't read the fine print, you're going to get dimes on the dollar on what he owes you," Mr. DeRegis said. 
Mr. Congel, through a spokesman, declined interview requests, and several senior executives of his main company, Pyramid Management Group, did not return phone calls.
Developers get sued, but some of Mr. Congel's companies' legal fights are unusual even by the standards of big-city builders. Several project partners accused him in an unresolved civil case in federal court in the Northern District of New York of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and of draining funds owed to his co-investors to finance new malls and expansions. 
Mr. Congel came close to getting out of the business in 1998, hiring Chase Manhattan to explore a sale of the equity in Pyramid, according to Wall Street bankers and news reports at the time. Instead, he stayed in the business and turned his attention to DestiNY USA.
Robust and active, he is said to enjoy hunting, skiing and tennis. But his passion is said to be business, particularly negotiating,and the DestiNY USA project apparently appealed to him on many levels. Besides its ambition, it offers him, he has said, the opportunity to improve his hometown for his children and grandchildren.
"This could be his legacy," said Richard W. Latella, a managing director of the real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield who has worked on Mr. Congel's projects, often as an appraiser for his lenders.
Since the project was first floated in the summer of 2000, Mr. Congel has variously said it will include hotels, a golf course, environmentally sound construction methods, movie theaters, parks and concert halls. It is estimated to cost $2.2 billion and would expand the 1.5-million-square-foot Carousel Center mall in Syracuse by 3.2 million square feet. 
Some critics said he has kept the actual shape of the project murky on purpose. "He's trying every angle he can to make himself eligible for these tax credits," said Michael J. Wasylenko, a professor of economics at Syracuse University.
Mr. Latella said that is understandable: "If you're going to build it, build it with other people's money, that's for sure."

So Many Lennys Trying To Make It

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
LENNY COOKE had the ball on the left side of the floor, a hop in his step, a gleam in his eye. No. 33 in the home whites of the Brooklyn Kings, he turned on the defender and began to back his way in.
 "O.K., right here, he should be turning, facing, faking, going right around his man," said a courtside observer, the original King from Brooklyn, the Knicks' legend named Bernard. "You don't get the ball 20 feet from the basket and back your man in, at least not at the next level." 
 Cooke, continuing to use his posterior as a power drill, pounded the ball, as the defender gave ground. Tim Duncan was not coming to help; nor was anyone else. Inevitably, Cooke was deep into the paint, perfectly positioned to force a foul. 
 Bernard King, unimpressed, noted Cooke's shooting guard's size, a muscular 6 feet 6 inches, and said: "In the N.B.A., he's not going to be able to do that. He's going to have to make a quick move to the basket or create separation to get off his jumper."
 The basket did account for 2 of Cooke's 47 points in the Kings' 126-120 victory over the Brevard Blue Ducks on Tuesday night at the Schwartz Center on the Long Island University campus in downtown Brooklyn. Forty-seven points in a professional basketball game -- even in the United States Basketball League -- must mean something, but what?
 Did they suggest that Cooke is still the prospect he was heralded as when he went one on one with LeBron James a couple of years ago at one of those meat-market camps for high school studs? 
 James recently signed with Nike for a reported $90 million and will be anointed next week as the Chosen One, the first pick of the 2003 N.B.A. draft, by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Cooke declared himself eligible last year after a transient scholastic life and wound up unemployed, until landing this spring with the Kings, in the borough he grew up in, for paychecks of a few hundred dollars.
 Just turned 21, he is averaging about 30 points a gamein a budget-challenged league that has, nonetheless, graduated dozens to the aforementioned next level. The competition, an assortment of former college players, some of whom tasted the big time, most of whom are passing time, represents the best Cooke has faced. Yet if it is possible to score 47 points and grab 17 rebounds and not answer the most pertinent questions regarding his future, this is the place.
 "What you're looking for is the ability to shoot the jumper, put the ball on the floor, draw double teams, kick it to the open man," King said. "You're looking for the fundamentals, the conditioning, the ability to not play down to the competition."
 In downtown Brooklyn as part of a promotion, King, whose unique post-up game and explosive turnaround jump shot made him, at 6-7, virtually impossible to guard straight up during his prime, was responding less to Cooke's results than to the rudiments of his game.
 Of course King was familiar with LeBron but no, he had not heard of Lenny. How could it be, King asked, that Cooke was rated so high and veered so far off course? He listened to the story, with all the modern trappings: the academic woes, the high school hopping, the circle of sycophants, the bad advice to turn pro despite no evidence he was high on any team's list.
 "So many of these young kids think it's all about talent," King said. "That's what I told these guys before the game: be honest with yourself when you ask, did I work as hard as I could, harder than I did last time."
 He noticed Cooke trailing too much in defensive transition and bending over, hands on his knees, when play was stopped. But he liked his nose for the ball, his willingness to pass, his jump-shot range when Cooke hit a 3-pointer from the left wing, albeit his only perimeter basket of 18 shots made. 
 "In fairness, he's playing out of position," King said, a situation Cooke would later explain as life in a league with few quality big men.
 After a year and a half out of organized ball, Cooke is playing again, and that, ultimately, is what those 47 points most meant. He said he had rid himself of his posse and reconnected with Debbie Bortner, the New Jersey woman whose family Cooke lived with for a year and who cheered him on Tuesday night. He has an agent -- a former Bronx prosecutor, Ken Glassman -- who doesn't tell him he is LeBron, or the next best thing. 
 "The phone is ringing," Glassman said. "There's interest for N.B.A. summer league teams."
 Seattle has called and Boston, too, but every year now the odds get worse as the N.B.A. talent pool has widened to welcome the world.
 Too few LeBrons, so many Lennys, young men who embody an American system churning out players who are, sadly, overindulged and underprepared. 
 "I got bigheaded a little bit," Cooke said. "Now I'm just working on my game, four hours a day. 
 "Maybe," he decided, "last year wasn't my time."
 In time, so long as he keeps playing, keeps working, who knows? Far away from courtside, taken from a box score, 47 points represent more than half of what the Nets mustered per game against the Spurs. Thirty a night on average, in any league, should earn Cooke the chance at least to prove he can take his game outside the paint and the county of Kings.

HEADLINE: Costs and Approach Disputed in Lincoln Center Redevelopment 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
In resigning last week as chairman of the Lincoln Center redevelopment effort, the construction executive Peter M. Lehrer said in a letter: "How this project has been managed, along with its lack of openness and divisive management style, has undermined the ability for it to proceed in a timely, responsible and cost-efficient manner. Control and oversight as to how money is spent are woefully inadequate." 
 In an interview yesterday Mr. Lehrer, whose company, Lehrer McGovern Bovis, has managed projects like the Central Park Zoo and Euro Disneyland, said Lincoln Center had made the redevelopment more complicated and cumbersome than it had to be. "This was not hard," he said. "I've worked on some of the most complicated projects in the world." 
 In response, Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, said he was satisfied with the project's progress and its use of resources. "I've found our work very positive," Mr. Levy said. "And I feel very comfortable with where we are." 
Among the funds drawn upon so far are not only the city's initial $24 million contribution, but also Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $15 million. Mayor Bloomberg, a billionaire who contributes to several cultural organizations, made the gift anonymously in 2000, when he was on the board of Lincoln Center and before he was elected, several Lincoln Center executives have confirmed.
In his letter Mr. Lehrer said, "Approximately $19 million has been spent for planning with very little to show for it."
Much of that $19 million has been devoted to Avery Fisher Hall -- including travel by Lincoln Center and New York Philharmonic executives to evaluate other concert halls around the world. The architectural firm of Norman Foster had been preparing to make a design presentation to Lincoln Center and the Philharmonic on Monday, but the Philharmonic's announcement that it was moving to Carnegie Hall in 2006 scuttled that.
Mr. Levy said Mr. Foster's efforts would not be wasted. "We intend to pick up where we left off," Mr. Levy said. "Enormously good work was done." 
Avery Fisher Hall is now expected essentially to become the new Carnegie Hall, devoted to a variety of groups rather than dominated by one hometown orchestra, a shift that has wide-reaching implications for the larger world of classical music and the future of Lincoln Center.
"What is it, and who are the constituents now and what does the campus mean?" asked George Steel, executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, which presents traditional and contemporary classical music. "Is Lincoln Center more a presenter or is it a venue? These are the big questions you have to answer."
Jane S. Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, said she had begun to rethink Avery Fisher as Lincoln Center prepares to step up its presenter role. She handles programming of the Great Performers and Mostly Mozart series. "It isn't about scrambling to find bookings," she said. "It's about how does the new Fisher fit into the overall artistic vision of Lincoln Center programming."
Last week Lincoln Center considered turning Avery Fisher into an opera house to keep the New York City Opera from moving downtown. (The opera company wants to escape the acoustics of the New York State Theater, which was built for dance and muffles sound.) That would have left the country's leading performing arts center without a major orchestral stage. But after several days of exploring a City Opera move to Avery Fisher, Mr. Levy said, the idea had been shelved. 
"The answer is no, for technical reasons and programmatic reasons," he said. "It would require a new footprint and have a cost that began to approach what demolishing the building would cost. This option is simply ruled out. We just wanted to exhaust the alternatives."
Mr. Lehrer is the second to resign as chairman of Lincoln Center's redevelopment project. Marshall Rose, the real estate executive, stepped down in October 2001 out of frustration with the project's internal politics. 
In resigning, Mr. Lehrer said that the use of acousticians, engineers, architects and consultants had been excessive, a concern other critics of the redevelopment share. Among the architects involved so far are Frank Gehry; Cooper, Robertson & Partners; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Beyer Blinder Belle; Fox & Fowle; Olin Partnership; Diller & Scofidio; and Mr. Foster.
Mr. Gehry was paid as much as $1 million, those familiar with the redevelopment say, which at the time angered Lincoln Center's constituent groups, which said they were not consulted. 
In his letter Mr. Lehrer said the preliminary phase of the redesign of 65th Street was "in excess of $1 million, which is grossly excessive and unjustifiable." Rebecca Robertson, executive director of the redevelopment corporation, put the amount at $395,000..
Lincoln Center executives said Mr. Lehrer and the redevelopment were a mismatch from the start because he is a builder, not a developer. Mr. Lehrer said he was fully aware of the processes involved on the front end of a project of Lincoln Center's scale. "You're always there during the planning stage, and it takes years before a project begins," he said.
Typically the so-called soft costs for such projects -- pre-building expenses like design, legal fees and permits -- run 35 percent to 40 percent of the total construction cost, Ms. Robertson said. She said the Lincoln Center redevelopment's soft costs so far -- $18.8 million -- amounted to about 1 percent of the initial expected construction cost of $1.5 billion. The project has recently been scaled back to about $700 million because of the economy.
"We are within or below industry parameters for this stage of the project," Ms. Robertson said.
During the redevelopment's first phase, from 1999 to January 2002, the redevelopment corporation spent $13.7 million: $9 million in city funds and $4.7 million in donations from individuals, corporations and foundations, including $1.5 million from Lincoln Center's various constituent groups like the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet and the Philharmonic.
In the second phase, which started in February 2002, the corporation has so far spent $5.1 million: $1.4 million in city money and $3.7 million in raised contributions. In addition to Avery Fisher, the money has gone toward plans for the Juilliard School, Alice Tully Hall and the transformation of 65th Street, which is expected to begin in June 2004. 
The city originally agreed to pay for 16 percent of the redevelopment, having paid for 16 percent of Lincoln Center's construction from 1955 to 1967. Based on the redevelopment's initial $1.5 billion price tag, the city's 16 percent contribution would have amounted to $240 million over 10 years, the expected duration of the project. The city also established a matching arrangement whereby Lincoln Center would have to provide the remaining 84 percent.
The city has made it clear that it wants to see the remaining $14 million of its first $24 million installment spent on early infrastructure, rather than planning.
Mr. Bloomberg contributed to the project in response to a request from Beverly Sills -- then chairwoman of Lincoln Center, now chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera -- those familiar with the gift say.
In an interview Ms. Sills would not confirm the philanthropist's identity but said that during her tenure the donor was consulted each time money was used for the redevelopment. She also said she guessed the donor was satisfied with the project's progress. "Nobody gives a donation and in that short amount of time expects to see a building," she said. "It was for planning." 
Another $1 million was donated by the Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation in October 2000.
Among Lincoln Center's 12 constituent groups -- which include the Film Society and the Chamber Music Society -- there is both concern and cautious optimism that Lincoln Center can make the most of an artistic turning point at Avery Fisher Hall.
"Architecture is destiny in part, and if you look at Lincoln Center and say, 'What is it?,' it's those three buildings triangulating the plaza," said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, speaking of the homes of the Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and New York City Ballet. 
"That's what Lincoln Center was built on," he said of the Philharmonic. "They don't go quietly into the night. They'll be missed. On the other hand there's an opportunity. It means Lincoln Center Theater has to be better than ever before to help to take up the slack, as do all the other constituents of Lincoln Center."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
E.D.S. Will Cut 2,700 Jobs As Earnings Outlook Softens

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 18 

 BODY:
The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said today that it would cut 2 percent of its work force, or about 2,700 jobs, and sell some assets to save hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
 E.D.S., which has diversified through acquisitions, said it would focus on its core business of running technology systems for other corporations and governments. 
 Company officials, however, warned that earnings in the second half of this year would fall slightly short of analysts' expectations. Revenue for the full year will also decline as much as 5 percent from last year, they said. 
E.D.S. officials, meeting with analysts in New York, said that the job cuts would save $230 million a year and that the sale of assets would raise about $250 million. They did not say what assets would be sold.
The company, which has 138,000 employees, said it would take a charge of $425 million to $475 million this year to cover the layoffs and other cost-cutting moves, which will include the shifting of call-center and software-application jobs to countries where costs will be lower.
Michael H. Jordan, the chief executive, said the layoffs would be evenly split between the United States and Europe. Officials declined to say how many jobs would be shifted from the United States to other countries, including India and Brazil.
Mr. Jordan, a retired CBS chairman who succeeded Richard H. Brown in March, said the first job of E.D.S. was to stabilize and then increase its core information-technology service business. "It's three-quarters of our revenue; we've lost focus on it," he said.
Mr. Jordan said the company's problems were caused by the economic and technology downturns of the last two years; perceived weakness compared with the industry leader, I.B.M.; and costly contracts and acquisitions.
While E.D.S. plans to focus more on managing customers' technology needs, Mr. Jordan said, it will still look at opportunities in other fast-growing services, like handling a company's back-office functions such as billing and claims.
E.D.S. said it still expected to earn 33 cents to 38 cents a share in the current quarter, excluding charges, and 70 cents to 80 cents a share in the second half of the year. That would be less than the second-half forecast of 83 cents a share from analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
The company said 2003 revenue would be $20 billion to $21 billion, down from $21.5 billion last year.
E.D.S. has struggled since September under the weight of disappointing earnings, bankruptcy filings by crucial customers, and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into an earnings warning and a failed stock-hedging transaction.

HEADLINE: Kodak Reduces Profit Estimate For 2nd Quarter By About Half 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Every time it seems as if 2003 cannot get worse for the Eastman Kodak Company, it does.
 The persistently sluggish economy coupled with the inexorable migration of photographers to digital cameras has been steadily whittling away at its domestic and European sales. Yesterday, Kodak said that the SARS epidemic in Asia had decimated its sales in China, one of the company's few bright spots until now. 
 A result, Kodak said, is that its second-quarter earnings from continuing operations will be 25 to 35 cents a share -- less than half the 60 to 80 cents the company forecast in April and a far cry from the 68 cents that analysts were predicting. 
Yesterday was the third time this year that Kodak, which is based in Rochester, has pulled back on earnings forecasts, and investors punished the stock, sending shares down $3.22, or 10 percent, to $28.77. 
"The SARS outbreak, as well as concern about geopolitical tensions, is keeping people from participating in activities that foster picture-taking," Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman, said in a statement.
Indeed, Kodak's sales of film in China were down 50 percent in April and May compared with the months a year earlier, and analysts said June sales were looking even worse.
"China represents 3 percent of Kodak's revenues, so that drop isclipping one and a half percent off the top line," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, who has an underperform rating on Kodak.
China is by no means Kodak's only trouble spot. The weak economy in the United States and Europe has cut deeply into consumer travel, which in turn has hurt sales of film and prints.
Kodak has also floundered in its attempts to wring profits from digital photography. Recently, Kodak and Hewlett-Packard dissolved Phogenix, their joint venture to make prints from digital cameras, in part because the technology never worked properly.
Economically pressed conventional photographers, meanwhile, have been buying less-expensive films even as Kodak's marketing campaigns have urged them to move in the other direction. And competition from reloaders -- companies that collect housings from single-use cameras and refill them with cheaper film -- have forced Kodak to lower prices on its single-use cameras.
"The economy, digitization, pricing -- all have been problems for them," Mr. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs said. 
Kodak has also endured more than a bit of executive suite turmoil as film-oriented executives left and digitally oriented executives arrived. Martin M. Coyne, president of Kodak's photography group, and Daniel P. Palumbo, president of the consumer imaging products unit, both departed recently.
Antonio M. Perez, a former Hewlett-Packard executive, is now Kodak's chief operating officer. The consumer digital camera business is now run by Yusuke Kojima, a former Olympus executive, who said he would soon reintroduce Kodak cameras to Japan, where they have never sold well. Bernard Masson, recently with Lexmark International, the printer company, leads Kodak's digital display group.
Kodak has contracted out much of its camera manufacturing, and it said in November that it was contracting out the manufacture of its lower-price films as well. 
Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid, who has a buy rating on Kodak shares, expects Kodak will soon close its plants in Mexico and Europe. "Their best bet is to let Asian contractors do their manufacturing, their maintenance, their inventory control," he said. 
The worst may be over for Kodak, however. Amy Wiyninger, a digital camera analyst with the technology research firm ARS Inc., said that sales of photographic paper and development chemicals should pick up because more digital photographers are realizing that prints last longer than electrons. "This year, for the first time, everyone isn't just e-mailing images around," she said.
Kodak has fleshed out its portfolio of digital products. It has introduced several inexpensive digital cameras, and it has fine-tuned its Web pages and software to make it easier for even the rankest of amateurs to download images from a digital camera and have them printed. It recently acquired Applied Science Fiction, which makes self-service kiosks where customers can turn a roll of film into prints in less than 10 minutes.
Perhaps most significant, at least some photo retailers say sales have turned the corner. Mitchell B. Goldstone, who owns 30 Minute Photos Etc. in Irvine, Calif., said business had picked up nicely of late. More important, he said, rolls of film and memory disks that customers bring in are providing anecdotal evidence that they are traveling again -- or, at least visiting nearby Disneyland. 
"I'm seeing Mickey Mouse and the Matterhorn and Paris," he said. "The economy must be turning up."

HEADLINE: House Votes to End Federal Estate Tax as Senate Battle Looms 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18 

 BODY:
The House voted today to eliminate the federal estate tax, the third time in a month that Republicans have approved a large tax-cut bill over objections from Democrats that the government is being deprived of its lifeblood.
 The permanent elimination of the estate tax is a long-sought goal of the conservative Republicans who lead the House, and many said today that the measure would keep family businesses from dissolving to pay the tax upon an owner's death. Democrats countered that only a few thousand of the very richest estates have to pay the tax every year, and several said it was immoral to add to the nation's record-setting debt to benefit those at the economic pinnacle. 
 The vote was 264 to 163, with 41 Democrats joining the Republican majority in an indication of the intense lobbying by small-business interests in favor of repealing the tax. 
Today's bill will have a hard time in the Senate, where supporters will have to assemble 60 votes for passage under the chamber's budget rules. That barrier prevented a similar bill from passing last year, and barring a compromise that changes the House bill, supporters say they are probably four or five votes short in the Senate.
Nonetheless, the vote today represents a fulfillment of Republican promises to bring a continuing series of tax-cut measures to the House floor, whether or not they have a chance of passage in the Senate. Each vote -- and there will be many more to come -- further divides the two parties and the two chambers over a much larger underlying issue: the size of the national government in the years to come.
Although some Democrats criticized the specifics of the plan to eliminate the estate tax, many reserved unusually sweeping condemnation for what Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, described as a Republican effort to undermine the United States' fundamental social compact by starving government programs of money.
"The Republicans are bringing a continuation of their reckless tax cutting binge that they are on, to undermine the fiscal soundness of the country," Ms. Pelosi said. 
Republican leaders retorted that the estate tax was another example of how families and businesses were being taxed to death, stifling the nation's economic growth.
"This isn't just for rich people, this is for everybody who shares in the American dream," said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. "We need to pass this piece of legislation, so we can keep this American heritage of families working, of families creating wealth, of families creating businesses."
The estate tax now collects 49 percent of estates of at least $1 million per individual and $2 million for couples, which under current law declines to 45 percent of estates more than $3.5 million per individual in 2009. In 2010, the tax is scheduled to disappear, but then revert to its old top rate of 60 percent in 2011. Republicans wrote the law that way in 2001 to comply with Senate budget limits, working under the assumption that the tax would be eliminated by Congress before 2011. The measure approved by the House today would end that "sunset provision" and kill the tax permanently in 2011.
Repealing the estate tax would cost the Treasury about $162 billion in the next 10 years, a figure that could grow extensively if the exemption is extended. Opponents had a field day with the Republicans' willingness to raise the deficit for that purpose, but not to provide a full prescription drug benefit for older people or an increased child tax credit to low-income families, issues now also under debate in Congress.
"So you're going to give away $60 billion to 40,000 rich kids every year, and you're going deny 40 million senior citizens the health care they deserve in their old age," said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California. 
Supporters cited a study released today by the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee, which said the tax was a leading cause of the dissolution of family businesses. It penalizes saving to pass on wealth, they said, and encourages excess consumption.
But opponents said that with the current $1 million exemption, the tax only affected the wealthiest 2 percent of all estates, and by the time the exemption rises in 2009, only about 10,000 estates would be affected, or less than half of 1 percent.
Democrats today offered a substitute bill, sponsored by Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, which would immediately exempt from taxation all estates of $3 million for an individual and $6 million for a couple. Mr. Pomeroy said his bill would exempt 99.65 percent of all estates from taxation, including all but 400 farms.
But House Republicans rejected the proposal and any other compromise on the tax.
"This amendment tells you don't be successful, don't save your money, don't grow your business," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, the sponsor of today's tax cut bill. 
President Bush issued a statement tonight praising the House for its vote, but centrist Republicans and Democrats in the Senate expressed more interest in a proposal similar to the Pomeroy bill, aides said. That proposal would cost less than $30 billion in the next 10 years, an amount that could be covered with various increased fees and elimination of corporate tax shelters.
Senate Republicans agreed today to meet their House counterparts in a conference about another divisive tax issue, increasing the child tax credit for 6.5 million families who did not receive it in the tax law signed by Mr. Bush last month. The White House said that at a breakfast meeting today, Mr. Bush urged leaders of the two chambers to resolve their differences quickly, but Congressional officials said there was still no breakthrough in the positions of the two chambers. The Senate approved a modest tax credit bill that would impose no cost on the Treasury, while the House bill includes other large tax cuts that would cost $82 billion over a decade. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 21, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a House vote to repeal the estate tax referred incorrectly to the current rate for estates of at least $1 million. For 2003, estates of $1 million to $1.25 million are taxed at 41 percent; the rate gradually increases until it reaches 49 percent on estates of $2 million or above. (The 49 percent rate does not begin at $1 million.)

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 

 BODY:
Raising the stakes in Silicon Valley's fierce takeover battle, the Oracle Corporation increased its hostile bid for PeopleSoft by more than $1 billion yesterday in a new effort to pressure PeopleSoft's board to consider its offer.
 In the latest legal tit-for-tat, Oracle also filed suit today against PeopleSoft and J. D. Edwards, the software maker that PeopleSoft recently agreed to acquire. Oracle said the lawsuit was "in response to their collective efforts to eliminate PeopleSoft shareholders' ability to accept Oracle's tender offer." 
 A few hours after Oracle's announcement, the State of Connecticut said it had filed a lawsuit against Oracle, alleging the company's proposed takeover of PeopleSoft violates the state's antitrust laws and would damage its economy. The state is just two weeks from its planned first phase of a $100 million computer system based on PeopleSoft software. 
Oracle, the world's second-largest producer of specialized software for business operations, said it would offer $19.50 a share in cash for all outstanding shares of PeopleSoft, raising the value of its bid to $6.3 billion. Oracle's original offer of $16 a share was valued at $5.1 billion.
After previously insisting he would not go higher, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, said the company decided to increase the offer after meeting with some of PeopleSoft's largest shareholders during the last several days.
"Oracle remains committed to acquiring PeopleSoft and will not be deterred by management's maneuvers to maintain control of a company they do not own," Mr. Ellison said. PeopleSoft's shares rose 78 cents today to close at $17.93; Oracle's shares rose 7 cents, to $13.42. 
In response to Oracle's higher bid, PeopleSoft said its board would meet to review the new offer and make a recommendation to shareholders "in due course." PeopleSoft's board rejected Oracle's original unsolicited $16 a share offer; its chief executive, Craig Conway, called the bid "diabolical."
Oracle's revised offer for PeopleSoft comes just two days after PeopleSoft modified its bid for J. D. Edwards, a smaller rival, to include cash as well as stock, thereby eliminating the need for a PeopleSoft shareholder vote. By removing the shareholder vote, PeopleSoft made it harder for Oracle to challenge the J. D. Edwards acquisition and made a PeopleSoft acquisition less attractive.
As part of its latest offer, Oracle is asking for the cancellation of the revised merger agreement between PeopleSoft and J. D. Edwards, and that PeopleSoft's shareholders be allowed to vote on the matter.
Last week, PeopleSoft and J. D. Edwards tried to block the takeover by suing Oracle. In its suit, PeopleSoft said Oracle's takeover offer was a "sham" aimed at hurting sales and destroying the company as a competitor. 
Executives at Oracle said PeopleSoft had left it with few options but to go directly to PeopleSoft's largest shareholders. "Normally, we would rely on the management of the target company representing its shareholders to determine what is a fair price," said Charles Phillips, executive vice president of Oracle. "But since the management wouldn't meet with us, we went directly to the majority of PeopleSoft shareholders and asked them."
Analysts took Oracle's new offer as a sign of the company's determination to acquire PeopleSoft despite management's opposition. But they suggested that Oracle's latest price might not be its last. "It gets them in the red zone, but not in the end zone," said David Hilal, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. "It's going to give Oracle more support among PeopleSoft shareholders but I think they're going to want to see $21 to $22 to consummate the deal," he said, referring to the price per share.
Eric Upin, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities L.L.C., said he thought Oracle's original offer of $16 a share was a fair starting point, but believed the new bid was a necessary next step and clearly showed that Oracle was serious. "At $19.50 it looks like a good accretive deal," he said. "This dispels the controversy of how committed Ellison is. This clearly shows he's sunk his teeth in."
Connecticut's lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Hartford, alleges that an Oracle takeover of PeopleSoft would effectively reduce competition because it would turn the market for enterprise software into a two-horse race between German-based SAP and Oracle. "The two remaining companies would have more than 50 percent of the market," said Richard Blumenthal, the state's attorney general. "It's a classic antitrust issue." 
State officials also said Oracle's proposed merger could derail gains the state had achieved as a PeopleSoft customer. A takeover of PeopleSoft by Oracle would likely cost the state much of what it has already spent, state officials said, given that Oracle has said it would not continue developing PeopleSoft's product line.
"The threat is very real and very immediate that we will suffer huge financial loss," Mr. Blumenthal said. "In this industry, ending innovation is the death knell for any product line." Oracle's executives expressed disappointment over the state's lawsuit and said that Connecticut's assumptions about the potential financial impact of an Oracle acquisition of PeopleSoft were based on false information. Mr. Ellison sent Gov. John G. Rowland and Mr. Blumenthal a letter insisting that Oracle did not intend "to force any customers to migrate to Oracle applications."
Mr. Phillips argued that Oracle's strategy to focus on a single line of products was more promising than PeopleSoft's plan to keep developing the J. D. Edwards product line. "They should be more worried about PeopleSoft spending its R&D budget on J. D. Edwards products, because they're all duplicates," Mr. Phillips said.
Mr. Phillips said Oracle was encouraged that PeopleSoft executives appeared to be carefully reviewing Oracle's latest offer. He also suggested that Oracle still had a wide range of possible tactics to pursue no matter what PeopleSoft did next.
"It's early in the game," Mr. Phillips said, "and we still have plenty of innings left."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Quick to Get Big Donors to Cover Cost of Convention 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Reaching out to some of New York City's highest-profile millionaires and billionaires, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, organizers of the Republican National Convention said yesterday that they had raised nearly all the money they expected to need to stage the event next year.
 In contrast to past conventions, in which organizers have often struggled up to the last minute and beyond to raise money, organizers of the New York City convention said they had received financial commitments of about $60 million from several wealthy residents and corporate chiefs, with 15 months left to go before the opening gavel strikes. 
 The convention is scheduled to be held in Madison Square Garden from Aug. 28 to Sept. 2, 2004.
That figure is just $4 million short of what the New York City Host Committee has agreed to raise and is several months ahead of a schedule of fund-raising goals spelled out in the agreement with the Republican National Committee. 
The agreement was released to The New York Times yesterday under a Freedom of Information Act request. The city withheld 46 pages of the 453-page document because of what officials described as security concerns. The total budget for the convention is $91 million. The host committee has promised to raise $64 million to pay such expenses as renting the Garden, building a bridge between the Garden and the post office across Eighth Avenue, transporting delegates around town, building a podium and buying an entrance carpet. The city agreed to pick up the $27 million in costs related to police, fire, emergency services and insurance.
The chief contributors include titans of banking, Wall Street and real estate, including David Rockefeller, Jonathan M. Tisch of Loews Hotels, Sanford I. Weill of Citigroup, Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman Sachs and William C. Rudin, the real estate magnate. 
The contributors pledged several million dollars each from their own personal fortunes or from their companies or associates. Mr. Bloomberg pledged $5 million of his personal fortune.
Lewis M. Eisenberg, the co-chairman of the Host Committee and the chief organizer of fund-raising, said he believed the financial commitments reflected both civic pride and deep support for the first-ever Republican convention in New York, where President Bush and Vice President Cheney will begin their drive to Election Day.
Several of the financiers are Democrats or have given to both Democratic and Republican causes. They said for them any partisanship was trumped by the convention's benefits to the city economy, estimated at $150 million, and to the city's psyche in the aftermath of 9/11.
"It is not about politics," Mr. Rudin said, noting that the Host Committee is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. "It is about New York City and creating economic opportunities."
The city, according to the agreement, had promised to use public funds to make up any shortfall in the $64 million fund-raising goal, but it is almost clear of that obligation given the pledges of support. 
Mr. Bloomberg said he was convinced the city, in the same time period, could have raised enough money to play host to both the Republican and Democratic conventions. The city was a finalist for the 2004 Democratic convention but lost to Boston in part because the Democrats did not want to hold a convention in a city that was also wooing the Republicans.
"New Yorkis a place where there is a lot people who have done very well and where there is a spirit of philanthropy, sometimes for museums, hospitals, and sometimes for political stuff," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
He added, "I tried to get both conventions to come to New York, and we could have raised the money for both of them in the same period very easily."
Some groups believe the campaign finance law passed last year that bans large, unregulated donations known as soft money in political campaigns applies to the convention host committees. The Federal Election Commission is expected to issue a ruling this summer, though few people in either party believe the commission will agree and turn off the spigot for 2004.
Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group supporting the campaign finance law, said he believed donations like those New York City is expecting are illegal.
"Anyone who thinks donors putting up huge amounts of money for a convention do not get precisely the kind of influence that the new law is intended to stop are kidding themselves," he said.
Mr. Eisenberg said the donors had not been promised anything in return and had made their commitments out of devotion to the city or the president. But he said as host committee leaders it was "likely" they may be invited to choice convention functions.
Organizers began raising money in April, three months after Republicans officially chose New York. By contrast, it took the organizers of the 2000 Republican convention in Philadelphia more than a year to report raising $40 million. (It ultimately raised $60 million in cash and in-kind donations.) 
The agreement provides details on how the convention budget will be spent, although city officials said costs may be adjusted as the actual bills come in.
About $5 million will be set aside to rent the Garden; $750,000 to build a pedestrian bridge linking the Garden and the Farley Post Office, which will serve as the news media center; $1.5 million to transport delegates and convention staff, some of them in car service sedans; and, for more mundane matters: $36,000 for the delegate entrance carpet and $186,250 for portable restrooms. 
Decor and fabric coverings will cost $808,500; $2.49 million will go to the podium; $7.7 million for host committee events, and $1.2 million for office supplies.
The Host Committee has promised 20,000 first-class hotel or motel rooms, 2,000 of which will be one- or two-bedroom suites. The Waldorf-Astoria, for instance, has offered 1,165 of the 1,297 rooms available at that time, including 24 suites at $529 a night overlooking Park Avenue and with a large foyer, separate living room and one or two bedrooms.
The committee must also provide a lighting, sound engineering and air-conditioning consultant.
The city will provide a shuttle bus system arranged by the committee under a traffic flow pattern the city must draft to ensure everybody can get from their hotels to the convention reasonably quickly.
One provision may pose a challenge under any circumstance.
"Host committee shall use its best efforts to ensure that taxicabs will be available during the convention period to provide taxi service to participants of the convention at rates no higher than the rates in effect at the time of the convention period," the agreement says. It does not spell out how that will be accomplished.
The $91 million budget does not include the approximately $14 million both parties receive in federal funds to put on their conventions. That money typically pays for costs associated with the proceedings in the hall, such as salaries for staff members organizing the actual program, producing the party platform and props such as videos played on stage.

HEADLINE: REPORT BY E.P.A. LEAVES OUT DATA ON CLIMATE CHANGE 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to publish a draft report next week on the state of the environment, but after editing by the White House, a long section describing risks from rising global temperatures has been whittled to a few noncommittal paragraphs.
 The report, commissioned in 2001 by the agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, was intended to provide the first comprehensive review of what is known about various environmental problems, where gaps in understanding exist and how to fill them. 
 Agency officials said it was tentatively scheduled to be released early next week, before Mrs. Whitman steps down on June 27, ending a troubled time in office that often put her at odds with President Bush. 
Drafts of the climate section, with changes sought by the White House, were given to The New York Times yesterday by a former E.P.A. official, along with earlier drafts and an internal memorandum in which some officials protested the changes. Two agency officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the documents were authentic.
The editing eliminated references to many studies concluding that warming is at least partly caused by rising concentrations of smokestack and tail-pipe emissions and could threaten health and ecosystems. 
Among the deletions were conclusions about the likely human contribution to warming from a 2001 report on climate by the National Research Council that the White House had commissioned and that President Bush had endorsed in speeches that year. White House officials also deleted a reference to a 1999 study showing that global temperatures had risen sharply in the previous decade compared with the last 1,000 years. In its place, administration officials added a reference to a new study, partly financed by the American Petroleum Institute, questioning that conclusion.
In the end, E.P.A. staff members, after discussions with administration officials, said they decided to delete the entire discussion to avoid criticism that they were selectively filtering science to suit policy.
Administration officials defended the report and said there was nothing untoward about the process that produced it. Mrs. Whitman said that she was "perfectly comfortable" with the edited version and that the differences over climate change should not hold up the broader assessment of the nation's air, land and water.
"The first draft, as with many first drafts, contained everything," she said in a brief telephone interview from the CBS studios in Manhattan, where she was waiting to tape "The Late Show With David Letterman." 
"As it went through the review, there was less consensus on the science and conclusions on climate change," Ms. Whitman said. "So rather than go out with something half-baked or not put out the whole report, we felt it was important for us to get this out because there is a lot of really good information that people can use to measure our successes."
James L. Connaughton, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House advisory group, said, "It would be utterly inaccurate to suggest that this administration has not provided quite an extensive discussion about the state of the climate. Ultimately, E.P.A. made the decision not to include the section on climate change because we had these ample discussions of the subject already."
But private environmental groups sharply criticized the changes when they heard of them.
"Political staff are becoming increasingly bold in forcing agency officials to endorse junk science," said Jeremy Symons, a climate policy expert at the National Wildlife Federation. "This is like the White House directing the secretary of labor to alter unemployment data to paint a rosy economic picture."
Drafts of the report have been circulating for months, but a heavy round of rewriting and cutting by White House officials in late April raised protest among E.P.A. officials working on the report.
An April 29 memorandum circulated among staff members said that after the changes by White House officials, the section on climate "no longer accurately represents scientific consensus on climate change." 
Another memorandum circulated at the same time said that the easiest course would be to accept the White House revisions but that to do so would taint the agency, because "E.P.A. will take responsibility and severe criticism from the science and environmental communities for poorly representing the science."
The changes were mainly made by the Council on Environmental Quality, although the Office of Management and Budget was also involved, several E.P.A. officials said. It is the second time in a year that the White House has sought to play down global warming in official documents. 
Last September, an annual E.P.A. report on air pollution that for six years had contained a section on climate was released without one, and the decision to delete it was made by Bush administration appointees at the agency with White House approval.
Like the September report, the forthcoming report says the issues will be dealt with later by a climate research plan being prepared by the Bush administration. 
Other sections of the coming E.P.A. report -- on water quality, ecological conditions, ozone depletion in the atmosphere and other issues -- all start with a summary statement about the potential impact of changes on human health and the environment, which are the two responsibilities of the agency.
But in the "Global Issues" section of the draft returnedby the White House to E.P.A. in April, an introductory sentence reading, "Climate change has global consequences for human health and the environment" was cut and replaced with a paragraph that starts: "The complexity of the Earth system and the interconnections among its components make it a scientific challenge to document change, diagnose its causes, and develop useful projections of how natural variability and human actions may affect the global environment in the future."
Some E.P.A. staff members defended the document, saying that although pared down it would still help policy makers and the agency address the climate issue.
"This is a positive step by the agency," said an author of the report, who did not want to be named, adding that it would help someone determine "if a facility or pollutant is going to hurt my family or make it bad for the birds, bees and fish out there."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ART OF THE FIRST CITIES: THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDUS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). The most timely exhibition in years, as well as diplomatically dexterous and beautiful. It surveys the culture of the third millennium B.C., mainly centered in Mesopotamia, the crucible of Sumerian civilization, where art, architecture, law and writing developed with the rise of the earliest cities. The beginnings of a cosmopolitan art are in tiny cylinder seals and in figurines. The show is full of small objects that are monumental in concept. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

FREDERICK J. BROWN, "Portraits in Jazz, Blues and Other Icons," Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through June 29). This three-decade, 30-piece retrospective profiles a painter who has restlessly explored Modernist abstraction, Neo-Expressionist narrative and portraiture. His big, luxuriantly congested, storytelling pictures from the 1980's are the most visually rich and imaginatively expansive. His portraits of great jazz and blues musicians are, at their best, theatrically energetic. But a big double portrait of Willem de Kooning steals the show. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $3, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th century, Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Johnson).

* "DREAMING IN PICTURES: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LEWIS CARROLL," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). A photograph is at least as much a looking glass as it is a window. We see in it our own reflections and obsessions. A post-Freudian world has inevitably come to see C. L. Dodgson's photographs through the looking glass of his alter ego, Lewis Carroll. This provocative show tries to put Dodgson's pictures back in their context, to stress that we have lost touch with Victorian conventions, which Dodgson largely obeyed when he photographed little girls. Childhood to Victorians represented, as the show's curator puts it, an "alternate reality, a metaphysical state of preknowledge." Dodgson could pose his charges in adult roles, give them guns, daggers and exotic costumes, even portray them as odalisques and half-dressed waifs, because he and most of his audience believed so emphatically in their total insulation from the implications of such postures. These presentations do not so much underscore the latent sexuality of the child (as we post-Freudians would have it) as they do an obvious lack of it. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

* "MANET/VELAZQUEZ: THE FRENCH TASTE FOR SPANISH PAINTING," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 29). The Met has clearly called in every chip to make this show spectacular. The first rooms are a virtual survey of great Spanish painting of the 17th and 18th centuries; after that comes a virtual Manet retrospective, with some Degas and Courbet thrown in for good measure; then a virtual 19th-century American overview of the most gifted portraitists influenced by Spanish painting via Manet, Degas and Courbet: Eakins, Chase, Sargent and Whistler. The thesis of Spanish influence on French art is hardly new, but it is explored in such precise and fresh detail, discreetly, without pushing comparisons (in that respect it's not like "Matisse Picasso" at the Modern, notwithstanding the coincidental titled pairings) that you would have to be churlish not to leave edified and amazed. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through Oct. 6). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

"ELIE NADELMAN: SCULPTOR OF MODERN LIFE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through July 20). Despite the clarion title, this exhibition is too monotonous, stiffly installed and short on drawings to do full justice to the erudite, polymorphous achievement of the Polish-born American sculptor Elie Nadelman (1882-1946). Still, don't miss this opportunity to see his work in quantity, especially the streamlined wood figures from the 1920's and the small, truculent plaster figurines, which were found in his studio after his death. Their suave economy, ineffable stillness, delicate gestures and seamless blend of historical and popular sources place them among the most complex, fully visual sculptures in Western art. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Smith).

"NOGUCHI -- THE BOLLINGEN JOURNEY: PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, 1949-1956," Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (temporary space), 36-01 43rd Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 204-7088 (through Oct. 13). More than 100 photographs and drawings re-create Noguchi's travels from 1949 to 1956, on a grant from the Bollingen Foundation. The project was for an ambitious book (never completed) on the spaces and structures -- religious, monumental, classical and communal -- of familiar as well as less-documented societies. Besides providing an elegant travelogue, the photographs give some idea of the many sources that Noguchi drew on for his work. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck)

"THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF CHARLES SHEELER," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). This majestic progression of 90 vintage prints will cause some ripples in the big familiar pond of American modernism, within which Sheeler is known foremost as one of the chief instigators of Precisionist painting. But his most profound, original response to Cubism came through the camera, in tautly composed photographs of Pennsylvania farmhouses and barns, New York skyscrapers and Ford's River Rouge factory. Their confident fusion of abstraction and fact, reverence and scrutiny, puts them among the most radical art of their time; and they are an important precursor, at least in spirit, to both Pop and Minimalism. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"ANDY WARHOL: SCREEN TESTS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 1). From 1964 to 1966, Warhol shot 500 short, silent, black-and-white films of artists, musicians, actors, writers, filmmakers, models, curators, celebrities and hangers-on at the Factory. The Modern has restored 277 of these screen tests, representing some 34 hours of watching time, and now 28 are being shown continuously on six screens. The subjects include Baby Jane Holzer, Salvador Dali, James Rosenquist, Dennis Hopper, Cass Elliott and Susan Sontag -- but they are of variable interest. By shooting the films at one speed and playing them more slowly, Warhol exposed the mechanics of discomposure and charisma. Some people are fascinating as they lose charisma; others are not. It has nothing to do with handsomeness, histrionics, coolness, slimness, trying or giving up. The typology of charisma is as elusive as the typology of criminality. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $6; $4.25 for students and 65+ (Sarah Boxer).

Galleries: Uptown

* "THE HEART OF THE MATTER: THE STILL LIFES OF MARSDEN HARTLEY," Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300 (through June 27). This display of nearly 60 works is said to be the first ever devoted entirely to Hartley's still lifes. Glowingly alive, varying in style from abstraction to realism and in subject from delicate floral arrangements to the depiction of fish, a dead bird and ladies' gloves, they were painted with the same power and elan that went into his intense, vibrant landscapes (Glueck).

"SALLY MICHEL, MILTON AVERY: A PORTRAIT," Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through June 27). Also known as Mrs. Milton Avery, the widow of the artist, Sally Michel used her own name as a painter in her own right. This warm memorial tribute to Michel and Avery mounts a group of informal, private portraits of each artist done by the other. A wall of Avery by Michel, who died in January, shows him painting, napping, smoking, reading, thinking, leaning. A facing wall of portraits by Avery (1885-1965) shows Michel smiling, mothering their daughter, March, wearing a new hat and painting a portrait of her husband. This small show is an engaging celebration of a highly productive relationship (Glueck).

"PUERTO RICAN LIGHT: JENNIFER ALLORA AND GUILLERMO CALZADILLA," Americas Society Gallery, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950 (through July 20). Ms. Allora and Mr. Calzadilla are young conceptual artist-collaborators who divide their time between Puerto Rico and New York, and this show brings both places together. The centerpiece is a 1965 fluorescent sculpture by Dan Flavin titled "Puerto Rican Light (to Jeanie Blake)," which in this case derives its illuminating power from solar energy gathered in San Juan and stored in batteries in the gallery (Holland Cotter).

Galleries: 57th Street

ERIC FREEMAN, Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through June 28). Painting doesn't get much more retinal than Mr. Freeman's large, sensuous compositions of tubular bands of neon-bright color. Rothkoesque but devoid of cosmic consciousness, they are so aggressively decorative that they verge on decadence (Johnson).

"MARIKO MORI: WAVE U.F.O.," atrium at 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575 (through July 31). Of late, this Japanese artist, whose past work blended science fiction, fashion and esoteric Buddhism, has been designing interactive spiritual hardware, and this podlike container is her most ambitious piece so far. It accommodates three electrode-wired participants at a time, who are treated to a son-et-lumiere projection of their brain waves, followed by an eye-rinsing aurora borealis of Ms. Mori's devising. The high-tech work is fun while it lasts and must have cost someone a fortune to produce (Cotter).

* AMY MYERS, Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through June 27). Ms. Myers, who made her debut at Mary Boone a few years ago, makes an impressive reappearance with this show of large drawings. The single, big, complicated, diagrammatic structures in each are made of countless draftsmanly parts meticulously arranged. They suggest many concrete things -- space ships, ectoplasmic apparitions, sexual organs, mandalas -- but remain emanations of an intensely personal exercise in hard labor and serious play (Cotter).

Galleries: Chelsea

MERLIN CARPENTER, "Children of the Projects," American Fine Arts, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7366 (through July 19). Like a grunge-generation Philip Evergood, Mr. Carpenter has created a suite of brushy, intentionally clumsy and overbearingly sentimental paintings that allegorize the plight of inner-city children. A boy in huge sneakers resembles an op-ed cartoon about escapist dreams of athletic success. Two boys in hip-hop wear, one aiming a handgun at himself, illustrate suicidal tendencies nurtured by poverty. Something is being mocked here but it's not clear exactly what (Johnson).

LARRY CLARK, "Punk Picasso," Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100 (through June 28). This show is a walk-in tabloid that reduces looking to rubbernecking. An autobiographical collage of photographs, newspaper clippings, confessional monologues and personal memorabilia, it ranges through the artist's bouts of drug addiction, rehab, incarceration and marriage, as well as his books, films and their reviews. The intention to equate the heartlessness and outlaw status of drug addicts with artists is clear. But self-revelation is not self-reflection, and it is hard to admire the searing honesty of someone who is an exhibitionist to begin with (Smith).

BART DOMBURG, Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494 (through June 28). With a careful but not too fussy touch, this Dutch painter makes pictures of land, sea and architecture that exude a muted mournfulness. With titles alluding to the Holocaust, they are actually Gerhard Richter-style history paintings. "Schuhprufstrecke," a stony plot framed by curbstone, was a track where concentration camp prisoners were forced to test the durability of shoes (Johnson).

ELGER ESSER, Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through June 28). A former student of the balefully influential Bernd and Hilla Becher, Mr. Esser is a high-concept photographer, but his large color pictures of spectacular coastal geology are nevertheless visually stunning and romantically affecting. They also look slightly antique, as is appropriate, since they are based on descriptions and sketches of sites in Normandy by Maupassant, whom Flaubert had asked to help in his research for a novel about a pair of failed amateur geologists (Johnson).

DAN FLAVIN, Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105 (through June 30). Six of Flavin's most radically simplified fluorescent light sculptures turn this spacious gallery into an oasis of coolly luminous quietude that verges on ecclesiastical. Believers will feel blessed. Skeptics may reason that just about any tastefully spare arrangement of lights in such a space would have a similarly dramatic effect. Either way, the show speaks volumes about the idealism of radically materialist art in the 60's (Johnson).

KAHN & SELESNICK, "City of Salt," Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610 (through July 3). Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick's latest photographic campaign looks like something produced by Monty Python under the influence of Sufism. Accompanied by long, mythic texts, their panoramic, faux-antique digital prints envision Orientalist scenes of magical adventure, mind-expanding allegory and goofy absurdity. "City of Salt," a work built of salt, sugar and clay in the gallery, is less interesting, but it does evoke the idea of lost mystic wisdom (Johnson).

R. L. KAPLAN, "Paintings From the 80's," Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through June 28). This 63-year-old Brooklyn-born painter is self-taught, but his paintings don't look like Outsider art. Surrealistic, political and painted in a simplifying style, his medium-large pictures of fighting birds, gridded flags, imperial architecture, regal dogs and empty parks allegorize international politics in an enigmatic, mournful mood (Johnson).

"ONLINE," Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500 (through Aug. 9). Not about Web art but the traditional use of line, this 38-artist show includes too much that is only tangentially linear. But works like Daniel Zeller's intense fields, like a zany topographical map; Hilary Harkness's fantasy of sexy girl sailors, drawn with Ingres-like refinement; and Beth Campbell's branching diagram of her own possible futures suggest that a more focused investigation of the varieties of linear expression in contemporary art would be worth pursuing (Johnson).

"PIERRE ET GILLES," Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through June 28). The word kitsch takes on a new dimension in this over-the-top Shangri-la depicted by the French photographer-painter team (Pierre photographs their subjects; Gilles punches them up with paint and airbrush). Butch male beauties, kittenish sex bombs, preening athletes, pop celebrities, satanic saints and goddesses, jacks of all genders and raw scatological-erotic material a la Mapplethorpe are their preoccupations, embellished with kinky props and settings. Despite their ingenuity of the pair, and their much-touted impact on the art, news media and fashion scenes, the show, with its stale camp glitter, could top your can't-wait-to-miss list (Glueck).

ROB PRUITT AND JONATHAN HOROWITZ, "Surreal Estate," Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258 (through June 28). This amusing and annoying show is intended to sell a big Victorian house that Mr. Pruitt and Mr. Horowitz own in Fleischmanns, a Catskills town. The artists painted the house black and decorated it in campy, Gothic horror style. In the gallery, they created a kind of Halloween party scene with black walls, a rattling glass chandelier and digitally printed banners. A video called "Extreme Houses Visits Peacock Hill" spoofs Martha Stewart (Johnson).

HELEN ROUSAKIS, "My Own Nature," Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through June 28). Ms. Rousakis photographs unidentified objects submerged in water. In her evocative color and black-and-white prints they appear coated in tiny bubbles, blurry in some place and sharply focused in others, eerily glowing like submarine life forms on another planet (Johnson).

JOEL SHAPIRO, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000 (through July). If the sculptures of Donald Judd and Elie Nadelman had children, they might grow up to look like the best works in Mr. Shapiro's exhibition. They are the ones beautifully fabricated in various woods: airy, floating jumbles of tenuously connected boxes that visually resolve from certain angles into figures jauntily dancing or assuming graceful yoga postures. A pair of giant bronzes, however, look ponderous and overscaled (Johnson).

FRANK STELLA, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through June 28). Big, unpainted assemblages of steel pipe bent into curves, spirals and serpentine forms, as well as sheet metal and occasional punctuations of plastic materials, fill the gallery with aggressive energy. Mr. Stella's Cubist blend of biomorphic and geometric forms has a vaguely space-age look, but it is too familiar to make these works as spectacularly surprising as he wants them to be. (Johnson).

* DO-HO SUH, Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923, (through July 18). Mr. Suh's full-scale recreation of his vacant New York apartment, including outer hallway and stairs leading to a nonexistent second story, is a wonderful blend of the mundane and the miraculous. From a distance, it's ghost house, with translucent walls, stairs, doors, and kitchen and bathroom fixtures all made from sheer, slightly metallic blue, green and purple nylon. Inside you discover that everything from the door hinges to the toilet has been realized with loving attention to detail (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

"ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE," Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347 (through June 28). Location One is host to artists from overseas who want to explore new electronic media. Works by the latest guests include Isabelle Jenniches's absorbing video of people reading on the subway; Dominik Lejman's video of a swarming, seemingly imploding crowd of people; Jiun-Tin Lin's electronic play with the illusion and reality of butterflies; Javier Viver's prototypes for portable dwellings based on industrial packaging systems; and Daniel Blaufuks's 243 postcards, alternating with brief messages to unidentified recipients (Johnson).

COREY McCORKLE, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212) 431-4977 (through June 30). The best thing here is an optically captivating circular window made from hundreds of cross-sections of bamboo. See it from the street as well as from inside the darkened gallery. Mr. McCorkle's interest in the New Age cult of houseplants, represented in a two-sided mural of photographs of a gardening community in northern Scotland, is intriguing but not, thus far, fully realized (Johnson).

Other Galleries

"ART AFTER THE AGE OF MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION," Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270 (through tomorrow). This show, organized by the curator Eugenie Tsai, presents five inventive art recyclers. Marietta Ganapin makes densely patterned mandalas from tiny pieces punched from art reproductions; Devorah Sperber redoes Chuck Close using colored pipe-cleaners; Michael Cloud makes gridded abstractions of old master still-lifes; Anoka Faruqee incrementally replicates her own poured paintings using an asterisk mark; and Suzanne Bocanegra's whole-wall installation inventories "All the Petals From Jan Brughel the Elder's 'Sense of Smell' " (Johnson).

"HOMELAND," Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 431-1737 (through June 29). This shrewdly entertaining group show, organized by five young curators in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program, addresses the present American political moment. Pieces from the 1980's and 90's acknowledge a history of activist Conceptualism, but most of the work is new and includes a Web project that maps out surveillance-free paths through Manhattan, a commemorative Enron monument and a Muslim call to prayer adapted from an alarm clock (Cotter).

* "THE NEW WORLD'S OLD WORLD: PHOTOGRAPHIC VIEWS OF ANCIENT AMERICA," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through July 19). From the mid-19th century onward, photography played many roles in the frontier territories of North and South America: as a scientific instrument, a surveillance device, a definer of cultural identity and an aesthetic form. This beautiful show documents those uses and offers a sustained meditation on the shadow-play of picture-taking and politics (Cotter).

* DARIO ROBLETO, "Say Goodbye to Substance," Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through July 3). Mr. Robleto, who is 31 and lives in San Antonio, makes his New York solo debut with a show that suggests a Nobel Prize-worthy science fair project. Its small, laboriously handcrafted sculptures are made from, among many other things, plaster, driftwood, homemade crystals, antibiotics, prehistoric whalebone dust, gunpowder and melted vinyl recordings of the Beatles, Black Sabbath and Tammy Wynette. Its themes include utopian thinking, space travel, pop culture and American childhood, all viewed with an attitude of sunny despair (Cotter).

Last Chance

"AFTERSHOCK: THE LEGACY OF THE READY-MADE IN POSTWAR AND CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART," Dickinson Roundell, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 772-8083 (through today). The ready-made was the Dada brain child of Marcel Duchamp, who presides over this crowded group show of work by American artists, old and young, he has inspired. Several, like Jasper Johns and Sherrie Levine, are represented by classic pieces that retain their charisma even in an overcrowded installation (Cotter),

RUDY BURCKHARDT, New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)673-6466 (through tomorrow). This show of photographs and paintings by the Swiss-born photographer and filmmaker, who immigrated here in 1935, was assembled by the poet Vincent Katz. It focuses on Burckhardt's involvement with the forests, ponds, flowers and individual trees of Deer Isle, Me. His lovely, lyrical compositions range from a pastoral stream meandering through marsh grass to close views of lichen-covered trees. But when he tried to capture in oil what his lens recorded so well, the results are less than salubrious (Glueck).

FRANZ KLINE, C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through today). Kline was the archetypal Abstract Expressionist, painter of the big, explosive gesture. But his paintings are also exquisitely elegant, as this nicely installed nine-piece show of black-and-white works on paper and canvas shows. While the wide swaths of black that tumble like giant logs across "Harleman" suggest impulsive violence, the composition tells a story of order and chaos captured in a moment of perfect equilibrium (Johnson).

"NOGUCHI: CONTOURS," UBS PaineWebber Art Galleries, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through today). Organized by the Noguchi Foundation's curator, Bonnie Rychlak, this show stresses the role of the body in the sculptor's work. It spans 1926 to 1982, and the pieces range from portrait heads to the paper-on-silk scroll drawings that Noguchi (1904-1988) made during an early visit to China (Glueck).

* TONY OURSLER, Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100 (through tomorrow). Mr. Oursler returns to the deceptively simple device that made him famous, and has his best exhibition in years. Mobile human features are video-projected in luridly over-ripe color onto simple, bulbous white sculptures. Giant mismatched eyes, fat lips and big, snaggly teeth (no noses) make up weird, comical and oddly endearing characters. Their angry, anxious, erotic and nonsensical monologues enhance feelings of emotional confusion and vulnerability (Johnson).

* "TRANSMITTING THE FORMS OF DIVINITY: EARLY BUDDHIST ART FROM KOREA AND JAPAN," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Sunday). The role of Korea in the development of Buddhist art and thought in Japan and therefore in the formation of Japanese culture itself emerges from decades of habitual marginalization in this beautiful exhibition. Dominated by meditating Buddhas and handsomely attired bodhisattvas dating from the sixth to the ninth centuries, the show, organized with the Korea Society of New York, highlights the forceful stylization and subtle abstraction of the human figure, which, while common in Asian and African art, is rarely equaled in Western sculpture between the medieval and modern periods. Hours: Today, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+ (Smith).

HEADLINE: Spring Street, a Stroll for All Seasons 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LOURIE; Richard Lourie's latest book is "Sakharov: A Biography."

 BODY:
I grew oblivious to Spring Street. It was bound to happen. It's the street I take to leave my neighborhood at the west end of Canal Street, it's the street I take to get home. Over time it became no more than a stretch of cement between me and where I was going. But this year, after a winter like a recession that wouldn't quit, I decided to stretch my legs and walk the length of the street to where it dead-ends at the Bowery. 
 The first thing I discovered was that Spring Street was eminently strollable -- long enough to be invigorating but not so long as to be wearying. The pace is naturally leisurely because there is so much variety at ground level with nary a dull block en route. Its contrasts are startling. At one end there's the bar-restaurant Ear Inn, in a building dating from 1817; at the other the new rice-pudding-only Rice to Riches, whose design style is 22nd-century Jetsons futurismo -- from "Gangs of New York" to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" all on a single street. 
 As I walked, I also saw that cross streets make cross sections. Spring Street bisects three neighborhoods -- a still nameless stretch between West Street and the Avenue of the Americas followed by SoHo and an area north of Little Italy often called NoLIta. All three are examples of artists' districts discovered and then commercialized, but all three are in very different stages of the process, SoHo being the most advanced. 
Glanced into from its perimeters, the little anonymous enclave between the Hudson and Hudson -- the river and the street -- can seem forbidding, industrial, bleak: sanitation trucks and three blocks' worth of U.P.S. vans are not the props of many fantasies. But that first impression would be doubly wrong. The neighborhood is unusually chummy and has some of the oldest buildings in the city, dating from the early 1800's. Behind the bar, the Ear Inn displays the detritus of decades past -- whiskey jugs and long clay Dutch pipes, entire vanished generations, outlasted by their trash. 
An art zone in the 70's and 80's when Roy Lichtenstein and Larry Rivers had studios nearby, this area was spared SoHo's commercialized fate because no galleries opened there. Geographically, it was far enough off the beaten track that it didn't even have a name -- not really SoHo, West Village or TriBeCa. The artists called it Limbo. Known as the Upper West Side in the early 19th century when New York was young and small and all downtown, it was later referred to as the Lower West Side. Current attempts like NoCa (North of Canal) or Hudson Square haven't stuck. Udi Behr, a local kibitzer of genius, has suggested UPStown. Who knows? It might fly.
This neighborhood may not have a name but it has a definite character and flavor. Still populated by painters and writers, along with designers, video people and the sort of young Hollywood actors who prefer lofts to bungalows, the neighborhood is marked by wit and offhand eccentricity. Around the corner on Greenwich Street is a window where poetry and agitprop appear, like one sign that has President Bush saying: "Why should I care what the majority of the American people think? They didn't even vote for me."
Next door, at 488 Greenwich, is a rare-cookbook store whose proprietor, Joanne Hendricks, displays in her window offerings like "Sandwich Manual for Professionals." (Add lunchmeat B to bread slice A . . .) A few steps farther toward Spring is Castillo, a little theater that specializes in ethnic and political drama, which will be moving to Theater Row (543 West 42nd Street) in the fall. The southwest corner of Spring and Greenwich is Iberian: Pinxtos, a restaurant gem of authenticity and artistry, is Basque; Pao, Portugese, manages to be cozy and sexy all at once, and Kana, which serves tapas, has the late-night crackle of Spain.
The north side of the street has gone a little ritzy of late. A newrestaurant named Spring Street specializes in truffles; Giorgione, whose part owner is Giorgio DeLuca of Dean & Deluca, guaranteeing exquisite freshness of produce, is already threatening to become the Elaine's of downtown.
Other than the high-end furniture store Wyeth, this part of town is essentially shopless. But there are clubs, bars and lounges like Noca, Sway and the scruffy, semilegendary Don Hill's. What will probably doom this neighborhood to development and overdevelopment is not celebrity like SoHo's but something much simpler: riv vu.

Hip Clubs and Fire Museum
The two blocks of Spring between Hudson and the gates of SoHo at the Avenue of the Americas seem to belong to no part of the city, have no quality of neighborhood, are just pure downtown. At night a few clubs set out their bouncers and velvet ropes to herd their clientele -- young, overdressed, braving obstacles of weather and indignity in the firm belief that something at the other end will make it all worthwhile. 
Yet that block also has the New York City Fire Museum at No. 278, which first attracts the eye with its etched glass image of firefighters in profile and a video display of 9/11. For the country and the world the twin towers have become symbolic, iconic. Their meaning downtown is more down to earth. Sept. 11 was not only an attack on the country and city but on the neighborhood as well. The towers are what's missing when you cross Hudson and look south for oncoming cars.
What is best about the Fire Museum is the Americana -- in one case, a stuffed dog, the heroic companion of firemen who could not bear to part with him, a street mutt all heart. Just as wonderful is the red and gold beauty of the old fire engines, their ornate brass gleaming. A hand-drawn hose reel from the Long Island City Fire Department from 1875 is strikingly elegant.
Before 1865 all fire departments were volunteer and they vied with each other in dash and bravery, in baseball, parades and, aesthetically, in a range of objects used in parades and ceremonies; some, like the presentation shields, are particularly handsome. A red, slender horse-drawn fire sleigh of the 19th century reminds us of days when Lower Manhattan was mostly meadow and springs did indeed gush from the ground -- whence Spring Street derives its name.
The area's history is colorful and rowdy. George Washington was headquartered there; later it was chockablock with saloons and fishmongers, free black oystermen and home to the Boodle Gang -- infamous for garroting. During the Depression the west end of Spring Street was a Hooverville -- a shantytown for the homeless and jobless. There was once an El on Greenwich Street constructed with fanfare and now gone without a trace.

SoHo: The Next Generation
Eccentricity and experimentation may be long gone from SoHo itself, but it lives on at its western border at the Avenue of the Americas. A complex of theaters, an art gallery and a cafe, all existing under the general name Here Arts Center, preserve a bit of the flavor of those bygone days when art was more adventure than career. ACE Gallery on Hudson Street has the same feel of authenticity, but it operates on a larger, more professional scale.
SoHo is in very bad odor with the culturati. Those who still live there try to slip unseen out of their front door as if leaving assignations. The galleries have fled like startled pigeons, mostly to Chelsea, some to 57th Street. The fabled Spring Street Bookstore near West Broadway has now become a clothing emporium. It may still be possible to write a novel in SoHo, but not to buy one. 
Though SoHo has become a district of fashion, furniture and fine dining, traces of its previous incarnations can still be spotted. Vesuvio Playground, at Thompson Street, named for an old renowned Italian bakery on Prince Street one block north, is a little more than half an acre surrounded by chain link, with netless basketball hoops and hard wooden benches painted a deep municipal green. Old-timers from the neighborhood might reminisce here over a slice from Ben's Pizza at No. 177 about what the place was like even before the artists came and went.
And most of the restaurants in this section intersected by Sullivan and Thompson Streets are Italian -- Fiamma, L'Ulivo, Mezzegiorno -- ready to spill out onto the sidewalk at the slightest provocation of a warm breeze. Prince Street boasts the classic cafes Borgia and Tina, but Spring Street does have an establishment that is decidedly offbeat, Mix, half cafe, half shoe store. There's a touch of old SoHo cheekiness in that combo.
Charles Darwin would probably be as surprised to find himself on the British 10-pound note as to learn that Evolution is a store at 120 Spring that sells everything from saber-tooth tiger skulls (reproductions) to freeze-dried mice (real). For some reason, creationism has yet to inspire any boutiques. In any case, Evolution, the store, is a reminder that the ferocious change that marks New York is a law of nature.
In a way SoHo's evolution was fitting. It wasn't high-tech or medical offices that opened after the artists left but restaurants, furniture stores, clothing shops and establishments devoted to makeup -- Mary Boone replaced by Helena Rubenstein, Castelli by Armani. There's a certain continuity there as well, the beauty of art giving way to the beauty of adornment, the distance between triptych and lipstick shorter than suspected.

World of Artsy Commerce
Even in the blocks between West Broadway and Broadway there are some glimmers of the old SoHo, though some may postdate SoHo's demise. The open-air clothing and jewelry market at the corner of Wooster Street has that been-around-forever feel. Flint Butera, an artist who sells his work on the street, has been dodging the cops, critics in blue, for 13 years. And there are some nice contrasts. The classic bistro Balthazar -- vast, mirrored, celebratory -- is across the street from the Open Center, a "spiritual supermarket" where people are more concerned with past lives than today's dinner.
"You know what NoLIta stands for?" asked a woman with whom I'd struck up a conversation on Spring Street east of Broadway.
"Sure," I said, "North of Little Italy."
"Wrong," she said. "No Low-Income Tenants Allowed."
Wistful, bitter, the joke was simultaneously nostalgic and prophetic. Would the neighborhood simply be a rerun of SoHo, high rents squeezing out the creative spirits who gave the place its personality in the first place? But that may not be the right template at all. NoLIta was always a place of artsy commerce, of the "'sensibility store" that showcased its owner's taste and skill while also being a venue for vending its products. New additions to the neighborhood like the glowing futurist Rice to Riches and Cafe Lebowitz, with its Mitteleuropean decor and cuisine, are both examples of high design in the service of attracting customers.
It is a quarter of the young, judging by the clientele packing bars like Sweet and Vicious at No. 5 or easygoing eateries like Bread at No. 20; for the younger generations the conflict between art and commerce was never so pronounced as it was for preceding ones. 
The real clue to the future may be found in Spring Street's second etched-glass figure, that of Bruce Lee in the window of the storehouse of SSUR, whose outlet is at 219A Mulberry. The end of Spring Street north of Little Italy might yet be absorbed into an expanding Chinatown. The present will become another stratum of the past. Future historians will puzzle over the early 21st century when people could buy cigarettes in drugstores but couldn't smoke them in bars.

HEADLINE: Planes Fly Off the Line, But Not Alwaysto the Sky 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: TOULOUSE, France, June 19 

 BODY:
One day they will carry 150 people 37,000 feet above the earth, but at the moment these hulks are no more glamorous than television sets on an assembly line.
 Dozens of men crawl over the 110-foot fuselages of the Airbus A320 at the company's main plant here, drilling, vacuuming and laying cables. Wings will be attached, computers installed. In 10 weeks, crews will fly them to the far corners of the world. 
 And so it goes, maybe five planes at a time in this cavernous hangar, 20 a month. 
But both Airbus and the Boeing Company, its main rival, are as vulnerable now to the airline slump as at any time in the last two years, with no solid signs that the market for planes will improve soon.
Industry experts say several factors, including a glut of aircraft parked in the desert, could lead customers to defer deliveries. Banks and other financial institutions have shied away from financing purchases of aircraft because of their plummeting values. And some experts say that despite new jet designs from Airbus and Boeing, it is unclear whether the two are investing in the right kinds of planes for future travel needs -- especially as smaller jet makers like Embraer encroach on sales of 100-seat planes.
Debate has emerged over whether there are simply too many planes, and whether the production rate is making matters worse. There are more than 2,100 parked planes, according to most estimates, and aerospace executives and analysts say more than 500 of them could return to service.
"There are some people who believe there is a paradigm shift, that there are too many aircraft, just as there are too many cars, too much telecommunications capacity," said Robert Lamb, a professor of management at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who studies the industry.
Both Airbus and Boeing "will have the tendency to keep the rate up," he added. "They do not believe this is a sort of death-defying point of no return. They do not recognize this is a paradigm shift and they're in trouble. Both of them are going for the gold ring. They may act in ways that may seem irrational."
At the Paris Air Show this week, some Airbus and Boeing executives acknowledged that the industry had problems, though no one suggested that there was overcapacity.
"The three years ahead will be difficult for all industry players and for Airbus, too," Noel Forgeard, chief executive of Airbus, said at a news conference. The recent weakening of the dollar only compounds the difficulty of exporting from Europe, he added. Yet he said he remained confident that Airbus would deliver 300 planes this year and 900 planes between 2003 and 2005.
Alan Mullaly, who heads Boeing's commercial plane division, said his company would deliver 280 planes this year and 275 to 300 next year. Next year's estimate, he said, takes into account any softening in the market or possible deferrals.
Some experts see those numbers as overly optimistic. For one thing, they say, the airline industry will almost certainly not see real recovery until 2005 at the earliest.
Hossein Amir-Aslani, head of the airline and aerospace group at J. P. Morgan Chase, said at a recent talk in Paris that many analysts doubted whether Boeing and Airbus could meet their delivery goals. "I think they have a right to be skeptical," he said. A number of deliveries are set for Asian carriers that have suffered serious drops in passenger traffic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome, he noted. The return of planes from the desert, he added, could be especially bad news for aircraft makers.
John Leahy, chief commercial officer at Airbus, said that only a "very, very small number" of parked planes belonged to companies with backlog orders at Airbus. Likewise, Randy Baseler, vice president of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said his company did not expect to be much affected by planes coming out of the desert.
Airbus and Boeing executives at the air show did not address the possibility that even more planes could end up in the lots, a distinct possibility given the precarious state of many airlines.
"All eyes are on American," an executive of a large leasing company said. American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, is struggling to avoid a trip to bankruptcy court. American has a long-term storage contract with Avtel Services in Mojave, Calif., and Justin Loucks, Avtel's general manager, estimated that a Chapter 11 filing could add 60 planes to his lot.
In addition, airlines are trying desperately to cut capacity and to simplify their fleet types, strategies that require parking planes. Airline executives estimate that capacity must still come down about 15 percent in the United States before airlines can gain enough leverage over seat supply to charge higher prices.
The more planes it has in the desert, the more options an airline has. It could buy parked planes from their owners, whether leasing companies or other airlines, for less than it would pay for new planes from Boeing or Airbus.
Yet it would be tough for either Airbus or Boeing to decide to cut production, Mr. Leahy said, because doing so could result in a loss of market share.
Airbus has a backlog of about 1,500 orders right now, or five years' production at the current rate. Boeing's backlog is roughly 1,100. There can be long-term advantages to churning out planes quickly: the more planes that are out there, the more money a manufacturer can make on plane servicing and spare parts, Professor Lamb said.
Michael Allen, chief operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting firm in Connecticut, said European labor laws made it tough for Airbus to slow production. Boeing is laying off 5,000 people this year, on top of 30,000 jobs cut since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Airbus has not laid off any of its 46,000 workers.
Outside of questions on the rate of plane production, people in the industry are asking whether the two big manufacturers are reacting quickly enough to the growing challenge from Embraer, the Brazilian jet maker, which now has a product that can compete with the smallest planes made by Airbus and Boeing.
This month, JetBlue surprised the industry by ordering 100 Embraer 190's, valued at $3 billion, rather than the similar-size A318 from Airbus. JetBlue's fleet consists entirely of Airbus A320's, and low-cost airlines have traditionally remained profitable by sticking to one plane type, saving on labor and maintenance. But David Neeleman, the chief executive of JetBlue, obviously saw better economies in buying Embraer jets.
In May, US Airways ordered 170 regional jets, evenly split between Embraer and Bombardier. The airline's executives had managed to loosen clauses in the pilots' contract that limited the size of such jets. Other major airlines in the United States have recently negotiated similar concessions from pilots, so regional jet makers can now offer planes to those airlines to compete against Airbus A318's and Boeing 717's, both 100-seaters.
"You're not talking about a typical regional aircraft that the industry grew up with; you're talking about a mainline-look-and-feel aircraft," Robert W. Mann, an industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., said of the Embraer 190. "It's generally what business travelers want. There's some operating cost penalties that come with that, but you can't lose as much money with a small airplane as with large ones."
When asked whether Airbus considered the Embraer a threat, Gerard Blanc, vice president for programs, said Airbus' priorities were in developing planes in the 400-seat range.
Mr. Mullaly, the Boeing executive, was not aware that Embraer 190's had 100 seats. "You should check on that," he said when a reporter told him. He added that Boeing was not focused on the market for planes of that size.
As expected, Airbus and Boeing spent much of the Paris Air Show arguing over the competing philosophies behind their new jet designs: the gigantic A380 from Airbus, which will seat 550 or more passengers and has already received 129 orders, and the midsize 7E7 from Boeing, created to be more fuel-efficient than similar-size planes.
But it is doubtful that low-cost airlines -- and they are the only consistently profitable ones these days -- will buy those planes. If JetBlue makes money off the Embraers, that could mean big shifts in the kinds of jets that are in demand. And that could change the very planes that workers at the Airbus factory here churn out month after month in the hope that the machines will spend more time in the sky than in the desert.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tariff on Hynix Chips Draws South Korean Protest 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 19 

 BODY:
The South Korean government said today that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization next week against the Bush administration's decision to impose a tariff of nearly 45 percent on chips made by Hynix Semiconductor. 
 The Finance Ministry said it would also challenge a preliminary decision by the European Union in April to impose 33 percent tariffs on Hynix's chips. 
 In each case, the imposed tariffs were based on allegations that the South Korean government had unfairly subsidized Hynix. The company, which has lost more than $7.5 billion over the last four years, is controlled by its creditors, including several banks that are largely state-owned. 
Competitors like Micron Technologies, an American company that at one point came close to buying Hynix's main assets, and Infineon Technologies of Germany have complained that the bailouts, loans and loan guarantees provided or arranged by the state-owned banks amounted to subsidies that violated trade treaties. 
South Korean officials fear that the tariffs imposed on Hynix will set a precedent for complaints against other South Korean exporters, many of which do business with the state-owned banks and benefited from the government's efforts to right the economy after the financial crisis of 1997-98. The finance minister, Kim Jin Pyo, said today that the government needed to demonstrate that it was not subsidizing exporters.
The United States Commerce Department said Tuesday that it would impose final tariffs of 44.71 percent on Hynix dynamic random access memory chips made in South Korea, somewhat less than the preliminary 57.37 percent tariff announced in April. The duties do not affect chips made at Hynix's plant in Eugene, Ore. 
The Commerce Department said that Samsung Electronics, the leading producer of memory chips, had also benefited from subsidies, but, at 0.04 percent of the value of its exports, the benefit was well below the 1-percent threshold for imposing tariffs. Micron, Hynix and Infineon rank second, third and fourth respectively in market share after Samsung.
South Korean officials said the United States had not presented enough evidence to show that the loans and loan guarantees were illegal subsidies.
South Korean officials said that though the government took over a number of banks during the economic crisis, they have had a free hand in making loans and have not acted at the state's behest in bailing out Hynix.
South Korean semiconductor exports have declined sharply, falling to $5.97 billion last year from $10.4 billion in 2000.
The dispute comes at a time when semiconductor sales appear to be improving after several years of deep slump. While Samsung has remained profitable because of its strengths in consumer electronics and other fields, Infineon, Micron and Hynix all posted losses in 2002.

HEADLINE: Still Blowing Bubbles 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The big rise in the stock market is definitely telling us something. Bulls think it says the economy is about to take off. But I think it's a sign that America is still blowing bubbles -- that a three-year bear market and the biggest corporate scandals in history haven't cured investors of irrational exuberance yet.
 Or, to put it another way: it's hard to find any real news to justify the market's leap. Instead, investors seem to be buying stocks because they are rising -- which is pretty much the definition of a bubble. 
 Before the Iraq war, optimists attributed the economy's weakness to prewar jitters. They predicted a great postwar economic surge: oil prices would plunge, reassured consumers would open their wallets and businesses would start investing again.
We're still waiting. Oil prices are off their prewar highs, but they're still higher than they were last fall. Consumers seem to be spending a bit more, but we're talking about fractions of a percent. And businesses are still more interested in cutting costs and laying off workers than buying new capital goods.
There have been some pieces of good news -- a not-too-bad manufacturing survey here, a pretty good housing-starts number there. But there has also been bad news, especially regarding employment. Payrolls are still contracting; since the U.S. economy has to create 80,000 jobs a month just to keep up with a growing working-age population, the already miserable job market continues to get worse.
Don't tax cuts and low interest rates create the conditions for an economic rebound? Well, interest rates have been low for a while. And everything that has happened since 2001 suggests that Bush-style tax cuts -- which, because they are targeted on the very affluent, basically give people with plenty of cash to spare even more cash to spare -- provide very little employment bang per deficit buck. Meanwhile, desperate state and local governments are continuing to slash services and, in a growing number of cases, raising taxes, undoing much or all of the stimulus from the federal government.
Does the collective wisdom of the investor class perceive an imminent, vigorous recovery that is invisible in the data? The market isn't always right. It wasn't right when it sent the Nasdaq to 5000; it wasn't right in the fall of 2001, the summer of 2002 or the late fall of 2002 -- three would-be bull markets that fizzled. And selling by corporate insiders hit a two-year high in May.
Meanwhile, the average stock is selling at 31 times earnings, twice the historical norm. And if you take into account pension liabilities and the cost of stock options, that number goes above 40. 
A few months ago, some analysts began to argue that because interest rates were so low, even today's very expensive stocks were a good buy. I don't agree, but that's a long discussion. What's clear, however, is that investors' big move back into the market has been driven not by careful comparison of returns, but by the fact that stocks are rising -- and the fear that if you don't buy stocks, you'll miss out on a good thing. The new bull market isn't forecasting anything; it's just feeding on itself.
Could the story I'm telling be wrong? Of course. Maybe a vigorous, though still invisible, economic recovery will deliver the sustained, double-digit earnings growth that analysts -- apparently not chastened at all by recent history -- are once again predicting.
But even if that happy scenario comes to pass, it's hard to justify current stock prices -- because if the economy booms, the low interest rates that might conceivably make stocks worth buying at 30 times earnings will soon go away. If and when businesses start borrowing again, they'll have to compete for funds with the federal government, which will be running $400-billion-plus deficits as far as the eye can see. Meanwhile, foreigners won't keep lending us $500 billion each year; in fact, private investment inflows into the United States have already dried up.
Oh, and the banana-republic policies now being followed in Washington won't just drive up interest rates; they'll probably generate a full-blown fiscal crisis one of these years. That can't be good for equity prices.
In short, the current surge in stocks looks like another bubble, one that will eventually burst.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
West Side Gaining 172 Apartments

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
With unabashed hyperbole, the sign at the entrance to Hudson Park, a luxury rental building nearing completion steps away from the western extreme of 96th Street, calls the structure "The Door to Western Civilization." 
 The title is not meant to be taken too seriously, said the man who dreamed it up, Brian G. Edwards, executive director of leasing for the brokerage firm Halstead Feathered Nest. 
 Mr. Edwards was busily fielding apartment hunters and television reporters doing a story on the rental market the other day. 
What they had come to tour is the most recent entrant on Manhattan's West Side housing scene: a 16-story building that adds 172 rent-stabilized units with scores of different layouts to the neighborhood's inventory. 
Because the land on which it sits, formerly a Mobil gas station and parking garage, was acquired through a 99-year lease, Shaya Boymelgreen, the developer, couldnot put up condominiums, the category of construction for which he is best known. 
The building was in the works for four years. Mr. Boymelgreen was in protracted negotiations with the owner of the land, 323 Garage Company, which did not want to give up its automotive business completely. 
Mr. Boymelgreen -- who said he had projects under way or in the pipeline in Brooklyn and Queens as well as in SoHo, TriBeCa and Wall Street -- said the West 96th Street building was on the drawing board well before 9/11 or the economic downturn. 
"I couldn't predict what would be three years ahead," he said, "or that condos would continue to be strong and rentals not so strong, so we are giving lots of amenities" and periods of free rent. 
He estimated that the building, financed through the Fremont Bank, cost about $40 million. 
In exchange for tax breaks given under New York State's Real Property Tax Law, the apartments will be rent-stabilized. 
Under the law, initial rents are set at market rates with increases determined by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. When the tax breaks are phased out -- in this case, after 10 years -- landlords can ask whatever rents they want. 
What makes the building distinctive, Mr. Edwards said, is that there are 61 different layouts. 
"In most high-rises," he said, "the apartment on the second floor is the same as the one on the 32nd floor." 
Apartments at Hudson Park include studios (470 to 521 square feet, renting for $1,785 to $2,279); one bedrooms (603 to 852 square feet for $2,261 to $3,032) two bedrooms (917 square feet for $3,439 to $4,012); and two bedrooms plus den (about 1,000 square feet for $3,983 to $4,646). 
Concessions of one month's rent on one-year leases and two months on two-year leases will be offered. The first tenants are expected to move in next month. 
There are also eight triplexes of 1,200 to 1,650 square feet with two floors below street level. In addition, there will be 13 penthouses ranging from one-bedroom duplexes of about 900 square feet to two-bedroom triplexes of about 1,000 square feet. They will have their own terraces averaging 100 to 175 square feet. Neither the triplexes nor the penthouses have been priced because they will not be ready for occupancy until August or September, Mr. Edwards said. 
The street-level entry floor of the triplexes will include the living room, kitchen, a bedroom and bathroom. The floor immediately below is being called the recreation area. It will have two bedrooms and a bathroom, permissible under the city's building code so long as the floor is 50 percent above ground and the space complies with light and air requirements. 
The third floor down is being described as "tenants storage." (Asked if residents could store beds there, Mr. Edwards said yes.) 
The triplexes will also have gardens and patios, features not often found in rental space, he said. 
Amenities include marble bathrooms, black granite counters, maple cabinets and maple plank floors as well as a roof deck, a 15-seat stadium-style movie theater available for rent by tenants, a fitness center and a children's playroom. 
The facade, a combination of stone and synthetic stucco, is punctuated with horizontal bands and decorative insets. 
Mr. Edwards was optimistic about the rental market. 
"Even in a soft rental market," he said, "people are moving in. This is an international city. This is still the place where dreams are made."

HEADLINE: Financial Indicators Signal Possible Economic Rebound 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A crucial measure of future economic activity rose in May, exceeding analysts' expectations and bolstering hopes that the economy may be headed for a rebound. It was also the largest increase in the indicator since December 2001. 
 The Conference Board reported yesterday that its index of leading economic indicators, which serves as a signal of economic performance in the next three to six months, increased by 1.0 percent in May, after a 0.1 percent rise in April and a 0.2 percent decline in March. 
 Analysts had expected the index to rise 0.6 percent in May. 
The gain came after essentially flat readings in the beginning of the year. The Conference Board said it was possible that the two consecutive monthly increases could indicate the beginning of an upward trend. 
Also yesterday, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by a seasonally adjusted 13,000, to 421,000, a five-week low. The Commerce Department said the deficit in the broadest measure of trade grew to a record $136.1 billion in the first quarter as war tensions sent crude oil prices higher. 
Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, said the improved reading "finally points to a recovery, almost a year and a half after the end of the recession. But the dangers present in the first five months of the year have not disappeared completely." 
Mr. Goldstein said the main worry was a lack of business confidence. "This is one reason why it has taken so long to build any momentum in business investment in equipment and inventory," he said. 
Eight of the 10 components of the index rose in May, including real money supply, the index of consumer expectations, stock prices and average weekly manufacturing hours. 
Also contributing to the better performance were a rise in building permits, more new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and vendor performance. 
Patrick Fearon, an economist with A. G. Edwards & Sons, said it was encouraging that the rise in the index's components was so broad. He said he still expected a recovery through the rest of the year, but remained concerned about business spending and consumer sentiment. "We'd like to see a few more months of positive readings before we can say that the economy is accelerating in a sustained way," he said.

A Famed Resort Where Tourists Fear to Tread

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PATTAYA, Thailand, June 14 

 BODY:
It is as if the terrorist attack had already occurred. Beaches and bars are nearly empty. Tour ferries float at anchor in the distance. Even the elephants are idle, with few customers to ride them.
 Thailand's most famous beach resort is a study in suspended animation, devastated by a slowdown in tourism caused by fears of terrorism and SARS infection. 
 This week, things got even worse as Thailand found itself in the bull's-eye of the latest terrorist threats.
In the country's Muslim south, the police arrested three men they said were members of a terrorist cell that was planning to attack embassies and entertainment spots.
At the same time, on a visit to Washington, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared that Thailand was an ally in the worldwide campaign against terror, something he had strenuously avoided saying in the past.
Until now, the national policy has boiled down to the plea voiced today by a restaurant manager here: "Why us? We're friendly."
As soon as the arrests were announced, Australia, 88of whose people died in the terrorist bombing in Bali last October, issued a warning to its citizens to stay away from beach resorts in Thailand.
Here in Pattaya, speculation has focused on a popular nightclub and a central shopping plaza as potential targets even though, with so few customers, they would seem to be poor targets.
"I try to stay away from the plaza," said Munir Hasan, a salesman at one of the dozens of tailor shops that make it seem as though people come to Pattaya to get suits made as much as to go to the beach. "It's onpeople's minds," he said as he sat on the stoop of his empty shop.
One waitress told of the day a man with what seemed Middle Eastern looks had entered her nightclub, used the bathroom, then walked out again.
"We didn't know what to do," she said. "We were all afraid to go back there and look."
No figures were available to illustrate the slowdown in Pattaya, but these days it looks more like a stage set of a beach resort with a famous red-light district than the real thing.
At the empty bars, the lights flash, the music pulses and the pretty women wiggle in the doorways calling out: "Welcome! Welcome!"
On the beach, rows of striped canvas lounge chairs stand nearly empty under their forests of parasols. Young men wait by stacks of black inner tubes, ready to rent them out.
The surf laps quietly at the sand. Almost no one is out there splashing.
It has been like this for months, people here say. "Everybody is scared," said a travel agent here. "The Thais don't visit China and the Chinese don't visit Thailand."
Last year 10.8 million tourists came to Thailand and spent $7.7 billion, 6 percent of the country's gross domestic profit, said Somkid Jatusripitak, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs and tourism, in a speech this week.
Tourism has permeated almost all walks of life and has become part of Thailand's image of itself. "The land of smiles wears a smile as always," Mr. Somkid said bravely.
A receptionist at a nearly empty seaside hotel here said he was sure that everything was safe.
"We have video cameras everywhere," he said. "We can check everything. And in the garage we have a video camera. Every car that comes in, we have a record. And in the lobby also, and also outside the entrance."
Boonlua Chatree, who covers the police beat for the local weekly, Pattaya Mail, said the police were paying special attention to Middle Easterners, many of whom congregate in a small area known as Little Saudi.
He said prejudice against Middle Easterners is quite strong here among both residents and visitors.
On what is called Walking Street, in the heart of the city's entertainment district, one open-fronted bar has posted a sign that reads: "No Arab people to sit down here. We do not want Arab people consuming alcohol or molesting women. We respect your belief in Islam."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE POSTWAR TASK; 
U.S. Focus In Iraq Is on Repairs, Not Building

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 19 

 BODY:
The United States will focus on emergency repairs rather than on major reconstruction of Iraq's crumbling electricity, water and sanitation systems, the top American aid administrator said here today.
 "You won't see a lot of new buildings," said Andrew S. Natsios, director of the United States Agency for International Development, in an interview here. "We are going to take existing infrastructure and repair it." 
 Mr. Natsios said that the problems in Iraq are more complicated than he had initially expected, but he predicted that the United States would not increase the size of its $2.4 billion aid package for Iraq this year. 
His comments suggested that the Bush administration may be at odds with British officials, who are overseeing reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq and who favor a more ambitious effort to rebuild a good part of the country's dilapidated power and water systems.
Bechtel Group, the American contractor that has a contract to oversee repairs to Iraq's infrastructure, is also proposing a more comprehensive -- and expensive -- series of water, sewage and electricity projects over the next several years.
More than two months after the war ended, power outages still occur several times a day and have grown worse in many cities because looters have been tearing down high-tension power lines to steal the copper.
Sewage systems are backing up in many neighborhoods, sometimes filling streets with waste, in part because electricity failures prevent the sewage pumps from operating. None of the sewage-treatment systems in Baghdad or most other cities are functioning, which means that waste water is being dumped directly into the major rivers.
Bechtel executives showed Mr. Natsios a sewage treatment station in Baghdad today that had been looted of almost all its equipment, including a largeturbine that thieves apparently removed with the help of a large crane. 
Mr. Natsios admitted that he had been taken aback by the scale of the looting. He also authorized Bechtel to install six new generators at water-pumping stations in the southern city of Basra.
But Mr. Natsios repeatedly emphasized the importance of emergency repairs, while minimizing the need for fundamental reconstruction. "We don't need to build new sewage plants, new water treatment plants," he said. "Emergency repairs can probably happen in a couple of months."
Citing international studies, Mr. Natsios also said that child mortality in Iraq is higher than in India. Seventy percent of those deaths, he said, can be traced to infections from bad drinking water.
But in discussing ways to reduce child mortality, Mr. Natsios emphasized health measures such as immunization and "biofortification," or adding vitamins and minerals to products like flour, or administering them to people directly.
"Two treatments a year of Vitamin A could reduce child mortality by 25 percent," Mr. Natsios said. 
Echoing the words of L. Paul Bremer, the civilian administrator here in charge of Iraqi reconstruction, Mr. Natsios called for "devolution" of responsibilities back to local Iraqis in their own communities.
British military officials, overseeing reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq, have been arguing that much of this country's infrastructure, especially its power and water systems, were inadequate even before the war and need to be rebuilt rather than repaired.
"All that is happening is local repairs to keep the systems going," said Lt. Col. Duncan Bruce, commander of the Duke of Wellington Regiment, which oversees a large swath of southern Iraq. "What we now need to see are major repairs."

HEADLINE: Uneasy Iran: New Strains 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 15 

 BODY:
The jokes crop up all over town. 
 Since the Americans could arrive any day, muses the corner grocer, he had better start improving his English. A demonstrator running from truncheon-wielding riot police officers yells, "We need the Americans to comehere to give us freedom!" 
 A taxi driver, no friend of the government, frets that North Korea is too belligerent about acquiring nuclear weapons and may prompt American forces to skip Tehran and head for Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. 
Ever since the 1979 Islamic revolution, tensions have fluctuated between the United States and Iran. These days, the tension level is rising, not least because some Bush administration officials and members of Congress have suggested that American actions in Iraq could serve as a blueprint for Iran. 
Over the last month, the two governments have skirmished verbally almost daily over everything from Iran's nuclear program to American allegations that Tehran is meddling in Iraq and supporting Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to Iran's opposition to a Middle East peace settlement. On Wednesday, President Bush said the United States "will not tolerate construction of a nuclear weapon" in Iran. 
Strains are increasing at a time when events have pushed the sides closer together -- at least geographically -- than ever before. American forces are just 300 miles from Tehran on the Iraqi border and flank Iran to the east in Afghanistan.
Proximity is fraught with danger and opportunity. Washington and Tehran will have to find a way to work together to achieve some stability in the region or they will have to come to blows, analysts believe. 
"Over the past 24 years, Iran has viewed the United States as a hostile power that is only pursuing the Islamic regime," said Sadeq Zibakalam, a Tehran University political science professor. "Likewise, the U.S. perceives Iran as nothing but a troublemaker, a state that ultimately must be dealt with, primarily by talking to it, but ultimately by toppling it, getting rid of it."
"The only point left as far as the Bush administration is concerned is whether to attack it from outside or undermine it from inside," he added. "But neither of the perceptions are true for either country."
The founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, made hostility toward the United States a building block of his revolution. Iran's actions, starting with the seizure of the American Embassy in November 1979, ensured that it became a pariah nation for years. The United States still maintains economic sanctions against the country. 
The reformists around President Mohammed Khatami recognized the need for Iran to move out of isolation. Under his tutelage, the "Down with U.S.A." signs came down. 
But the reformists have always had to contend with the conservatives concentrated around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who have jailed those who even suggest reconciliation.
Yet political analysts find a subtle shift in Iranian views for reasons of both domestic politics and international relations. Domestically, the popularity of renewed relations with the United States could make whoever achieves it a national hero. Some analysts believe that is why former President Hashemi Rafsanjani has recently broached the topic. Internationally, the American successes at toppling governments in Iraq and Afghanistan have made Iran's ruling clerics take notice. 
"The conservatives see the destiny of Saddam, they see the destiny of Mullah Omar in Afghanistan," said Hamidreza Jalaipour, a reformist publisher and political scientist. "They realize they can't fight the U.S. The Imam Khomeini could fight the U.S. because when he spoke, two million people came out onto the streets. But these days there is no mass movement like that."
On the other hand, many believe that voices of support for an American intervention would reverse in the face of an actual attack. One veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who expressed hatred for the clerics said he would volunteer to fight again if American forces tried to cross into Iran. 
Political analysts here divide conservative opponents of any relations with the United States into three groups: the pragmatists, who would accept renewed ties if it won the country enough advantages; the die-hards who would never accept it as it would probably spell their doom; and those somewhere in between. 
What the conservatives want, and what some reformists and other opponents fear, is for the United States to accept Iran as a stabilizing force in the region and ease the pressure for domestic liberalization. Opponents of the clerics dread the idea that Washington will begin dealing with the people they would like to see pictured on a deck of cards, like the former Iraqi leaders. 
The United States and Iran had entered into talks focused on mutual interests in Iraq and Afghanistan but broke them off after Washington accused Tehran of harboring the Qaeda operative who planned three bombings in Saudi Arabia on May 12. 
Iran has dug in its heels, waiting for the day when its support in the fight against terrorism, the ambiguities in its nuclear program or its influence with Shiites in Iraq could become bargaining chips in talks with Washington. 
Privately, officials here say important issues in Iraq and Afghanistan make the resumption of talks inevitable, probably within weeks. 
Many reformists and conservatives in Iran dread the idea that the United States may be tempted to inspire a violent change in government. They expect that their new proximity to American forces will prove more of an opportunity than a danger. 
"We believe we need to have relations with America for the sake of progress in the country," said Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, President Khatami's spokesman, arguing that Iran cannot just be shoved aside given its Persian Gulf location and its 65 million people. "They know they need us. Our geographic position and our high population ensures a role for us in the future of the region. The whole world knows that."

HEADLINE: Talks Collapse on U.S. Efforts To Open Europe to Biotech Food 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19 

 BODY:
Talks between the United States and the European Union over opening up Europe to genetically modified foods broke down in Geneva today, the Bush administration announced, heightening trans-Atlantic tensions.
 American officials said they would soon request that the World Trade Organization convene a panel to hear their case, in an effort to end a ban that farm groups say is depriving agricultural businesses of hundreds of billions of dollars a year. 
 The Bush administration called Europe's policy illegal, saying that scientific research had shown genetically altered crops to be safe. The European Union "denies choices to European consumers," Richard Mills, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, said in a statement today. 
European officials said the long-term effects of altered food remained uncertain. They said they were disappointed by the administration's publicizing of the dispute.
The food dispute is one of a handful of trade fights between the United States and Europe and comes as tensions linger over the war in Iraq, which many European countries opposed. Trade officials also continue to haggle over steel tariffs imposed by the Bush administration last year, farm subsidies on both sides of the Atlantic, and an American law that reduces taxes for companies with overseas operations, among other issues.
"There have never been more of these litigations than there are right now," Robert E. Lighthizer, a trade lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Washington, said of the disputes. He said the relationship was "extremely contentious."
American and European officials met in Geneva today for a round of negotiations, known as a consultation, after the United States filed suit at the W.T.O. over the issue last month. Today's announcement means that the trade organization will soon begin selecting a panel of judges to hear the case, although a decision is likely to take months.
Genetically modified food -- which can grow more quickly than traditional crops and can be resistant to insects -- has caused scant controversy in the United States, where people eat it every day. Almost 40 percent of all corn planted in this country in genetically modified. 
In Europe, however, the environmental movement is more powerful, and a series of food problems, including mad cow disease, have made people far more skeptical of assurances of safety from governments and businesses. Some food packages there bear the label "GM free," and the initials are well enough known to be used regularly in headlines in British newspapers.
The European Commission has permitted the use of some genetically modified foods, like soybeans, in the last decade, but has effectively placed a moratorium on most new products.
The Bush administration and agricultural businesses view the policy as simple protectionism because American companies, which dominate the biotechnology industry,would benefit most from lifting the ban. Without it, American companies would export about $300 billion more in corn each year than they do now, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Scientific research has generally shown that genetically modified foods do not cause health problems.
"Countries shouldn't be able to erect barriers for nonscientific reasons," Don Lipton, a spokesman for the farm federation, said. "That's a very important principle in international trade."
In a speech last month, President Bush escalated the dispute by saying that Europe's policy was undermining efforts to fight hunger in Africa. African nations, fearing their products would be shunned by Europe, are avoiding developing genetically modified food that might help feed the continent, he said. "European governments should join, not hinder, the great cause of ending hunger in Africa," he said in the speech.
European diplomats reacted angrily to Mr. Bush's comments, saying that their health concerns were serious and noting that European nations spend a greater part of their budget on foreign aid than the United States. 
European officials have also said that they are surprised that the United States has highlighted the dispute recently. This summer, the European Parliament is scheduled to consider a measure that would establish strict labeling rules for genetically modified products, which could allow more of them to be sold.
Europe's resistance to modified crops received a political lift last week when a global treaty restricting them was approved. Although it is not clear what effect the treaty, known as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, will have on the trade dispute, it is likely to make it easier for countries to restrict importing the crops, trade experts say.
The United States, worried about the treaty's impact on American exporters, agreed only reluctantly to support it when it was negotiated in 2000.
Announcing that the talks between Europe and the United States had broken down today, Mr. Mills, the trade representative's spokesman, said in his statement that he was "disappointed but not surprised." 
He added, "We'll be moving forward with requesting a panel" to decide the case.
Willy Helin, a European Commission spokesman, said that European officials had explained their policy fully to the United States delegation today, but that they had expected the dispute to reach the next level.
"This is a first formal step," he said.
Argentine officials, who have joined the United States in filing the W.T.O. case, also attended today's talks, Mr. Helin said.
But other nations that have previously criticized Europe's position, including Egypt, did not, he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 21, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the collapse of talks between the United States and Europe over genetically modified foods misstated the amount that American agricultural businesses estimate they are losing each year because of a European ban on the foods. It is hundreds of millions of dollars, not billions. The article also misstated the estimated annual loss for the corn market. It is $300 million, not billion.

HEADLINE: Last Days For a Survivor Of Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The battered and disfigured Deutsche Bank building in Lower Manhattan, among the last remaining buildings damaged in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack whose fate has not been decided, has been deemed beyond repair and is expected to be taken down beginning next month, according to people involved in negotiations on its future.
 It will be the end of an unlikely symbol. In the days immediately after Sept. 11, 2001, the boxy, 40-story skyscraper next to the ruined World Trade Center became a talisman of hope to many rescue workers at ground zero. Human remains were found on its roof. 
 Sentiment downtown was overwhelmingly in favor of repairing it if possible, the thought of another building coming down being too much for many people to bear. At least eight buildings were destroyed and at least seven were seriously damaged in the terrorist attack.
The weeks have stretched into months, and now the building at 130 Liberty Street, veiled in black netting, has become an unwelcome symbol of decay -- "an ever-present reminder of the darkest moment in our past," Gov. George E. Pataki said in April -- in a neighborhood that is struggling to revive itself.
Mr. Pataki also directed that rebuilding officials "replace the shroud with a mural trumpeting a new symbol to rise at ground zero," the 1,776-foot tower designed by Studio Daniel Libeskind. 
The building must be disassembled more than torn down, covered in an airtight tarp to contain the asbestos and other contaminants that have made the building unusable. As a result, the cost of the work has been estimated at more than $100 million, according to people involved in planning the project. Insurance payments to Deutsche Bank are expected to cover most of the cost. The mural the governor ordered is expected to be installed on the tarp in September at a cost of $1.5 million.
Downtown residents and businesses have pushed government officials to force a decision about the Deutsche Bank building. "The only hope we have down here is in the rebuilding of this area," said Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, the neighborhood advisory board for Lower Manhattan and a director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. To many, she said, the building "represents the slowness of the progress down here."
What will happen to the property once the building is removed is still uncertain, although many people have made their interest clear. Deutsche Bank has expressed a willingness to sell it, according to people who have participated in discussions. 
The Bloomberg administration has indicated its interest in acquiring the property, possibly for residential construction. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said the area south of Liberty Street was "an emerging residential neighborhood," adding that the building "could be a mixed-use site, with a trading floor at the base with a separate entrance for apartments up above."
Officials at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are also interested in the future of the property. One version of Daniel Libeskind's plan for ground zero places a 1.67-million-square-foot office building there. 
Matthew Higgins, chief operating officer of the development corporation, said rebuilding officials had always considered the possibility of including the Deutsche Bank property in the overall planning for the site. But, he said, "it's premature to say whether we'd have an interest in the property."
Because of its proximity to the area's transportation hub, it might be attractive to a commercial developer, although it would be difficult to justify an office building there when 10 million square feet of space is scheduled to go up across the street over the next decade.
Since the Sept. 11 attack, Deutsche Bank has been battling with the building's four insurers over its fate, and the bank has maintained for at least six months that the structure is beyond salvage. The insurance companies disagreed, wanting to rebuild, at least until recently. Last week the bank reached a tentative settlement with the lead insurer, the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, which would allow the demolition to proceed, according to three people involved in planning the building's future.
Rohini Pragasam, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the settlement or the building's future. "We continue to work toward a final decision on the fate of the building," she said. Mark Schussel, a spokesman for Chubb, also declined to comment. A final deal requires approval by the three other insurers -- AXA, Allianz and Zurich -- and negotiations continue. 
The building, known as the Bankers Trust Building until Deutsche Bank merged with Bankers Trust a few years ago, was built in the early 1970's and contained 1.4 million square feet of office space. It was connected to the World Trade Center by a footbridge across Liberty Street and was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon Associates, the architecture firm that also designed the Empire State Building, and Peterson & Brickbauer.
Although steel falling from the south tower of the trade center ripped a 24-story gash in its northern facade, the building remained structurally sound. Its sprinkler system was triggered, however, and the combination of standing water, contaminants from the trade center, sealed windows and little direct sunlight spawned a robust strain of mold throughout much of the building. 
After an intense cleaning, the city health department declared the building free of mold earlier this year. The dismantling of the building will still require engineers to pay close attention to environmental hazards, accounting for most of the costs of taking the building down.
Raising scaffolding around the building to support the tarp enclosing the project will cost more than $10 million, according to a real estate executive familiar with the project. The removal of asbestos and other contaminants is expected to cost more than $70 million, while taking apart the structure will run at least $25 million.
The fate of one other building near ground zero remains unresolved: Fiterman Hall, a 15-story building at 30 West Broadway. On Sept. 11, 2001, its owner, the Borough of Manhattan Community College, was three weeks away from unveiling a $64 million renovation. The college has been working with the State Dormitory Authority and its insurers on the building's future.

HEADLINE: Time Running Out, Albany Is Stymied On Major Measures 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Friday, June 20 

 BODY:
As the last day of the regular legislative session wore on this morning, Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders had not yet reached agreements on a host of major bills, among them one to extend rent regulations. It appeared that the 2003 session was in danger of being notable as much for what had not been done as for what had been done.
 The long night of strained and often fruitless negotiations capped a contentious six months in which the Legislature passed a budget over the governor's vetoes. Many legislators said the wounds from that conflict had yet to heal and ill feelings hindered compromise. 
 As legislators worked into the pre-dawn hours, they still had not bridged their differences over renewing rent regulations that expired at midnight. The Republican governor and his colleagues in the Senate majority threw negotiations into turmoil by passing a surprise bill that would extend regulations for eight years and reduce the City Council's oversight. The Assembly Democrats, meanwhile, passed two different versions of their own bill, a straight four-year extension of the current law and a one-year extension. Earlier, on Thursday night, the city board that regulates rents passed a rent increase that was lower than expected. Page B1. 
Even without an agreement, the lapsed law would have no immediate effect on tenants, however, since most tenants are still protected by leases and it takes at least 30 days to evict someone. 
Some Democrats speculated the Senate version of the rent bill was a bargaining stance intended to be traded for something else yet to be made public. It remained unclear how the impasse would be resolved.
So many issues were still open that Assembly leaders said they planned to return later this morning. But the Senate said it would finish its business before daybreak and adjourn for the summer. Earlier in the day, the governor and legislative leaders predicted that they might even have to come back in the fall to take care of unfinished business.
"We'll see what happens later in the year," Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said after an afternoon meeting with the governor and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver.
There were a few agreements in an otherwise unproductive day of negotiations, lobbying and hallway politicking. By early morning, the Legislature had agreed on bills that would compel hospitals to provide emergency contraceptives to rape victims, increase penalties for sexual assault and ban the use of ephedra, a diet supplement. 
After two years of failed negotiations, the chambers were close to a deal today on revamping the state's program to clean up toxic-waste sites and to encourage the redevelopment of urban wastelands. Yet the bill had not been printed at midnight, and it remained unclear whether it could be passed before dawn.
A bill to replace New York City's old community school boards with new education councils also appeared headed for passage early today, though it requires a special message from the governor which had not been given by midnight.
The governor and Legislature remained at odds over many important bills. A bill that would have required lobbyists who try to influence state contracts to disclose their earnings and clients went nowhere. The drive to reduce the state's strict mandatory sentences for drug crimes, known as the Rockefeller laws, became bogged down today in disagreements over sentences for drug dealers who use guns or children or run other criminal organizations, despite a seven-hour negotiating session Wednesday night brokered by Russell Simmons, the founder of Def Jam records, who has become a self-appointed leader of critics seeking to change the laws.
Talks also foundered on a bill to save money by limiting the drugs given to Medicaid patients. Under such a system, adopted by more than 20 other states, a state establishes lists of preferred drugs. Medicaid recipients and their doctors must obtain permission from the state to use more expensive medications.
The Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats also could not come to terms on a bill that would have mandated insurance coverage for mental health problems, after the Business Council of New York State and insurers said it would cost them too much. Bills aimed at reducing insurance fraud and limiting the liability of car-leasing companies also went nowhere.
Some other bills drawn up for special interests died a quiet death. A bill that would have guaranteed certain tax breaks to a Syracuse developer to help him finance a giant mall was put on indefinite hold because of questions about the project, legislative aides said.
Several bills sought by tavern owners and tobacco lobbyists to water down the state's recently enacted ban on smoking in the workplace also remained bottled up in committee this evening.
Women's groups hailed the deal on the emergency contraception bill, which was expected to pass both chambers later today, as a victory. For the first time, it would require all hospital emergency rooms to provide emergency contraceptives -- high doses of birth control pills that can prevent pregnancy -- to women who have been sexually assaulted. Many New York hospitals already offer the pills.
The New York State Catholic Conference dropped its opposition Wednesday night after the bill was amended to include, among other things, a provision that hospitals are not required to dispense the pills to pregnant women. 
Only California, Washington and New Mexico have enacted similar laws, though proposals are being reviewed in nearly a dozen other states, according to advocates.
As dusk enveloped the gothic Capitol building Thursday evening, Albany leaders said they had put the finishing touches on a bill that would resolve a long-running dispute over replenishing the depleted state Superfund program, which oversees cleanup of the most hazardous waste sites.
The bill would create a voluntary cleanup program for abandoned industrial sites known as brownfields. The outlines of the deal, according to people close to the negotiations, would set aside more than $100 million for the Superfund program.
Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans also agreed that the stringency of the cleanup would be based on whether the site would be used for future commercial and industrial development or residential developments.
The state would also create a new inner-city brownfield redevelopment program modeled after its business redevelopment areas, known as Empire Zones. Developers would be offered tax incentives for developing brownfields in these areas.
The failure to reach an accord on a preferred list of drugs for Medicaid patients marked a missed opportunity to save money, administration officials and legislators said. The main sticking point, in the end, was how much of an exemption to include for mental illness, H.I.V. and AIDS.
Republicans wanted to exempt certain classes of drugs, like antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiretroviral drugs.
Democrats wanted, instead, to exempt types of patients, so that a person with mental illness, for instance, would have no trouble getting an antibiotic or a pain reliever that was not on a preferred drug list.
By all accounts, the Senate, Assembly and governor had moved close to a deal in the last three days.
The deal on a bill to replace New York City's community school boards with parent councils largely reflects recommendations made by a bipartisan task force earlier this year, legislative aides said. The new councils will comprise nine parents elected by parents of children in the district, two community members appointed by the borough president and a nonvoting high school senior appointed by the district superintendent. The old school boards were eliminated by last year's school governance law, which gave the mayor broad control of the school system.
The two houses also reached an agreement on a subject near and dear to many legislators' hearts: money they dole out for projects in their districts known as member items. About $170 million in member items was restored in a deal with the governor on a bill that made several technical changes to the budget the Legislature passed in May. In return for the member items, the governor received about $70 million for economic development programs that he controls, as well as an additional $30 million in other grants.

Bruno, said it remained to be seen if the Legislature would have unfinished business to resolve in the fall. (Photographs by Ting-Li Wang/The New York Times)(pg. B6)

HEADLINE: Rent Increases Are Approved As Albany Debates Law 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN and WINNIE HU

 BODY:
In a concession to tenants last night, the board that regulates the rents of about a million New York City apartments shaved a percentage point off a proposed rent increase. But hours later in Albany, state legislators fought past a midnight deadline over the future of rent stabilization itself. 
 Landlords were disappointed by the action of the Rent Guidelines Board, citing spiraling costs for property taxes, fuel and insurance. But still, the new increases of up to 7.5 percent were the largest since 1989. 
 The board, in a 5-4 vote shortly before 7 p.m., approved a 4.5 percent increase for one-year leases and 7.5 percent increase for two-year leases -- down from the 5.5 percent and 8.5 percent figures that the board initially recommended on May 5.
In separate votes, the board proposed an annual increase of 3.5 percent for residential hotels -- a reduction of a half a percentage point from the May 5 vote. The board did not change its increases on lofts of 4 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year renewals. The increases apply to leases renewed in the 12 months after Oct. 1, 2003.
And shortly before midnight, Gov. George E. Pataki and Senate Republicans pulled a surprise by introducing and passing a new bill that would extend the rent law by eight years, until 2011, and weaken it by allowing landlords to deregulate more apartments. It would also limit the City Council's authority to influence the rent laws. Assembly Democrats said they would oppose the Senate bill, apparently creating an impasse as the rent laws were expiring. 
The Assembly passed two different versions of its own bill, a straight four-year extension of the current law and a one-year extension. 
There was expected to be little, if any, immediate impact on tenants, since most are still protected by their leases. In cases where there is no lease, state law requires a landlord to give 30 days' notice before evicting a tenant. Indeed, the last time the rent laws were to expire, in 1997, the Legislature allowed them to lapse for four days before they renewed them. 
"We're right now in a really scary place," said Brian Honan, legislative director for Tenants and Neighbors, an advocacy group. "This is a real attack on not only tenants, but also affordable housing in New York." 
The vote by the rent board -- the first to be made up mainly of appointees of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- suggested that city officials were trying to be sympathetic to tenants in a time of economic distress punctuated by steep budget cuts, tax increases, a subway fare increase and the residual effects of the Sept. 11 attack.
"I think we were looking at the big picture, and the morale of the city," said Martin A. Zelnik, one of five new members on the board. "There's something to be said for a moral victory" in reducing the rates, he said. "I think we want to send a message to the city that we were listening."
Whether Mr. Bloomberg actually had a hand, subtle or otherwise, in persuading the members to back down from their preliminary vote was not clear. Marvin Markus, the chairman of the board, said after the vote that Mr. Bloomberg and Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, "had no input" in the decision-making process.
The tenant population is a major force, based on numbers alone. Of the city's three million dwelling units, about two million are occupied by renters, though nationally only about a third of dwellings are rental units. 
Of the city's two million rental units, about one million are stabilized units subject to the board's decisions. About 350,000 more are rent-controlled apartments, public housing and other government-related residences. The remaining 650,000 units are not regulated.
Every year, the board adjusts rents for the million regulated apartments. There has never been a rent decrease or rent freeze. After last night's vote, the tenants who packed the United States Custom House in Lower Manhattan voiced their displeasure by yelling, "Shame! Shame! Shame!"
Landlords were disgusted, too.
"I'm astounded," said Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, an owners' group. " This board is intent on destroying the existing housing that we have. This board cannot do its math."
At the same time, though, some board members, as well as people in attendance, noted that they were distracted by what was going on in Albany. The rent laws, originally set to expire last Sunday, were already extended four times by special legislation in the past week. 
The main sticking point was high-rent vacancy decontrol, a provision that allows landlords to eliminate regulations on vacated apartments once the rent reaches $2,000 a month. Mr. Silver, backed by tenants' groups, has called for repealing the provision, saying that it undermines the entire system by phasing out apartments.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Mixed Employment Data For May 

BYLINE:  By Janny Scott (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
 The official count of private-sector jobs in New York State shows that they increased in May by 6,900 on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to figures released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. But New York City lost several thousand jobs in May after a gain in April, some economists and the office of the city comptroller estimated. "Despite the optimism brewing on Wall Street, employers are clearly still reluctant to hire," said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist for Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate firm. "In fact, the securities industry had one of the largest one-month losses." There were also losses in retail trade, clothing manufacturing and private education, she said. The city's unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent, while the state's remained unchanged at 6.1 percent.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Seeking Buyers' Names In Tax Shelters 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service ordered one of the nation's biggest law firms, Jenkens & Gilchrist, yesterday to disclose the names of 600 wealthy clients who bought tax shelters that it considers abusive. The law firm said it would not comply.
 The shelters allowed taxpayers to fabricate a minimum of $2.4 billion of deductions to reduce their taxable profits, said Cynthia J. Mattson, a senior lawyer at the I.R.S., adding that the figure is likely to be many times that. The tax agency is sending a strong signal to professionals and the wealthy that it will track down tax abusers. In other cases, it is seeking the names of people who bought tax shelters sold by the accounting firms of KPMG and BDO Seidman. Like the law firm, they are fighting disclosure. Two other big accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young, reached agreements with the I.R.S. last year when it sought lists of tax shelter clients. 
 The I.R.S. won approval yesterday from a federal judge in Chicago to issue its summons to Jenkens & Gilchrist, which is based in Dallas. The law firm took in at least $72 million in fees for its tax shelters and probably much more, according to documents filed by the Justice Department.
The I.R.S. commissioner, Mark W. Everson, said that "attorneys and accountants should be pillars of our system of voluntary compliance, not the architects of its circumvention." 
"Where necessary," he added, "we will vigorously pursue those who in fact act as promoters of abusive transactions."
The order does not preclude criminal prosecutions of the taxpayers who bought the shelters or the lawyers and accountants who devised and sold them, said Eileen J. O'Connor, chief of the Justice Department's tax division, and Pamela Olson, the Treasury's tax policy chief. 
Jenkens & Gilchrist declined to answer questions, but said in a statement that it would not identify any clients whose names were sought in the summons, signed by Judge John W. Darrah of Federal District Court in Chicago.
The firm maintains that it did not sell tax shelters and merely gave advice.
"Americans have a right to consult with an attorney in confidence, and that only the clients themselves can waive that right," Jenkens said, adding that it expected the courts to uphold its position.
The summons does not apply broadly to people who sought advice, but only to those who bought tax shelters, said B. John Williams, chief counsel of the I.R.S.
The government has not used this particular type of summons before, Mr. Williams said, adding that it was aimed at blunting delaying tactics by the law firm. If the law firm fails to release the names within six months, then the normal time when the I.R.S. can take enforcement action becomes open-ended.
Jenkens & Gilchrist hired its own lawyer to review files in its Chicago office to determine if any clients bought tax shelters that the I.R.S. has deemed abusive. The Treasury Department requires promoters of such shelters, known as listed transactions, to keep records of the buyers and to turn them over when requested. The summons seeks in part to determine if Jenkens & Gilchrist flouted those regulations.
The lawyer who reviewed the firm's files, Daniel T. Hartnett, found that at least 607 of 700 clients whose files he examined bought tax shelters that were listed transactions, according to an affidavit by James M. Johnson, the I.R.S. revenue agent in the case. Mr. Hartnett declined to comment.
Several clients are already suing Jenkens & Gilchrist for selling what they say were worthless tax shelters. More lawsuits are expected.
Three Indiana men and a woman who sold their business at a $70 million profit assert in their lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, that Jenkens & Gilchrist sold them a tax shelter that was identical to one the government had earlier banned as improper. 
Jenkens & Gilchrist charged $2 million, Ernst & Young $1 million and the law firm of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood charged $75,000 for an opinion letter that the tax shelter was sturdy enough to withstand I.R.S. challenge.
The shelter was called Cobra -- for currency options bring reward alternatives. It used foreign-currency trades to generate losses whose only purpose was tax avoidance.
Tax shelters generally involve the use of complex transactions with no business or economic benefit other than to create paper losses and gains. The gains are taken by a partner who does not pay taxes in the United States, like an offshore bank or an Indian tribe, and the losses are taken by the buyer of the tax shelter to offset real financial gains. Typically, the transactions involve several layers of partnerships and other enterprises.
Nearly 100 tax shelters are under investigation, government officials said.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

"BRUCE ALMIGHTY," starring Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 94 minutes). Mr. Carrey embodies the scary possibility that at heart every human being is a sugar-crazed 6-year-old hellion gleefully wreaking havoc in Mommy and Daddy's fastidiously decorated living room. In this rambunctiously funny new comedy, his alter ego, Bruce Nolan, a frustrated television newscaster in Buffalo who is relegated to human-interest stories, gets to rampage at the loftiest spiritual level. At Bruce's darkest moment, God himself (Mr. Freeman) comes to the rescue and invites Bruce, who has been loudly cursing the heavens, to try his hand at running the universe while God takes a break. Chaos ensues. Mr. Carrey's infantile Almighty is selfish, capricious and shortsighted, and delights in cruel practical jokes. Ms. Aniston is Bruce's loyal girlfriend. And Mr. Freeman's deity is a wry, mischievous sage with a laissez-faire attitude toward the world (Stephen Holden).

* "CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS," with the Friedman family: Arnold, Elaine, David, Seth, Jesse and Howard. Directed by Andrew Jarecki (not rated, 107 minutes). Mr. Jarecki has used American self-absorption as the heart of his engagingly evenhanded and intelligently assembled first feature. Essentially, that's what "Capturing the Friedmans" is all about, the American middle-class obsession with documenting innocuous daily life with 8-millimeter cameras, and now videotape. Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove it into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and 8-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their home and lives. Mr. Jarecki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows that to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment. He layers the story, setting up his premise early in the film: that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story (Elvis Mitchell).

"THE EYE," starring Lee Sin-Je. Directed by Oxide and Danny Pang (unrated, 98 minutes). In this artfully scary movie from the Pang brothers, Thai-born filmmakers who work in Hong Kong, a young blind woman receives, along with new corneas, the ambiguous gift of second sight. Like Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense," she sees dead people, and what they want from her only gradually becomes clear. What makes the film so haunting and effective is the Pangs' mastery, especially evident early on, of simple, elegant shock-generating techniques. There are some computer-generated special effects, but the scariest moments come when blurry images come into focus, a process that replicates the wonder and terror that the heroine experiences as she comes to her senses and simultaneously learns not to trust them (A. O. Scott).

* "FINDING NEMO," with the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (G, 104 minutes). Pixar Animation Studios' wonderful new aquatic fable tells the story of Marlin (Mr. Brooks), a nervous, fearful clown fish searching the big, wide ocean to find his rebellious son, Nemo (Mr. Gould), who was scooped up by a fisherman. The movie's stunningly rich visualization of an undersea wonderland is matched by a sense of humor that is fresh, sure of itself and devoid of the cutesy, saccharine condescension that drips through so many family comedies. The wittiest characters are Marlin's absent-minded traveling companion, Dory (Ms. DeGeneres), a cheery blue tang afflicted with short-term memory loss, and Bruce (Mr. Humphries), a scary Great White Shark who has adopted a 12-step program to curb his insatiable appetite for other fish. The movie is not quite up to the level of the "Toy Story" movies, but almost (Holden).

"GARMENTO," starring David Thornton and Katie McNichol. Written and directed by Michele Maher (R, 87 minutes). All the usual suspects from Seventh Avenue are in full, noxious flame in "Garmento," Michele Maher's scattershot satire of the fashion industry and its sins. This comic gallery of prima donnas and sleazy businessmen would be funnier if it tried half as hard and weren't so stridently overacted. The story focuses on the successful revival of a defunct line of disco-era jeans (remember Calvin Klein) on the wings of a scandalous ad campaign invoking pedophilia (Holden).

"THE HARD WORD," starring Guy Pearce, Rachel Griffiths and Robert Taylor. Written and directed by Scott Roberts (R, 103 minutes). This action-comedy heist film is amusingly gamy, an anecdotal crime film that's an antidote to the pile of overly slick robbery pictures of the last few years. Unlike such gaudy, gleaming toys, in which the hoods have access to so many devices and fleets of automobiles that you wonder why they couldn't just retire on what they're spending on pulling off the crimes, the Australian-based film is set in a trough of despair. It features a few tart rip-off scenes and a performance of back-alley bravura by Mr. Pearce in the lead as Dale, the thinking-man's hood who is the oldest of the Twentyman brothers, three accomplished thieves who are just about to be set free on bail. Their lawyer, the scheming, perfectly exfoliated Frank (Mr. Taylor), who's arranging their release, has also set up a bank job for them and turns against them by its end. The rest of the film involves the brothers' getting pulled into another robbery after getting out of the joint, and using it to plot their comeback. "The Hard Word" is a series of snatches and betrayals, with a couple of surprises that aren't terribly hard to figure out. But it has the asset of a grimy, slightly mildewy atmosphere -- a believably dank ripeness that's reminiscent of the British crime films of the 1960's (Elvis Mitchell).

"THE HEART OF ME," starring Helena Bonham Carter, Olivia Williams and Paul Bettany. Directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, (R, 96 minutes). The high-toned accouterments that signify the "Masterpiece Theater" style of wistful Anglophilia cannot redeem "The Heart of Me," an undercooked romantic drama set largely in London in the 1930's and 40's, from dullness. The story, adapted from Rosamond Lehmann's 1953 novel "The Echoing Grove," is a fable of betrayal and forgiveness in which high-strung, bohemian Dinah (Ms. Bonham Carter) recklessly embarks on a long-term affair with Rickie (Mr. Bettany), the husband of her proper sister Madeleine (Ms. Williams). The theme of forgiveness is blared in an early scene in which the clandestine lovers, romping through idyllic countryside, pore over a singsong verse by William Blake that invokes mutual forgiveness for "all eternity." Before the movie is over, the reiteration of that verse (the 1930's literary equivalent of Their Song) has become an annoying tic (Holden).

"HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE," starring Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Ron Shelton (PG-13, 111 minutes). Mr. Ford's character, a veteran Los Angeles detective with a callow young partner (Mr. Hartnett) and sundry financial and professional problems, may be a walking cop-movie cliche, something both he and Mr. Shelton seem happy to acknowledge. But rather than perpetrate another by-the-book exercise in copland corruption and underworld sleaze, Mr. Shelton opens the movie up, using its intricate plot as the frame for a collage of funny riffs and surprising performances. Mr. Hartnett's affable dimness disguises impeccable comic timing, and Mr. Ford does his loosest, wittiest work in years. The supporting cast is a goody bag stuffed with hip-hop strutters, mature bombshells and two bona fide music legends: Gladys Knight and Smokey Robinson, who plays a put-upon cabdriver. The movie is shambling, anarchic, self-indulgent and a whole lot of fun (Scott).

"JET LAG," starring Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno. Directed by Daniele Thompson (R, 91 minutes; in French with English subtitles). Can a vain, luxury-loving beautician in flight from an abusive husband find happiness with a dour, hound-dog-faced manufacturer of frozen foods who suffers from crippling panic attacks? That's the less-than-burning question posed by "Jet Lag," a peppy romantic trifle from France that rises above the mundane on the strength of its beautifully detailed lead performances. The potential sweethearts, Rose (Ms. Binoche) and Felix (Mr. Reno), find themselves stranded at Roissy-Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris during an air traffic nightmare. A relationship that begins with the borrowing of a cellphone turns into a shared overnight stay in a hotel, during which the strangers squabble, then begin to bond. Because the screenplay is as canny about human nature as the two stars, this odd couple's romantic rapprochement is surprisingly credible (Holden).

"LOVE THE HARD WAY," starring Adrien Brody and Charlotte Ayanna. Directed by Peter Sehr (unrated, 104 minutes). If ever a movie star embodied the lean and hungry look that actors consider synonymous with street credibility, it is Adrien Brody, whose character, Jack, in "Love the Hard Way" is a petty criminal who specializes in posing as a policeman and shaking down Asian businessmen in sexually compromising situations. But Jack is also catnip for the kind of woman who fantasizes taking a walk on the wild side. And in the shaky screen adaptation of a novel by Wang Shuo, Claire (Ms. Ayanna), the woman who goes for that stroll against her better judgment, is a studious biology major at Columbia. If its early scenes have a bracing, hard-boiled sting, the movie goes slack (and ultimately loses credibility) as it drifts into mushier territory and stumbles through three possible endings (Holden).

* "MANITO," starring Frankie G. and Leo Minaya. Directed by Eric Eason (unrated, 76 minutes). Made with very little money and a great deal of heart, Mr. Eason's debut feature is a loving, intimate and ultimately sad look at life in Washington Heights. It traces a hectic day in the life of a splintered Dominican family, whose pride and joy, Manny (Mr. Minaya), is about to graduate from high school. Mr. Eason's ear for speech is as impressive as his eye for local detail, and the film manages to be at once intimate and tactful. Frankie G., who play's Manny's protective older brother, Junior, has some rough edges, but he shows himself to be a powerful actor with the ability to display the nuances of his character's contradictory temperament. In the end, the movie swerves toward melodrama -- becoming a fable of The Streets rather than a story of particular blocks and boulevards -- but for most of its packed, brief running time it is beautifully observed and full of life (Scott).

"THE MATRIX RELOADED," starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers (R, 138 minutes). The mastery of filmmaking hasn't abated in "Reloaded." The Wachowskis are as suited to the task of guiding this sequel to their surprise 1999 hit as their unsure hero, Neo (Mr. Reeves), is to saving the world. Though the staging of the action sequences is as viciously elegant as you've been primed to expect, there's a dispiriting more-of-the-same aspect to the picture. The mentor Morpheus (Mr. Fishburne) and the virtual villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also return, and a whole new group of characters surface as Neo, Trinity (his lover, played by Ms. Moss) and the crew continue to fight the oppressive forces threatening to eliminate humanity and the hidden city of Zion. As the middle film of a trilogy, "Reloaded" seeks to increase the emotional stakes -- which it doesn't quite accomplish -- while leaving enough of a cliffhanger that audiences will flock back into the tents for the last portion. The directors pay their audiences the unlikely compliment of taking them seriously. Unfortunately, they take themselves too seriously. "Reloaded" has one of the most excitingly subversive and radical points of view ever seen in a major motion picture, however, a postmodern purview that accords equal weight to philosophical ideals from people of color. This includes the warmhearted spotlight given to Gloria Foster, who returns as Oracle, the source of all knowledge for Neo (Mitchell).

"MAY," starring Angela Bettis and Jeremy Sisto. Directed by Lucky McKee (R, 95 minutes). A facetiously witty slasher film that keeps its forked tongue firmly in its gashed cheek, "May" is the story of a female Jeffrey Dahmer who can connect to other people only in the most extreme ways. The title character (Ms. Bettis) is a simpering woman-child who works in an animal hospital and whose only confidante in the world is a doll her mother gave her as a young girl. When she meets a potential friend, she fixates on a favorite body part. In the case of Adam (Mr. Sisto), an aspiring filmmaker, with whom she has one disastrous date, it's his hands. Although it doesn't aspire to be more than a genre parody, "May" is movie-wise and alludes to Brian DePalma's "Carrie," Roman Polanski's "Repulsion" and Claire Denis's "Trouble Every Day," to name only three of many knowing references (Holden).

"THE NAZI OFFICER'S WIFE." Directed by Liz Garbus (unrated, 96 minutes). This documentary could just as easily have used the title of a recent potboiler: "Identity." And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, "The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust," questions of identity -- and the continual submersion of self to stay alive -- are the heart of the story. "Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear," says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism (Mitchell).

"PISTOL OPERA," starring Makiko Esumi. Directed by Seijun Suzuki (unrated, 122 minutes; in Japanese with English subtitles). For those who thought Seijun Suzuki's high-strung, lawless and watchably frenzied shoot-out drama "Branded to Kill" (1966) was hard to follow, his all-female remake, "Pistol Opera," which makes marginally more sense, will come as a relief. Imagine if Howard Hawks had remade "Rio Bravo" -- well, he did actually, but suppose he had done it with a female cast and stirred in a slowed sexual tension between the characters. That's what happens here. "Pistol Opera" is insanely likable but suffers from anemia; Mr. Suzuki obviously can't crank up the high-bore hysteria he used to generate, and using movement and placement to express character as much as dialogue in an enervated environment costs this film needed urgency. Stray Cat (Makiko Esumi) is given the order to eliminate the two top-ranked killers of the Guild. This will move the third-ranked Stray Cat up to the pole position, among other things; for those in need of logic, go see "Hard Boiled" or any of the hundreds of Hong Kong action pictures that took their lead from Suzuki's baroque and enthusiastic gunplay classic (Mitchell).

* "SPELLBOUND," directed by Jeff Blitz (G, 97 minutes). Mr. Blitz's first documentary feature, which follows eight participants in the 1999 National Spelling Bee, has enough suspense, humor and emotion to fill a season of Hollywood blockbusters. The children, whose backgrounds form a rich, complex American patchwork, are as remarkable for their individuality as for their sociological diversity. Somehow the picture's themes -- the peculiarity of the competitive spelling subculture, of its young adherents and of the English language itself -- add up to an unexpectedly rich and moving work of cultural insight and human sympathy. The movie is a celebration of intelligence, discipline and the irreducible oddness of American culture (Scott).

"TOGETHER," starring Liu Peiqu, Chen Hong and Tang Yun. Directed by Chen Kaige (PG, 117 minutes; in Mandarin, with English subtitles). The classical music that pours through "Together" infuses a feverish emotionalism into the story of a 13-year-old violin prodigy (Mr. Tang) and his devoted father (Mr. Liu), who would sacrifice everything for his son's future. These two and the third major character, Lili (Ms. Chen), a high-strung material girl from upstairs who becomes a fantasy figure and surrogate mother to the boy, are broadly drawn, almost symbolic figures in a movie that culminates with a weepy inspirational cloudburst. In the story, the father, an impoverished cook from the provinces, takes his son to Beijing to compete in a contest, and the boy eventually achieves his foothold, but not before almost blowing his chances. The movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Chen's hot-blooded portrait of the neighbor whose brassy exterior covers a soft heart (Holden).

"2 FAST 2 FURIOUS," starring Paul Walker and Tyrese. Directed by John Singleton (PG-13, 100 minutes). 2 loud. 2 long. 2 dumb. If the obtuse dialogue and the inane story don't bore you silly, then the crude, tedious racing sequences, replete with whining engines, squealing brakes and enough close-ups of clutch pedals and shifting knobs to fill an instructional video, will surely induce a grinding headache. 2 aspirin should do the trick (Scott).

"TYCOON," starring Vladimir Mashkov, Andrei Krasko and Maria Mironova. Directed by Pavel Lounguine (unrated, 128 minutes). The portrait of Platon Makovksi (Mr. Mashkov), a shady capitalist wheeler-dealer and economic kingpin in post-Communist Russia, roughly parallels the rise of the notorious Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky. This two-hour-plus movie wants to be an Eastern European answer to "The Godfather," and every now and then it lives up to that promise. The movie is fueled by Mr. Mashkov's blazing portrayal of Platon, a brilliant, charming, schemer and prankster whose high-rolling way of life eventually closes in around him. The tone of the narrative, which confusingly darts around in time, suggests a jazzy, comically edged film noir. If the movie feels convincingly wired to the moment, it is finally too scatterbrained and anecdotal for the strands of its story to cohere into more than an intriguing jumble (Holden).

"THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND," directed by Sam Green and Bill Siegel (unrated, 92 minutes). This documentary tells the story of the Weathermen, a splinter group from Students for a Democratic Society. This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former members of the Weathermen, now in their 50's or older, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement meant to them. The documentary is also packed with some of the most powerful images of violence of the period, like a bound Vietnamese being shot in the head at point-blank range and the bloody bed of the Black Panther Fred Hampton after he was killed. Voluble and charismatic, the film's stars -- the members of the group determined to overthrow what they considered to be a criminal United States government that waged the Vietnam War and targeted groups like the Black Panthers -- spent a lot of time in the media spotlight. Young, white and articulate, figures like Bernadette Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Mark Rudd, Brian Flanagan and Naomi Jaffe were clearly very sexy criminals. That exuberance and incentive has been captured by the directors. Mr. Green and Mr. Siegel have made a film of passions, and they establish a context that shows what a turbulent period the late 1960's were, slyly contrasting the peace-and-love vibe with events of the time. The film doesn't let its subjects off the hook, despite apparent sympathies toward their politics (Mitchell).

HEADLINE: Carmakers Around World Are Turning to India for Parts 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 19 

 BODY:
The scramble by the recession-wounded global automotive industry to find a source for low-cost, high-quality components has been a big boon to India's auto parts makers.
 Among the rash of announcements just this month was one by the Delphi Corporation, the world's largest automotive parts maker, saying that it would have $140 million worth of auto parts -- forged engine parts, intricate plastic moldings and other products -- made by Indian concerns, and that such orders were expected to exceed $250 million a year by 2007. The Ford Motor Company said that it expected to get more than $100 million worth of components from Indian parts makers in the next two years. Volvo said that it planned to increase its manufacturing in India to 100 million euros ($117 million) worth of parts in one year instead of three. 
 The demand has come even from China, a rival to India in low-cost manufacturing. And the orders are flowing throughout India's auto parts industry, to subsidiaries of Ford, General Motors, Toyota Motor and other major carmakers; to global auto parts leaders like Delphi and Visteon; and to homegrown auto parts makers, including Bhart Forge and Hi-Tech Gears. 
The flurry is spurring the industry to set ambitious targets.
Exports of auto parts are projected to reach $25 billion in 20 years, according to the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India. Already the exports, nearly two-thirds of which go to the United States and Europe, have risen to an estimated $800 million for the year ended March 31 from $578 million a year earlier -- a 38 percent spurt.
While the current figure is less than a tenth of the amount India's software exports bring in, investors in India's stock markets are bidding up the prices of auto parts concerns in the belief that the industry holds as much promise.
The parts makers' success thus far has come in large part from two factors that have already helped make India's software and support services industry successful: low labor costs and one of the world's largest technologically adept work forces. Additionally, locally produced raw materials like rubber and steel are inexpensive.
"Big carmakers are under huge pressure to reduce costs," said Hans-Michael Huber, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler India. And purchasing specialists from the unit's parent company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., are combing India for top-quality low-cost suppliers, he said.
The Toyota Motor Corporation is setting up its own auto parts unit on the outskirts of Bangalore with a $197 million investment to supply transmission systems to Toyota worldwide beginning in mid-2004. Toyota is also converting a textile machinery plant in another Bangalore suburb to produce auto parts. 
Much of the outsourced business is going to a handful of the more than 400 local parts makers. For example, India's leading auto components company by revenue, Bharat Forge, says its headquarters in Pune, southeast of Bombay, is being visited two or three times a week by delegations of product and supply experts from global carmakers.
Still, though India's auto parts exports are growing robustly, they account for just a minuscule portion -- less than 0.1 percent -- of the $1 trillion world auto parts industry. They are small even compared with those of other low-cost manufacturing centers like Mexico and Brazil.
But India's capabilities in a variety of manufacturing processes give it a competitive edge. "The level of manufacturing industry here rivals that in most of the developed countries," said Kiyomichi Ito, managing director of Toyota's new Bangalore-based unit, Toyota Kirloskar Auto Parts.
One sign of the new aggressiveness in the industry, as well as the many takers worldwide for its products, came in late May when the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India led a delegation of 33 domestic parts makers to the United States to meet with major manufacturers. Sundaram Clayton, Hi-Tech Gears, Shriram Pistons and Rings and Rico Auto Industries were among those represented.
"On earlier visits, we got the polite brush-off," said Arvind Kapur, managing director of Rico Auto. "But this time we had more than a dozen buyers surrounding us everywhere we went. From Ford and General Motors in Detroit to Cummins in Columbus to Caterpillar in Peoria, we sensed a desperation to source from emerging markets."
Rico Auto, based in Gurgaon, outside Delhi, sold $120 million worth of aluminum and ferrous engine and braking parts to G.M., Ford and other foreign customers last year.
When India opened its doors to foreign carmakers in the mid-1990's, nearly all the global car companies entered the market through joint ventures with local companies. They set up vigorous quality processes and brought in global quality certifications. "The local industry got tuned in to international needs, quality and logistics," Mr. Huber of DaimlerChrysler said.
Gradually, the bigger homegrown parts companies geared up to compete with the world's best, alongside Indian subsidiaries of international parts leaders like Delphi and Visteon.
Vinay Piparsania, director of sales operations at Ford's Indian unit, said, "India's small auto parts manufacturers are as much a success story as the country's software industry."
But as local manufacturers acknowledge, it has been a slow path to maturity, and some Indian companies are only beginning to emerge as reliable suppliers. "We relentlessly pursued Ford and General Motors to source from our company," Mr. Kapur of Rico Auto said. "In the case of General Motors, we had a breakthrough after seven years."
With India's credentials now more established, automakers like DaimlerChrysler are benefiting from the cost differential. "Indian firms offer 20 to 25 percent cost reduction, and this gets automakers excited," said Deep Kapuria, chairman of Hi-Tech Gears, also based in Gurgaon. Customers for his company's transmission gears and shafts include Cummins, the diesel engine maker, and Honda Motor.
Exports from India to DaimlerChrysler reached 63 million euros ($73.8 million) in 2002, up from 45 million euros in 2001. "Granted, this is only 1 to 2 percent of my company's total purchases worldwide, but the doors are now open and the most difficult part is over," Mr. Huber said.
DaimlerChrysler now buys forgings in Pune in western India, wiring harnesses in Gurgaon in north India and automotive software and electronics in Bangalore in the south. "Auto parts exports to DaimlerChrysler should touch 100 million euros by 2005, conservatively speaking" Mr. Huber said.
Still, the going may not be as easy as some parts makers believe.
Mr. Ito of Toyota said that the Indian legal system was not set up to uphold international business contracts, and that might hinder growth.
Then there is the fact that most of the 400-odd Indian auto parts firms are family-owned. While some have technology transfer relationships with Japanese and European automakers, many others have been slow to adapt to global business standards -- some are still learning, for instance, that failing to honor their commitments can incur heavy penalties.
Competition from other southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia is growing, and as in nearly every sphere of Indian exports, China is also an aggressive player.
As inexpensive car batteries from China flooded the Indian market a couple of years ago, nervous Indian car parts makers scurried to China to study the competition. But the Indians breathed easier when they found that while China had an edge in the lowest-cost work, it did not necessarily have an advantage further up the quality scale. 
Some Indian parts makers even sniffed opportunity there, led by Bharat Forge. Forged and machined crankshafts shipped to China now account for one-quarter of the company's $60 million in annual exports, up from nothing a year ago. "In metal-intensive components where software-oriented design and engineering is involved and where technically skilled manpower is required for manufacturing, Bharat Forge offers an advantage in terms of both price and quality," said Baba Kalyani, the company's chairman.
P. Balendran, a vice president for General Motors India, said that quality was central to India's appeal. "Qualitywise, India is better than Mexico, China, Taiwan or for that matter, Korea," he said, referring to South Korea. "In terms of price, India is 15 percent cheaper than Mexico, 10 percent cheaper than Korea and at par with China and Taiwan."

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Friday about rising demand for auto parts made in India misattributed a forecast for exports. The figure -- $25 billion in exported auto parts by 2023 -- came from Arvind Kapur, a member of the executive committee of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India, not from the association itself.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurial Spirit Leads Middelhoff to Investcorp 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 19 

 BODY:
Nearly a year after he was forced out of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann after clashing with the family that controls it, Thomas Middelhoff has finally landed a new job: as a partner with Investcorp, a global investment firm known for buying and selling gilded brand names like Tiffany, Gucci and Saks Fifth Avenue.
 Mr. Middelhoff completed a contract today to head the European corporate investment arm of Investcorp, which has close ties to investors in the Persian Gulf and is listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange. 
 "I would like a more entrepreneurial role," Mr. Middelhoff said in a telephone interview. "My network of contacts in Europe, whether in politics or business, will help me do this business with some success." 
For Mr. Middelhoff, 50, this decision ends a lengthy, closely watched job search, during which his name popped up regularly in the German news media as a candidate for any number of marquee posts.
Mr. Middelhoff was even briefly mentioned to be under consideration for a senior executive or board position at AOL Time Warner, after the departure of its president, Robert W. Pittman. His name was pressed by Stephen M. Case, then the chairman of AOL, who is a close friend of Mr. Middelhoff's.
"That made me happy and proud," Mr. Middelhoff said. "But I think there was never any chance." Mr. Case stepped down as chairman in May.
In recent months, as a buzz surrounding Mr. Middelhoff began to wane, he held talks with several private investment firms in the United States and Europe, among them the Blackstone Group. The discussions with Investcorp began about nine months ago, according to people at the firm.
Mr. Middelhoff said he was attracted to Investcorp because it is publicly listed, has a track record in the luxury-goods industry and has a solid reputation. The firm was started in 1982 by Nemir A. Kirdar, an Iraqi-born former banker at Chase Manhattan, to steer money from wealthy clients in Arab countries into real estate and other assets in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Middelhoff, who declined to reveal his salary, will receive an equity stake in the firm along with a salary and stock options, which he says will surpass what he earned as the chief executive of Bertelsmann, where he was one of Europe's best-paid executives.
Mr. Middelhoff will sit on Investcorp's 24-member management board, which comprises the most senior of the firm's 74 partners. He will report to the global head of corporate investment, Chris O'Brien.
Although he will be based in London, he plans to keep as his principal residence a family farm in Bielefeld, Germany, a bucolic town in Westphalia near Bertelsmann's headquarters in Gutersloh.
Mr. Middelhoff was thrust into the ranks of unemployed media barons last July, after he clashed with the family of Reinhard Mohn, which controls Bertelsmann. Mr. Middelhoff wanted to raise capital by selling more shares to the public, which would have diluted the family's stake.
The Mohns balked, prompting him to resign. They have since reasserted their control over Bertelsmann.
Unlike Mr. Pittman or Jean-Marie Messier, the ousted head of Vivendi Universal, Mr. Middelhoff left Bertelsmann with his reputation mostly intact. While the company made an unprofitable foray into the Internet during his tenure, its shareholder equity multiplied more than five times, to more than $10 billion, thanks to a hugely profitable investment in AOL.
As a result, his name was quickly floated as a candidate to run Deutsche Telekom, the debt-burdened state phone company that had recently forced its chief out.
Mr. Middelhoff said he was contacted by the company but the discussions went nowhere, mainly because the German government owns a controlling stake, which he viewed as an insurmountable obstacle.
"I had no interest in exchanging the Mohn family for the German government," he said. "It would have been another horror show."
Deutsche Telekom eventually promoted Kai-Uwe Ricke, a senior executive.
Perhaps Mr. Middelhoff's strangest near-miss came last winter, when he was offered a senior position at the World Economic Forum, the Swiss foundation that holds a rarefied conference of political and corporate celebrities each year in the Alpine resort of Davos.
The idea, people close to Mr. Middelhoff said, was for him to be a successor to Klaus Schwab, the one-time professor who turned the Davos conference into a global event. It became clear, however, that Mr. Schwab did not really want to relinquish his control, and Mr. Middelhoff developed cold feet.
At Investcorp, he said he would be free to invest in medium-size companies throughout Europe. Although he said he would naturally gravitate toward the media, telecommunications and technology industries, he did not plan to limit himself to these areas.
After 16 years of climbing the ranks at Bertelsmann, Mr. Middelhoff said he found the process of choosing a new job to be arduous -- not least because of the disorienting array of possibilities.
"For a couple of weeks, I really felt I should do something for society," he said. "I thought, 'You made your fortune, you should give something back.' But then I thought, 'You're too young for that. It is too early.' "

HEADLINE: Cities Made for Walking May Be Fat Burners 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
Does living in the suburbs make you fat?
 Probably, say several urban planners, architects and researchers who are studying how the design of communities affects human health. The reason, they say, is that people have to drive everywhere. 
 "We're not at the point now that we know that sprawl makes you fat," said Lawrence D. Frank, associate professor of urban planning at the University of British Columbia. "But if you choose to live in a sprawling environment, you are more likely to be overweight." 
Mr. Frank was an author of a new study that set out to answer this question: "If we make places more walkable -- denser, more mixed-use, more pedestrian-friendly and more interconnected -- do people in fact walk more, and if they walk more, are they healthier?"
With responses from 12,000 people, the authors determined that people who live in areas of low-building density (read: suburbs) tend to weigh more than people in higher-density, mixed-use areas (read: cities), even accounting for income, age, sex and ethnicity.
In Atlanta, at the lowest-density levels 68 percent of white men were overweight; at the highest-density levels, 50 percent were overweight. At the lowest density, 23 percent were obese; at the highest levels, 13 percent were obese.
The study found the same pattern for white women and black men, but did not survey enough black women to determine if it held for them.
Mr. Frank discussed his survey on Thursday here at a conference of the Congress for the New Urbanism, a movement that advocates more mass transit and pedestrian-friendly development. The movement's critics say the new urbanists are liberal, elite suburb-bashers who want government to control how and where everyone lives. 
Mr. Frank's colleagues at the conference agreed that his findings were important for supporting a long-held perception.
"The research is validating something that I've long observed when I've been in cities, which is that you see a lot of slender people," said Peter Katz, a marketing consultant and real estate developer from Alexandria, Va. "You go out to the heartland, the middle of America, the small towns and suburban areas, you see a lot of obese people."
An estimated 60 percent of Americans are overweight or obese.
Daniel Solomon, an architect from San Francisco, said that Mr. Katz's observations were true wherever suburbs were sprouting. Mr. Solomon pointed to Shanghai and Beijing, where people walk and ride bicycles, but said that those cities' new suburbs, where people drive more, had high rates of diabetes and obesity.
As a result, he said, parents are taking a stern approach to combatting obesity in their children.
"There are ads now on Beijing television for summer camps modeled on World War II Japanese concentration camps," Mr. Solomon said. "Middle-class parents send their obese children to be disciplined by guards dressed in Japanese World War II uniforms."
In the United States, the planners said, the cities most suitable for walking are Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle. Those least friendly for walking, Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix, are the lowest-density cities, with high rates of diabetes and obesity.
But not everyone buys the idea that environmental sprawl is responsible for sprawling waistlines. Ron Utt, a housing and transportation analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said the theory "has a touch of intuitive credibility, but you're fat for a lot of reasons, like the fact that you don't do laundry by hand anymore."
"The heaviest people," Mr. Utt added, live in urban public housing.
"They are living in Congress of New Urbanism nirvana, with small apartments, small land use, taking public transit," Mr. Utt said, "but they tend to be significantly overweight. Your weight has less to do with housing than with a sedentary life, more people making their living not doing any kind of physical labor, and our recreation options are sedentary -- VCR's and DVD's have eliminated the need even to go to a movie theater."
Other factors complicate the picture as well. For example, cities may force a person to walk more and become slimmer. But cities can also trap pollution from cars, making cities extremely unhealthy, especially for people with asthma.
Still, Mr. Frank's findings could hold useful implications for urban planning and for how people think about where they want to live.

HEADLINE: G.E. Reaffirms Its Predictions For Earnings 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., June 20 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company reaffirmed its profit forecast today for the second quarter and the year.
 G.E., the industrial and financial services giant based in Fairfield, expects earnings of 37 cents to 39 cents a share in the second quarter, the chief financial officer, Keith Sherin, said at a meeting with investors and analysts. 
 The company also maintained its earnings range of $1.55 to $1.70 a share for the year, which would represent an increase in net income of 3 percent to 13 percent.
The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call is for 38 cents a share for the second quarter and $1.60 for the year.
But some analysts trimmed their forecast of G.E.'s earnings for the year and next year ahead of the meeting today.
"The slow economic growth continues," Mr. Sherin said, adding that G.E. is positioned for an economic rebound.
While volume in plastics is down, Mr. Sherin cited strength in other businesses like NBC. "In the quarter we've had some pretty good wins," Mr. Sherin said, citing aircraft orders and NBC's winning the United States television rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympics.
Mr. Sherin said the impact of SARS, a concern of some analysts, had been minimal and was diminishing.
Mr. Sherin called a tentative four-year contract reached by G.E. and its unions a fair deal for both sides. He said the company was optimistic the deal would be ratified by union employees next week.
G.E. officials also highlighted new growth businesses, which include Hispanic media, security and sensors, and health care data technology.
Shares of G.E. rose 15 cents, to $30.01.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
On Empire Building The American Way

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KOTKIN; Stephen Kotkin is the author of "Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse, 1970-2000" (Oxford).

 BODY:
THE DUST OF EMPIRE
The Race for Mastery in the Asian Heartland
By Karl E. Meyer
Illustrated. 252 pages. Century Foundation/Public Affairs, $26.
 Karl E. Meyer is old fashioned in his way. He reads voraciously, travels to rough places and worries that Americans lack not just knowledge of the world but curiosity as well. He invokes edifying traditions epitomized by George Kennan the Elder, explorer extraordinary and author of "Tent Life in Siberia" (1871), now largely forgotten. Mr. Meyer edits World Policy Journal (the name is evocative), holds a Princeton Ph.D. in politics and has been a Washington Post foreign correspondent and a New York Times editorial writer. He sees his vocation as educating nonexperts, and this is his ninth book, synthesizing "basic information in a readable manner" with captivating personal profiles: a Russian viceroy to the Caucasus, Mikhail Vorontsov; the "frontier Gandhi," Abdul Ghaffar Khan; the C.I.A.'s Kermit (Kim) Roosevelt, a grandson of Teddy and a Kipling devotee. 
 Mr. Meyer evokes these characters in a sweeping yet pithy rumination on empire (not on how Americans are incapable of empire but on how they ought to know better). His instruction takes its title from Charles de Gaulle, who sour-graped the new African states that booted out colonial overlords as "the dust of empire." But the author is preoccupied with British experience, whose colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain (christened "Imperial Joe" by America's best expositor on empire, Mark Twain) once boasted, "We are a great governing race, predestined by our defects as well as our virtues to spread over the habitable globe." Mr. Meyer fears the sequel. "America now sits where Britain did in the 1890's, only the old empire is squared" because "even at her apogee, Britannia had nothing like America's economic and military preponderance," he writes.
To counteract this national autism, Mr. Meyer plays Sherpa through the swath from the borders of China to the Caucasus Mountains, between the Indus River and the Qazaq steppes, disparate lands that have in common bad government and supplying drivers for New York City taxis.
He begins with a chapter on a thousand years of Russian imperial rise and fall, up to the present-day oil rush, which Mr. Meyer deems an "unforeseen opportunity" for Washington and Moscow to cooperate. Next come 26 centuries of Iranian history, through the 1953 C.I.A.-backed coup and the 1979 Islamist hostage-taking, culminating in an admonition for both the United States and Iran to admit past wrongs and reconcile. Shaky Pakistan follows -- a mere half-century to cover -- from the massacre-accompanied 1947 partition from India (pinned on Lord Mountbatten and Nehru) to the post-9/11 twists of its president, Pervez Musharraf. 
The page-turning chapter on Afghanistan that follows is sharply focused and analytically outstanding. Then comes one mostly on Georgia, once a rich Soviet republic and now beyond even shambles, despite ranking fourth in 1990's United States foreign aid. The tour concludes with a hectic scamper through the five Central Asian "Stans," whose "relative calm" -- amid their ecological ruin and despotism -- is a bright spot. Missing are India and Turkey, two democracies, regional powers and offspring of differing empires, British versus Ottoman, a notable contrast here unexamined. 
Mr. Meyer's meandering narrative pivots on the fateful American theory that the Soviet Union had a soft Islamic underbelly, which induced cold warriors to arm Afghan mujahadeen, and later generations to suffer the blowback. "What was more important in world history?" an unrepentant Zbigniew Brzezinski remarks. "The Taliban or the fall of the Soviet empire? A few over-excited Islamists or the liberation of Eastern Europe?" 
Intriguing asides emerge en route. Altitude not ethnicity may cause civil war, Mr. Meyer reports, judging from the Peruvian Andes, the Balkans, the Hindu Kush, the Nepalese Himalayas, Chechnya and the Karabakh Range, Colombia, Algeria's Atlas Mountains and the Pamirs of Tajikistan. Oil, as another traveler-journalist, Ryszard Kapuscinski, wrote, "is a fairy tale and like every fairy tale, a bit of a lie" -- a curse to peoples who possess it and wallow in corruption and poverty. Through such apercus and vignettes, Mr. Meyer identifies the booby traps of imperial self-delusion, warning against the Asian heartland as a "temptation to be resisted." 
But then he himself does not resist. He recognizes a war-on-terrorism imperative to engage friendly dictatorships in strategic locations, but he urges the United States somehow not to become accessory to their abuses of human rights and public treasuries. Instead, he advises Washington to promote federalism, open borders and civic institutions abroad. "Like it or not, Washington is the seat of an empire," he asserts.
But wait: Mr. Meyer also declares that "America is not an empirein a formal sense." The discussion slips from American "empire" to American "influence," which we are told "is most effective when exercised jointly, when Washington's purposes are clearly articulated and consistently pursued and when security arrangements do not compromise the claims of decency and transparency that are America's most valued assets." 
As a 21st-century American liberal, Mr. Meyer recalls the 18th-century English conservative Edmund Burke, who argued that empire had corrupted England but still refused to relinquish the faith that empire should and could be done better. Yet history -- Mr. Meyer's favored educational tool -- has showed otherwise, though you would never know given today's imperial amnesia.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Blue Chips Rise, but Tech Shares Are Hit by Profit Taking

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks staged a moderate comeback from a two-day sell-off yesterday, rising amid investors' growing confidence in the economy and their anticipation of another interest rate cut next week. But technology shares, the biggest gainers in Wall Street's recent rally, succumbed to profit taking.
 The market began retreating from larger gains in the afternoon because of a technical factor called quadruple witching, and concerns that stock prices had perhaps risen too high, too quickly. 
 On a quadruple witching day, futures and options on individual stocks and on indexes all expire at the same time. 
"Given that the market has had the run-up that it has had, it is probably just taking a bit of a breather here," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Philadelphia. "It might be a sign that the market is getting a little tired or is overextended."
After climbing as much as 96.98 points during the day, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.22 points, or 0.2 percent, at 9,200.75. The moderate gain followed a two-day loss of 143.49, the index's first multiple-day loss in a month. The broader indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.99 point, or 0.1 percent, to 995.69. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,644.72.
All three gauges ended the week higher. The Dow rose 0.9 percent, the Nasdaq advanced 1.1 percent and the S.& P. gained 0.7 percent. It was the fourth straight winning week for the Dow and S.& P.
Trading was choppy, with stocks posting gains in the early going but pulling back in the afternoon because of the quadruple witching.
Analysts say investors' optimism about the economy and the market is growing. Investors seem particularly confident that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which meets next week, will again lower interest rates.
"The undercurrent is positive. Chances are growing that we are going to have a good year," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Thomas F. Lydon Jr., president of Global Trends Investments in Newport Beach, Calif. said: "I am starting to hear from people about their 401(k) and their brokerage statements again. People are actually opening them up, for the first time in a year or so. That is a very encouraging sign."
Further proof of a more upbeat mood among investors can be found in the progress the major indexes have made since March 11, when the rallies began. The technology-focused Nasdaq has surged 29.4 percent since then, while the S.& P. has climbed 24.4 percent and the Dow has risen 22.3 percent.
Among yesterday's gainers, General Motors rose 52 cents, to $38.59, after announcing a plan to improve its finances.
The brokerage company A. G. Edwards rose 44 cents, to $33.64, on quarterly earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations.
Darden Restaurants, which operates the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains, fell 39 cents, to $19.11, after Smith Barney downgraded it to underperform from in line.
Research in Motion, the technology company known for its Blackberry e-mail device, slipped 6 cents, to $22.95, after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to underweight from equal weight.
Declining issues had a narrow lead over advancers on the New York Stock Exchange. Because of the quadruple witching, volume was heavy.

Treasury Prices Decline
By The Associated Press
 Treasury prices were down yesterday. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 4/32, to 102 7/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.36 percent, from 3.34 percent Thursday. 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was 114 31/32, down 12/32. Its yield increased to 4.43 percent, from 4.41 percent Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Have Municipality, Will Travel to Paris Air Show

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 18 

 BODY:
At the Paris Air Show this week, there are the usual missile makers and bomb builders, the helmet hawkers and flight suit fashionistas.
 Then there is the Arizona Department of Commerce. 
 It has a booth in Exhibition Hall 3 right across from Amsafe Aviation, a company based in Phoenix that makes airplane seat belts. "The perfect climate for aerospace" reads the slogan on a bright orange backdrop, printed near the photos of Monument Valley and an Apache Longbow attack helicopter.
"We're obviously trying to position Arizona as an attractive location for foreign aerospace companies so they can choose this state as their U.S. base," said Sally Spray, director of the international trade and investment division at the department. "We want to say, 'Bring it to Arizona, it's a good strategic location.' " 
The state is not alone. Nearby sit the booths of both the Oklahoma Department of Commerce and the State of Maryland, whose lieutenant governor recently stopped by. Cincinnati is in the neighborhood, too, as well as New York, southwest Florida, Virginia and Washington State, according to the list of exhibitors.
The severe budget crises afflicting American municipalities have sent them scrambling to find new sources of investment. They are going out of their way to offer incentives like tax breaks and factory sites to companies willing to set up local operations. In recent years, many states have opened economic development offices abroad to draw in investors from the global marketplace. Arizona, for instance, has representatives in Mexico, Europe, Japan and Taiwan.
The Paris Air Show, the largest gathering of military contractors and aerospace companies in the world, has become the states' latest hunting ground. It is an especially auspicious time to promote the benefits of setting up shop in United States because the weakening dollar makes the country a more attractive manufacturing base.
But it is competitive here at the show. Maryland rented a sprawling booth. Oklahoma's is just slightly bigger than a Parisian bathroom. But that state is not shy about advertising its offerings in big words on one of its backdrops: "Cash for jobs created" and "tax exemptions." 
Ms. Spray, meanwhile, said Arizona could boast of, among other things, "365 golf courses, one for every day of the year."
She groused about New York and California. They have name recognition, she said, and foreign companies often gravitate to them even though Arizona has lower operating costs and right-to-work laws that result in a low level of unionization at workplaces. "We're not a huge incentive state," she added. "We don't say, 'Here's a check for 29,000 euros' or whatever. But we do have enterprise zones. We can tailor those financially to people."
Like many manufacturing businesses, aerospace companies worldwide have increasingly played municipalities against one another to squeeze out the best incentives. In May, the Boeing Company announced it was taking proposals from any state that wanted to be the site for final assembly of Boeing's next jetliner, the 7E7. Lawmakers in Washington State, where Boeing does final assembly of all but one of its commercial jets, scrambled to offer tax breaks and other incentives to keep Boeing there, a push that led to a tax incentive package valued at $3 billion over 20 years if Boeing stays.
In fact, Snohomish County, where Boeing does final assembly of its wide-body jets, has a small exhibit here with brochures sitting beneath a "Home of Boeing" sign.
In recent decades, Bombardier, the Canadian regional jet maker, received lavish incentives and free factories from countries in which it set up plants, said Robert Lamb, a professor of management at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who has studied aerospace companies and the economies of municipalities. Bombardier also arranged with governments to buy its planes in exchange for its presence, he added.
Professor Lamb said it was not surprising that states had shown up at the Paris Air Show because they were desperate to drum up revenue any way they can. "There's a need for so much new business," he said. "You have to pay money to make money. You have to pay out for infrastructure buildup. You need to do roads, water. The things they are doing are much bigger than light industrial planning."
The danger, he said, is in putting too much hope into cyclical businesses -- like many aerospace companies -- that lay off large numbers of people during downturns.
Yet states continue to court such companies. Kara H. Smith, director of European operations at the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, looked up from a laptop at her booth to talk about her state's recent history of attracting foreign aerospace investment. First, she said, there is Lufthansa Technik, which services business jets in the Tulsa area. Then there is Labinal, a French electronics manufacturer that set up a plant in 1997 in Pryor Creek.
Asked about the companies she was focusing on at this air show, Ms. Smith declined to identify them or discuss specific incentives, citing competitive reasons. For two months before the show, she said, she had four workers calling companies and sending out letters to talk up the state and set up appointments. Representatives of Oklahoma attend four or five aerospace trade shows each year, she added.
"Our strategy is to focus on what we're world-class at," said Ms. Smith, who works out of the Netherlands. "And aerospace is what we're highly competitive at."
Mary Smith, executive director of the Aerospace Alliance of Tulsa, said there were 143,000 aerospace jobs in the state, with almost a fifth of that in the Tulsa area. She estimated that the industry brought in $3.2 billion to the city each year. American Airlines has its largest maintenance base in Tulsa, she said, where it employs 9,200 people and has attracted 200 suppliers to the area. Part of Ms. Smith's job is to find overseas companies to add to that number.
Many foreign companies set up shop in the United States in hopes that they will be regarded more favorably by American politicians and government officials, something that is especially important for military contractors.
Rainer Hertrich, the co-chief executive of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS, said he wanted officials to stop mentally associating his company with just Europe. He pointed out that the company had plants and research offices in Mississippi and Alaska. A company's nationality should be defined by where it gives the most "added value," he said, meaning in part where it creates jobs.
The states here have also set up their booths to push the products of companies based in their regions. Small aerospace companies that might not have been able to afford to come on their own can piggyback onto the exhibition spaces of the states. Ms. Spray, the Arizona representative, said the state spent about $60,000 to have a presence at the show but was charging small companies from Arizona to share its display.
A couple of executives from one of those companies, Advanced Training Systems International, were milling around next to Ms. Spray. The company, based in Mesa, Ariz., has a fleet of a dozen fighter jets that it uses to train military pilots from foreign governments like the United Arab Emirates. Its instructors, including pilots who have attended the Navy's "top gun" school and flown with the Blue Angels, are also paid to engage in mock dogfights with customers. Its slogan: Train to Fight, Fight to Win.
"This is a real cost-effective way for a company like us to be at the show," said Charles Stanford Jr., the chief financial officer. "This show is a central meeting point for all of our worldwide customers."
And there are more potential clients to win over.
"We want to go meet the Canada people in a minute," Ms. Spray said to Mr. Stanford.
"Sorry, but we can't join you," he said. "We've got a meeting at 6:30. I've got to get back to the hotel first."
"Canada's having a reception," Ms. Spray said. "But I'll mention you. Maybe we can set something up."

HEADLINE: How Do We Look? 

 BODY:
 How does the world see the United States? An exhibition scheduled to open July 3 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York asks that question. Titled The "American Effect," it will feature artists from 30 countries, all of whom explore the ways in which the United States influences the rest of the world. The Op-Ed page asked several of these artists to write about their work.

SAIRA WASIM, PAKISTAN

The Sept. 11 attacks not only shaped world politics -- they also had a strong impact on the work of artists around the world. I wanted to portray the true feelings and basic needs of an ordinary man, one who wants peace, prosperity and love. I took inspiration from Mughal court paintings that recorded for history the victories of the kings.
 "Friendship After 11 September 1" shows a new era of amity between Pakistan and the United States. It depicts President Bush embracing President Pervez Musharraf for helping him in the war against terrorism in South Asia. Beneath this, people in the two countries are celebrating the victory of peace and hope: the cow and the lion (symbols of strong and weak) are together. There is an American nation that is friendly and optimistic but has suffered from state terrorism and now wants to live in peace. And there is a Pakistani nation that is happy to be friends with this superpower, as it will open new opportunities and economic hope to a poor country. There are also the mullahs, who are oblivious about their own religion (Islam being a faith of peace and love). They are the ones who misinterpret their religion and manipulate the innocent public to commit violence in the name of jihad. They are never happy with this friendship, which is why they are portrayed as sad at this occasion.
 It's time to realize that only love and friendship can save this world from all disasters.

MIGUEL ANGEL ROJAS, COLOMBIA

Among the United States' influences on Latin America, the seductive effect of American culture is well known. I remember the impact of first hearing "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley and the Comets when I was a child. The attraction of American cultural forms is perceptible in all levels of our reality, especially in our identity.
 The art of the United States is no exception. For example, Pop Art -- that rich, complex and imperturbably happy school -- has prompted me to reflect on our own reality in Colombia and to examine the reciprocity of inter-regional relations. The production and trafficking of drugs like cocaine would not exist without demand. This ever-growing business has produced an underground flow of dollars, which has in turn given rise to another, more horrible trade: the trafficking of arms. What for some is merely a recreational habit, an addiction, is for others war, death and displacement.
 "Bratatata" is an appropriation of a Roy Lichtenstein war scene, "As I Open Fire," that I constructed in cutouts from coca leaves. I want to make drug users and the law reflect on responsibility and on the need to find solutions to these seemingly insoluble issues.

ALFREDO ESQUILLO JR., PHILIPPINES

The details of the American occupation of the Philippines were just things I had to memorize when I was in high school. They had nothing to do with my life or my future. I thought that the past was not all that important, as long as I remembered enough dates and names to get good grades in history. Little did I know how much all this would matter to me now -- now that I am a visual artist trying to make sense of the ways in which Filipino society was robbed of its independence by colonial forces, and how these facts of our subjugation have been erased from our collective consciousness. History has much to say about how or what we are now: the English language, the Hollywood influence, the craze for American goods. All this has generated my urge to paint a post-colonial narrative.
 "MaMcKinley" serves as a meditation on how American imperialism betrayed the Filipino people. The unmasking begins with an appropriation of an archival American mother and child portrait, recasting it so that the mother becomes President William McKinley, who in 1898 issued the Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, which asserted United States control over the Philippines. The child becomes an innocent Filipino dressed in stars and stripes. However, under the hem of "Mama" McKinley's sleeves there is the hint of the barrel of a gun; her guardian hands turn into the threatening claws of an eagle.
 The moral here cannot be ignored. The historical facts are bitter. Benevolent promises were made but precious lives were taken. What was the most remarkable part of the Filipino-American relationship: the handshake or the bloodshed? Especially now that terrorism has changed our lives, the past has to be reconsidered. While the painting portrays America as a colonizer with a deceiving attitude, and the Philippines as a helpless victim, it still begs for some positive result on the viewer and on society as a whole.

YONGSUK KANG, SOUTH KOREA

After the Korean War, land on the west coast of South Korea, about 50 miles from Seoul, was set aside to be used for target practice by the United States military. Residents of these areas lost farmland and fishing grounds. Over the years they suffered other losses, too: bombs missed their targets, causing damage to civilian areas. Despite all this, South Korea and the United States have refused to move the ranges.
 The gray tones in my photographs are meant to convey distance and ambiguity. We aren't at war, but we aren't at peace, either. Traditionally, war photographs were meant to appeal to the viewer's sentimentality and to evoke emotion. My landscape photographs play a different role. They do not depict real warfare. They capture the remnants of military exercises. Though the United States is here to defend us, its exercises feel like an invasion. Without emotional intervention, I strive to expose the tragedy of contemporary South Korea. In these places, we see that the disaster of the Korean War has not yet ended.

ANDREA ROBBINS ANDMAX BECHER, UNITED STATES

For about 17 years, the primary focus of our work has been what we call "the transportation of place," situations in which one limited or isolated place strongly resembles another distant one. There are many reasons for these transpositions: colonialism, diaspora, war, migration and emulation. We use our own backgrounds as starting points: one of us is German and came to the United States as a teenager (Max), the other grew up in a Jewish family in Marblehead, Mass. By locating personally familiar images in unfamiliar contexts, rather than seeking out the exotic, we hope to arrive at new meanings.
 One area of particular interest to us is how American internal expansion has been sold through the figure of the gun-slinging cowboy, and how that myth has sometimes evoked unintended interpretations abroad. In Germany, for example, Karl May, the wildly popular late-19th century novelist, helped write a German version of the Wild West in which the Indian is the protagonist. While many Americans grew up playing heroic cowboys and villainous Indians, many German children grew up playing the game with Indians as the heroes. The American cowboy myth was reinterpreted to fit local nostalgias and anxieties.
 We photographed the phenomenon of Germans dressing up as Indians on weekends and at special festivals to capture what it looks like on the receiving end of an American projection. We are also asking how, in light of the Holocaust, Germans wound up identifying with the victims of American manifest destiny, rather than with its perpetrators. How could a people who waged an internal colonization within Europe less than 60 years ago, killing millions of people -- Jews, Gypsies, gays and people considered "asocial" -- and banishing millions more to the four corners of the earth, identify with native Americans, the victims of American imperialism?

DANWEN XING, CHINA

Traveling between China and the United States has made me increasingly aware of the conflicts between modernity and tradition, dream and reality. These have become important themes in my work. My goal is to sketch a visual representation of 21st century modernity. I carefully choose direct and intimate moments to portray the objects I find. The aesthetic quality of the imagery almost removes the photographed objects from their social context.
 But I cannot forget that most of the e-trash I'm photographing is shipped from the United States and dumped in Guangdong Province, where people make a meager living recycling it. While we rely extensively on high-tech devices for our modern life, I was nevertheless shocked when I first confronted China's vast piles of dead and deconstructed machines, cords, wires, chips and parts -- all with the traces of America on them.
 In my country, I have experienced the changes that have taken place under the influence of Western modernity. These changes, driven in large measure by the United States, have contributed to a strong and powerful push for development in China. At the same time, however, they have led to an environmental and social nightmare in remote corners of the country.
 I hope by showing these photographs in New York, I can somehow bring the trash back to the United States, and bring home the fact of its existence to American audiences.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Raise $10 Billion For Pension Gap 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM with JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 20 

 BODY:
General Motors said today that it would borrow $10 billion by selling bonds and other securities, and would use substantially all of the money to reduce its pension deficit of more than $19 billion.
 The bond sale, which would be one of the largest ever and which would be open to buyers worldwide, would allow it to accelerate its effort to finance its United States pension plans, according to a G.M. statement. 
 The company had already announced that it would contribute about $15 billion to its United States benefit and retirement plans by 2007.
Shares of G.M. rose 1.4 percent, to $38.59, after the announcement in the morning, but the prices of the company's bonds fell. The bond sale "helps take near-term pension funding issues off the table for investors," said Joe McCusker, vice president for credit strategy and research at FTN Financial, a Wall Street brokerage firm. "But it doesn't change what the obligation is and it doesn't change the operating environment at all." 
After the announcement, Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, reaffirmed its rating of BBB for G.M. But S.& P. maintained its negative outlook, which means the company could be downgraded in the future.
Last week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded G.M. to Baa1, a notch above the S.& P. rating, and maintained its negative outlook. Fitch Ratings lowered its rating on Thursday to BBB+ with a negative outlook, also a notch above the S.& P. rating.
Company pension plans have been battered by more than three years of poor investment returns combined with low interest rates. Because pension calculations involve estimating returns to cover long-term obligations, lower interest rates mean that more cash contributions are required.
The last three years represent the longest period of combined declining stock values and low interest rates since company pensions became widespread after World War II. Many companies now show pension deficits, but the deficit at G.M. is the largest, because the plan itself is huge. The G.M. bond sale comes at a time when interest rates are at or near historic lows and Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to push short-term rates even lower when their two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday. The sale is scheduled for late next week, after the Fed meeting. 
G.M. is taking advantage of these low rates and is making a bet on a recovery by putting some of the $10 billion into its pension funds before the end of the year.
If stocks rally, the value of the contribution would be increased. But if the market suddenly falls, much of the contribution's value could be lost.
The G.M. bond sale, which will total $13 billion because of a $3 billion issue for its financing subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, is also coming when corporate bond issues are tapering off.
But some bond analysts said that the size of the G.M. sale along with the large amount of G.M. and other automobile company bonds outstanding might mean that some investors would be reluctant to buy a lot of the new issue.
Automobile bonds are already trading at far higher spreads to comparable Treasury securities than other companies with similar credit ratings, and the sale of billions more in new automaker bonds could drive those spreads even wider, Mr. McCusker said. "Its going to take a long time for investors to digest," he said.
In trading today, bonds of G.M. and other automakers trimmed their losses after sharp declines in the morning. The price of G.M.'s 10-year note maturing in 2012 fell as much as 2 points, or 2 percent, but was down about a point in late trading. Its yield of 6.68 percent was 3.3 percentage points above a comparable Treasury security, a much wider spread than the 1.35 percentage points for AOL Time Warner, which has a similar credit rating.
G.M.'s pension-fund obligations, which included a deficit of $19.3 billion at the end of last year, have been a major drain on resources and a competitive disadvantage. And the company said in its statement today that the deficit was even bigger, although it did not provide a new figure.
The shortfall stems largely from the fact that G.M., though still the world's largest automaker, has been shrinking for decades in its home market, to about 28 percent so far this year from as much as 60 percent of United States sales in the early 1960's. As a result, the company's retirees now outnumber its active workers in this country by 2.5 to 1, causing obligations referred to in Detroit as legacy costs. 
Paying pension and health care benefits to hundreds of thousands of American workers adds up to a cost disadvantage of thousands of dollars per car compared with Japanese automakers, which have almost no retirees here and a much younger work force in the United States. 
In his report, Scott Sprinzen, the S.& P. credit analyst who reaffirmed G.M.'s rating today, described "the proposed debt issues as a prudent means of addressing these requirements." 
"Additionally, G.M. would be taking advantage of historically low interest rates."
Mark Oline, a managing director at Fitch, described today's action by G.M. as "a mild negative."
"It does leverage the balance sheet and imposes additional financial cost," he said. "In a down scenario, the pricing and cost pressures the company faces reduce its cash generation and the company could be faced with a larger debt burden and still significant legacy liabilities. We don't see that changing."
Michael Bruynesteyn,Prudential's auto analyst, was a bit more optimistic. Earlier today, he upgraded G.M.'s stock to buy from sell.
"The market has shrugged off negative news in the sector and is bringing the auto industry stocks up on the perception of an economic recovery," he said in a report.
He added that he expected the stock to rise from current levels but said, "There are still plenty of warts on its story."
A G.M. spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said the $10 billion was expected to be divided over time among three United States pension trusts: one for its union workers' pension plan, one for its salaried employees' pension plan and a third that is kept for retiree medical benefits. She said it was too early to determine the amount for each fund.
Both stock and bond analysts remain concerned about the ability of G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler to compete in what has become a difficult market. Net prices are declining as incentive costs soar, an influx of foreign competition has led to a glut of unsold cars and trucks and industry sales are weakening.
"Our concern was that despite the fact that the company has done well in its truck portfolio, higher legacy costs and a continued decline in pricing, and their inability to structurally reduce their costs, mean that the company faces continued margin pressures," Mr. Oline said. "It's difficult to see how G.M. will be in a position to restore margins to sustainable levels that will allow them to competitively service these legacy liabilities."
G.M. held a conference call with investors on the bond sale this morning. The selling job by Wall Street, which will be led by Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, the global coordinators for the issue, begins Monday.
Of the $10 billion aimed for the pension funds, $3.5 billion will be convertible bonds. The remaining $6.5 billion will be regular bonds and will include 10- or 12-year notes in dollars, intermediate-term notes denominated in euros and long-term debt in both dollars and euros.
The $3 billion sale for G.M.A.C. will include three-year notes in dollars, five-year notes in euros and two-year floating rate notes in euros.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: ENERGY; 
Thieves and Saboteurs Disrupt Electrical Services in Iraq

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 20 

 BODY:
The electricity system of Iraq, already damaged by the war, is now being torn apart by systematic looting and possibly by sabotage.
 Not far from the Bayji power plant in northern Iraq, high-tension cables that run to Baghdad now either hang like spaghetti or have disappeared altogether. 
 Near the southern city of Basra, dozens of the biggest electric towers have been toppled in the past few weeks and now look like giraffes with their necks broken.
In the city of Falluja, about 30 miles west of Baghdad, unidentified attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade on Thursday night that blew up a transformer serving half the city. 
With daytime summer temperatures already climbing past 110 degrees and still rising, the attacks have become a major worry for the American-led occupation authorities.
Daily power cutoffs are getting worse in many areas. Electricity failures have disrupted water supplies and led to huge backups of sewage because neither water nor sewage can be properly pumped. 
In some areas on the east side of Baghdad, some streets have been flooded for entire blocks with overflows of sewage.
Outside Bayji, farmers have been unable to irrigate their fields in the past week because the attacks on high-tension cables also damaged a number of local electric lines.
"This is not random, entrepreneurial looting," said Andrew S. Natsios, head of the United States Agency for International Development. "It is organized and systematic."
While looting for profit appears to be the primary motive for the attacks, especially in southern Iraq, officials in Iraq at the United Nations Development Program are increasingly convinced that sabotage is playing at least some role.
The evidence is ambiguous. American and British forces have found at least a dozen clandestine smelters, where organized gangs have stripped the coating off cables and then melted the copper into bars. 
More difficult to explain is the increasingly frequent destruction of 100-foot electric towers. Dozens of the towers have been toppled, sometimes four or five in a row.
Though such actions could be a result of thieves pulling down the cables, the extent of the damage to many towers has led many investigators to suspect that it is linked to the erratic but persistent guerrilla attacks on American soldiers in Baghdad and nearby cities like Falluja and Ramadi.
"I think it was a combination of organized resistance and opportunism," said Michael Robinson, the Bechtel Group's executive in charge of assessing and rebuilding Iraqi electrical systems under a contract with the United States government.
Earlier this week, Army soldiers raided scores of buildings in the Shiite district of Baghdad called Sadr City, formerly Saddam City. At one house, soldiers found several tons of thick cable that had been dug up from underground.
The cable filled up the house's entire courtyard. After finding it, the soldiers had to crash through the front wall of the courtyard and then haul out the cable with a large front-end loader. Last week, Army soldiers found and seized an 18-wheel truck filled to the brim with cables.
"This is the main form of robbery that we have here," said Capt. Stephen Corn, who has been leading many of the raids.
"We don't have as many shootings as we did in the first month," he said. "We don't have personal crime. Right now, most of it is this kind of looting."
The grenade attack on Thursday night at a substation in Falluja, which turned a room-size transformer into pillar of fire, may or may not have been an attempt at sabotage.
The motive for the attack was unclear because as many as 16 American soldiers were at the substation and Army officials initially assumed they had been the target.
But the grenade was the only real salvo in the attack. It immediately knocked out power to half the city, and the loss of the transformer will leave the city's overall power system under even more strain.
Indeed, residents in Falluja today were already blaming Americans for the destruction of the transformer.
"The presence of the American soldiers provokes a reaction against the occupiers," said Suadad Tariq, the substation's night supervisor, who was on duty when the attack occurred.
"I do blame the Americans," he said. "This is not a military base. This is a service station."
Mr. Robinson of Bechtel said that Baghdad alone needed about 1,700 megawatts at the moment, but that it was producing only 1,200 or 1,300. The situation is getting worse, as summer heat drives up demand for power even more.
"As the temperature goes up, they expect that each additional degree adds an extra 70 megawatts of additional use," Mr. Robinson said. "When you look at the power system in Iraq, it's held together by paint."

HEADLINE: World Forum Moves Venue From Davos To Dead Sea 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: SUWEIMA, Jordan, June 20 

 BODY:
For those used to the ramparts of the snowbound Alps, it does not get lower or much hotter than this.
 The World Economic Forum, a global assembly of luminaries from boardrooms and governments, usually holds its councils in Davos, the Swiss ski resort. This time the forum's managers and King Abdullah II of Jordan determined that it should be held on the shores of the Dead Sea, 1,369 feet below sea level, the lowest place on earth, where temperatures routinely exceed 100 degrees. 
 If the intent of the gathering Saturday through Monday is as its agenda states, to foster reconciliation among troubled peoples, this is as good a spot to start as any.
Jordan lies in a vise of conflict with postwar, unsettled Iraq to the east and Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to the west. It borders Syria and Saudi Arabia. 
Technically, of course, the forum, which held its first session outside Switzerland in New York last year, has no powers to make any decisions affecting official government policy. Technically, it is no more than a Swiss charitable foundation, run on a $50 million budget financed by big business sponsors. But at this meeting, there is a sense that, after the war in Iraq and as President Bush promotes a so-called road map for peace in the Middle East, the gathering has at least been well timed with an impeccable guest list.
One participant, for instance, is Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is commuting from the Dead Sea to Jerusalem in the effort for peace. 
Other guests include the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan; Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan; Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister; Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general; and the chief executives of big American corporations like Hewlett Packard and Boeing.
The gathering will occupy two adjacent five-star resorts intended more for sunny tourism and mud baths. Some sessions will be held in an enormous air-conditioned tent.
The most obvious change from Davos might be the reception that any antiglobalization demonstrators or other protesters get if they try to come here. Instead of Swiss police officers with tear gas and water cannons, they would find at least six Jordanian Army roadblocks reinforced by machine guns mounted on American-built Humvees.

HEADLINE: ENDGAME IN ALBANY: LEGISLATION; 
A Long Night and Day In a Year of Very Little

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 20 

 BODY:
In the pageant of inaction that was New York's regular legislative session, Exhibit A was Albany's failure to pass a law to shed light on the inner workings of government.
 It was only days ago, on Sunday, that Gov. George E. Pataki pledged to tighten the state's lobbying laws, thereby vying with the two top legislative leaders for the mantle of government reformer. 
 But that promise was not the only legislative sleight of hand, lobbyists and government watchdog groups said today. Many showcase proposals were left unresolved. 
A monthslong effort to extend rent regulations exploded into open political warfare, only to be resolved in the final moments. It was an outcome that left Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker and an advocate of greater protection for tenants, visibly deflated. Legislation to clean up toxic waste sites and redevelop urban wastelands faltered, was said to be resolved, but was ultimately not enacted. Though all sides moved toward a solution tonight, they said the matter would probably be taken up again in the fall.
A campaign to revamp drug laws from the Rockefeller era devolved into a melodrama and never made it out of negotiations. Even some of those trying to change the laws seemed doubtful of success, despite visible leadership from Russell Simmons, the founder of Def Jam records, who insisted until the end that the laws would be revised.
Lawmakers failed to pass a bill to help a developer's giant mall project in Syracuse. They did nothing to reduce insurance fraud.
And even though the Senate and the Assembly said early today that they had an agreement on a bill to fix technical flaws in the budget legislation that lawmakers passed in defiance of the governor, it fell apart when the Assembly objected to what analysts called a weakening of the state's commitment to take over New York City's bond debt from the 1970's.
The session ended in a dizzying display of round-the-clock government. The Senate worked through the night and wrapped up at 5:30 this morning. The Assembly took a short break a few hours earlier, then resumed voting until 8:30 tonight. Each chamber worked unilaterally in passing many one-house bills.
After a budget season marked by acrimony, there was not much to brag about, politicians on both sides of the aisle said. By passing separate bills, the lawmakers essentially passed none. A fundamental problem in Albany, political scientists have said, is that the two houses rarely meet in conference committees to resolve differences between competing bills, and the legislation dies on the vine.
This year, many lawmakers had vowed to finally institute government reform, including revising the budget process, creating independent oversight of fiscal matters and tightening the rules on lobbying. In this session, legislation to address those issues was presented in one house or the other, or by the governor, but in the end there was little to sign into law.
"It's partisan gridlock," said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, who patrolled the Capitol halls all night watching the political drama unfold.
"People's housing is at stake," he said this morning. "People's health is at stake. The state of our democracy is at stake. But it doesn't matter. It's more partisan ammunition in the legislative fights."
Still, as Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the Senate's Republican majority, pointed out at a 1 p.m. news conference, there were some bipartisan achievements.
"I know there are some unfinished things," he said. But it is likely that he and Mr. Silver will call their members back in September to extend the session.
A bill to support a water filtration plant in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, which would have failed if a roll call vote had been taken, was rescued at the last minute on the Assembly floor by a procedural maneuver. Both houses of the Legislature and the governor also agreed on bills to compel hospitals to provide emergency contraceptives to rape victims, increase penalties for sexual assault and ban the use of ephedra, a dietary supplement.
But again, with each accomplishment on a smaller item, a larger one seemed to fail. Notably, the governor and the Legislature could not come to terms on a bill to tighten regulation of the state's adult homes for the mentally ill, though all sides generally agreed on the needed changes.
As with so many other issues, the adult home measure became entangled in the sometimes contentious negotiations over a host of other proposals, including new rules for assisted living facilities for the elderly, and no one wanted to compromise on one issue while others remained on the table.
One deal the governor called a success was an agreement to establish a fiscal control board in Buffalo. The move was seen as a boon for a once-thriving city that has been on the edge of bankruptcy for years.
On a more arcane note, the Legislature, following an opinion by the State Court of Appeals, enacted a change in state laws regarding medical malpractice cases. The lawmakers clarified how certain payments awarded by juries should be made to successful plaintiffs.
"The original intent has been restored," said Peter Newell, an aide to Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who heads the Insurance Committee. Mr. Newell said that what had amounted to a math problem in the 1986 statute had inadvertently doubled or tripled the structured payments.
Mr. Newell said he expected the governor to sign the bill.
At a news conference here, Mr. Pataki, a three-term Republican, acknowledged that important work left undone included an overhaul of the Rockefeller-era drug laws, which set mandatory minimum sentences even for minor crimes and have been a longtime point of contention among lawmakers.
Andrew Cuomo, a leader of the movement to change the laws and a gubernatorial candidate last year, vowed to keep fighting.
"The good news is that we've come closer than ever before," Mr. Cuomo said today at City Hall in Manhattan. "The bad news is that this isn't horseshoes."
He added: "This governor has to be held responsible. It didn't happen because George Pataki didn't make it happen and the legislative leaders didn't make it happen."
Mr. Pataki also acknowledged that on the state budget, he had been resoundingly defeated by the Legislature, which passed its own plan and then overrode his veto. Still, he seemed ebullient as he addressed reporters at his news conference, even playfully sparring with them as he reflected on a year he said was not his worst ever, despite the budget fight.
At one point, he addressed the failure to enact a requirement that lobbyists trying to win state contracts disclose the names of their clients and their expenses and compensation, even as questions have been raised about former administration officials' influencing government action as private lobbyists.
"Reform will happen," he said.

BOEING NOTIFIES 845 WORKERS THAT THEY WILL BE LAID OFF

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 About 860 workers spent their last day at Boeing yesterday and the company handed out 60-day layoff notices to another 845 employees. 
The workers leaving yesterday were notified of the layoffs on April 18. They included about 630 employees from the Seattle area. Most of the new layoff notices were being issued to workers in Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, a Boeing spokesman, Bill Cogswell, said. The effective date for the new layoffs will be Aug. 22. Boeing has cut 33,890 jobs under a reduction plan that started in December 2001.

Prilosec to Be Available Without a Prescription
The Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter sales of Prilosec, the ulcer and heartburn pill that not long ago was the top-selling prescription medicine in the world. The decision benefits those who pay for the drug -- health insurers and people with no insurance -- and could roil the pharmaceutical industry.
 Prilosec is expected to sell for less than $1 a pill when it becomes available without a prescription this fall, compared with $4 a pill now. But health care executives said that few consumers who have health insurance would see any savings. Page A1. 

Finally, a Reward for Harry Fans
In a scrupulously choreographed, multicontinent extravaganza, fans of Harry Potter who had lined up at bookstores that stayed open into the late hours were finally able to pay their $29.99 (or often some discounted price) for "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." The book is the much-anticipated new installment by J. K. Rowling that recounts the exploits of the schoolboy wizard. B1.

In the days and hours before the official release of the book, lawyers for J. K. Rowling had threatened to sue USA Today for publishing reviews. B6.

Senate Approves Resale of Drugs
The Senate voted overwhelmingly to allow pharmacists to import prescription drugs from Canada and resell them in the United States, so American consumers could get the benefits of lower Canadian prices. But that plan is contingent on a finding that the imports would pose no risk to public health, and the Bush administration made clear that it would not issue such a finding. A13.

PeopleSoft Board Rejects Oracle Bid
The board of PeopleSoft announced that it had voted to recommend to shareholders that they reject Oracle's takeover bid. C3.

Deal for Cordiant May Be in Trouble
The WPP Group's acquisition of Cordiant Communications of Britain may not be a done deal. Active Value Advisors, the largest single shareholder in Cordiant, said that it bought 30 million more shares of Cordiant, increasing its stake to 23.94 percent -- just below the amount needed to block the WPP deal. C2.

Nautica Hints That It Is for Sale
Nautica Enterprises, the clothing business, inserted one line in a news release about a proxy fight -- a line that said Nautica was having discussions about being bought. C3.

Shares Rise on Investor Optimism
Blue-chip stocks staged a moderate comeback from a two-day sell-off, rising amid investors' growing confidence in the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.22 points, or 0.2 percent, at 9,200.75. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.99 point, or 0.1 percent, to 995.69. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,644.72. C5.

HEADLINE: 2 Nuclear Weapons Challenges, 2 Different Strategies 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
With his hands full in Iraq, President Bush has now given nearly identical warnings to Iran and North Korea -- that their efforts to build nuclear weapons will "not be tolerated" by the United States -- even while he is pursuing very different strategies to stop them.
 While the countries are often discussed in tandem as Mr. Bush's most urgent proliferation threats, they present different challenges. Despite Mr. Bush's declaration that the United States would never abide a nuclear North Korea, American intelligence agencies say they believe the country already possesses two weapons, and for the first time it is boasting about its capacity to produce many more. It has rejected the nuclear treaties it once had signed. 
 Iran, by contrast, insists its program is for peaceful uses only, and Mr. Bush's problem is that the country is pursuing a strategy of building up a nuclear infrastructure within the letter of international law, but in a way that would make it easy to exit the treaties and quickly build nuclear weapons.
So for now Mr. Bush is pursuing a strategy of squeezing North Korea economically, finding reasons to intercept its exports, and, if he can win the agreement of the North's neighbors, cut off many of its imports.
There is no talk of economic strangulation of Iran. Administration officials say that strategy would be nearly impossible given Iran's oil trade and its extensive relationships with Europe and Russia, and it could give the Iranian government a new way to portray the United States as the enemy of the Iranian people. Instead, Mr. Bush is trying to build a case for highly intrusive international inspections of Iran that will lay bare what the White House calls a clever Iranian strategy to build a weapons capability in plain sight.
The administration insists it does not foresee the use of force in either case. But Mr. Bush has explicitly left that option open in the case of North Korea, and today one of the most hawkish members of the top ranks of the State Department, John Bolton, told the BBC that even in the case of Iran "all options are on the table." In a telephone interview, Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said there was little mystery about the administration's approaches to North Korea and Iran.
"The approaches are pretty straightforward and based on the unique facts of each case," said Ms. Rice, who was the chief architect of the president's declaration last year that the United States would act preemptively against any power that threatened the United States, or threatened to put nuclear material into the hands of terrorists.
She described North Korea as the more imminent threat, and called it "a particular case in which you have a long record of the same kind of behavior: They reach an agreement, break it, and then make an effort at blackmail." That is why Mr. Bush, she said, had insisted on bringing all of North Korea's neighbors into negotiations with the country, and into a common strategy to disarm it. 
In fact, Mr. Bush has been more successful than even his aides had anticipated in bringing Japan around; it has begun imposing "safety inspections" of North Korean ships, effectively tying them up in port, or offshore, at tremendous cost to a precarious North Korean economy. But China remains reluctant to help cut off North Korea or bring down its government, which it fears could cause chaos and a flood of refugees from North Korea. South Korea is similarly reluctant.
That is a problem, because time is not on Mr. Bush's side. Since North Korea threw out international inspectors on New Year's Eve, it has turned on its nuclear reactors and, it appears, the reprocessing facility that would enable it to convert 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into weapons-grade plutonium. It says the reprocessing is under way. If so, Mr. Bush will face a difficult choice: to keep up the strategy of gradual pressure, or consider military action. 
Iran, by contrast, is still a few years away from producing enough fuel to build weapons, experts say. "You have some time," said Gary Samore, a top disarmament official in the Clinton administration, now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "But the Iranians have looked at the mistakes North Korea and Iraq made in attempting clandestine programs, and they are going about this in a far more sophisticated way. They are trying to stay just within the protocols of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty."
Those protocols allow nations to obtain almost anything for a civilian nuclear program, as long as they allow full inspection. The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded this week that Iran attempted to deceive inspectors, which played to the administration's argument that Iran's assertions that it has no interest in a bomb are laughable.
"On Iran, we are just beginning to build an international consensus," Ms. Rice said. "We have long suspected they are trying to hide a military program under cover of a civilian one. I think the I.A.E.A. report has made people take notice, which is positive."
Ms. Rice, like the president, has sometimes questioned the effectiveness of nonproliferation treaties, and Iran may be an example. They fear that Iran's strategy is to build up all the nuclear infrastructure it needs, then, like North Korea, renounce the treaty and start building weapons. 
Mr. Bush raised that specter during a meeting three weeks ago with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, trying to persuade him to end Russia's $800 million nuclear reactor aid program to Iran. Mr. Bush said he wanted to ensure "that a nontransparent government run by radical clerics doesn't get their hands on weapons of mass destruction."
It is unclear whether Mr. Putin agrees. He said today he had been assured by Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, that the country would not develop nuclear weapons. 
Mr. Bush's aides fear that both Iran and North Korea will follow the example of Pakistan: They will simply declare themselves nuclear powers, and wait for the world to adjust to that as a new reality. It worked in Pakistan's case: President Pervez Musharraf, briefly shunned by the West after his country exploded its first nuclear weapons, will be welcomed by Mr. Bush at Camp David on Tuesday as an ally in the war against terrorism.

 BUNKER 13
By Aniruddha Bahal.
345 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $24.
 THE novel of espionage appears to do best when powerful nations think they are doing badly. Devised in the early 20th century to address in fiction Britain's loss of influence in the world, the spy thriller went on to enjoy its best years between the British humiliation at Suez in 1956 and the return of national self-assertion under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980's. The novels of Ian Fleming, John le Carre, Len Deighton and, at a more elevated moral level, Graham Greene gave British readers imaginary triumphs to savor in secret while their newspaper headlines bawled about diplomatic failure and economic decline.
The chief features of the spy thriller in its original British form were an excess of plot over character; a fascination with weaponry, aviation and other advanced technology; and a sort of fawning hostility to women. Politics, which might have given the plot away, was replaced by conservatism or nostalgia. Out on the actual and technical frontier, the spy-hero defended a society he despised, throwing away his life for heartless females and the London clubs. His sympathies, if any, lay with his adversaries, who, mutatis mutandis, traveled the same road to perdition. 
This novel, the first published in this country by the Indian writer Aniruddha Bahal, tricks out the old British literary war horse with some elements from American novels and movies about the Vietnam War. Alongside the British overelaboration of plot, the aggressive and soppy sex scenes and the blizzard of technical factoids, there are wisecracks, profanity, jungles and a most un-British interest in money and modernity. Add in some Indian metropolitan touches -- consumerism, a passion for acronyms -- and the reader has a taste of the literary brew that is "Bunker 13." 
Bahal is well known as a journalist of enterprise and panache. A founder and head of investigations at the groundbreaking Indian Web site Tehelka.com -- tehelka means "sensation" in Hindi -- Bahal devised an ingenious sting operation to publicize what he said was endemic corruption in Indian defense procurement. His team of reporters secretly videotaped officers and civilians, including the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, pocketing bribes from fake salesmen selling nonexistent thermal imaging binoculars. Even in the distinguished annals of Indian journalism, nothing like that had ever been attempted. 
The story broke on Tehelka.com in March 2001 and shook Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government to the core. George Fernandes, the defense minister, resigned, and court-martial proceedings were announced against several senior officers. But in the climate of fear that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan, the B.J.P. fought back; Fernandes was reinstated, and Tehelka.com found itself under investigation. Last August, Bahal was briefly imprisoned. Meanwhile, funding for Tehelka.com dried up. 
"Bunker 13" is therefore Tehelka.com by the nearest legal means, which is literary fiction. The novel tells the story of MM, a brilliant magazine journalist and a former army cadet who stumbles on a group of corrupt Indian officers in Kashmir smuggling heroin and captured weapons and selling them to anyone who will buy them. 
MM turns out to be as gifted a gangster as a journalist, and can outdo the Indian special forces in endurance and the Russian mafia in deceit. Even his yuppieism he carries off in style, displaying his wardrobe and liquor cabinet only at the moment they are demolished by a jealous Sikh major looking for his stash. Nothing penetrates MM's cheerful cynicism but heroin, which is the subject of a great deal of lyrical solemnity. And women, of course, who receive the usual mixture of sobs and slaps. 
The story proceeds with tremendous energy and in a whirl of gaudy literary effects from Delhi to Kashmir to Moscow and back again. Early in the book, an officer injects heroin in free fall on his parachute training. Bored with peddling a few Stinger surface-to-air missiles to India's enemies, the corrupt officers attempt to hijack a rail shipment of India's nuclear warheads. As should be clear by now, "Bunker 13" is not a work of cautious and pettifogging realism.
Spy thrillers generally don't do politics or history, and Bahal steers clear of such entanglements till the end. The long-running and bloody insurgency in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state under Indian administration, boils down to a matter of killing "Mossies" -- that is, Muslim insurgents infiltrated from Pakistan. 
Bahal's Kashmir has no picturesque lakes, no floating vegetable gardens, no villages of tin roofs with smoke rising up through the willows, no mosques, no dark and sinister alleys in which militants lurk with rocket-propelled grenades, nothing like that. His Indian Army officers speak a sort of super-hard-boiled literary slang, their equipment has been upgraded to American levels, and even their atrocities belong more to Vietnam than Kashmir.
YET in the midst of this artificial literary creation, there are scenes -- of the bureaucratic process at a Delhi police station, of life and love as an army cadet, of selling fake antiques in Kerala -- that convey some novelty, which is all that we sometimes require from any novel. Riding in an agonizingly slow convoy under the Pakistani guns to Kargil, high up on the northern edge of Indian-administered Kashmir, MM manages to communicate authentic peril. One senses that his creator has made that particular journey. The moment passes and we are back to equipment and the intricacies of plot.
India is a powerful nation and becoming more powerful, and its rise to greatness is matched by its capacity for soul-searching. The middle-aged fret at the betrayal in modern India of the nonviolent and ascetic ideals of Gandhi and at the sometimes brutal conduct of the armed forces and political class in suppressing insurgencies from Punjab to Kashmir. The rising generation looks abroad for its models. "Bunker 13," with its mixture of yuppie modernism and fogyish regret, precisely captures this moment. 
Indian writers in English have managed to revive other literary forms that had long since run out of steam in Europe and North America. It may well be that even the superannuated and lachrymose spy thriller will have a new day in the Indian sun.

AT WAR WITH
OURSELVES
Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World.
By Michael Hirsh.
288 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $26.
 Americans make lousy imperialists. Our hulking military and economic might make the Roman Empire seem inconsequential by comparison, but our hearts are not in conquest. We want to be liked, and are surprised when we're not. We are inward-looking, a little complacent, and we have been, at least since Vietnam, more than a little risk averse. When we do go to war we go to win, but we don't stick around. America put the hedge in hegemon.
At least, that's the way we see ourselves. It is increasingly not the impression held by the rest of the world. The Bush administration, provoked by those September blows to the heart, has set about persuading America to step up to its imperial potential. In the 30 months of the Bush era, America has led posses of its own choosing into two wars, withdrawn from international arrangements that we considered confining, adopted a with-us-or-against-us rhetorical style and declared as a matter of national purpose that we will allow no rival to grow into our weight class. 
These two books are offered as multilateralist rebuttals to the ascendant above-it-all doctrine. Both volumes are short and aimed at a general audience. Both conclude that the unilateralism of the Bush administration is wrong, not because it violates some abstract moral code but because it is inimical to American interests. Inevitably the two books cover a lot of the same ground, but from different vantage points.
If you want to know how the American colossus looks to the rest of the world, "Rogue Nation," by Clyde Prestowitz, is your book -- an unsparing but unhysterical catalog of American behavior that has made the world see us as self-centered and hypocritical. The counts in the indictment are familiar: We preach fair trade but underwrite American cotton farmers at such high prices that we keep African farmers in poverty. We guzzle petroleum, and then need a foreign policy that overemphasizes one region of theglobe. We preach democracy and dance with tyrants. "Rogue Nation" could serve as an appendix to this month's global poll by the Pew Research Center, which shows a balloning fear and mistrust of the United States around the world.
Prestowitz is president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. (His 1988 book, "Trading Places," was a mildly alarmist look at the competitive threat of Japan.) He is at his best translating the forbidding details of international commerce into lucid narrative. How American indifference contributed to the Asian economic crisis of 1997, for example, and how world currencies came to be pegged to the dollar -- a kind of monetary unilateralism that enables us to export our economic problems -- are explained with welcome clarity, and without a trace of antiglobalist cant. Likewise, his recounting of the dispute over the Kyoto treaty on global warming is fair-minded. He acknowledges the weaknesses of the treaty and the culpability of the European greens, frustrated leftists who hijacked the cause of environmentalism, but he concludes that in the end what was lost was much more than an inadequate treaty. He is sometimes glib on the politics -- his conclusion that the United States should impose a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example, and his somewhat idealized notion of a unified Europe. 
While he focuses his opprobrium on the Bush administration, Prestowitz understands that America has long been an outlier, a feet-and-Fahrenheit power in a metric world, gripped by an assumption that the rest of the world should conform to us as the benchmark of normal civilized values. "Indeed, the chief reason Americans are blind to their own empire is their implicit belief that every human being is a potential American, and that his or her present national or cultural affiliations are an unfortunate but reversible accident." 
And the solution? Essentially, spontaneous enlightenment. Americans should wise up, throw out unilateralist politicians, treat the world with respect and generally be just a little less . . . American. While we're at it, I propose that we eat right, floss daily, tithe generously and stop watching mindless TV shows.
MIchael Hirsh's "At War With Ourselves" is a more introspective look at America, particularly the America of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, which Hirsh followed in his jobs as foreign editor and chief diplomatic correspondent for Newsweek. Although the book is enlivened by reporting trips he has taken, it is written from inside the intellectual bubble of the Council on Foreign Relations. Hirsh drizzles the text so liberally with bylines from the world of scholarly punditry that the prose often becomes sodden with attribution. Someone should have advised him to put his sources in the footnotes and trust his own judgment.
For his judgment is fundamentally sound. His book is well informed, historically literate, nonideological common sense. That may sound like faint praise, but in an America that sometimes seems poised between reckless adventure and helpless inertia, centrist common sense is something to be treasured. By "centrist," I mean Hirsh is a liberal internationalist who has come to see the value, as well as the inevitability, of applying American muscle to the world's problems, up to a point.
Where, exactly, that point is, the reader may have trouble telling. Hirsh is a hawk on the Balkan wars (who isn't, these days?), and he confesses to having been badly wrong in anticipating that our ouster of the Taliban would turn out disastrously. On a harder test -- Iraq -- he ducks. Both of these books apparently went to press on the cusp of the war, so the authors knew whatever they said would be overtaken by events. Prestowitz nonetheless plunges in; he says that "at this point there is little choice but for the United States and whatever partners it can gather to overthrow Saddam and occupy Iraq. The cost of not doing so is now greater than that of doing so." Hirsh does not quite say what he would do, though he gives the impression he would not have supported an invasion without United Nations sanction.
Poor, maligned, unsexy multilateralism has, for all its faults, historically been the default position of American foreign policy, and Hirsh does a powerful job of reminding us why. He demonstrates that the "international community" we often disparage as feckless, corrupt and inhospitable (Condoleezza Rice called it "illusory") is in fact an instrument we built, one that most often serves as an extension of American power, and one that we desperately need.
Even the United Nations, despite its noisy membership of pipsqueak tyrants and volatile states, serves a variety of useful functions, most importantly co-opting potential adversaries like China and Russia. As for other international bodies, "the W.T.O. is the world's rule-setter; the I.M.F. its credit union; and the World Bank its principal charity," he writes. America dominates all of these organizations, and can use them to "take the raw edge off American hegemony."
More than useful instruments, Hirsh argues, these agencies have become, bit by bit, better advocates of the values we profess -- the freedoms of marketplace and voting booth, the rule of law. We need these imperfect surrogates because America has a serious credibility problem peddling values on its own. Hirsh calls this "ideological blowback." For example, we cherish democracy in principle, just not in Pakistan, not right now.
Hirsh is good on the subtleties of how, as countries develop the wherewithal to challenge us, they become inexorably entangled in the global order -- the way, for example, the manager of a privatized Chinese enterprise quickly develops "a kind of dual citizenship" as he learns to anticipate the needs of his foreign customers. And America is inescapably entangled, too. Even our defense industry, once the domain of sheltered, single-client weapons manufacturers, has shifted more and more to global suppliers of technology whose health depends on the rules of free trade.
Hirsh outlines a sensible basis for detente between the warring hegemonists and internationalists, an America that leads without bullying. That is an accomplishment to be congratulated, even if you do not entirely share his optimism that this consensus is emerging before our eyes.

HEADLINE: BODY AND IMAGE; 
One Size Definitely Does Not Fit All

BYLINE:  By MARY DUENWALD

 BODY:
"DID you know that it's Beautiful Women Month?" a much-forwarded e-mail message asks, before making a few pertinent statements. Here's a sampling: "Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14"; "If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours"; and "The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a 12-14."
 There are more "facts on figures," not all of them perfectly accurate. Ms. Monroe, who was 5 feet 5 1/2 inches and weighed between 118 to 135 pounds, may have been busty enough to fill out a size 14, but partly because sizes were smaller in the 1950's. And Barbie is indeed disproportionate -- a 1995 study found that for a woman with an average body type to attain Barbie's shape, she would need to grow 24 inches (making her more than 7 feet tall), take 6 inches off her waist and add 5 to her chest. But if she came to life, she could presumably still walk upright, the director of the study said. 
 As for the average woman's weight today, it has jumped to 152 pounds in the 90's from 144 in the late 70's. 
But even after correcting the e-mail's exaggerations, the message remains: today's culture holds up standards of thinness that do not make sense for the average woman and -- the e-mail's tone plainly suggests -- it is high time women stood up to the pressure.
Other signs of a grass-roots movement in favor of women accepting their bodies, whatever their size, can be found in movies like "Real Women Have Curves" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"; in Internet sites like AdiosBarbie.com, About-Face.org and Loveyourbody.org, which urge women to love their shapes; in books like "Skinny Women Are Evil: Notes of a Big Girl in a Small-Minded World" by the comedian Mo'Nique; and in the sixth annual Love Your Body Day, on Oct. 15, sponsored by the National Organization for Women Foundation.
"There's momentum that's finally beginning to build," said Debbie Burgard, a psychologist in Los Altos, Calif., whose clients are women with weight problems and eating disorders.
This is not simply a pro-fat movement, or a throwing in of the collective towel when it comes to weight control. In fact, weight experts point to signs that a weakening obsession with skinniness can lead to a stronger attraction to fitness. Curves (formerly called Curves for Women) fitness centers, which are more welcoming to larger women than the average gym, are the fastest-growing franchise in America, according to Entrepreneur magazine. Over the last seven years, the number of locations has grown to more than 5,500, while a new one opens every four hours, said Gary Heavin, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, which is based in Waco, Tex. Until January, Curves did not advertise.
"Most gyms are more akin to nightclubs than they are to support groups or exercise centers," Mr. Heavin said. "Women felt they needed to lose 10 pounds before joining."
Curves centers are relatively small -- they fit easily into a modest strip mall or neighborhood storefront -- and offer a half-hour workout designed for women unaccustomed to exercise. A large part of the appeal, Mr. Heavin said, is that average or heavier-than-average women can get together with like-size women to support and inspire one another.
The phenomenal success of Curves, many experts say, is a sign that women are accepting, and therefore taking better care of, their bodies.
WOMEN are also writing more letters to magazine editors, criticizing the spindly fashion models and praising efforts to include bigger women, said Cindi Leive, the editor in chief of Glamour. She has received thousands of responses to her second annual "body love" issue in May. "It's now a mainstream idea that no one should be allowed to tell us that we need to diet in order to have worth in this world," Ms. Leive said, "and it wasn't 10 years ago."
Emme, perhaps the most famous of the full-figured fashion models, has been lecturing at college campuses and even testified before a Congressional subcommittee about the need to help women overcome their problems with body image. 
"What I stand for is accepting your body type, whether you are a size 2 or a size 14, and then taking care of yourself with a balance of exercise and eating really well," said Emme, who introduced her own line of women's clothing sizes 14 to 24 last fall.
Another popular full-figured model is Mia Tyler, the focus of several Web sites. Ms. Tyler, a half-sister of the actress Liv Tyler, has modeled for Lane Bryant and H & M's Big Is Beautiful line.
But will this new awareness be enough to cure the plague of body hating that, mental health experts contend, is widely and deeply ingrained in American women?
That may be too much to ask.
"If there's a change so far, it may be that women have gone from being horribly dissatisfied with their own bodies to being somewhat less horribly dissatisfied," said Dr. Kelly D. Brownell, the director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders, and the author of the Barbie proportions study. "It's very hard to find a woman who really likes her body. Even if she likes the shape, she will not like her toes, her knees, her elbows or her ankles. There's always something wrong."
Prof. Susie Orbach, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science, has been addressing the subject since 1978, when her book, "Fat Is a Feminist Issue," was first published. "I think there could be a zeitgeist change, but there hasn't been yet," she said. "We're still not fully recognizing that the body-image problem is a public health emergency."
Body dissatisfaction, Dr. Brownell said, stems from two assumptions -- that a body can be shaped at will, so that "the only thing that lies between any woman and perfection is effort," and that an imperfect body reflects an imperfect person. "Superimposed on these wrong assumptions is the highly unrealistic body ideal," he said. "It leads women into conflict with their own body."
The conflict can play a role in eating disorders like anorexia nervosa (chronic undereating), bulimia (overeating followed by purging) or chronic binge eating but, psychiatrists say, they are too complicated to be explained by body dissatisfaction alone. Full-blown eating disorders are rare. But even for a woman not suffering a full-blown eating disorder, disappointment with the size or shape of her body can be a daily problem. A recent study at the University of Central Florida, in Orlando, showed that adult women who have a positive view of their bodies are happier no matter what their age is. 
The trouble is, most women do not have a positive view of their bodies, experts say.
"It's a subclinical pathology that is so ubiquitous, women think of it as a normal obsession to have," Professor Orbach said.
At this point, even if movies, television and magazines all suddenly started promoting images of normal-size or large women, the skinny-body ideal would persist, Professor Orbach said, because it is so embedded in the average woman's psyche. The notion that a woman should be rail thin, she and others said, is transmitted from one generation to the next.
"We're in our third generation now," Dr. Burgard said. "I have patients now whose grandmothers were anorexic."
About a third of American women are obese, meaning that their body mass index -- a ratio of weight to height -- is 30 or more. Another third are overweight, with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 (under 25 is considered healthy). The average 152.3-pound American woman who is just under 5 feet 4 inches will have an index of 27, overweight but not obese.
A woman whose body mass index climbs above 25 or, more dangerously, past 30, stands an increasing risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and various kinds of cancer -- like breast, colon and endometrial cancer. Excess fat strains the body's metabolism and the skeleton, leading to insulin resistance, plaque buildup in the arteries and other problems. 
THE fact that widespread negative body image coexists with the growing weight problem is "no accident," Professor Orbach said. The "narrow aesthetic," she added, that is promoted in popular culture leads women into a vicious cycle of overeating. "They think they should deny themselves food, and then they eat more than they want," she said, "and then they feel terrible so they eat too much again, and they don't know how to solve that problem, so they eat more."
Black women, many studies show, are less likely than white women to hate their size, but that gap is shrinking, experts say.
Dr. Kumea Shorter-Gooden, a psychologist at the California School of Professional Psychology in Alhambra, and a co-author of a book called "Shifting: The Double Lives of Black Women in America," to be published in September, recently interviewed hundreds of black women, partly about their view of themselves. "African-American women are more comfortable with being overweight than Anglo women are, and African-American women are in general heavier than white women," she said. Black culture, she said, does not encourage thinness as extremely as white culture does.
But increasing numbers of African-American women are engaging in such destructive eating-related behaviors as starvation diets, vomiting and using laxatives, Dr. Shorter-Gooden said.
Body-image problems have begun to affect a wider range of age groups -- girls as young as 10 and women in their 50's and older -- psychologists have found.
Another disturbing trend in body image, Ms. Leive said, is the soaring popularity of plastic surgery. "You're hard pressed to find a Hollywood actress who hasn't either had work done or has spent the last six months nibbling on crumbs," she said.
What can be done? Women, Dr. Brownell said, must "uncouple their body esteem from their basic self-esteem," and realize how destructive these unrealistic ideals can be.
Society, he said, must learn to appreciate a greater variation in body shapes and sizes. "We accept variations in hair color, eye color and facial features, and we should do that with body weights," he said.
"Size acceptance is really important," Dr. Burgard agreed. "I don't see how we're going to stop eating disorders until we stop reading character into the size of people's bodies. It's stereotyping. We've made progress against other stereotypes, and we can make progress against this one, too."

HEADLINE: THE LEAP OF HIS LIFE; 
A Rookie and His Burdens

BYLINE:  By Peter de Jonge; Peter de Jonge is the author, with James Patterson, of the novel "The Beach House." He last wrote for the magazine about sportscasters.

 BODY:
Midway through the second quarter of an early-season game against the Memphis Grizzlies, the rookie power forward for the Phoenix Suns, Amare Stoudemire, flying diagonally across the paint, made an unlikely but life-affirming attempt to convert a low-altitude rebound into a reverse put-back dunk. Only that he's 20 and what the N.B.A. auditors of flesh and bone call "a freak" enabled him to even imagine that he could make this play. From a little triangular section of seats right behind the Suns bench, reserved for homeboys, lovers, swindlers and kin, Stoudemire's people looked on. Among them was Marwan Stoudemire, Amare's 14-year-old half-brother, whom Amare brought west with him from central Florida and enrolled in a private Phoenix day school. Marwan is not a freak. He wears a metal cast of the Cartoon Network antihero "The Brain" on a chain around his neck, has a heartbreaking smile and soft, ancient eyes, and if anything, he is small and slight for a ninth grader. After the game, when he told his brother's towering teammates that he touched the rim that afternoon, all he got was rolled eyes. 
 But as his brother stretched for that rebound, Marwan, before anyone else in America West Arena, sensed the possibility of highlight-footage immortality and sprung from his seat. In his excitement, he spilled hot chocolate on his immaculate powder-blue Ecko sweatsuit; as he ruefully dabbed at the stain, his cellphone rang. The call, exhorting him to be cool, was from Michael Walker, Amare's homeboy and roommate, sitting two seats away. Unfazed, Marwan looked over at Alexi, an Arizona State sophomore Amare met at a Nelly concert, and blamed her for the spill. 
 "My fault?" said Alexi, a big "A" dangling from her wrist and calligraphy scrolling up her lower back.
"That's right," said their other companion, Artis Wilson. Wilson, 6-foot-6, slim and stylish and a former schoolyard legend himself back in Lake Wales, Fla., is the former husband of Carrie Stoudemire, Marwan and Amare's mother. Wilson is also Marwan's temporary guardian, which might explain why he jumped to Marwan's defense. "And don't be sitting back all quiet," he went on to tell Alexi. "This ain't the opera, girl."
On television, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that the outcome of games actually matters. In the comped pews, it's plain that every salaried second of official N.B.A. action is pure anticlimax, a 48-minute celebration of the blessed fact that the drama of getting there is finally over, and that for the millionaire players and their friends and family, it's all good now, at least for a while. When Walker yelled "Big Al," second-year reserve forward Alton Ford pointed back, chuckling, and even Amare, who plays with a glazed-over deadpan he calls his "swagger," sneaked quick handsome grins at his girl, Alexi. 
Just before the half, Carrie Stoudemire joined the party by phone from Florida, where she was serving four months at Lowell Correctional Institute. One hand cupped over his Nokia, Wilson connected his ex-wife, in prison, to her son's heroic exploits on the court. "Amare. Fifteen feet straight away. Jumper. Net. And now some Grizzly is trying to take it to the hole. REJECTED! I tried to warn the boy before he did that, but he wouldn't listen."
Before she and Wilson were cut off by her prison curfew, the ex-couple giddily discussed her imminent transition from inmate to front-row N.B.A. mom. I couldn't hear Carrie, but this was Wilson's end of the conversation: "You aren't going to sit here and be cool. . . . You may try to be cool, but you ain't never been cool. . . . I'll be what kind of cheerleader? . . . Oh, that's really funny. . . . Well if I put that on, what are you going to put on? A grass skirt?"
For all the joking, there was an undercurrent of anxiety, because Carrie Stoudemire, who because of numerous convictions has been in and out of jail for much of her sons' childhoods, was getting out the next morning. At 8 a.m., she would step through the gates and climb into a limo that would take her to Orlando, where $40,000 of jewelry would be waiting along with the $100,000 Mercedes Amare bought her. Then on Saturday morning, after two days of shopping and primping, so, as Wilson put it, "Carrie can arrive in style," she had a ticket on the red-eye to Phoenix. 
Female genetic lottery winners become supermodels. Male genetic lottery winners play professional basketball, and this week in Manhattan, the N.B.A.'s 29 general managers will divvy up the planet's annual harvest at the league's draft. To refine their thinking, they will have reviewed ad nauseam the results of the 2002 draft, in which the first choice was a 7-foot-5 21-year-old from China; the fifth, a 7-foot 19-year-old from Georgia (as in Tbilisi, not Atlanta); and the seventh, a 6-foot-11 behemoth from S-o Carlos, Brazil. But the best of all of them was the ninth pick, Stoudemire, a 6-foot-10, 245-pound teenager from Lake Wales, Fla.
It is too soon to deliver a verdict on all of last year's choices, much less fully understand the critical indicators. But one question every G.M. will have tried to answer is how Stoudemire, who recently became the first player directly out of high school to be named the N.B.A.'s Rookie of the Year and whose first-season numbers easily outshone previous high-schoolers turned superstars, like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady, was still around at No. 9. 
One insight the G.M.'s could take from the early returns is that getting caught up in anything but a coldblooded appraisal of genetic endowments is bound to break their hearts and get them fired. Every team knew Stoudemire was the funkiest athlete in the draft, a monstrous combination of length, hops, quickness and power. But it was the soft data that led them astray. 
And there was so much of it. For starters, Stoudemire was raw even for his age, which was only19. It's one thing for a top American prospect to emerge from high school without an education, but we expect our matriculating man-children to be fluent in basketball. Stoudemire played only two years in high school, but cannily spun his inexperience as evidence of staggering potential. "When I go on to college or the N.B.A.," he told Slam magazine while he was in high school, "and get somebody to teach me basketball, man, it is over." Nevertheless, his best move, which is getting the ball with his back to the basket, turning on his defender with a terrifying suddenness and throwing it down in his wincing face, is difficult to pick up from a chalk talk.
Then there was the disquieting fact that Stoudemire's Cypress Creek High managed to win just 16 of its 29 games in his senior year. What kind of dent would Stoudemire make on the league if he could barely lift a high school team above .500?
But what had general managers really freaked was the Stoudemire family. Chaotic households are the smithies of the N.B.A., but Stoudemire's first coming of age was precarious by any measure. His father died when he was 12, and his mother has been in and out of jail on a variety of convictions for theft and forgery. During Stoudemire's middle-school years, his mother yanked him and Marwan out of classrooms as she moved abruptly among various towns in Florida and New York State. Between sophomore and senior years, Stoudemire switched schools seven times. What Stoudemire said about Marwan, who lost his father when he was 7, also applies to him. "Growing up without a mom or dad," Amare told me, "is going to be tough on anyone." 
It was certainly tough on Amare's older brother, Hazell Jr. After spending a year in juvenile detention, he led Bradenton Southeast High School to a record of 35-0 and a Florida state championship. Yet even the bona fide prospects of pro stardom could not keep Hazell out of trouble; he is now doing three to nine years for drug dealing and sexual abuse at a prison in upstate New York.
General managers aren't shrinks, but they've absorbed enough Dr. Phil to know that some measure of childhood stability is necessary to becoming a productive, law-abiding adult. League rosters may be stuffed with the sons of absent fathers, but entering the league without either parent is pretty much uncharted terrain. Surely, empathetic G.M.'s thought, a kid making the jump straight out of high school is going to be in over his head without his mom. 
Before the draft, the Suns were leery of Stoudemire, too. "We do an extensive background check," says Bryan Colangelo, the general manager and son of the Suns owner, Jerry Colangelo. "The information that turned up was nothing I would say would cause great concern." 
They also had Stoudemire sit down for a psychological test, as they do with all prospective players. "It's a brief 10- or 15-minute sketch of who that person is," says Colangelo, a Cornell graduate who was struggling to sell commercial real estate in New York when his father welcomed him into the fold. "It's prepared by a sports psychologist and administered by a team counselor and graded and prepared by an outside firm." 
Even after they drafted him, the Suns behaved as if Stoudemire might surface on the police blotter without full-time baby-sitting and remedial input. As the season approached, they talked of weaving him "the perfect cocoon" and recruited Scott Williams, a veteran who as a teenager lost both his parents in a murder-suicide, to be his good neighbor in the locker room. The assistant G.M., Mark West, was charged withmonitoring his comings, goings and cash flow.
 Seemingly oblivious to all this attention, Stoudemire came in and took care of business, dunking as mercilessly on the heads of N.B.A. All-Stars as he had on overmatched schoolboys. More than that, he fired up a Suns team that had entered the season with decidedly modest expectations. And there hasn't been a whiff of off-court malfeasance. When the traffic from Scottsdale made him late to a preseason practice or two, he moved closer to the downtown arena. He organized his life around simple routines, chilling on his couch after practice, napping before games and limiting his night life to trips to the mall for "something to chew on" at the Cheesecake Factory. 
When I arrived in Phoenix, Amare was living with his old friend Michael Walker; he had his brother Marwan set up in a Scottsdale town house under the caring eye of Artis Wilson. The season was young, and things had settled into a calm rhythm. But nothing has ever stayed that way for long in the Stoudemire household.
Unlike many players' mothers, who are unwilling to uproot their lives to move to a city from which their son might be traded at the drop of a hat, Carrie Stoudemire was coming to town to reinvent herself and stay. And everything the team had heard from Stoudemire's agent, John Wolf, indicated that she would insist on being a major part of the picture, if not run the whole show. 
The team got a glimpse of her volatility last summer when Frank Johnson, the Suns coach, accompanied Stoudemire to his mother's sentencing hearing in Florida. The bitter paradox of her most recent legal difficulty is that it was based on attending last year's N.B.A. draft. When she left for New York last June without permission, she violated her probation. It seems cruel to punish the biological urge to witness the moment your son becomes a multimillionaire, as well as to give the party afterward for which Wolf got stuck for the $3,000 Champagne bill. But impulsiveness had cost Carrie Stoudemire before. 
"Carrie didn't actually think they would violate her, because she had been doing so good on probation," Wilson says. "Plus she had paid back all this money for restitution and done everything she could to get off probation early. I think the problem was that the parole officer and Carrie had some words before, and I think that's 75 percent of the reason for the lady violating her. Carrie is the type, she is going to speak her mind. She may regret some of the things she says later, but at the time, she's going to say it." 
Johnson says that at the hearing, Carrie Stoudemire was considering trying to work out a new deal that would have allowed her to come to Phoenix and help her son set up house. It was a move, he says, that could have backfired in the form of a much longer sentence. In a highly emotional encounter, Amare was able to persuade her "to just do the time and get it over with." And according to someone close to the team, Carrie Stoudemire did not help her cause at the hearing when she kept her sentencing judge waiting for half an hour. 
Still, in the middle of all this drama, Carrie Stoudemire managed to exert her will on the organization. "We all had dinner one night," says Johnson, a former N.B.A. journeyman who was entering his first full season as head coach. "Afterward, she and I stayed in the car and talked for two and a half hours. She filled me in on Amare and what he needs. It was extremely valuable. Carrie's a very strong-willed woman. She'll tell you what she wants. She's got very definite rules she believes in, and if they're not followed, she'll let you know."
Part of what makes Carrie Stoudemire so tough is that nothing in her past will embarrass her into receding into the woodwork. As Wilson sees it, that refusal to quietly accept the hand she's been dealt is, for better and worse, who she is. "Unless you're someone who knows that you're never going to make more than $30,000 a year your whole life, it's hard for you to judge someone like Carrie," he says. "Carrie is the boldest woman I've ever known." 
All of which made the team's preparations for transforming her into a happy member of the Suns family, particularly through a program for parents dreamed up by the younger Colangelo, unlikely, if not laughable. "The idea," says Colangelo, "is to bring everyone in for a weekend and put them up in a nice hotel. It will be sometime in the year; we're still working on the dates. This is not just for Carrie, and we're going to get them to realize what our organization is about, help them understand what we expect of their sons and what they should expect of their sons and what they should expect of life in the N.B.A."
Colangelo is particularly proud of the name he coined for his little retreat, which he has yet to hold. "I call it N.B.A. Moms 101," he says. 
After practice one afternoon, I followed Stoudemire and Michael Walker back to a small, stone-sided ranch house with palm trees out front that Stoudemire was renting in a nondescript upper-middle class grid 10 minutes from the arena. Except for the loaner Caddy in the garage -- Stoudemire's Escalade was getting the requisite N.B.A. $50,000 Gucci makeover -- the place looked abandoned. The small pool in back was half empty, the shades drawn and the front yard burnt to a crisp.
Once inside, my hosts disappeared into their bedrooms so Stoudemire's pit bull and I could get acquainted. After a lonely morning in the backyard, JT had abandonment issues of her own. Beside herself, she bounded off the floor to paw my chest and root between my thighs with her stony prehistoric snout. 
For distraction, I scanned the minimal furniture. A couch and chair faced a big-screen TV, and between them sat a stack of video games. The only personal effects were a handful of Polaroids of Stoudemire and his older brother posing in front of a phony backdrop of palm trees and sand taken last summer at a correctional facility in New York.
Since Hazell Jr. is also 6-foot-10, and 70 pounds heavier than his brother, the two are a formidable sight, particularly staring down over huge crossed forearms. Knowledgeable observers insist that it's still not clear who is the better player. Certainly, Hazell, whose nickname in high school was Baby Shaq, was more intimidating and, according to his mother, made Amare, himself on the aggressive end of the spectrum, seem like a puppy. Maybe that is how it goes for would-be entertainers from America's gladiatorial class. Exceed a certain level of aggressiveness, you become an inmate. Stay just on the right side of it, you get a sneaker contract. 
Hazell, who is just 26, may still be young enough to play pro basketball when he gets out, if not here then overseas, but he has never had his younger brother's passion for the game or capacity for sidestepping trouble. Burney Hayes, a Lake Wales cop who cared for Amare and Marwan during their mother's absences, blames adults who let him down for Hazell's difficulties. "Hazell learned at the wrong time how easy it was for him to make people back up," Hayes says. "And if he sees you're intimidated, oh, he's going to play on it."
When Stoudemire emerged from his room, he said we could talk while he and Walker played video games. Before I could object, he inserted a cartridge marked "Florida vs. Florida State" into his PlayStation2 console and collapsed on the couch, he and Walker instantly deep into the game.
On the court, Stoudemire gives nothing away, barely acknowledging his defender or even his own teammates. In his best games, he plays as if in a private fury, grabbing offensive rebounds off the backs of bewildered teammates and dunking on them almost as much as his opponents.
On his couch, he rarely took his eyes off the screen. "Amare has a hard time showing emotion," Wilson told me earlier. "You can tell when he's happy sometimes, but for the most part he always has the same look. A lot of time when he's angry, you won't actually know it unless he tells you." In her long conversation with the Suns coach, Carrie Stoudemire told him she hadn't seen her son cry since the afternoon when he was 12 and learned that his father had died.
There has been a lot of hand-wringing about throwing callow teenagers into the caldron of pro sports, but watching Stoudemire, joystick in hand, you could sense that his transition from Cypress Creek High School to the Western Conference had been the one easy segue in his uneasy life. 
Rigors of the N.B.A.? That workday consisted of a two-and-a-half-hour practice, much of it at the foul line, an assistant snapping the ball back to him after each shot so he wouldn't have to step off the stripe. After a shower, a quick check of his pager and both cellphones, 10 minutes in his Cadillac listening to the latest bit of resuscitated Tupac, he was back on his couch playing video games with a pal he's had since fourth grade. 
What might have been perilous was going to college, where he would have had to share a room with strangers, go to classes he wasn't prepared for and be stone broke and surrounded by white people who weren't. Pro basketball is one of the few venues in which a poor African-American can legally make a fortune without having to spend inordinate amounts of time with people whom Stoudemire segments into "hippies and rednecks" and don't think it's not the cherry on the cake of his day. In Stoudemire's house as well as the Suns locker room, the TV is tuned to BET, and in the car in between them, the music is always hip-hop or R&B. When we discussed a proposed reality show about his first year in the league, it became clear Stoudemire has never heard of Ozzy Osbourne. 
But if adjusting to life in the N.B.A. has been a minor challenge, getting there -- a dream he had been burnishing since his first reverse dunk at 13 -- required one bold calculated gamble after another. Before he got to Phoenix, Stoudemire bounced through six high schools in three years, including two brief stops at Mount Zion Academy, the North Carolina basketball factory attended by Tracy McGrady. In the various accounts of Stoudemire's development, all this moving around is often characterized as an example of how the system betrays the young men it is supposed to help. But every time Stoudemire jumped ship, he was operating less like a student than like an ambitious C.E.O., willing to relocate as many times as it took to find the right situation. If coaches and basketball pimps were playing him for whatever they could get, he was working them just as hard. None of it was personal, just business. 
When Stoudemire was declared academically ineligible as a freshman, Hayes had Stoudemire tested for a learning disability. Instead, the test confirmed something heand his wife suspected, which is that Stoudemire has an extremely high I.Q. Though that intelligence may not have shown up in his high-school transcripts, it is clear in the way he threaded his way through the land mines of his high-school experience.
Entering the league out of high school is about aura as well as skill, and everything Stoudemire did, and managed not to do, for five years, including the decision to participate in an HBO program about his checkered high-school career, was a play for exposure. With a father in the ground, a mother in jail and an older brother heading there fast, Stoudemire never stopped plotting career moves.
An example came the summer before his senior year, when Stoudemire abandoned the Adidas-sponsored camp for the one sponsored by Nike. "That had never been done before," Stoudemire says, the slightest trace of a smile at the corner of his mouth, "switching camps and going like that."
HBO implied that the jump was prompted by a timely visit to Carrie Stoudemire at a Polk County jail by George Raveling, the former U.S.C. coach turned Nike procurer. "That's bull, man," Stoudemire says in his startlingly deep voice, the truth of what he's saying so transparent there's no need to emphasize it with eye contact. "She was incarcerated at the time, bro, and nobody was really looking out for the fam, and Rav pays a visit and puts $100 in her commissary. She didn't even get a chance to touch the money. He put it in so she could buy snacks here and there, you know what I mean? I was going to the Nike All-American regardless. I am trying to go out of high school. On the A.A.U. circuit, I was destroying everybody. I don't mean to sound cocky or nothing, but I was doing me. I figured if I go to the Nike camp and get the player of the camp, I'd be the best player in the country, no question."
The most impressive part of his high-school resume was how he handled himself after being declared ineligible his junior year by the Florida High School Activities Association after a controversy over his Mount Zion transcripts, which may have been doctored by the school. In an entire year without basketball, he managed to stay out of trouble almost entirely. His only infraction was a 10-day suspension for pretending to hurl a basketball at a gym teacher, who was telling him to get off the court. She claimed that while Stoudemire had her in his sights, her life passed before her eyes.
To avoid the fate of so many around him, Stoudemire has learned to seal out the world, as if by throwing a switch. By now it has become so ingrained that his first reaction to any entreaty from the outside world is "No," which can make him appear chilly and absent. Unlike the Suns star point guard, Stephon Marbury, who has been supporting more than a dozen friends and relatives since he turned pro, Stoudemire has kept the purse strings tight. "A lot of my family, I'm not going to support," he says. "You know why? 'Cause just yesterday, I was doing really bad, and they didn't support me. I wasn't doing too good just last year. They didn't think I was going to go out of high school. Now that I did, I had two cousins call from New York I never even saw before. I don't know how they got my number. They didn't really want me to send them money, but I could hear in their voice, the next time they call, it will be 'Well, I need a favor.' Well, I'm going to change my number before you even ask me." 
Lake Wales is a Citrus Belt town of 35,000, some 40 miles southwest of Orlando. The Stoudemires, Wilsons and Palmores (Carrie's family) have lived there and known of one another for a couple of generations. On a hot morning a few weeks after I visited Amare in Phoenix, I drove by the corner house where Carrie lived as a child and the now-empty lot just off Lincoln Avenue, the bar-lined heart of the town's ghetto, where Amare's father, Hazell Sr., and his nine siblings lived. Amare's grandfather moved to Lake Wales from Alabama for work in a sawmill and was later stabbed to death at a card game on Christmas morning. My guide was Earnest Stoudemire, Amare's uncle and a semiretired police officer, who told me that when he returned from Vietnam and became a cop, Lincoln Avenue was where he got "his workout on Saturday night from the fights, shootings and cuttings."
He also pointed to the lot where the house once stood in which Amare often lived with his father, a stylish, athletic man who had a couple of years of college and had just given up on a lawn business to sign on with a trucking company when he died at 41. "That still makes me mad," says Earnest, who survived a heart attack at 39. "The males in our family have a problem with high cholesterol. Hazell had been having chest pains and ignored them, and he knew better. If he was alive, he'd have two sons in the N.B.A. right now, because he was the one who could control Hazell Jr." 
The main drug corridor north from Miami, Highway 27, runs straight through Lake Wales and brought a crack epidemic that touched all three families and that at one point required Amare's uncle to arrest his younger brother, Hazell Sr. Years of harassment by Earnest and his colleagues have only succeeded in moving the crack trade a few blocks over to a desolate stretch that exudes a palpable menace even in blazing sunlight.
Earnest said that when he signed on with the police department, a black person had no hope of advancement, and despite a college degree, he didn't get a promotion for 17 years. Eventually, a new chief came in with more egalitarian standards, and Earnest spent 13 years as a homicide detective before becoming a captain, the highest black appointment in the department's history. Now, as a part-time officer, he does some pastoring and has an outreach ministry specializing in the eradication of evil spirits. He has performed some 1,000 exorcisms.
Most of the black population of Lake Wales is settled now, but Carrie's and Artis's parents, like many of their generation, were migrants working the Florida orange groves in spring and the upstate New York fruit and vegetable farms in the summer. Although Carrie and Artis dated briefly in 1984, they didn't get together seriously until half a dozen years later, when they found they had both signed on for the same summer upstate apple-picking trip organized by Wilson's uncle.
The two were married from 1990 to 1995, spending much of that time in New York State around Middletown and Newburgh, where Wilson, who had dropped out of high school and joined the Navy, worked at a chemical factory and did maintenance at night. They never had any children, but all three of Carrie's sons spent time with them. Hazell Jr. got into his trouble when he was living with Wilson, and Amare and Marwan were with Carrie and him when, over a matter of months, each boy lost his father. Wilson has a record, too, which he described as "a little bit of everything." Like Carrie, he has also suffered from crack addiction, but says he has been clean for several years. 
Amare and his younger brother spent the last couple of years of their time in Lake Wales in a corner of Burney Hayes's trailer home behind the elementary school. Their life in Phoenix is a far cry from that, and for a while at least, Artis Wilson shared in the upgrade. The afternoon after I went to Amare's house, Wilson took me to pick up Marwan after school. He sat low behind the wheel of his two-tone DeVille, gold shades fighting off the desert sun, as he made the 50-minute drive into Phoenix. Stoudemire's high-school transfers may have been self-initiated, but the earlier upheavals were not. And for Marwan, who didn't have the dream of a pro career to sustain him, they were devastating.
"Marwan almost feels like he has to keep the family together," Wilson said. "When Carrie and I first got married, he couldn't sit and watch Carrie walk outside because he didn't know whether she was going to come back, and if she went outside, he would run to the door and cry. I was, like, 'Boy, sit down; she's just going to the telephone.' Over a period of time, you know it affected him more than it did Amare, but now he's going to be all right because all this is behind Carrie now, and they're coming into this new life and whole new lifestyle, and I don't think she's ever going to leave him again."
As soon as Amare, who wears a diamond-studded "Pinky" around his neck in solidarity with his brother's "Brain," signed his contract, he made it a priority to get Marwan's education on track. When Wilson and Marwan arrived in Phoenix last July, they were met at the airport by Frank Johnson and his wife, Amy, who took them to a few private schools she had researched based on Carrie Stoudemire's criteria. Her recommendation was St. Mary's in east-central Phoenix, based on its academic and athletic strength as well as its economic and racial diversity. Wilson concurred. The downside is the lengthy rush-hour commute from the town house Stoudemire is renting for Wilson and Marwan in Scottsdale. 
"I get him up at 6 o'clock, make him some breakfast and drive him to school," Wilson said. "Most of the time, I pick him up at 2:30. Sometimes he stays after school. Like today he has a detention because I got him there late. So that was my fault this time. We come back here. He takes a nap, gets something to eat and at 7 o'clock he goes to the Sylvan Learning Center. I get him from there at 9. We come back here, watch a little TV and talk a little bit and go to sleep by 10."
When Wilson wasn't chaffeuring Marwan, he was on the phone. "We got three lines in the house and two cells," Wilson said, "and most of the time they're pretty busy." Carrie Stoudemire called a dozen times a day from minimum security in Florida; the more restricted Hazell Jr., once a day from medium security in New York. Stoudemire's windfall and prospect of long-term security has given an unexpected infusion of hope to each troubled member of his immediate family, and a lot of that hope is channeled by Wilson through the phone. 
For Wilson, Carrie's arrival would be the first step in a staggered reunion that won't be complete until Hazell Jr., who is up for parole early next year, also makes it west. "I want to see their family when Carrie is here and his brother is here and they're all back together again," he said. "Because over the period of their lifetime, they have been through so much, and they had so much to overcome and so much adversity and so much that has gone wrong. You know, this to me is God's way of repaying them. Saying, you know, 'Hey, it was bad, but look at it now.' So the thing for me is to see them as a family again and look at them all together."
Wilson took particular pleasure in the conversations between Amare and Hazell Jr. "I love to hear them talk," he says. "Amare is very close to his brother. His brother gives him advice about girls, talks to him about playing on the court and just about life in general -- watching out for people, his money, everything. Amare respects his brother's opinion and judgment about a lot of stuff."
As the Cadillac gobbles the miles, I asked Wilson if he thinks he and Carrie are getting back together. "No, I don't think so," Wilson said. "A lot of women that know her and know me, they think it might happen, but I don't think like that, and neither does Carrie. The love, as far as being intimate, it ain't there no more. As friends, she's my best friend, and I'm her best friend." 
Wilson spoke of Amare's need to be wary of women who might want him for the wrong reasons. Wilson isn't overly concerned, because of all the people cautioning him about just that possibility. Then again, getting advice about love is like weatherproofing a shack against a hurricane. "When it hits, it hits," Wilson said with a gravely laugh, "and that's it."
Romance is something Wilson knows a little about. He was not having trouble meeting women in Phoenix. "I meet them anywhere," he says. "If I'm at a red light, I see a pretty girl, I let my window down and speak, 'Hey, what's up?' I just have fun." 
One afternoon, he walked into a clothing store and came out with the phone number of a petite woman going through a rough divorce, and it did not seem like a lark anymore. "I'm crazy about her," Wilson said.
We pulled off the highway, rolled down a side street and found Marwan, in dress-code khakis and white button-down shirt, standing outside the school in an afternoon swirl of just-released students. He bade farewell to friends, hopped into the back seat, screwed his earrings back in and was asleep before he could be asked to divulge a detail of his day. 
Carrie Stoudemire did not make it out to Phoenix as quickly as planned. She wasn't on the Saturday red-eye out of Orlando or the Sunday or Monday morning flights either. And after five months in which she had burned up long-distance minutes with hourly check-ins from Lowell, she dropped out of phone contact soon after rolling out of the prison gates. 
"About 11 in the morning, I called and spoke to the limo driver, who said she was in some store," Wilson said. "And she didn't call back until 8 the next night." 
With her N.B.A.-playing son on a road trip, her urgency to get to Phoenix had apparently lifted. It wasn't until Tuesday afternoon that Wilson met Carrie's plane at the airport. From there, they picked up Marwan at St. Mary's and after dinner stopped by Amare's house, which Carrie found scandalously modest, because Carrie wanted to see JT. "She's crazy about that dog," Wilson said.
When the Suns returned from the road, the team put out the welcome mat for the mother of their Rookie of the Year candidate with a little party before a home game. According to Wilson, Carrie kept to herself, as she did when the team invited mothers onto the team plane for a short trip to the West Coast to play the Clippers. "Carrie wouldn't mingle," Wilson said. "She never has. She's a loner. She'll speak to the other mothers at games, but she's not going to become friends in the way that they will do stuff together."
As for relations with Wilson, all was quiet for a couple of weeks. When he would get back from dropping Marwan off at school, the two went out for late breakfasts or stayed around the house and talked and made frequent trips to the malls. There was a little testiness about Wilson dipping into an account not allocated for his expenses, but everything was essentially copacetic, he says, until she found out about the petite woman from the store.
Carrie and Wilson hadn't been a couple for years, but Carrie gave him the age-old ultimatum to stop seeing the woman or get out. By taking sole care of Marwan since July, freeing Amare to focus on basketball, Wilson had provided a crucial service to the Suns and Stoudemire, and though he had not received the salary he says he had been promised, he considered himself an employee of the family. "And I don't know too many employers who are going to tell you who to date," Wilson said. Two days before Christmas, a female friend he had made in town offered her couch. "If it wasn't for her," he said, "I'd be sleeping under a bridge." 
For Wilson, it was a precipitous fall. Overnight, he lost his home, car and good Suns tickets and was summarily cut off by all four Stoudemires. Even Michael Walker froze him out. But the low point, he said, was when Carrie had Marwan call to tell him, "You ain't never done nothing for me." 
Only Frank Johnson, the coach, and his wife, Amy, showed flickers of conscience, Wilson says, offering leads for jobs at the Phoenix airport, one of which he eventually got, and still comping him tickets to games, although they were on the far side of the arena. But Amy Johnson, who earlier in the year would talk on the phone with Wilson for two hours at a time, was in an impossible position and gradually stopped returning his calls. (The Johnsons now deny ever helping him with the job or tickets.)
And with his link to celebrity severed, Wilson lost his allure to the sales clerk. "When I was with Amare," Wilson recalls, amazed by his own naivete, "she would make it her business to somehow get out to Scottsdale." Now that he was working the graveyard shift at National Car Rental and living in a little studio two blocks from her place, she wanted to slow things down. 
Meanwhile, according to friends of the family in Phoenix and Lake Wales, Marwan had stopped attending school when Wilson moved out. When the team left town again for a six-game trip that passed through Orlando, Carrie followed them on the road and took Marwan with her. By the time she got back, she had resolved to move closer to Amare's place and saw no point in having Marwan go back to St. Mary's. "I remember coming by the house one day," Wilson says, "and seeing Marwan siting around playing Sega. I said, 'Why are you not in school?' He just looked at me with a little smile."
Even with the tutoring, Marwan struggled at St. Mary's, and perhaps it wasn't the best school for him. But another disruption seemed to be the last thing he needed.
After pushing Wilson out of the picture, Carrie set about dealing with her son's other personal connections, like his agent, John Wolf. Wolf had been an unlikely candidate to have landed a rookie as prominent as Stoudemire. But throughout his working life, Wolf has shown a knack for seeing business opportunities in hard-pressed pockets. He invested part of the money he made from representing Dee Brown, his first N.B.A. client, in a small chain of coin-operated laundries, and after selling that, bought a huge liquor store with a dozen cash registers in Minneapolis. Brown, who worked for the Orlando Magic after he retired and got to know the Stoudemire family, recommended Wolf to Amare.
In the time allotted to him, Wolf did an excellent job, skillfully steering Stoudemire to Phoenix, whose young team he thought was the best fit. And in a climate in which sneaker money was scarce for all but a handful of street-minded superstars, Wolf extracted from Nike a deal guaranteeing more than $1 million a year for three years. "It wasn't a good conract," Wolf told me over the phone from his office at the liquor store. "It was a great contract."
But it wasn't good enough for Carrie Stoudemire, and perhaps in the wake of Nike signing this year's high schooler, LeBron James, to a $90 million contract, she's right. When she told Wolf to go back to Nike for more, Wolf remembered why he had invested his share of Dee Brown's Reebok money in those laundries and quit. According to someone close to the team, Wolf felt sufficiently abused to want to quit weeks before, but he had been talked out of it by the Suns. It is crucial for a team to have a buffer between it and the player so that it can exert influence over him without becoming the direct object of his contempt. For the Suns, the prospect of having to deal with Carrie every time they have an issue with Amare is terrifying.
Especially since, at this point, Carrie Stoudemire may be in a fouler humor than when she checked into Lowell Correctional. Despite the fairy-tale improvement in her family's fortunes, her four decades of personal catastrophe follow her everywhere she goes. In a brief phone interview, the only one she would allow, she summarized her outrage. "My life," she said, "is not a joke."
In that same conversation, which took place shortly after she arrived in Phoenix, Carrie Stoudemire had already found plenty not to like about her son's new employers. "I can't talk to you," she said, "because I'll tell you the truth about these people." Besides, she said, she has to save her story for a major cable channel, which is planning a documentary on her life.
With Carrie Stoudemire ensconced in Phoenix and Hazell Jr. set to arrive in town as early as next year, those two troubled family members could become the most delicate challenges in Stoudemire's career. Unlike Eminem, who has been so unforgiving of his imperfect mom, Stoudemire sees every line on his mother's rap sheet as proof of her commitment to provide for her family. He defiantly refers to her as "my role model," "my heart and soul," and someone who "was always there even when she wasn't" and "had my back through thick and thin." But what Stoudemire is thinking and what he tells reporters may not be the same. According to Wilson, who when last I spoke to him had begun spending time with Marwan and Carrie again, Stoudemire has already expressed interest in having his mother move to Florida or New York.
Just before the end of an early-winter practice, the Suns unlocked the doors to their pristine practice courts in the bowels of America West Arena and let in beat reporters for their routine look-see of the team. For the next 10 minutes, all that could be heard in this subterranean chapel of basketball was the squeak of sneakers and the pock of basketballs. 
Working with a trainer, a shirtless Marbury strengthened his release by taking tiny two- or three-foot shots with a medicine ball. At another hoop, the team's rookie swingman, Casey Jacobsen, fired up three-pointers. On a third basket, Stoudemire, wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt, black Nikes and his trademark rubber band on his left wrist, was throwing up baby hooks, casual jumpers and finger rolls. He was bouncing up and down so effortlessly that it seemed as if the energy that propelled him upward, higher than perhaps any other player can go, was coming from right out of the floor. 
In Lake Wales, Burney Hayes told me that for Amarethe court became a sanctuary and the ball itself a tangible piece of salvation. "She's a little bald-headed girl," Hayes said. "She won't complain; she just sustain. Bounce her, and she comes back. All she wants is more." And watching Stoudemire gamboling around the court, skinny legs tapering up to a thick chest and huge arms, I could see why he was so upset about being banished from that high-school court. But now he had his own perfect court, and nobody was ever going to shoo him off it.
For Stoudemire, the court remains, as it probably always has been, a refuge from family turmoil. But Carrie, Hazell Jr. and Marwan gave Amare more than something to flee from. They not only gave him a desperate need to succeed, and to succeed quickly, but the precocious maturity to handle it when he did. By the time he was 13 and his arms and legs started morphing like a cartoon superhero's, he knew that his body was not only his own best hope but also the last and only chance for his mother and two brothers.
Safely ensconced in the league, Stoudemire quickly proved that he was a hard-nosed competitor, and by the time he scored 38 points against Kevin Garnett and the Timberwolves and then grabbed 21 rebounds against the Grizzlies, he had answered all the big questions. He was more than good enough, and his skills would translate into wins for a Suns team that went on to make the playoffs and even managed to take two games from the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. As far as basketball is concerned, the greatest suspense left is whether he will develop his left hand and a medium-range jumper. After all he has been through, it hardly matters how that part of the story turns out.
The question with something real riding on it is whether Stoudemire's success will be of lasting benefit to the beleaguered family members who did so much to inspire it. Amare can pay for all the things they have never had, but in the end, it may turn out that Carrie, Marwan and Hazell Jr. did more indirectly for Amare than his money can do for them. In their way, they prepared him for, and sped him toward, his future. 
At the very end of the practice session, Amare stepped to the stripe for his daily dose of foul shots. For a player who goes to the basket as hard as Stoudemire does, foul shooting is important, and this year he only shot 66 percent. But at practice, he knocked them down like a seasoned pro. It would have been hard for anyone but an expert to spot the flaws. Clearly, there is nothing much wrong with any part of Stoudemire's game or his head, and his success has once again tilted N.B.A. priorities. Just ask Lebron James, the fatherless 18-year-old with an astounding vertical leap, whose mother bought him a Hummer with money she didn't have. Had it not been for Stoudemire, Nike would never have gambled $90 million to sign James to a sneaker deal, and the Cleveland Cavaliers would not be nearly so thrilled to be making him the No. 1 pick this week. Thanks to Stoudemire, talented American high-schoolers from the worst neighborhoods are just what N.B.A. general managers are looking for again.

 BODY:
 Peterson has reminded us of some simple arithmetic facts: the Bush tax cuts will reduce national saving and investment, bequeathing our children a smaller economy from which to meet the commitments we have written into law. But if the Bush tax cut of 2001, which will make little difference to most families, were redirected to strengthening Social Security, it would more than close the financing gaps. We do not have to cut benefits or raise taxes sky-high. We just have to make sensible choices.

HEADLINE: Dayton Claims Its Airspace 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER; STEPHEN KINZER is a cultural correspondent for The Times, based in Chicago.

 BODY:
LIGHT floods through large windows into the corner store in Dayton, Ohio, where two brothers began designing a machine that would revolutionize human life. They were Wilbur and Orville Wright, and their storefront bicycle workshop is a focal point of this year's celebration marking the 100th anniversary of their invention of the airplane.
 This workshop is one of those places that provoke reflection about life's mysteries. How, in this unremarkable room, did two seemingly ordinary men set out to solve a problem that had tantalized humanity since before the days of Icarus? Why did thousands of years of history and dreams culminate here? 
 This year's anniversary raises not only cosmic questions but also one that is quite prosaic: where was the airplane born? Many Americans would reflexively answer "Kitty Hawk," because it was there, above a North Carolina sandbar, that Wilbur and Orville Wright's contraption took to the air for the first time on Dec. 17, 1903. That grates on some people in Dayton, who take pains to point out that their city nurtured the Wrights, was the only home they ever had as adults, and was the place where they made their most important technical breakthroughs. 
Given those facts, it is perhaps appropriate that this year's celebration, Inventing Flight, will be centered in Dayton. It has been five years in the planning, and organizers have raised $27 million, most of it from private donors, to stage a 17-day party in downtown Deeds Park from July 3 to 20. There will be events connected to the Wrights, like a simulator that will give visitors a chance to feel the sensations of early flight, and more modern attractions like a prototype of a new Air Force jet fighter and a replica of the international space station, plus sound-and-light shows every night.
The North Carolina observances, scheduled to include the opening of new exhibitions and culminate with a re-enactment of the epochal flight on Dec. 17, will be on a much smaller scale. Those in Dayton are expected to be the biggest event in the city's history and draw more than half a million people; about one-tenth that number are expected at Kitty Hawk.
The Dayton celebration is doubling as a coming-out party for the city, which some local civic leaders say has been too reluctant to flaunt its history and rich inventive tradition. Over the last few years, as plans for this big show have advanced, the city has blossomed. Public grants have helped pay for several neighborhood renewal projects, and a new riverside park, a performing arts center and a lovely minor-league baseball stadium have been built. 
"Dayton's coming of age," said Mary Mathews, executive director of the Carillon Historical Park, a campus-style museum where Wright Brothers artifacts hold pride of place. "We're not just second to Cincinnati or Cleveland. We have a lot to offer of our own."
In recent years the Wright Brothers have passed out of most living memory and become distant figures. Visiting Dayton, especially this year, is a way to shake some of the historical dust off them. They were sons of a clergyman who was often away from home. Their mother, whose own father had been a carriage maker in his native Germany, was mechanically inclined. She and her children played with unusual toys, including a rubber-band-powered propeller on a stick that could rise into the air.
When they were still teenagers, the brothers built a printing press from scrap material and opened a print shop. Later they became bicycle mechanics, and then began manufacturing their own bikes. By the turn of the century, fired by the example of the German glider pioneer Otto Lilienthal, they were transfixed by the idea of powered flight. They built their first airplane on the same workbenches where they repaired bicycles.
To test their plane, the brothers searched for a place that was flat, breezy and far from prying eyes. They chose Kitty Hawk, took their various flying machines there by rail and boat four times between 1900 and 1903, and inscribed that isolated town's name in history. Today visitors can walk between markers that show the length of each of the four flights achieved on Dec. 17, 1903. The first, the great breakthrough, covered 120 feet. Orville Wright was at the controls. He flew for 12 seconds, at an altitude that never exceeded 12 feet.
By 1904, the Wrights had decided that they needed a testing ground closer to home, and arranged to use a prairie clearing near Dayton. It was here in 1905, at what is now known as the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, that they flew what they called the world's first practical airplane. The one they had at Kitty Hawk could only take off, stay airborne for a few seconds and then belly-flop onto the sand. Their 1905 model could be maneuvered in flight, kept airborne for as long as the fuel held out, and landed easily and repeatedly.
Today, license plates in North Carolina carry the motto "First in Flight." Those in Ohio say "Birthplace of Aviation." Both are correct, just as both states are justified in depicting Wright airplanes on their quarters: the 1903 model for North Carolina and the 1905 one for Ohio.
Visitors to Dayton during July will throng to the little workshop at 22 South Williams Street, where the spark of genius once flashed so brilliantly. This is the only one of the Wrights' five bicycle shops that still stands on its original site, and was their base of operations from 1895 to 1897. Here they first decided to embrace the challenge that would make them immortal, as they later recalled in a magazine article: "It was not until the news of the sad death of Lilienthal reached America in the summer of 1896 that we again gave more than passing attention to the subject of flying." The workbenches, the drafting table and the building's floor are original. Some of the tools on display were actually used by the Wrights.
On the walls hang copies of several cartoons that were published in Dayton newspapers during the years when the Wright Brothers were active. One, drawn soon after they became world famous, has a panel set in 1904 in which scowling locals watch an early flying test and one scoffs "Look at 'em -- the durned loonies!" The second panel, dated 1908, shows the brothers being decked with honors in Europe while the same local man proudly claims, "I always said the boys were wonderful inventors."
Orville and Wilbur Wright displayed flamboyant imaginations as they reached a triumph that many people believed was beyond humanity's reach. There was nothing else flamboyant about them, however. Both were painfully shy and ill at ease in social situations. Neither ever married. Wilbur (he was the older by four years, the one without the mustache) died of typhoid in 1912 at the age of 45. Four years later, Orville sold the family's aircraft company and took his last flight as a pilot. He lived until 1948, long enough to see his invention change the world, but never again sought a central role in the industry he helped found.
The Wrights' childhood home is no longer in Dayton; Henry Ford bought it and moved it to Dearborn, Mich., in 1936 as part of his plan to bring together the homes of great inventors. But Hawthorn Hill, where Orville lived the last 34 years of his life, still stands, and although it is normally closed to the public, organizers of the July celebration have arranged to open it for a limited number of tours during this summer. 
The house is stately and white-columned outside, and Orville's study has been preserved as he left it, dim and Victorian in style. His bookshelves hold works by Kipling and Ibsen, a biography of Oscar Wilde and a 61-year set of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly. The house also has several gadgets Orville designed, including a shower that sprayed water on his body from three sides to help soothe pain he suffered after a plane crash in 1908.
Some of Dayton's Wright-related sites were being renovated and expanded when I visited in May, but all are expected to be ready for the big July bash. Principal among them are the inventors' bicycle workshop and adjacent print shop, where blobs of ink apparently spilled by the Wrights still soil the floor; the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, which can legitimately be called the world's first airport; Hawthorn Hill, where Orville Wright received a steady flow of admirers during his later years; and Carillon Historical Park, where the prize exhibit is the plane the Wrights flew in 1905 (the 1903 model is at the Air and Space Museum in Washington). 
Although Dayton and Kitty Hawk will be the centers of this year's festivities, other communities are also participating. At Rockefeller Center in New York, for example, a display of planes and rocketry will be on view from July 29 to Aug. 18. One of its centerpieces will be a replica of the 1903 plane that will be flown at Kitty Hawk in December.
"For some years," Wilbur Wright wrote as he and his brother began their historic work in Dayton, "I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible for man." This year's anniversary is a chance to recognize how completely that affliction reshaped transportation and warfare, altered humanity's concept of distance, and shattered ancient ideas about the limits of the possible.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
A Model Program to Rehabiliate Homes in Freeport

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
IN looking for a rundown property last winter to highlight a new federal program that would rehabilitate houses in lower income neighborhoods, the Community Development Corporation of Long Island turned to officials of the South Shore village of Freeport, where the corporation has its Nassau County office. 
 "Four local residents recommended by the mayor went out on a Saturday knocking on doors in one of the oldest sections of Freeport asking to rehabilitate them," said Marianne Garvin, executive vice president of the nonprofit corporation. "There was a lot of skepticism, but then they found Carrie Mays, and she said yes." 
 A certified nursing assistant making $400 a week, Mrs. Mays has lived in her 80-year-old four-bedroom house since 1975. Mrs. Mays's daughter -- a secretary who makes about $300 a week -- also lives in the house, with her three children, and shares the $1,500-a-month mortgage payments. 
Mrs. Mays said she welcomed having her two-story house fixed up. Once it was evaluated by the Community Development Corporation, the house turned out to need almost $50,000 worth of work to make it safe and energy-efficient, which is the goal of the new program. This included new ceilings, doors, insulation, kitchen floor and carpeting. The entire house also needed to be painted and the sun porch rescreened.
Mrs. Mays passed all the requirements for eligibility in the program, and within four months the house had new vinyl siding, the porch screens were on and rehabilitation was well on its way and is expected to be completed this month. 
On June 7, a team of volunteers painted the interior during a special celebration that formally announced the Weatherization, Rehabilitation and Asset Preservation program. It is the first nationwide program of this kind, although it is modeled after a similar Long Island program. 
Mrs. Mays's home is one of 195 in the village of Freeport that are to be worked on under the WRAP program, which combines federal, state and local home rehabilitation and energy-saving grants. The program is expected to lower electric bills by 25 to 35 percent, increase property values in the neighborhood and help low-income homeowners preserve their home assets. 
The program was initiated in December 2002 by the 50-year-old Ford Foundation, the giant philanthropic organization. The nationwide WRAP program is being modeled after the Community Development Corporation's two-year-old Loss Prevention Program, which receives grants from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation and the federal Department of Energy. The program has spent $2,372,266 to rehabilitate 496 houses throughout Long Island with an average household income of $14,694.
George McCarthy, the foundation's program officer in development, finance and economic security, said he approached the Community Development Corporation to set up a three-year pilot program in a concentrated area of Freeport. While the approach is similar, the rehabilitation money comes from the federal government, instead of the state.
"The Community Development Corporation has one of the most innovative and comprehensive programs in the country; they do a lot of post-purchase assistance," Mr. McCarthy said. "My goal is to use their program as a model and create a national program. 
"We were looking for innovative responses to the lack of an adequate home improvement industry for the lower-income communities," he said. "That kind of service seems to have disappeared from low-income housing about 30 years ago. That is because the houses were older, the jobs more difficult and the owners had less money to fix them up. 
"As a result many of these people were getting bad services, which introduced them to predatory loans. We are trying to help those with low income protect their assets and keep their houses."
The foundation has selected 12 nationwide sites to participate in the WRAP program; each will receive $100,000 a year for three years to cover administration and education costs.
Freeport is the first of six projects to begin this year. The others are in Hartford; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Rio Grande City, Tex.; and two in Boston. Next year, projects will begin in Staten Island and New Orleans, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the nonprofit Energy Programs Consortium, which awards the Ford Foundation grants. 
Two major federal grants were received from the Fannie Mae Foundation, which gave Freeport $50,000 for the first year, and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, which gave $30,000.
In Freeport, the energy-saving projects will be financed through a $60,000 three-year grant from the Freeport Electric Company, the village's municipally owned power company; $180,000 from the State Energy Research Development Association; and $600,000 from the federal Department of Energy. 
The money for rehabilitation work includes $150,000 from Nassau County for the first year. An application for $500,000 from the state is pending.
Freeport's three-year goal is to weatherize and rehabilitate 195 of the 1,520 houses in the northeast region of the village, said Ms. Garvin. "That is more than 10 percent of that region, the number that a research team from the University of North Carolina feels is necessary to encourage others in the neighborhood to invest in their homes," she said.
According to William F. Glacken, Freeport's mayor, the targeted area had been neglected for 30 years until six years ago, when some rehabilitation began. "These are sturdy houses, but the stock needs a facelift and the WRAP program is perfect to bring the housing back," he said. "These are not tenements or dilapidated houses; they are just tired."
THE average Freeport house sells for $200,000, he said, adding that the median income in the village is $60,000, except in the northeast quadrant, where the median is $40,000. (Currently, the median household income on Long Island for a family of four is $83,700.)
Since Freeport's WRAP program began in December, four houses have been rehabilitated, 14 are in progress, 16 have been put out to bid and there are 60 homeowners on the waiting list, Ms. Garvin said. 
There are strict regulations for eligibility in the program. Applicants' incomes must fall below 80 percent of the median household income for Long Island. They must have their names on the house's deed, have homeowner's insurance and be current on their taxes.
Once the work is completed, a lien is placed on the house for the total cost of the project. If the homeowner remains in the house for five years, the lien is forgiven, but if the homeowner or dies within five years, the cost must be repaid.
"We try to stay within $4,000 and $6,000 per house for the energy work and below $15,000 for rehabilitation," Ms. Garvin said. If a house needs more than $21,000 in grant money, the homeowner is referred to Freeport's residential rehabilitation program.
In the case of Mrs. Mays, $20,866 was spent in grant money to cover the project, and another $28,000 came in donated labor from four different local contractors.
Recently, Freeport hosted a gathering of officials who will be setting up WRAP programs in other states. Included was a visit to three homes, including Mrs. Mays's, which have been approved for projects.
One of the houses is a 83-year-old brick and stone four-bedroom Dutch colonial owned by Delores Rivas, who lives in the house with her daughter and four grandchildren.Her two mortgages, which total $702.02 a month, are paid predominantly with child support and Social Security money. The Community Development Corporation is currently helping Mrs. Rivas, who has lived in the house for 20 years, to get her name on the deed since her husband, who was listed alone on the deed, died without a will. Until then, rehabilitation work cannot proceed, but in the meantime the $11,280 energy portion of the project, including a new roof and weatherstripping, has been completed. 
A short distance away, a 75-year-old three-bedroom white house with pink trim, owned by Caprice Bateman, will receive a $20,950 renovation that includes a $2,600 lead-abatement project. Ms. Bateman, a corrections officer at Rikers Island, makes $59,000 a year and has a monthly mortgage payment of $1,700. She has lived in the house for five years with her three children. The WRAP project includes replacing a rear stoop, the roof, interior stairways and the front door and insulating the attic.
In observing the Freeport neighborhood, Kevin Washington, the loss prevention coordinator for Staten Island's WRAP program, said it was "similar to Staten Island, only our houses are a little older."
The Staten Island program manager, Richard Trouth, said about 15 houses would be involved in the northern part of the borough, in a section where the annual median income is $35,000 to $42,000.
Katherine Bequary, senior research analyst for Hartford's Community Renewal Team, will be operating the WRAP program in the north-end Blue Hills neighborhood, where the home ownership rate is 55 percent, the highest of any Hartford neighborhoods, she said. Approximately 70 homes are to be rehabilitated.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
An Industry-Government Team Lures Backup Sites

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
NEW rules that say financial companies doing business crucial to the national economy must be able to resume operations within 24 hours of a major emergency have led to formation of a New Jersey group that seeks to work with companies that might put backup offices in the state.
 The new consortium includes two large real estate companies, the Gale Company and Cushman & Wakefield; Verizon; the Public Service Electric and Gas Company; and state authorities, including the Commission on Commerce, the Economic Development Authority, the Commission on Science and Technology and the Urban Enterprise Zone Authority. 
 Gil Medina, a former state commerce commissioner who now directs Cushman & Wakefield's technology enterprise group, said his company and Gale were recently working to establish a backup office for New York Life in Westchester County when the idea of setting up the consortium occurred to them.
"We felt it was important to bring together public and private bodies in New Jersey to provide a service to those impacted by the new requirements," Mr. Medina said. "Not to take away from New York, because everyone in the region has an interest in New York City prospering. It is the economic engine. But many top-tier financial institutions have been affected by the new regulations -- and New Jersey, like many areas of New York outside Manhattan, is fertile ground for the stakeholders." 
A promotional letter for the new consortium describes New Jersey's potential as a backup site like this: "Imagine a secure, reliable and economical network of satellite centers in the New York metro area that are all linked together -- and to the core -- by a modern transit system and highway system, with an ample supply of specialized workers, expertise, communication infrastructure, water and power, all integrated with central operations in New York but functioning independently of the New York-based operations."
A year after the attack on the World Trade Center buildings, federal securities industry regulators released a report emphasizing the need for financial institutions to have out-of-town backup facilities. In its initial form, the report, the Interagency White Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the United States Financial System, required backup sites to be 100 to 250 miles from Manhattan.
According to the final version of the report released this spring, however, companies may choose their own locations as long as they can assure the authorities that they have arranged for a secondary office ensuringthe speedy restart of business after a disaster.
"The New Jersey White Paper Consortium was formed to provide firms the support and flexibility they need to create backup sites," Mr. Medina said, "taking advantage of New Jersey's strengths, while minimizing the impact on New York City's economy."
Mark Yaeger, Gale's president, said that changes in technology permitted companies to put their backup offices farther away. "It used to be that with information traveling through cable and wiring beyond about 25 miles, speed and quality and security of transmission became potentially jeopardized," he said.
"Now, that's not so much true, but the quality of fiber optics available is still crucial. And the human travel distance is still very important. In order to have a completely redundant facility, there is the need to be able to get people there quickly." 
Mr. Yaeger said that Gale executives had analyzed which financial service firms would be affected by the report's regulations, which would have the greatest concerns in the event of an "outage of critical facilities" and which would be most likely to find a good fit in New Jersey for a backup facility. 
The consortium is now setting up meetings with companies on that list, he and Mr. Medina said.
The Westchester County transaction that Gale and Cushman have already completed involved securing a 385,000-square-foot backup office for New York Life Insurance at the Mount Pleasant Executive Center. The partners have also recently completed two similar deals for emergency backup facilities in New Jersey: Deutsche Bank's lease of 200,000 square feet at 2 Gatehall Drive in Parsippany and First Fidelity Investments' lease of 87,000 square feet at 125 Chubb Avenue in Florham Park.
COMPANIES are permitted options under the new regulations in the type of contingency operation they plan, Mr. Medina said. "There are actually a ton of options," Mr. Yaeger added, "from creating a completely built-out dark site, ready to put the lights on when necessary, to, at the other extreme, just having a system for knowing what space is out there that your company could implement and not really having it in place."
For those firms performing critical financial roles that need space available in crisis situations, Mr. Yaeger said, vacant space is available in some buildings that Gale owns. "If the Gale options do not satisfy a company's requirement," he said, "then the full support of Cushman & Wakefield will be implemented to find a suitable building or site"
Cushman & Wakefield brokers and manages commercial properties but does not own any.
At this point, Mr. Yaeger noted, the federal regulations require every financial institution to have an emergency strategy in place, but not necessarily a building. He said that one allowable strategy was for financial institutions to rotate workers from their Manhattan offices regularly to secondary offices they have elsewhere so that the employees were able to function in both places.
Regulations require, however, that the secondary office be at least large enough to accommodate the basic number of staff members needed to keep all crucial business functions going in the event of disaster, he noted.
"Ideally," Mr. Medina said, "the secondary office is a mirror image of the primary office. But that may not be economical."
He said that New Jersey and other areas near major financial centers in New York City and Philadelphia, offered more economical sites for backup office plans because the cost of transporting employees would be lower. 
Also, these areas each offer state-sponsored business incentive programs that could help cut the cost of contingency space, Mr. Medina said.
"In addition, if companies cluster their back-office operations in this region, they can take advantage of a common pool of labor, expertise, specialized suppliers and infrastructure," he said. "To the extent that companies disaggregate, they lose economies."
When considering the overall picture for financial institutions needing backup, Mr. Medina said, a balance must be found between "some level of concentration, and some level of disaggregation."
That balance is expected to evolve, he said, based on individual companies' determinations about what is best for them.
THE report also requires firms that play significant roles in critical markets to have emergency backup plans that include sufficient equipment and data sources. That is why P.S.E.&G., which serves nearly three-quarters of the state's energy customers, and Verizon, which focused on "disaster survivability" in developing its current telecommunications systems, are part of the consortium, Mr. Medina said. 
"The ideal backup building has independent power, water and telecommunications capability," he said. "It is on a power grid fed by multiple substations, with a backup generator and, of course, excellent security.
"The consortium is designed to provide companies with the closest thing to ideal, based on the best information we have from those with the most expertise."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about an industry and government group that is marketing commercial space in New Jersey for use as emergency backup offices misspelled the surname of the president of the Gale Company, which is part of the consortium. (The error also occurred on April 26 and on Jan. 23, 2000.) He is Mark Yeager, not Yaeger. 
The article and the picture caption also misidentified the town in which space has been leased for a backup facility. The building is at 125 Chubb Avenue in Lyndhurst, not Florham Park.

HEADLINE: As Graduates Look for Work, The Engineer Is Standing Tall 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
As Susan Brewton prepared to graduate this spring with a degree in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, she lay awake at night fretting about the tough job market she was about to enter.
 She needn't have worried. Before she was even able to don her cap and gown, she had four job offers. Even after she accepted a position as an engineer for the Naval Surface Warfare Center in West Bethesda, Md., the calls from eager military contractors hoping to employ her kept rolling in. 
 "It was very flattering," said the 36-year-old Ms. Brewton, who worked as a journalist for 10 years before going back to school to pursue engineering. "My professors had told us all of these horror stories about getting a job in the down economy, but I didn't seem to have any trouble."
Ms. Brewton is undoubtedly among the cream of the crop of entry-level engineers. She graduated summa cum laude from a top engineering school and has three internships under her belt, not to mention 10 years of experience in the working world. And she had a keen interest in fluids and turbomachinery, something that impressed her new employer, a government research group that studies ships.
Even so, career experts in the engineering field say that Ms. Brewton's job-hunting experience is not so unusual.
In the weakest overall employment market in many years, the engineering field may be one of the few bright spots. According to a recent survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers predicted that members of the class of 2003 with backgrounds in computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering would be in high demand upon graduation. All three of those degrees were listed in the association's top 10 list of degrees that are considered most desirable by employers.
Experts predict the need for engineers in many sectors will only increase. Yet, the number of high school students interested in studying engineering in college has been on a steady decline. Among the more than 1.1 million seniors in the class of 2002 who took the ACT Assessment college entrance exam, less than 6 percent indicated they were planning on studying engineering in college, down from 9 percent in 1992.
One area that has heated up significantly is the military sector, where engineers are being heavily recruited to work for the newly created Department of Homeland Security, and for private companies that do contract work for the agency. With a proposed budget of $36.2 billion for 2004, the new department has more openings than qualified professionals to fill them, says Ken Selzer, president of Defense Placements, a Washington subsidiary of Management Recruiters International.
Mr. Selzer's team has recently been asked to find candidates with electrical engineering backgrounds to do classified communications work in the areas of border and transportation security. He has also been recruiting mechanical engineers with experience in installing air handling systems to help detect and prevent chemical and biological attacks.
Before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, "there was always a demand for these kinds of people," Mr. Selzer said, but the need has "skyrocketed" in the last year. Complicating the search, many positions require government security clearances that can take a year to 18 months to complete.
As a result, Mr. Selzer typically limits his recruiting to candidates who already have them. Salaries average about $70,000 for people with three or four years experience, he said, with some engineers making upward of $120,000.
Some are even seeing a resurgence of demand for engineers at high-technology companies. Clint Staley, a professor of computer science at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, says he has been pleasantly surprised this spring to be getting calls once again from employers looking for recent computer engineering graduates for jobs in software development. "It's been pretty quiet the last couple of years," Mr. Staley said.
AirPrism, a software start-up in Redwood Shores, Calif., has hired 18 engineers in the last several months to design and support hand-held devices. It plans to hire at least eight more by the close of the year, according to the president and chief executive, Steve Sommer.
Marc D. Lewis, North America president of Morgan Howard, a global executive-search firm for the technology industry, has been busy placing those with computer engineering backgrounds into high-level positions like chief security officer and chief information officer. "The market for technical talent has warmed up significantly in the last three months," he said. 
All of this is not to say that landing a job has suddenly become easy. Generalists are probably less desirable than engineers with niche specialties, for example, said Wayne Voris, a vice president for the Cincinnati office of Spherion Professional Recruiting. "Conventional wisdom says you should round yourself out, but that's not the case in engineering," Mr. Voris said.
Recent college graduates, in particular, need to be aggressive in their job hunting, recruiters say. Jamie Fox, who graduated this month with a degree in electrical engineering from California Polytechnic, says it took nearly nine months to secure a job offer from Mazzetti & Associates, an architectural engineering and consulting firm in San Francisco. 
He began looking for full-time work last fall, attending career fairs sponsored by his university. At such events, he said, you usually "give your resume to a bunch of people and no one ever calls you back." But at a fair in January, he took a more forceful approach, handing the people at the Mazzetti booth a list of reasons he wanted to work there, directing them to his personal Web site, and showing off his familiarity with the company by spouting information he had gleaned from its Web site.
He left the meeting all but securing the $50,000 position on the spot. "The C.E.O. joked with me and said, 'When can you start?' " Mr. Fox said. The lesson he drew from the experience: "You've got to search pretty hard, and be pretty determined."
Even Ms. Brewton, the Virginia Polytechnic graduate who was in such high demand while still in school, had to exert herself to be noticed. She spent her entire senior year going on interviews, some of them pretty grueling. For her final interview with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, her current employer, she was grilled from 7:30 a.m. through the late afternoon. Like Mr. Fox, she came armed with information about her employer that she had gathered not only from the Web but from employees she had contacted. "I already had a good feel for the job and what kinds of things I would be doing," she said. "By no means did I go in blind."

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING; 
Wanted:Whistle-Blower Managers

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Right Thing: Conscience, Profit and Personal Responsibility in Today's Business" (Spiro Press). His column usually appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SENIOR managers need to wake up. Rather than wallowing in the wreckage of corporate scandals and blaming a few overzealous chief executives or overeager young workers who might do anything to get ahead, managers need to step up, take responsibility for how business is done in their companies and, well, start managing.
 In most businesses, people know when bad behavior is going on. They know who's cutting corners. They know about suspect expense reports. They know when promises to customers are consistently unfulfilled. They especially know when their own work is undermined by a colleague. 
 Of course, not everyone is aware of every bit of misconduct, but rest assured that some workers see the various infractions as they occur. To paraphrase Edmund Burke, all that's necessary for evil workers to triumph is for good managers to do nothing.
Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., a professor of business ethics at Harvard Business School, said the solution is simple. "Managers need to make stronger efforts to let people know what the rules of the game are in their companies, what the bright lines are that shouldn't be crossed," he said. "If people are held accountable, it sends a very clear message."
If you accept the results of a survey released last month by the Ethics Resource Center, a nonprofit ethics training organization in Washington, a significant number of employees are speaking up. Of the 22 percent of the American workers who said they had witnessed misconduct in the workplace, almost two-thirds said they had reported the misconduct to management. But only 43 percent of younger workers -- those under 30 and with their companies less than three years -- said they had reported misconduct they had witnessed.
IT would be too easy to condemn callow youth entering the workplace as being solely responsible for letting unethical behavior go unchecked. Management may talk about the importance of ethics, but workers are likely to get their ethical cues from what they witness at work every day.
In the Ethics Resource Center survey, half of younger workers agreed with the statement, "My co-workers show respect for employees who get good results even if they use questionable ethics practices." Just 26 percent of other workers concurred. 
"It's a huge difference," said Joshua Joseph, a senior researcher at the center who designed the survey. "That's very troubling."
Again, the easy response would be to cast stones at young workers. Instead, if managers truly care about fostering an ethical workplace, it falls to them to stem this tide.
To expect that a younger worker will go against the norms of a workplace isn't just expecting ethical behavior, said Sharon Daloz Parks, the author of "Big Questions, Worthy Dreams: Mentoring Young Adults in Their Search for Meaning, Purpose and Faith" (Jossey-Bass, 2000). "It's expecting ethical heroism."
It is not heroic, however, for veteran managers to only do their jobs and let their employees know that questionable ethics will get them nowhere. If managers know that a rising star is using questionable tactics, they must also stand up to their own bosses who are rewarding the results.
Indeed, there is some evidence that younger workers would welcome a workplace where ethical behavior is more than just talk. A survey by the Aspen Institute asked students at 12 international M.B.A. programs what they would do if they found that their values conflicted with those of the company that employed them. The results, released last month, showed that 35 percent said they would very likely look for other jobs, while 44 percent said they would try to have others at the company join them in addressing their concerns. The response could be read as a positive indicator of willingness among younger workers to stay with a company and try to effect change, rather than ignoring it and moving on.
If managers take seriously the importance of ethical behavior in the workplace, they need to do a better job of letting all workers know what behavior will not be tolerated, that they will receive full support if they report misconduct, and that those guilty of misconduct will not catapult their way to the top but instead be held accountable for their actions. Such management behavior would send a clear signal to workers that being ethical in the workplace is career-enhancing -- and that any alternative is unacceptable.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
Reading, Writing and Now Checkbook Balancing

BYLINE:  By SUSAN B. GARLAND

 BODY:
BEFORE the end of the summer, scores of newly minted high school graduates will head off to college, on their own for the first time. How prepared are they to balance a checkbook, handle a credit card or budget an allowance? 
 Many new college freshmen will have to learn the hard way, by trial and error, but there is hope for those coming up behind them. Financial institutions and educators, as well as the federal government, are putting together courses, advice sheets for parents, interactive Web sites and other materials aimed at improving the personal finance skills of children, from preschoolers to teenagers. (You can even send your child to special summer camps to learn money management skills.) And though still in a minority, some school systems have added personal finance to their curriculums, teaching the fundamentals of saving, spending, investing and earning. 
 But part of the material, including some online offerings, may not be particularlyhelpful. Some information from banks or brokerage firms, for example, may seem more promotional than educational. And some Web sites have so much material that it requires patience, and maneuvering from page to page, to get through it all. 
Consumer groups and economic leaders, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, say that it is important for young people to learn money management skills, especially as more kinds of financial products become available. The increase in self-directed retirement accounts also means that workers need to become wiser savers and investors. 
Several recent studies suggest that young people have a long way to go in grasping personal finance skills. In one study, which was released in March by Teenage Research Unlimited, a market research group in Northbrook, Ill., teenagers reported that they spent 98 percent of the money they receive from parents, jobs and other sources.
IN another study, released last year by the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, a nonprofit group in Washington that promotes the teaching of personal finance in schools, 68 percent of the 4,024 participating high school seniors flunked a set of personal finance questions, up from 59 percent in the previous survey, in 2000. 
Forty-two percent of the seniors said they didn't know that sales tax made purchased products more expensive; 92 percent didn't know that credit card holders were responsible for $50 in charges made on a stolen card.
Only four states -- New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Idaho -- require students to take a course that includes a personal finance unit, according to the National Council on Economic Education, a nonprofit group based in New York. 
Pooja Raju, 17, who will graduate from Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, on Wednesday, said a required economics course had taught her how to balance a checkbook, use credit wisely and save early for retirement, among other things. 
In one class exercise, each student was assigned a hypothetical job and salary and had to figure out how to pay various bills. Now that Ms. Raju understands the fundamentals of personal budgeting, she plans to use her money from her summer job at J. P. Morgan Chase to buy a laptop computer for her first year at the State University of New York at Binghamton. "Before, I probably would have asked my parents for the money," she said. "But they're already spending so much on me; I'll put the money aside myself."
The economic education council and other organizations have been trying to persuade schools to include such classes, at least as part of math courses and other required classes. "Our goal is to make economic and personal financial decision-making skills the 'fourth R' -- the real world," said Robert F. Duvall, the council's president.
The steady proliferation of personal finance materials may make it easier for parents to teach financial concepts at home, and perhaps to learn a few things themselves. Resources include interactive Internet and software games, stock market simulations, lesson plans, workbooks and computer-based calculators. The materials are developed for use by parents and teachers or by children, and the topics range from the benefits of compound interest to spotting investment schemes.
One place to start is the JumpStart Coalition's Web site, www.jumpstart.org. Parents can find information about ordering more than 400 publications, including curriculum guides, government brochures, videos and books.
A search on the JumpStart site can be narrowed by age, from kindergarten to adult, and by topic, like credit cards or bankruptcy. Dara Duguay, the executive director of JumpStart, says all written materials are evaluated by an educational consultant for organization, objectivity, ability to capture a student's interest and independence from specific products.
One reason for the push for financial literacy is that some parents are not taking the lead. Less than half of parents with school-aged children stick to a budget or pay off their credit cards in each billing cycle, according to a 2001 survey by the American Savings Education Council, a nonprofit group in Washington that tries to raise public awareness of personal finance issues.
"Parents are often reluctant to talk about money, and perhaps that's related to the concern about practicing what we preach," Mr. Duvall said. "If we talk about handling credit wisely, we have to do that ourselves, and the fact is, we are not."
Some Web sites have been developed by large financial institutions, which regard improved financial literacy as good public relations and a way to attract future customers. "All of the financial services companies are self-promotional to a certain extent because they have products they want people to buy," Ms. Duguay said. "People have to make the judgment themselves whether a line has been crossed."
A Young Investors Network sponsored by the Smith Barney division of Citigroup (www.smithbarney.com/yin/home.htm) provides a tutorial on investments and allows visitors to create a "cyber stock portfolio" of real companies. The visitor learns about a stock by using Smith Barney research and can track the portfolio by logging in with a password. The site also informs teenagers that they can track real, future investments many ways, among them by visiting the Smith Barney Web site. The parents' section says children can learn about "financial responsibility with the prepaid Citi Cash Card," and has a link to that product. The site is used as part of a stock market contest among 150 classrooms in 15 states.
An A. G. Edwards site, accessible through www.agedwards.com by clicking on "Investor Education," includes a "Big Money Adventure." Aimed at 6- to 10-year-olds, it is a long story about two children who find some money in the jungle. The children have two choices: they can spend the money on items like tennis shoes and sunglasses, or they can invest it in Lucy the Bear's necklace business. If they decide to invest, they are told, they can make "a percentage or profit." 
The lesson, according to Max the Bird, is that when they leave the jungle, "you can do the same thing by investing in the stock market." Max does warn them, however, that "there is always" a chance you will lose money. 
Ms. Duguay says that some of the best corporation-backed sites and curriculums are those that have sought the help of organizations with experience in personal finance education or education in general. "Corporations don't understand anything about the educational system," she said. "The smart ones are pairing with nonprofits."
Two years ago, Bank of America provided $3.2 million through its foundation to help create Financial Fitness for Life, a curriculum for kindergarten through high school, with the National Council on Economic Education. About 18,000 teachers in 21 states and the District of Columbia have trained in the curriculum. 
Although the program was created primarily for schools, materials also are designed for home use. Guides for parents, including worksheets and activities for children of various age levels, are available for $11.95at www.fffl.ncee.net. The site also has sample interactive activities that a child can try first.
VISA U.S.A. designed a program with the help of nonprofit organizations, including the National Consumers League and the Women's Institute for Financial Education. Called Practical Money Skills for Life, the program is free and can be found at www.practicalmoneyskills.com. 
The site includes lesson plans for teachers, tips to help parents teach responsible money management, and games and activities. Each area is divided by age. In one section -- called "How Much Does It Really Cost?"-- Visa imparts some sobering lessons on the cost of credit. Visitors learn that a shopper who buys a $650 stereo on credit and makes the minimum payment will take 42 months to pay it off at an annual percentage rate of 19.85 percent, for a total cost of $887.44.
"Our responsibility is make sure students understand that a credit card is not free money and that it is a loan," said Rosetta L. Jones, director of corporate relations at Visa U.S.A.

 BODY:
PEOPLE have been asking Gordon Segal for the last three years when he plans to build the second store of CB2, an eclectic offshoot of the Crate and Barrel chain, which he and his wife, Carole, started four decades ago. The answer is always the same: when he's good and ready.
 In an age when blind ambition causes many companies to expand at a breakneck pace, Mr. Segal, the chief executive of Crate and Barrel, is a perfectionist who would rather develop a chain slowly than allow it to swell beyond his control. After all, it took him six years to open the second Crate and Barrel, in 1968, and he says he will take the same approach in opening the second CB2. 
 "It's a laboratory store," he said during an interview in his office in Northbrook, Ill., a suburb about 25 miles north of here. "It's an experiment. You can do it much faster and better, but we do things carefully and slowly." 
The CB2 store, housed in an industrial-looking building with an angular, mesh metal awning, is between a Trader Joe's market and a noisy elevated-train stop in the trendy Lakeview section of Chicago. Like its more sophisticated predecessor, CB2 is neat, colorful and meticulouslyorganized, and it offers a variety of stylish housewares.
But CB2 strives to be hipper and more urban than Crate and Barrel, to reach younger shoppers who may be bored or intimidated by the original chain. To reach them, CB2 sells some tongue-in-cheek products that would never be found at Crate and Barrel, including a book of 1950's-inspired postcards with smiling housewives in calf-length dresses doting on their husbands and children while scrubbing floors or cooking.
The shelves at CB2 are lined with suede pillows, fake wheat grass "growing" inside rectangular tins, and drinking glasses decorated with recipes for fruity cocktails. Orange-colored gel-filled eye masks, made for people with hangovers, sit alongside a display of books titled "Office Spa: Stress Relief for the Working Week," which offers advice on how to massage the worker in the next cubicle. The store also sells soap for those occasions when "you need to turn up the volume on your inner voice of reason"; this spring, a line of plastic shower caps, printed with a fish design, sold out and had to be restocked.
"It's important to have that whimsical side to our product," said Nate Tanner, 29, a lightly bearded, shaggy-haired store designer for Crate and Barrel. "You could imagine how serious and pretentious this store could be."
Pottery Barn, a main rival of Crate and Barrel, has opened a new line of stores, Pottery Barn Kids, and two niche Web sites and catalogs. But that has not hurried Mr. Segal's plans. Instead, CB2 waits in an incubator with Mr. Segal watching every move and recording every success and misstep.
"It's as if he and his wife's name were on the front door," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing and retail consulting company in New York. "They will continue to refine it and refine it and refine it until they get it right."
Crate and Barrel is consistent enough to be reliable, yet it changes just enough to be relevant, Ms. Liebmann said. It has also turned up its nose at the Gap model of a store on every corner, she added.
Mr. Segal sold a majority stake of Crate and Barrel to the private Otto Versand G.m.b.H. of Germany, a large mail-order company, in 1998. But Crate and Barrel is still under Mr. Segal's creative control.
Crate and Barrel has grown steadily, if not spectacularly, even during economic slumps. Its sales have risen every year for a decade, expanding 11 percent last year, for example, to $824 million. It expects sales to top $900 million this year. The chain, which has grown to 119 stores, does not disclose profit figures, but says it has never lost money. Mr. Segal would not break out sales for CB2.
Rob Wilson, president of the Tiburon Research Group in San Francisco, said Crate and Barrel could grow slowly because it is privately held. While many public companies are under constant investor pressure to expand, Mr. Segal can set his own speed. Mr. Wilson said that "it's not as sexy to grow at a snail's pace, but usually it's the guy whose money is directly involved who makes the best decisions." 
Lauren Cooks Levitan, a San Francisco-based managing director and senior research analyst of specialty retailing for SG Cowen Securities, said Crate and Barrel had strong brand-name recognition and strong growth potential. 
Ms. Levitan, who once worked for Crate and Barrel as an assistant store manager, said the company had been able to glamorize domestic items more effectively than the more utilitarian Lechters, now defunct. "Visual presentation is something they take extraordinarily seriously," Ms. Levitansaid. "Crate and Barrel knows how to romanticize a spatula."
Unlike many competitors, Crate and Barrel has both a manager and a designer at each store, and the headquarters gives each location enough creative control for management to stay interested, resulting in low turnover. Hiring and retaining the right people have been crucial elements of the chain's success, Mr. Segal has said.
HE has also said that he wants to build another CB2 store here, possibly near the Crate and Barrel on North Avenue, closer to the city's center, and possibly within a year.
He has also suggested that he might build another CB2 in a northern suburb, then perhaps in New York, Boston or Washington. But he has announced no formal plans, leaving even the current CB2 store manager guessing.
"It's frustrating," said the manager, Debbie Kushnir, 32. "He's very meticulous about his locations. He wants to hammer it out perfectly before he opens it up in new cities. He came into the store about a month ago to do a surprise visit. He knows if the light isn't focused or the music isn't loud enough or the staff isn't smiling."
In January 2000, when CB2 opened, 10 percent of its merchandise could also be found at Crate and Barrel. But over time, CB2 gained a better understanding of its target audience. It is a bit younger than Crate and Barrel's: college students looking to decorate their dorm rooms, recent graduates in their first apartments, newlyweds in their first homes. The store now shares only 2 percent of its products with its parent.
Whitney Peterson, 30, who works for a commercial real estate company, said she had been shopping at CB2 at least once a month for a year and a half. During that time, she has bought a contact lens case, refrigerator magnets, rugs, pillows, sparkling wrapping paper, and cards. "It's got inexpensive, fun home-decorating stuff," she said. "If you needed something at the last minute, you could pop in here and find it."
Hilary Applequist, 24, said she would rather shop at CB2 than at Pottery Barn, which she said was for more established homeowners. "That's not a place you'd shop for your first apartment," said Ms. Applequist, a nursing student.
That would please Mr. Segal, who said he built his company on the notion that everyone should be able to buy affordable, durable and fashionable home goods.
"Making a lot of money was never our goal," he said. "It was to be a world vendor, finding the best products wherever they were: wood chairs from Italy, glass from Poland, cookware from Germany."

HEADLINE: The High Life Is Winding Down for Jaguar Mechanics 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
IF you are an import-car enthusiast of a certain age, you remember the jokes: if you want to drive a Jaguar, buy two -- one of them will always be in the shop.
 After Ford bought Jaguar in 1989, it made reliability a top priority. Joe Ivers, executive director of quality and customer satisfaction for J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm, noticed the change. "Throughout the 90's Jaguar had what I would characterize as a very athletic, consistent and dramatic improvement in initial quality," Mr. Ivers said. And when the Power survey checked Jaguars as they aged, they became increasingly reliable. 
 The improvements have been noted by owners and those who make a rather busy living working on the cars. "If all we did was try to service new Jaguars, like we did back in the 80's, it would be a pretty dicey proposition," said Earl Gibbs, owner of North Coast Exotics in Cleveland. "I'd be like the Maytag man." There are still enough vintage cars, however, to keep him busy.
When Ron Tencati, a government worker from northern Virginia, considered buying a used XJ6 Vanden Plas two years ago, he was concerned about the quality. "I did some research and learned that after Ford bought them their reliability got much better, and I've had no trouble," said Mr. Tencati, one of several owners who responded to a query posted at Edmunds.com.
Many cars have a few problems, but Mr. Gibbs says he has no qualms recommending that a friend buy an XJ6 from the mid- to late 1990's. "In the past, it would have been reckless to recommend that someone buy an eight-year-old Jaguar," he said.
Improvements in quality have also been noticed by Ed Harrison at Coventry West, an Atlanta company that sells Jaguar parts.
The observations are backed up Power's Vehicle Dependability Index, a survey of 30,000 original owners of vehicles four to five years old.
"To us, it has been sort of surprising to see Jaguar in the real high ranks of V.D.I.," Mr. Ivers said. "It's not the place where we have seen them in the past."
In the 2002 dependability study, which looked at 1998 models, Jaguar ranked ninth with 280 problems per 100 vehicles. Lexus was first with 159 problems, but Toyota (fifth) had 276 and Porsche (sixth) had 278.
Jaguar did even better the year before. In the 2001 study, Lexus was first with 173 problems per 100 vehicles, Infiniti was second with 219 and Jaguar was third with 250.
 That doesn't mean Jaguar owners had a free ride. Some of the durability issues owners mentioned in surveys on the last-generation XJ8 centered on uneven tire wear, brake noise and problems with the engine-control computer. But these were not seen as serious problems, Mr. Ivers said.
"There still is a good distance to cover before it's in the Lexus range, but the underappreciated fact is that Jaguar long-term durability is in the same range as vehicles produced by Toyota," he said.
While life with a Jaguar cannot be expected to be trouble-free, some owners figure other factors compensate. Bill Alderman of Dallas has owned three Lexuses, but finds them sterile. "They are all fantastic cars, but after about six months it becomes a car," he said. His '96 XJR continues to enchant him.
"To me it looks like it's going about 60 when it's sitting in the garage," he said.
Some Jaguar owners, however, have turned their backs on the XJ and gone German; sometimes the reasons had nothing to do with quality. "The first time I walked into the dealer I walked right past the new XJ, because I thought it was the X-Type, the small one," said Barry Fromberg, chief financial officer for Dean Foods in Dallas. He traded in his old XJ for a new BMW 7 Series.
Mr. Ivers said that Jaguar tended to stumble in the quality rankings in the years when it brought out new vehicles. It tends to recover the next year.
In 1999, Jaguar ranked first out of 36 automakers in initial quality. In 2000, the year the S-Type was introduced, it dropped to 10th, Mr. Ivers said. Then in 2001 it rose to second. In 2002, when the X-Type was new, Jaguar dropped to 19th (out of 35). This year, it was 10th.
"That raises the question about the XJ," Mr. Ivers said. "Will they struggle with that launch?"

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Jaguar XJ8; 
A New (Aluminum) Way to Skin a Cat

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
JAGUARS have always had style, but for too long they lacked substance. They ceased to be driving machines for hard-core enthusiasts, and their reliability --or lack thereof -- was legendary. As the company teetered on the financial precipice in the 1980's, its cars seemed as anachronistic as the British Empire.
 Since the FordMotor Company snatched Jaguar from the brink of collapse in 1989, Ford has poured in the resources required to improve quality and expand the model lineup. After adding the midsize S-Type and compact X-Type, and redesigning the sporty XK series, Jaguar finally turned its attention to its flagship sedan, the XJ. The 2004 model is the first thoroughly re-engineered XJ since 1987, and Jaguar executives are emphatic that the car now has substance to go with its style. 
After a 500-mile trip through Arizona, along the convoluted ridges of the White Mountains and across the scrub lands of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, I cannot disagree, especially since I was able to drive the '04 and '03 models back to back. 
While the old and new XJ's do not look a lot different -- styling changes seem subtle unless the cars are shoulder to shoulder -- the '04 is radically different under the skin. This runs counter to the common practice of hiding old technology under new sheet metal: the XJ is like a classic armoire stuffed with a Centrino-based computer and HDTV.
Aside from their once-poor reliability, a concern that Jaguar has worked hard to address in recent years, complaints about past XJ's tended to center on two areas: space was surprisingly tight for such a large car, and despite Jaguar's sporty reputation, demanding drivers found the XJ's steering too vague and its ride too floaty.
A lightweight aluminum unit body -- the first on a mass-produced car -- was developed to address both concerns. The body itself is 40 percent lighter despite being 4.3 inches taller and 2.6 inches longer. Over all, the car weighs 200 pounds less despite being more spacious and significantly stiffer.
Partly because of the lighter weight, Jaguar fitted all models with an air suspension to keep the ride height constant whether there is one occupant or five. The car is indeed stable and quiet at high speeds and nimble when the roads are more demanding -- combining the fluid grace that owners call Jaguarness with the lighter feel of a smaller car. The XJ lets you have your crumpets and eat them, too.
Three versions are offered: the XJ8 starting at $59,995, including delivery charge; the better-apppointed Vanden Plas at $68,995; and the higher-performance XJR at $74,995. The standard XJ8, expected to account for 55 percent of the 12,000 to 14,000 expected sales in the United States each year, undercuts the BMW 745i and the newly redesigned Audi A8L by about $9,000 and the Mercedes-Benz S430 by $13,000.
Standard equipment includes a self-leveling air suspension; adaptive damping that optimizes both the ride and handling; traction control with an antiskid stability system; electronic parking brake; power-adjustable foot pedals; parking sensors; and 12-way power front seats. With just a few options, my XJ8 test car came to $64,820.
The engine has been enlarged to 4.2 liters. The XJR comes with a supercharger that raises horsepower to 390, from 294, and cuts the car's 0-to-60 acceleration time to about 5 seconds (from 5.4 in the 2003 XJR). The XJ8 and Vanden Plas dash to 60 m.p.h. in 6.3 seconds, Jaguar says, down from 6.9.
The previous Vanden Plas was a long-wheelbase version, but it now simply has the most elegant trim. Since all XJ's have been stretched, the car no longer comes in two sizes. Inside, there is an inch more headroom and shoulder room and more legroom (2 inches in front and 5 inches in the rear). Burly six-foot Americans can sit in the back without needing a British stiff upper lip.
One of the old XJ's biggest sins was a trunk that couldn't hold the requisite four sets of golf clubs. It can now, with cargo volume increasing to 16.6 cubic feet, from 12.7.
Asked what is the most obvious improvement, David Scholes, the chief program engineer, nominated the steering, which feels much more direct and precise. Another bonus is a new transmission, a six-speed automatic by ZF, a leading European supplier. With a slightly lower first gear and a higher top gear, the six-speed aims to deliver better acceleration and, Jaguar executives say, 15 percent better fuel economy. The supercharged XJR's mileage is now good enough (17 town, 24 highway) to avoid the federal gas-guzzler tax.
With either version of the engine, these are formidable powertrains. Step on the XJ8's accelerator, and significant power is immediately available almost without regard to engine speed. Downshifts are short and quick, but not abrupt. And when you apply the brakes going into a turn, the transmission anticipates your next move with a downshift that sets you up for a burst of speed as the road straightens out.
The interior has the usual leather-and-wood Jaguar ambience, but I had some complaints. The black-plastic buttons for the climate and audio systems were not very elegant. The readouts for the trip odometer, temperature gauge and radio were hard to read in bright sunlight.
Those are small things. The new XJ fixes everything that was seriously wrong with the previous model, yet it has maintained its pedigree. Unlike the S-Type (which shares parts with the Ford Mondeo sold in Europe) or the X-Type (a mechanical twin of the Lincoln LS), the XJ keeps most of its stuff to itself.
Susan Jacobs, an industry analyst who is president of Jacobs & Associates in Rutherford, N.J., says the smaller models have hurt Jaguar's image. "The XJ is coming to the market a time when the cachet of the brand has been severely eroded," she said. "I think the new XJ is going to help Jaguar remain competitive with BMW and Mercedes, and that's fine. But that doesn't revive or send Jaguar on a new course."
Nor does the XJ's evolutionary styling signal a new direction, since the look has not changed appreciably over 35 years. But luxury automakers often find themselves torn between their desire to innovate and the conservative tastes of their customers. BMW found this out by giving its 7 Series a radical, highly polarizing makeover.
George Ayres, vice president for marketing at Jaguar Cars North America, said the designers had chosen to go for a look with staying power. "The XJ came out in 1968," he said. "This is the seventh-generation car. And we have sold 800,000 XJ's worldwide, which is more than half of all Jaguars ever produced. We've proven already that that design can last quite a long time."
Not everyone agrees. Chris Cedergren, an analyst with Iceology, a consulting and research firm in Los Angeles, says the styling, while handsome and true to the Jaguar tradition, may not have the legs to compete for a decade with the sleek new Audi A8L or the next generation of the Mercedes S-Class. And he says it may not attract younger buyers.
While Ms. Jacobs has no problem with the evolutionary styling, she says Jaguar may have missed an opportunity to signal the innovations under the skin. In fact, what lies beneath is not just a new Jag, but a radically improved one -- an XJ that atones for many sins of the past.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Cool On Cars, But Warm On Car Parts

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THESE days, the Big Three automakers are looking more and more like a bunch of Lilliputians. 
 Helped by generous incentives, sales remain robust. But profits are hard to come by. Detroit's share of the market is ebbing. 
 Despite plump dividend payouts, the stock prices of DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor and General Motors are all off by 20 percent or more over the last 52 weeks. 
Gary R. Lapidus, an automotive analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, talked last week about the industry. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Auto industry executives argue that profitability will improve when the economy picks up steam. Does that position have merit?

A. To characterize the problem as the economy, which Detroit wants to do, confounds me. This downturn was led by overinvestment and the technology bubble. With interest rates at a 50-year low, consumers have been buying houses and cars.
At best, what you are looking at is a sluggish, modest recovery. For autos, that doesn't paint a very exciting picture. 
The need to buy new cars is not that great, so any recovery is not going to be a disaster, but it won't mean a sales boom, either. We will probably chug along at 16.5 million unit sales and a structural overhang of rising excess supply in an O.K. environment.
The auto industry is operating at about 88 percent of capacity, a rate that is extraordinarily unique in the annals of economic downturns. In the early 1990's, by contrast, capacity utilization in the auto industry went down to about 67 percent. And the profit they are earning today at the current level of capacity is dramatically less than what they have historically earned at that sort of rate.

Q. Is excess capacity the crux of the problem?

A. Currently, we estimate the present excess supply in the North American market at two million vehicles. Over the next five years, we are forecasting that automakers will add 2.6 million units of supply, but that demand will only absorb 1.6 million units. That means one million units will need to be cleared through lower prices.
It is going to be very difficult to create a profitable industry with this much capacity. The pricing environment that is created by trying to sell this many vehicles makes it very hard for me to see how to get a thriving industry without removing costs. 

Q. Are expenses for pension and health care benefits for union retirees Detroit's biggest cost problem?

A. They are a microcosm of the Social Security problem: too few active employees are bringing in revenue for too many retirees. That is why these companies are desperately committed to maintaining market share and revenue. They need to cover those looming retiree benefits.
We estimate that by 2007, the collective benefit expense for the Big Three may increase by as much as $7.3 billion, an 80 percent increase from 2002. And the problem doesn't reach its peak until late in this decade and early in the next, from 2008 through 2012. In terms of cash flows, that is the peak period of pain.

Q. Labor contracts expire in September. What's your forecast on the negotiations?

A. The issues are always the same: job security, retirement benefits and wages, probably in that order of importance. I would say there is unlikely to be any kind of strike. Neither side has the stomach for that, and a strike won't accomplish anything except allow the non-Big Three, nonunionized companies to take market share.

Q. Is there any reason to look at auto stocks as good long-term investments?

A. I don't see a credible argument for investing in the Big Three for anyone with a 12-month to 24-month time horizon. Increasingly, they have become trading vehicles. To a certain degree, they they are liquid options on an economic recovery.
You can look at some non-U.S. manufacturers as long-term investments, particularly some of the Japanese manufacturers. They have an opportunity to expand market share in North America. Toyota and Honda are viable long-term investments.

Q. You don't care for the automakers, but you have a different attitude about the auto supply companies. Why? Which do you like?

A. The suppliers are the flip side of the Big Three.
The industry is going to keep adding new supply and keep cutting prices, which is great for the consumer. If you are a supplier, you get paid on volume. The normal and sustainable level of auto production is a lot higher than we had previously imagined. That is a bad thing for the Big Three, but if you are a company like Lear Corporation, it is a good thing. They make money on volume. Lear and Johnson Controls are two beneficiaries of what we call the Motown Breakdown.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Long Term, A Rate Cut May Not Be A Good Idea

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
WHY mess with a good thing?
 Based on statistics from financial markets, investors seem pretty sure that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates one more time on Wednesday. A cut of at least a quarter-point seems virtually certain in the target for the federal funds rate, and a half-point reduction is possible. But there's little reason for so much more easing of monetary policy. 
 Several economists are convinced that the economy is at a turning point, and ready for a strong second half of the year. News from the corporate sector has ranged from static to positive, and surveys of executives are reporting greater optimism. Prices for goods and services are starting to rise.
The only thing that can derail the recovery now, they all say, is a big shock: another terrorist attack, another spate of accounting scandals, or something else that the bearish gods haven't already tried.
If that's true, why cut rates now? With the economy potentially on an upswing, cutting rates would only add unnecessary fuel to the fire. It would also reduce the Fed's firepower for dealing with any shock that might come later. Surely, it would be better to wait for the shock, then pull the trigger. If the shock never comes, everyone's happy.
Moreover, many businesses might not be affected by another cut. Bankers, for whom interest rates are the price of doing business, say the state of the economy -- more than the rate itself -- has been the prime determinant of corporate borrowing.
More important to companies is how long the Fed keeps short-term rates low. If the Fed commits to stable rates for a long period, long-term interest rates -- the ones that matter more for big capital and construction projects -- will stay down as well.
Analysts and pundits alike have warned of the dangers of disappointing the market. Traditionally, the Fed has been careful to telegraph its moves in order to avoid disruptions. This time, without a cut of at least a quarter-point, the market will have underestimated the cost of credit, and stocks may fall.
But hold on a minute. Think about what the Fed would be signaling if it kept rates steady at 1.25 percent: we don't think another cut is needed, because the economy is starting to recover.
Wouldn't that message have a much more positive effect on the market than any disappointment about a measly quarter-point cut?
There seems to be some confusion on this point. At least one analyst has cautioned against cutting by a half-point precisely because, by his logic, it would tell the markets that the Fed has finished its easing of monetary policy.
But such a move might instead convey that the economy's problems are worse than the market thought. There are other ways, using words rather than costly deeds, for the Fed to tell the markets that it's wrapping things up for a while.
Indeed, signals about the staying power of the Fed's policies can act as substitutes for changes in the level of interest rates. In physics, the speed of an object in motion depends equally on the force applied to it and the duration of the impulse. In the economy, duration can be even more important; because investors are forward-looking, the effects of expected policy in the future show up in the markets today.
It is possible that the markets' expectations for a rate cut are based on a negative appraisal of the economy, or other, noneconomic factors. Some avid Fed watchers believe that Alan Greenspan, the chairman, is so concerned about his legacy that he will buy a little insurance for the recovery by overshooting the mark.
BUT that kind of insurance is expensive, especially as the federal funds rate scrapes bottom. Mr. Greenspan has a limited amount of room left, and must use his remaining cuts carefully.
If prices started to fall around the nation, a half-point cut would give the economy a much bigger jolt -- in psychological if not financial terms -- than a quarter-point. Buying insurance now might actually be a riskier strategy than standing pat.
If the Fed keeps rates steady this week, or even cuts by just a quarter-point, some investors will be surprised. But they may also learn a useful lesson. Those who beg for a rate cut now are focusing on the short term. They want marginally looser credit today, regardless of the consequences tomorrow.
At this moment, however, the economy needs investors who are more concerned with the long term -- the period during which the economy's fundamental strengths will have time to show through. A gentle chastising of the myopic investors, accompanied by an explanation, might help to shift the markets' focus. That way, unnecessary disappointments might be less likely in the future.

HEADLINE: A Happy Firm's Ending Is Anything But 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
BROBECK, PHLEGER & HARRISON tried to be the un-law firm, young and hip instead of staid and boring. 
 With expansive offices in a downtown San Francisco office tower, it was not the kind of place where lawyers wore white shirts and striped ties. While young associates at other firms complained about endless hours, pushy partners and boring work, Brobeck, according to a former associate there, was often fun. And profitable: the firm's roughly 150 partners took home an average of $1.2 million each in 2000, and associates were paid wages as high as those offered at many older, powerhouse firms in New York. 
 Its clients, including companies like Cisco Systems and Compaq Computer, were ebullient, riding to fabulous wealth on the crest of the new Internet economy. 
So when partners told employees in January that the firm would be closing, many of the roughly 450 lawyers and nearly 1,000 staff members there weren't just stunned. They felt betrayed.
They found that their firm had not paid administrative fees for its 401(k) plan, locking them out of their accounts for months. Many found themselves suddenly without health insurance. Some have been stuck with unreimbursed firm expenses. And many say they have not received information about any of these problems -- let alone about how to deal with them -- from their bosses.
Many former senior partners said they were embarrassed by the collapse of the firm and no longer wanted to have their names associated with it. Privately, they said they, too, were hurt badly financially by the firm's problems, which became acute when its debts became immediately payable as a result of the departure of a number of partners. 
The collapse of any business can be devastating to employees. But the fallout from Brobeck's demise, which has already spawned a lawsuit by former employees, has exposed many of the resentments that are usually hidden in a law firm. Staff members like secretaries and computer technicians say they were treated much worse than the well-paid associates, and many Brobeck employees resent the hundreds of thousands of dollars that they believe the partners paid themselves even as the firm's prospects deteriorated. 
Perhaps most striking is the way Brobeck's downward trajectory resembled that of any other company in trouble, even though the firm occasionally provided strategic advice to companies in financial trouble. 
There are bitter parties on all sides and much slinging of blame. 
Charles Bencomo, who worked in computer support in the firm's office in New York, said he was surprised to learn in mid-February that he could not withdraw funds from his 401(k). In early 2002, Brobeck stopped paying UMB Bank to administer the firm's plan, which held more than $160 million.
Employees knew the firm was having some trouble -- it had gone through layoffs last year -- but "for that to happen was pretty shocking," said Mr. Bencomo, who now works in computer support at another law firm, McDermott, Will & Emery. Many of Brobeck's employees were eventually able to pull money out of 401(k) accounts, and all should ultimately be able do so.
Mr. Bencomo said he was still bitter that the firm did not contribute a bonus of 5.5 percent of his salary to his 401(k) account, as it had in previous years. But at least he was able to find another job, he said.
"I was fortunate," Mr. Bencomo said. "I was able to land on my feet. But there are alot of people who couldn't."
OTHER Brobeck employees said they found that the firm was not reimbursing them for expenses on their corporate Diners Club cards. 
Stephen M. Snyder, the former Brobeck partner heading the firm's liquidation committee, said that unpaid checks are pinned to the wall of his office.
"Everybody has dishonored checks from the firm," Mr. Snyder said. "I think that that problem dates from probably the end of January." He sighed. "There's plenty of debt to pay," he added.
Until the last minute, it was unclear whether the firm would pay employees for unused vacation time. Only on Feb. 14, the last day of business for most employees at the larger offices, did checks arrive. 
That was quite a shift for a firm that had helped lead the way in raising new associates' salaries to as much as $125,000 in the late 1990's, driving up the expectations of young lawyers nationwide.
Even after closing in February, the partners were not charitable to the staff, said Jayne Loughry, formerly a senior counsel in the firm's San Francisco office.
"The Brobeck partners have made no general effort to reach out and help their former employees," Ms. Loughry said. "No effort at all to set up any kind of emergency loan fund, anything to help tide these folks over."
Most of Brobeck's lawyers have now landed safely, often at other law firms, although not all those on its staff have been so lucky.
Without access to money in 401(k) accounts and without severance pay, some staff members say it has been difficult to pay mortgages and health insurance premiums. And they say partners did not adequately explain the firm's dire predicament to them either before or after announcing that it would close.
"No one told us anything," said Larry McBroom, who worked at Brobeck for 15 years, most recently in the billing department. "I found out more from the newspapers, magazines and the Internet. There was just no communication."
Lawyers in the Dallas office of Brobeck gave scant warning to staff members that the firm was closing, said Lynn Cleckler, a legal secretary there. "Basically we got one day's notice," she said, adding that the loss of her job has posed a particular hardship for her and her husband because she has an eye disease and he is diabetic and they have had a hard time finding insurance.
To get information, many former staff members, including Ms. Cleckler, have relied on an informal e-mail network set up by Jim Lewis, an information technology trainer who was laid off by the firm last December.
News of a lawsuit coordinated by another former employee also spread along the e-mail list. The suit, filed in March in state court in San Francisco, contends that Brobeck did not comply with state and federal laws requiring either advance notice of a shutdown or payment of two months' severance. 
A liquidation committee is dealing with Brobeck's obligations to suppliers and employees. The firm has not sought bankruptcy protection, probably because a filing could expose partners' personal assets to creditors, bankruptcy lawyers said.
And some partners have a lot to lose. In 2000, the earnings of the average Brobeck partner peaked at $1.2 million. The firm was growing, preparing new office space in Palo Alto, Calif., and luring young associates from stodgy East Coast law firms that did not have the appeal of Brobeck's high-technology clients.
The expansion plans would cause problems. During 2001, Brobeck used current revenue to pay for the new space, but at the end of the year the firm collected less money from clients than it had predicted. Partners found themselves faced with forgoing their share of annual profits. They took out a loan from Citibank for about $40 million, according to two former partners, and that money ensured that the partners' annual compensation remained healthy.
Usually, partners in law firms are compensated in two ways. First, each draws money monthly against his or her share of anticipated annual profits. Then, after the firm's profitability is clear, partners divide any remaining actual profits among themselves, early the next year.
During 2002, revenue declined but partners still drew out tens of thousands of dollars a month -- a fact that frustrates former employees. It made the partners look greedy, employees said, and was not in keeping with the image that the firm was trying to project to them. The firm also laid off staff, something that the former chairman, Tower C. Snow Jr., had guaranteed would not happen on his watch. But Mr. Snow stepped down as chairman in November 2001.
During 2002, numerous partners left the firm, joining competitors. In the spring, Mr. Snow, the firm's former chairman, led a contingent to Clifford Chance, an international law firm expanding on the West Coast.
Ultimately, more than 60 partners defected in 2002. That set off a provision in the loan agreements that Brobeck had made with Citibank: if more than 15 percent of the partners left the firm, Brobeck's debts would become due immediately. 
In the fall, Brobeck's top partners renegotiated the terms of the loan with the bank. They pledged the firm's anticipated profits -- $26 million -- to pay down some of its debt. Because that profit registered as personal income, the partners had to pay taxes on that money, even though they never got it. 
"You're taking out less, but you're getting taxed," said one former Brobeck partner, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "That's the harsh reality."
Partners also looked for a way out through a merger with a stronger firm. For months, they negotiated to combine Brobeck with a big East Coast firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. Talks were held in different offices of the two firms until early January this year, and most employees expected a deal to be reached. But it was not.
Brobeck's financial condition was too precarious and the conflicts of interest between Brobeck's clients and those of Morgan Lewis were too intractable, said Francis M. Milone, the chairman of Morgan Lewis. 
"AT the end of the day, after several months of negotiation, it just got to the point that we did not think that we would be able to get all the pieces together," Mr. Milone said. "There was a significant number of things that had to come together and they just didn't."
In the weeks after the talks failed, Morgan Lewis hired nearly 150 Brobeck lawyers.
Partners on Brobeck's policy committee learned on Wednesday, Jan. 29, that Morgan Lewis would not agree to a merger. They decided that the firm could not survive. The firm's lawyers and staff members learned the next day of an imminent shutdown; the partners formally voted to dissolve the firm two weeks later.
Now Brobeck's liquidation committee is desperately trying to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection, in part to avoid personal liability. Bankruptcy proceedings are "a very public and messy process," said Peter J. Antoszyk, a bankruptcy lawyer at Brown Rudnick Berlack Israels in Boston. 
"In some cases," he added, "partners may even be required to disclose their personal financial capacity -- how much they can pay." 
Mr. Snyder, of Brobeck's liquidation committee, said that he expects many partners will have to help pay the firm's debts, even without a bankruptcy filing. 
"The partners are going to lose a ton of money," he said. But he acknowledged that losses by wealthy partners probably would not reassure employees who were looking for work. 
"That stuff hits closer to home for the employees than for the partners," he said.

HEADLINE: Pension Reserve: What's Enough? 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
ACCOUNTING is a dismal science, pension accounting even more so. But it is increasingly important to penetrate the fog today, when companies are using complex and sometimes hidden tactics to change the way they pay for their pension plans. For the roughly one in five workers in the private sector whose employers have established pension plans, those changes could significantly affect the way they live in retirement.
 One business that is having trouble funding its pensions is Greyhound Lines, the bus company, which has gone through years of labor strife and bankruptcy. Several years ago, it quietly managed to get permission from Congress to stop putting more money into its drivers' pension fund. In essence, the Greyhound provision lets the company act as if its pension plan is fully funded, when in fact it is not. Greyhound argued that it had special circumstances, and that if it obeyed the funding rules it would end up with far too much money locked away in the pension trust. Its drivers' union agreed. 
 No other company has anything like Greyhound's exemption -- yet. But as pension deficits widen and big contributions come due, Greyhound's little-known exemption is just the kind of solution that many employers lust after. 
Companies in several industries say that rules requiring big contributions to underfunded pension plans must be changed. The shortfall for General Motors is so daunting that on Friday it said it will have to sell $13 billion in bonds, with most of the proceeds going to reduce deficits in its American pension plans. 
In Washington, varying relief mechanisms are being sought, but all would have the same effect: to reduce the amounts that employers set aside today for benefits due in the future. 
The long-term effects of that could be harmful. Federal officials have spent the last quarter-century prodding companies to fully fund their pension plans; they say that ballooning pension deficits show a need for more contributions, not exemptions. 
In their quest for pension relief, the major airlines have hired Richard A. Grafmeyer, the same lobbyist whom Greyhound used to secure its break in 1997. Mr. Grafmeyer is also a former deputy staff director of the Senate Finance Committee and a former deputy chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. He has declined to discuss the matter. 
Greyhound, meanwhile, is seeking to expand its own break and to make it permanent, because the original exemption is set to expire in 2010. Now, as in 1997, Greyhound says special treatment is necessary because its plan covers an unusually old group of workers, whose life expectancies are shorter than national norms for all pension participants. Workers who won't live long enough to cash many pension checks don't require very big pension contributions.
Other business and labor groups are calling for pension measures that would bring relief by adjusting mortality tables, allowing pension plans more time to account for investment losses, reducing pension-insurance premiums and changing the interest rate that is used in computing pension liabilities. 
BILLIONS of dollars are at issue, but teasing out the details is difficult because current, specific data on individual pension plans was made secret by an act of Congress in 1994.
The absence of facts has not chilled the debate. Proponents of pension relief say the economic recovery itself may be at stake. 
"Companies cannot commit to building new plants, launching new research projects or hiring new employees if that cash is needed to fund pensions," wrote Glen A. Barton, the chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar and a member of the Business Roundtable -- an elite group of corporate chief executives -- in a recent letter to each member of Congress. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is a former chairman of the Roundtable.
But from the other side come warnings that the funding rules need to be tightened, not relaxed. Giving one company a break can "give other financially distressed companies a blueprint for how to 'borrow' from their pension plans," said Steven A. Kandarian, executive director of the federal agency that insures pensions, in Senate testimony in January. 
In the worst case, the United States Treasury -- in other words, the taxpayers -- would have to step in, because traditional pensions are guaranteed by the federal government, and the pension insurance agency is itself in poor shape and unable to absorb large claims indefinitely. 
Weakening funding rules increases the risk to the government's insurance program, pension analysts say. The rules were enacted by Congress in 1974 and tightened in 1987 and 1994.
"The reason these funding rules were put into place was to protect the government insurance program, so the premiums wouldn't be too high and so the taxpayer wouldn't have to bail this out," said Richard A. Ippolito, a former chief economist of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency that insures pensions.
For Greyhound, as for many other companies, the pension troubles began with deregulation. When the intercity bus business was opened to competition in 1982, Greyhound suddenly found itself going head to head with low-cost rivals that had no pension benefits to cover. 
Greyhound demanded concessions in 1983; the drivers went on strike. A contract agreement settling the strike, which lasted seven weeks, freed Greyhound from ever having to make any more pension contributions. The drivers themselves made the next year's contribution. Greyhound was also allowed to close the plan to new drivers. 
"There was no funding of the plan from that point forward," said Greg Herbold, the president of Amalgamated Transit Union local 1700. "But everybody kept accruing benefits." 
In traditional pension plans, workers accrue, or build up, bigger pensions with each year of service, amassing the largest portion just before they retire. Greyhound's drivers earned their maximum pension after 30 years of service.
In 1990, there was another, much longer strike. Greyhound, threatening to end the pension plan entirely, won another concession from the drivers when the strike ended in 1993: if the pension plan needed money, the workers would pay, in effect, by allowing their accruals to stop. Benefits would be frozen, no matter how many years drivers stayed behind the wheel. 
For Mr. Herbold and the other drivers in the plan, the threat of a pension freeze set a clock ticking. Drivers with less than 30 years of service could only hope that they would achieve their maximum benefits and retire before the plan became underfunded and accruals were frozen. They did not know when that might happen. Once a worker has earned pension benefits, an employer cannot legally take them away.
For a few years, stock-market gains kept the plan adequately funded, and it appeared that all drivers would qualify for full benefits. 
But in 1994, Congress changed the rules for pensions. Regulators had found that some companies were making assumptions of very high mortality rates for their workers. By assuming that employees would not live long enough to cash many pension checks, the companies could shrink their mandatory contributions, saving money.
Congress cracked down, requiring all companies to use a standard mortality table. For Greyhound, the effect was "shocking," said Randy Hardock, a lawyer at the Washington firm Davis & Harman who succeeded Mr. Grafmeyer as Greyhound's lobbyist in 2000. Using the standard mortality table required Greyhound to fund its pension plan as if it were funding the benefits of new, young employees, he said, when in fact the only drivers in the plan were those hired before 1983. 
"THESE are very old people in this plan, and they've been dying, in fact, 30 percent faster than the mortality table is saying," Mr. Hardock said. "If you have to fund your plan as if people are going to live for 15 or 20 years, and in fact they're only living 10 or 11 years, you just end up with too much money" in the pension fund.
When Mr. Grafmeyer was Greyhound's lobbyist, he helped to secure the sponsorship of Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, for a provision letting Greyhound treat its pension plan as 90 percent funded, even if its assets fell to just 85 percent of future obligations. 
Normally, a pension plan that dips below 90 percent for an extended time is considered underfunded, and the company must make special, accelerated contributions.
Janice A. Mays, chief counsel for the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Rangel had sponsored the measure because he believed that the participants would be poorly served without it. "By helping this plan, you are not causing any risk to the participants," she said. "You're actually helping the plan to survive."
Greyhound's exemption was inserted into a broad 1997 tax bill, written without mentioning Greyhound or pensions directly. Asked why the measure was drafted that way, Mr. Hardock acknowledged that it helped to prevent a "me too" problem, in which other companies with underfunded pensions might spot Greyhound's exemption and clamor for the same thing.
Indeed, many businesses and unions are saying this year that the standard mortality table is behind many pension problems, and are calling for permission to adjust it. 
But Greyhound's pension plan administrator, Paul Owsley, a former driver who is an employee of the pension trust, was skeptical of contentions about the mortality rate of Greyhound's bus drivers and a lessened need for contributions.
"Our oldest participant now is 102 years old," he said. "The average age is well over 80. These longer life expectancies have put the plan in jeopardy, because they draw money out of the plan." Currently, the Greyhound plan pays about $75 million a year to pensioners, he said.
In any case, the 1997 exemption did not bring enough relief. When stock prices started to tumble in 2000, the gains that had kept the plan afloat since 1983 began to evaporate. 
Unless Greyhound made a contribution, the plan's actuary warned two years ago, it would be noncompliant by 2003. But Greyhound still had a labor agreement saying that it did not have to make contributions.
Complicating matters, Greyhound by that point had been acquired by Laidlaw Inc. of Canada. Laidlaw has its own problems; it sought bankruptcy court protection from its creditors in 2001, two years after the takeover, and plans to emerge from its court-supervised reorganization on Monday. Laidlaw's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission warn that any pension contributions "could have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition of Greyhound." 
To slow the pension fund's deterioration, Greyhound froze accruals in 2002. By that time, a vast majority of the drivers -- about 14,000 -- had beaten the clock, fulfilling their 30 years and retiring with maximum benefits. Only about 800 drivers covered by the plan were on the road, striving for their 30 years, too.
One of them is Mr. Herbold, a 27-year Greyhound veteran. For him, the freeze halted his benefit growth three years shy of qualifying for the maximum benefits -- just as he was about to earn the biggest part. 
Not surprisingly, Mr. Herbold has strong feelings about this, and about pension policy in general. Enforce the funding rules too rigorously, he said, and the country will end up with weak companies that default on their pension promises and stronger companies that refuse to offer pensions. 
"We're going to create this whole class of people 30 years from now that's going to be dependent on the government,because corporate America has decided that it's not their responsibility. It's going to be a big, huge problem," he said.
For the remaining drivers to get their maximum benefits, Greyhound would have to lift the freeze. But Greyhound's labor contract says that this cannot be done unless the pension plan climbs back up to 115 percent funding. That is extremely unlikely -- unless the rules change.
Laidlaw's government filings say Greyhound and the union are trying "to negotiate a method for avoiding contributions." A pension bill already passed by the House contains a provision to let Greyhound deem its pension plan to be 90 percent funded in perpetuity, no matter how low the real percentage falls. It would also exempt Greyhound from the standard mortality table.
When told about this, Mr. Owsley, the plan administrator, expressed surprise. "They don't tell us anything, so I don't know what they're driving at," he said. 
Such a measure, Mr. Owsley said, could ruin the pension fund. "With a flat stock market," he said, "when you're not taking anything in and you're paying out $75 million a year, it doesn't take too many years before you're in trouble."
Mr. Hardock disagreed, saying he was "very confident" that the expanded relief measure would not jeopardize the pension plan.
WOULD it really be so bad to bend the pension rules for just one troubled company, long enough to let 800 bus drivers earn the pensions they expected? 
Even if the plan failed, the government would step in and start issuing the 14,000 pension checks. The pension agency's coverage has limits, but the drivers' benefits are not extravagant -- the top annual payment is around $20,000 -- so all would get their benefits if the federal agency took over the plan. The pension plan has a deficit of about $42 million, according to Laidlaw's most recent filings -- hardly enough to swamp the pension insurance agency. 
What scares federal regulators is not the Greyhound case, but the likelihood that larger companies will use it as a precedent. 
As airlines run up enormous losses, the Air Line Pilots Association, as well as several airlines, are advocating industrywide pension relief. So far, they have won sympathy from some lawmakers, but no sponsors for an airline pension relief bill. The failure of any pilots' pension plan would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the government's obligations; together, America's passenger airlines had a pension shortfall totaling $26 billion at the end of 2002. 
Already, the pension agency is working with $7.1 billion in pension debt that it took on from bankrupt steel companies last year. The steel pensions alone nearly wiped out the agency's entire surplus. The agency has operated with a deficit before, but if the problem grows, it will have to find new sources of revenue. 
Always on the minds of pension policy makers is General Motors, whose $25 billion worldwide pension deficit is larger than its market capitalization of $21.8 billion. G.M. is participating in the push for pension relief but says that it can handle all of its pension obligations.
"It's like a gamble," said Mr. Ippolito, the pension insurance agency's former chief economist, of pension relief. If favorable market conditions return, everybody -- companies, workers and taxpayers -- will win. If not, everybody loses.
"Constituents want relief right now, and it's tempting for Congress to give out all these benefits," Mr. Ippolito said. "But if you tell all these people they don't have to put money into these plans, the problem is, down the road, somebody else isgoing to be asked to pay for it."

A Rally for Funds, and Their Families

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIMELMAN

 BODY:
THE rally in stocks since mid-March has been welcomed by most investors, but those who hold shares in companies whose primary business is managing mutual funds and other financial assets have had even more reason to celebrate. From March 10 through Thursday, the Lipper management company index, a group of asset managers, gained 35.5 percent, compared with 23.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 "When the stock markets go up, the stocks of the asset managers go up even more," said George A. Roche, the chairman of T. Rowe Price, one of the companies in the group. 
 But, with some exceptions, when the market falls, shares of asset managers tend to fall even further. "These companies have so much leverage to the stock market," said Alexander L. Thorndike, a managing director at Century Capital Management, a privately held mutual fund company in Boston. 
Companies like Alliance Capital, Franklin Resources, T. Rowe Price and Janus Capital make money from the fees they charge for managing investment assets. As stock prices have rebounded in recent weeks, so has the level of assets managed by these firms, leading to higher fees. In March and April, a total of $16.4 billion poured into domestic and international equity mutual funds based in the United States. In January and February, the funds had a net outflow of $3.8 billion, according to the Financial Research Corp. in Boston.
Many analysts say shares of most asset management companies have risen so quickly that they are now expensive. Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, takes this view, saying that only Alliance Capital and BlackRock, a company with mostly institutional clients, are worth buying at their current prices.
But others say shares of the asset management group are likely to rise further. An analysis by Putnam Lovell NBF,an investment bank and research firm, found that when the overall market rebounded in some recent recoveries, asset managers tended to outperform for several years.
For example, in the three months after Oct. 31, 1990, when the market was emerging from a trough caused by recession and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the stocks of asset managers, as a group, rose 27 percent, while the S.& P. 500 climbed 13 percent. And over three years, the asset managers gained 190 percent, while the S.& P. 500 was up 54 percent.
Still, opportunities for buying publicly traded asset managers are limited to a dozen or so stocks, many of which are of mid- and small-cap companies like Gabelli Asset Management, Waddell & Reed and Neuberger Berman. Some of the largest asset management companies, with household names like Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, are privately owned and thus their shares are off limits to investors. Others, like Citigroup Asset Management, Merrill Lynch Asset Management or Deutsche Asset Management, are divisions of even larger corporations that offer a wide array of financial services.
According to Merrill Lynch, asset managers had pretax profit margins -- after interest payments and depreciation -- of about 36 percent, on average, as of the fourth quarter of 2002. By comparison, banks and savings institutions had a pretax margin of 29 percent, while the margin for insurance companies was 5 percent.
Revenues for asset management companies generally are more stable than those for most other financial services companies because they are tied to fees. That predictability helps asset managers achieve price-to-earnings multiples that are higher, on average, than for other financial services companies -- 21.2 percent versus 19.4 percent for brokers, on average, according to Putnam Lovell. And because of the relatively straightforward nature of their businesses, asset management companies have largely avoided the conflict-of-interest scandals that have plagued companies that provide stock research and investment banking under the same corporate roof. Asset management companies also tend to have fairly simple balance sheets -- a benefit now that many investors have soured on companies with opaque financial statements.
In previous market corrections going back to 1987, stocks of the asset managers fell 30 to 40 percent more than the overall market, said William Katz, an analyst at Putnam Lovell. But takeovers of asset management firms by larger companies, like Alliance's acquisition of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in 2000, fueled an upswing in share prices, Mr. Katz said. And during the recent market decline, these companies "weren't viewed as such a regulatory and corporate governance risk compared with banks and brokers," he added. From Aug. 31, 2000, to mid-March of this year, the group fell 29 percent, compared with a 43 percent decline in the S.& P.
THE Securities and Exchange Commission has been looking closely at the various fees that mutual funds charge investors. An agency report submitted to Congress on June 9 indicated that the S.E.C. favors improved financial disclosure by the firms. While a Congressional subcommittee is considering a bill that would give shareholders more information about fund expenses, no fundamental change in the level of mutual fund transaction or management fees is expected.
Some factors may make the companies less attractive as investments than they were in the 1990's. The aging of the baby boomers is expected to lead to a slowdown in the growth of stock holdings in retirement accounts. And many investment experts predict that stock gains in coming years will be modest. As a result, Mr. Moszkowski of Merrill Lynch said he is forecasting annual revenue growth of 9 to 11 percent for the asset management group, versus more than 15 percent in the past decade.
For these reasons, he said, investors should focus on asset management companies that can do the best job of bucking this predicted slowdown. Several analysts like Alliance Capital because it manages substantial bond portfolios as well as stocks, and because its client base is well diversified among large institutions and individual investors. In addition, it has solid exposure to two areas that are expected to grow rapidly: management of assets for foreign investors and management of traditional, defined-benefit pension plans. Though many companies have switched away from these pensions in recent years to 401(k) plans, "the stock market decline over the last three years have thrown both state and corporate plans into an underfunded position and we estimate that they will have to make perhaps $30 billion in contributions in 2003," Mr. Moszkowski said. 
Alliance's shares have gained 18.7 percent this year. Some of its mutual funds have held large positions in troubled companies like Enron and Tyco International, but relatively few investors moved their assets out of Alliance's funds. 
Franklin Resources, known for its Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, also benefits from the inroads it is making among investors based overseas, particularly in India, Taiwan and South Korea.
Both Franklin Resources and Alliance Capital have strong networks of wholesale distributors who market the companies' equity and fixed-income management to brokers and financial advisers who sell the products to investors. 
Asset managers say that assets brought in through a middleman tend to stay in place longer than investments made by people dialing up a fund company on their own.
"We don't have any no-load funds for retail investors," said Martin L. Flanagan, a co-president at Franklin Resources. "And we think that's the right way to do business."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about investing in shares of asset management companies misstated the median price-to-earnings multiples for two groups of financial services stocks as of June 13. They were 21.2 for the asset management companies (not 21.2 percent) and 19.4 for brokers (not 19.4 percent).

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action: The Sequel 

BYLINE:  By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, is author of "The Ordeal of Integration," the first volume of a trilogy on race relations.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
No issue better reveals the American tension between principle and pragmatism than the debate over affirmative action. This week the Supreme Court is expected to enter the debate with a widely anticipated ruling on the University of Michigan's admissions policies, which favor black and other minority applicants. More important than the decision the court reaches will be the reasoning it uses.
 As pragmatic public policy, it is easy to show that the benefits of affirmative action far outweigh its social or individual costs. It ensures the integration of our best universities and thereby promotes (if indirectly) a heterogeneous professional elite. In conjunction with antidiscrimination laws, it has directly fostered the growth of an African-American and Latino middle class. 
 Corporate America has also embraced the policy, mostly by choice. As a result, minorities make up a large part of the middle and top ranks at many of the country's most recognizable firms. On Fortune magazine's latest list of the 50 best companies for minorities, for example, 24 percent of officials and managers are minorities. Affirmative action has transformed the American military, making it the most ethnically varied at all levels of its organization of all the world's great forces. And, along with changing ethnic and racial attitudes, affirmative action has helped promote a powerful global popular culture, many areas of which are dominated by minorities.
Negative achievements -- that is, what affirmative action has spared us -- are hard to prove. But it is surely reasonable to attribute the relative infrequency of ethnic or racial riots in America to the presence of minority leadership in many of the nation's mainstream institutions.
All these gains have been achieved at very little cost to America's economic or political efficiency: our economy dominates the world; our army is history's most awesome; our great universities have few equals; our arts, science and scholarship are the envy of the world.
There are indeed costs at the individual level, borne by those whites who may not have gained places or jobs as a result of preferences for minorities. But nearly all research indicates that these costs are minuscule. Repeated surveys indicate that no more than 7 percent of Americans of European heritage claim to have been adversely affected by affirmative action programs, and it has been shown that affirmative action reduces the chances of whites getting into top colleges by only 1.5 percentage points.
For all its achievements, however, many critics fear that affirmative action violates fundamental principles that have guided this country. It is indeed difficult to reconcile affirmative action with the nation's manifest ideals of individualism and merit-based competition. But America's history is replete with just such pragmatic fudging of these ideals.
In foreign policy the United States has defended dictators, destabilized democracies and invaded other countries in the pragmatic promotion of the national interest. Domestically, Congress regularly passes laws that favor special interests -- veterans, millionaire ranchers, farmers, oil-well owners, holders of patents about to expire, people with home mortgages -- many with no economic justification, all costing billions of tax dollars.
Why, then, the obsession with the principle of colorblindness, especially among right-wing activists who otherwise exhibit little enthusiasm for the equality principle enshrined in the Declaration of Independence? It is hard to resist the conclusion that principles are invoked in public life to rationalize the control of the vulnerable. In relations among equals, meanwhile, pragmatism trumps virtue.
Yet these critics miss a more compelling, and more subtle, argument against affirmative action. In spite of its benefits, there are serious problems in the long run for its beneficiaries if affirmative action is not decisively modified.
First, while diversity is a goal that deserves to be pursued in its own right, it was a major strategic error for African-American leaders to have advocated it as the main justification for affirmative action. In doing so, they greatly expanded the number of groups entitled to preferences -- including millions of immigrants whose claims on the nation pale in comparison to those who have been historically discriminated against. Such a development understandably alarmed many whites who were otherwise prepared to turn a pragmatic blind eye to their principled concerns about affirmative action.
Using diversity as a rationale for affirmative action also distorts the aims of affirmative action. The original, morally incontestable goal of the policy was the integration of African-Americans in all important areas of the public and private sectors from which they had been historically excluded. But if diversity is the goal, the purpose of affirmative action shifts from improving the condition of blacks to transforming America into a multicultural society. Thus the pursuit of inclusion is replaced by the celebration of separate identities.
In a more profound sense, the diversity rationale undermines a hopeful view of America. If the purpose of affirmative action is to redress past wrongs, then it requires both the minority and the majority to do the cultural work necessary to create what Martin Luther King Jr. called the "beloved community" of an integrated nation. Instead, many of its supporters see affirmative action as an entitlement, requiring little or no effort on the part of minorities.
Another consequence of this view is that it allows no recognition of the brute historical fact that the very patterns of social, educational and cultural adjustments that ensured survival, and even conferred nobility, under the extreme conditions of racist oppression no longer apply. In fact, now they may even be dysfunctional.
The gravest danger, however, and what perhaps alarms the majority most, is the tendency to view affirmative action as a permanent program for preferred minorities and, simultaneously, the refusal even to consider it a topic for public discourse. Indeed, among the black middle class, especially on the nation's campuses, blind support for affirmative action has become an essential signal of ethnic solidarity and commitment.
The nation needs this policy, but it must be modified. For starters, it should exclude all immigrants and be confined to African-Americans, Native Americans and most Latinos. It should include an economic means test. Only those who are poor or grew up in deprived neighborhoods should benefit. At the same time, poor whites from deprived neighborhoods should be phased into the program, a development that would counter the arguments of right-wing critics.
Finally, affirmative action should be severed from the goal of diversity -- which, as the legal scholar Peter Schuck has argued, is best left to the private sector. Middle-class blacks and Latinos would continue to benefit from such voluntary programs, properly understood as a sharing of diverse experiences and perspectives rather than a withdrawal into ethnic glorification. There is every reason to believe the nation's corporations and universities will continue to find such a policy to be in their own best interests, and the nation's.
Americans have always recognized that high ideals, however desirable, inevitably clash with reality, and that good public policy requires compromise. But only through the struggle of affirmative action are they coming to realize that such compromises, wisely pursued, can actually serve a higher principle: the supreme virtue of being fair to those who have been most unfairly treated.

Interest Rates? The Dollar? Test Your Reflexes

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
POSITIVE economic news, including upbeat reports on the regional economies in New York and Philadelphia, helped the dollar rally against the euro last week and sent Treasury yields sharply higher.
 Should investors take notice? Or are these just pauses in two long-running trends that will soon resume, with the dollar declining and interest rates falling again? 
 The response in the currency and Treasury markets to hints that the economy may be headed toward better times is a reminder that investors may need to shift their bets quickly. So pay attention. 
Because Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to cut their benchmark interest rate this week by at least a quarter-point, to 1 percent, it is easy to argue that both the dollar and Treasury yields will resume their declines.
But some analysts say the dollar's strong performance last week signals that its decline is near an end. That means that investors who have put money into European stocks could have their returns diminished by a rising dollar before year-end.
As for the bond market, the recent rate surge is a sure sign that yields will continue to be volatile as investors assess the outlook for economic growth and weigh the likelihood of rising inflation versus the threat of deflation.
Many analysts expect that rates will not move much higher soon. Even conservative forecasts, however, call for the yield on the 10-year note, now 3.36 percent, to rise to around 4 percent by the beginning of next year if the economy responds as expected to another Fed rate cut and the fiscal stimulus of the Bush administration's tax cut.
So investors should at least reassess their investments in Europe, where the rise of the euro and the fall of the dollar have generally been the best news for American investors the last 18 months. The dollar has bounced back recently: the euro is now worth $1.1605, versus $1.1909 on May 29.
"We think the dollar will bottom relatively soon," said Steve Englander, chief foreign exchange strategist for the Americas at Barclays Capital. His forecast has the dollar falling further as the euro rises to $1.25 the next three months. But then it shows the euro declining to $1.20 the next six months and moving even lower the following six months.
One reason for this turnaround is Barclays's prediction of a rebound in American economic growth to an annual rate of 3.5 to 4 percent. In addition, Barclays analysts expect that the European Central Bank, which reduced its benchmark rate a half-point, to 2 percent, two weeks ago, will have to cut rates much more to ensure an economic rebound in Europe. These reductions in European rates will make owning euros less attractive, helping the dollar.
On the fixed-income side, the question is this: How much further do bond prices have to fall and yields rise to make bonds less attractive than stocks? As the yield on the 10-year note shot up to 3.36 percent last week, from 3.11 percent, the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell sharply.
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic consulting firm, said an eventual sell-off in the Treasury market would be worse than anticipated. One reason, he argued, is that buying of United States Treasury securities by the Japanese central bank and Japanese investors has pushed American yields lower than is justified by current economic data or the outlook.
BY Mr. Weinberg's estimate, Japan's central bank bought about $40 billion, at current exchange rates, of United States Treasuries in April and May while Japanese investors bought $57 billion worth of foreign bonds in the same period, much of it in the Treasury market.
When this buying slows or reverses, he said, Treasury prices will fall and yields will rise faster than many people expect.
"This makes this a difficult time for investors," he said. "Investors still don't have the confidence to go back into stocks and are looking for safety in bonds. But that safety blanket is going to be taken away."

An Economic Indicator Sings, and Dances

BYLINE:  By C. J. Satterwhite; COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Economists may still be gloomy, or clueless, about the direction of the overall economy, but the leaders of one industry based in New York are as happy as children at a birthday party.
 "Broadway is fine," Anita Waxman said on Monday night at the Chelsea Piers, where she picked up a humanitarian award from a charity, Chabad's Children of Chernobyl. Ms. 
Waxman should know. She was a producer of "Gypsy" and "Flower Drum Song," among other shows. 
"Ticket sales are very good," she said. "There are not so many Europeans, but Americans are traveling. And they all want to see a Broadway show."
Ms. Waxman and her business partner, Elizabeth Williams, will try to oblige. In addition to several projects still in the we-can't-talk-about-it-yet stage, they plan to bring "Bombay Dreams" from London next spring and to revive "Marty" on Broadway, with John C. Reilly in the lead.
The charity, which provides shelter, education and medical care for Russian children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident, raised more than $1 million from the auction, including $26,000 for a three-year lease on a BMW S.U.V.
The crowd included the actors Ron Silver and Debra Winger and the talk-show host Montel Williams. Dr. Ruth Westheimer was also there, and when she was auctioned off as a dinner companion, she bounced up onstage and told the auctioneer, "Don't sell me cheap." She brought in $6,000. C. J.

Companies Say 'Profit' and the Market Rises

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Investors anticipating higher corporate profits and another cut in interest rates drove the three major stock market indexes higher last week. 
 The market rallied strongly on Monday, after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its factory index for June reached a record high, and stocks gained again on Tuesday. 
But the rally faltered on Wednesday, when Eastman Kodak and Clorox issued profit warnings. Then traders took profits on Thursday, pushing stocks still lower. 
 On Friday, upbeat profit forecasts by Pfizer, General Motors and General Electric helped raise prices. And some investors bought stocks on the expectation that the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, will cut its benchmark interest rate for the 13th time since January 2001.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 83.63 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 9,200.75. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.08 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 995.69. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,644.72.
 In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.36 percent from 3.11 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Lump-Sum Incentive For the Unemployed 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "How to Give Job Seekers a Tastier Carrot" (Economic View, June 8) suggested that unemployment benefits paid in a lump sum would motivate the unemployed more effectively than a system that ties payment to length of unemployment. 
 If handled properly, lump-sum payments could also respond to a broader concern in today's job market. As the column noted, unemployment benefits were created to ease the burden of temporary job loss in a manufacturing economy. Many states demand that beneficiaries continue to search for work, and some deny benefits if the unemployed person chooses to start his or her own business.
Today, many people will never find another job. If you are 50 to 65, your industry is dying or you have occupied a very senior, prominent position, you may be more likely to generate an income by starting a business than by pounding the pavement and sending out resumes. Yet our infrastructure of taxes, benefits, and even jury duty assumes that anyone who is motivated can get a job, that self-employment is a luxury for creative expression and that long-term unemployment is the fault of the job seeker.
We have a long way to go, but a lump-sum unemployment benefit, with no strings attached, would be a step in the right direction.

What We Don't Know About Obesity

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
TRIAL lawyers say there is a clear culprit in the obesity epidemic: a fast food industry that keeps plying Americans with calorie-laden, cheap meals and snacks. The food companies are as bad for Americans' health as the tobacco companies, they say, and the lawyers intend to litigate. A conference this weekend in Boston is examining legal approaches to fighting obesity.
 But there is just one problem. It was clear that persuading people not to smoke would go a long way toward getting rid of excess lung cancer and emphysema deaths and preventing huge numbers of people from suffering heart attacks and strokes. 
 With obesity, researchers say, it is not clear what causes it or what its effects are. Are people overweight because of fast food, large portion sizes, too little activity, calorie-packed foods, constant snacking? A combination? Something else entirely? Would slimming down make overweight people any healthier? At this point, the scientific evidence is not clear.
Yet few want to give up and accept the idea that this is a nation of obese people. 
In a campaign that resembles the antismoking crusades of an earlier era, the Washington Business Group on Health, an organization of 175 large employers that provides benefits for 40 million people, is starting an initiative to help its members lose weight 
Worried about the effects of obesity on health care costs and productivity, the umbrella organization is starting a new initiative, helping its member companies encourage their workers to lose weight. 
"We are all stunned as we listen to the statistics," said Helen Darling, the group's president. She pointed to studies concluding that obesity is now as much of a health problem as tobacco used to be, and as much of a drain on the economy.
Today, 35 percent of Americans are overweight, and 27 percent are obese. (Overweight -- a body mass index of 25 to 29 -- translates into a weight of 150 to 174 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman, for example, and 182 to 213 pounds for a 6-foot man. Obesity, a body mass index above 30, would mean weights above those levels.) The incidence of diabetes increased by 50 percent in the past 10 years. And half of all obese people are either diabetics or incipient diabetics.
"It's not about beauty or anything else," Ms. Darling said. "It's about avoiding disease."
If only it was so simple.
Dr. Reubin Andres, an obesity researcher at the National Institute on Aging, sighed. "As the sage of Baltimore, H. L. Mencken said, 'For every complex question there is a simple answer. And it's wrong.' "
In this case, the effort to help fat people help themselves has several implicit assumptions, researchers say. One is that all those overweight Americans would be healthier if they would just shed their excess pounds. "Here is what we know," said Dr. Gary Foster, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. "If you have diabetes and you lose weight, it is likely to get better and you will go on less medication." That is important, he stressed, because in addition to causing immense suffering, diabetes is expensive to treat and has expensive complications -- amputations, kidney failure, blindness.
But, he added, it is not yet known whether losing weight will help with other medical conditions: "Will it prevent or decrease the risk of heart attack or stroke or will you be less likely to be hospitalized? We don't know that yet."
It is true that blood pressure may go down slightly or that cholesterol levels may improve. But does that translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes, the so-called hard outcomes? After all, hormone therapy for menopause improved cholesterol levels but studies showed that women who took it ended up with more heart attacks and strokes. With weight loss, Dr. Foster said, "we don't know what happens to hard outcomes."
Then there is the thorny question of how to help people slim down. 
"The evidence is clear that people are aware of this problem and want to do something about it," said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher and co-director of the diabetes center at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He added that wanting to look good can be an even greater motivation than wanting to avoid chronic disease years down the line. Yet, the number of fat Americans has inexorably increased year after year. With weight loss, many people fight a losing battle. "If it were easy to do and there were good ways, people would have done it," Dr. Leibel said. 
Dr. Foster at the University of Pennsylvania said the statistics are disheartening. About a third of his patients, for example, regained their weight within a year of losing it. About two-thirds regained it within three years. And 80 to 90 percent regained it in five years.
Regardless, obesity experts say, efforts like the Washington Business Group's should not be discouraged. The group, for example, wants workplace cafeterias to offer low-calorie choices and to post nutrient levels and calorie counts for its foods. It wants stairways to be made more inviting so people will walk up a couple of flights rather than taking an elevator.
"We want to make the workplace itself supportive and empowering for those who are motivated," Ms. Darling said.
These efforts may help, Dr. Leibel said, but without knowing exactly why people are getting fatter, it is hard to say what will make them thinner.
"When you ask what's causing the obesity epidemic, we are like deer in headlights," he said. "It is clear that the environment has changed, but it is not clear exactly what aspects of the environment are responsible."

Short Men, Short Shrift. Are Drugs The Answer?

BYLINE:  By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
HAIL America, land of the speedy and home of the shaved, where the list of short things we love keeps getting longer. We love brief wars and abbreviated weapons, instant messaging and prescient gratification. A duchess said you can't be too trim; editors say the same about stories.
 But the one thing we don't like short and never have is our men. There is a harsh rule of thumb about male height, and it measures six feet and counting. As study after study has shown, tall men give nearly all the orders, win most elections, monopolize girls and monopolies, and disproportionately splay their elongated limbs across the cushy unconfines of first-class cabins. By the simple act of striding into a room, taller than average men are accorded a host of positive attributes having little or nothing to do with height: a high IQ, talent, competence, trustworthiness, even kindness. 
 And men who are considerably shorter than the average American guy height of 5-foot-9 1/2? These poor little fellows are at elevated risk of dropping out of school, drinking heavily, dating sparsely, getting sick or depressed. They have a lower chance of marrying or fathering children than do taller men, and their salaries tend to be as modest as their stature. If they are out striving to make their mark, they are derided as "Little Napoleons." Call them whatever you please, and chances are you won't get called on it, for making fun of short men is one of the last acceptable prejudices.
Small wonder, then, that an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration has just recommended that the agency approve the use of genetically engineered human growth hormone for healthy children who are "idiopathically" short -- that is, children who are at the bottom-most tail of growth curves, yet who, unlike a small subset of very short children, do not suffer from growth hormone deficiency. Children with innate hormone deficiency are given hormone shots to very noticeable effect: without the treatment, they would be true midgets, perhaps under four feet tall as adults; with the shots, they are brought up to low-normal heights.
Yet ever since the biotechnology business began synthesizing potentially limitless supplies of the drug 20 years ago, doctors have been using it in off-label fashion to treat children who for unknown reasons are quite short, maybe in the lowest three percentiles of their age group. The results have been what might be called whelming, in some cases adding as much as 3 1/2 inches to a person's projected final height, in others maybe no more than an inch and change. Still, the scientists on the advisory panel were persuaded enough by the hormone's relative safety and measurable if modest effects to recommend all-around treatment for the seriously subcompact among us.
Whether the F.D.A. takes the advice will not be known until later this summer, if even then. Yet already the moral trichotillomania has begun. Why are we so obsessed with height, particularly among men? Women, after all, often like to be called petite, though women in law, business and other high-powered professions who are below the female average height of 5-foot-5 claim that their diminutive stature makes it hard for them to be taken seriously.
ARE we really willing to subject our kids to buttock or thigh injections three to six times a week, year after year, just so that the local Dudley Dursley will taunt them about their big ears and good grades, rather than their stature? Aren't people like the Dutch, among the tallest populations on earth, with an average male height of over six feet, really the human equivalents of S.U.V.'s, barreling heedlessly along, sucking up more than their fair share of precious resources like oxygen? And who will pay for the treatments anyway, which can run $20,000 a year? 
"If the F.D.A. approves the drug for wider use, insurance companies won't have to pay for it, but it may be harder for them to say no," said John D. Lantos, associate director of the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago. "Then the cost of the treatment ends up being collectively subsidized, and we have to wonder, is this the best way to spend limited health care dollars?"
Can't we instead tell our short child, listen, Brunelleschi, the founding architect of the Italian Renaissance, was short, and ugly too; Picasso was only 5-foot-4 and Voltaire an inch beneath him; and one way to stand tall is to do stand-up?
"There's some interesting data that short men are overrepresented among comedians," said Henry B. Biller, a co-author of "Stature and Stigma: The Biopsychosocial Development of Short Males."
To which this 5-foot-3 1/2-inch woman can only sigh, Ha! The data in favor of lofty stature is too mountainous to ignore. For every extra inch of longitude, a man adds 2 percent to his yearly income. Maybe 60 percent of American chief executives are six feet or taller, and according to Nancy Etcoff of Harvard Medical School, author of "Survival of the Prettiest," only 3 percent are 5-foot-7 or shorter. American presidents are also big offenders, a tradition begun by George Washington, who at 6-foot-2 loomed by at least eight inches over most of his contemporaries; and since then, nearly half of our presidents have been of Dutchly dimensions. Famously, the taller of two presidential candidates nearly always wins the election. Carter beat the taller Ford in 1976, but couldn't dodge Reagan's three-inch advantage four years later.
Tall men certainly know the allure of their height. In the personals of a recent issue of New York magazine, for example, fully half of the men seeking women described themselves as tall. Women, by contrast, if they mentioned their height at all, tended to give an exact measurement, perhaps to discourage men below that mark from writing in. Dr. Etcoff notes that in one study of married couples, less than one-half of one percent of the women were taller than their husbands. 
Yet ultimately, height may be as much a matter of attitude as of altitude. In one recent study, Andrew Postlewaite, professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues Nicola Persico and Dan Silverman, determined that what really counts for a man's professional success in life, heightwise, is not his adult height, but the height he was in high school. 
"If you take two people who were 5-foot-6 in high school, and one grew to 5-foot-7 and the other to 6-foot-1," said Dr. Postlewaite, "there would be no predictive difference in their adult income." Whether that is because one's physique in those critical years of puberty sets the thermostat of self-confidence and swagger, or whether short teenagers, who tend to avoid sports and other group activities, fail to master the nuances of team spirit considered crucial throughout most of the business world, Dr. Postlewaite cannot yet say. "Clearly something happens in high school that has important long-term effects," he said.
Maybe you can't go home again, but with homeroom, you can never leave.

HEADLINE: New York's Rumpus Room 

BYLINE:  By WITOLD RYBCZYNSKI; Witold Rybczynski is the author of "A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the Nineteenth Century."

 BODY:
I CAN'T imagine Manhattan without Central Park. Without the park, meadows and lakes would be miles away, instead of just behind the Metropolitan Museum. Without the park, taxis couldn't take those east-west shortcuts that are like sudden short drives into the country. Columbus Circle would be simply a circle, like Piccadilly Circus, instead of an arc opening onto a generous green wood. I would never see the top of the Dakota sticking up out of the trees like a spooky Transylvanian castle. 
 Without the intervening park, the Upper East Side would blend into the Upper West Side -- unthinkable. Without its enchanted setting, Tavern on the Green would be just another tourist eatery, and the site of the Bethesda Fountain would be simply an ordinary street corner. New York City without Central Park would be like Chicago without the lake, San Francisco without hills or Los Angeles without sunshine. 
 I've always liked Napoleon's description of the Piazza San Marco in Venice as "the finest drawing room in Europe," a somewhat ingratiating remark since he had just conquered the city. A decorous Parisian park could be described as a sort of salon, with nothing more strenuous going on than a game of petanque; a London park is more like a comfortable living room, with people dozing in scattered deck chairs. Central Park is like neither; it's too informal to be a drawing room, and too sweaty and boisterous to be a living room. On any given day, you can see dog walkers and bird watchers, bicyclists and joggers, horseback riders and folk dancers, soccer and baseball teams, and yes, petanque players. Central Park is the city's outdoor rumpus room.
 Most urban parks reflect the style of their cities. Parisian parks and gardens exhibit a Gallic sense of good order and neat urbanity; London parks are casual and elegant, like London buildings and streets. Central Park, which officially got its start 150 years ago yesterday, when the proposal to create the park went to the New York State Senate, is different. The uniform Manhattan grid was laid out for the convenience of real-estate subdivision and traffic flow, just building lots and streets. No frills. Pragmatic, standardized, commercial, artless -- and largely treeless -- the grid represents an urbanism that only a surveyor could love. 
 The creators of Central Park turned their backs on this mercantile diagram. They made the park all loopy curves; even the streets crossing the park lose their straightness. Despite its matter-of-fact name, Central Park is romantic, nonstandardized, uncommercial, artful -- and full of trees. It is all frills.
 It was Edmund Burke who first coined the famous description of parks as "the lungs of the city," but Central Park is also New York's heart. Without Central Park, New York would risk becoming as callow and mercenary as many of its critics maintain it is. The park is part of New York's better nature. 
 Whenever I walk down Fifth Avenue next to the park, and I am not in a hurry, I get drawn in. I can't resist. Maybe it's all those shady trees, or the glimpse of sparkling water, or the sinuously curved path that disappears behind a clump of bushes. Before I know it, I am in another world. 
 It's easy to forget what a distinctly odd world it is. Generally, urban parks are conceived as large public gardens with gravel paths, flower beds and manicured lawns. Central Park is a swath of Adirondack landscape -- woodland, rocky outcroppings, lakes and all. 
 City and park meet at a simple, rugged stone wall. On one side of the wall, a sidewalk, women in frocks, traffic, and the bustle of the city; on the other, a dark, silent primeval forest. Jay Gatsby meets Natty Bumppo. The abruptness of the change -- from man-made to natural, from natural to man-made -- is so absolute, it almost takes my breath away. Even though I know that the park is as much an artifact as the surrounding city, like any work of art, it's what it makes you feel that's important.
 Above all, Central Park is horizontal, in the most vertical city in the world. The contrast is underlined by the looming cliff of skyscrapers that encloses the park like an architectural frame. The experience of any urban park is always the experience of temporary escape, but in Central Park the distant view of tall buildings is a constant reminder of the city. 
 Paradoxically, this heightens the experience of retreat and lends a particular zest to everyday, ordinary occurrences. That's why so many memorable movie scenes have been filmed in the park: romantic carriage rides, park-bench conversations, harrowing chases, echoing steps in a shadowy underpass. There is always that delicious and slightly unsettling sense of dislocation, of being in the city -- and not. A walk in Central Park always makes me feel that I'm playing hooky.
 THE bill that authorized the construction of the park followed three years of cantankerous public debate. It was not a straightforward decision -- this was New York City, after all -- since there were two competing sites. The affair was settled in the courts, and the "central" site prevailed. 
 The southern section of Central Park opened to the public in the winter of 1859, about two years after the competition for the design of the park was held. Can one imagine such speed today? Surely not. New Yorkers immediately took to skating on the frozen lake. In the summers they went boating in rented skiffs, and later cruised silently in electric launches, or lounged in one of several Venetian gondolas, listening to the singing boatmen. 
 The park had an elaborate system of bridle paths and carriage drives, an elm-lined mall for promenading, a ball ground for games, and a parade ground (today, the Sheep Meadow) for military exercises. There were rustic arbors and the Belvedere viewing platform, but the only building was a genteel watering hole, the Ladies' Refreshment Salon. In all, Central Park was a mannerly place, mirroring the high-minded ideals of William Cullen Bryant, an early advocate, who hoped that a park in New York would promote "good morals and good order."
 Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux are often praised for the farsighted vision of their design, but one thing that they did not anticipate was how popular Central Park would become. By 1865, before the park was complete, there were already more than seven million visits a year, at a time when the city's population was about half a million (today there are more than 20 million visits annually). 
 From its opening, and ever since, Central Park played catch-up, trying to adapt itself to the various demands of its voracious clientele. Vaux added a boathouse at the head of the lake, a dairy that served milk to children, and a spa pavilion that served mineral water to adults. The 1880's saw a welter of new outdoor activities in the park: roller-skating, bicycling, baseball. There was a craze for tennis, and more than a hundred grass courts were set up in the South Meadow. 
 Olmsted introduced free concerts to the park as early as 1859, and these proved so popular that an ornate bandstand was built beside the Mall. Nineteenth-century concerts were decorous affairs; people were not allowed to sit on the grass. For many years, parks commissioners, notably Robert Moses, who ruled from 1934 until 1960, had a strict notion of which recreational activities were appropriate, and that did not include large public gatherings. 
 Paradoxically, it was Moses who was responsible for creating the 90-acre Great Lawn on the site of the filled-in Lower Reservoir. The flat open area turned out to be the perfect place for outdoor concerts. In the summer of 1966, 75,000 people gathered on the Great Lawn to hear the New York Philharmonic, led by Leonard Bernstein, and the following year 135,000 people listened to Barbra Streisand. 
 It took sanitation workers three days to clean up the trash, raising the question, not for the last time, of whether the park should be open to mammoth crowds. Nevertheless, more concerts followed, culminating in the reunion of Simon and Garfunkel, who played to nearly half a million people in 1981. 
 Musical concerts have a long tradition in Central Park, so it is easy to forget that the park has also served as a place for mass demonstrations. This is a relatively recent development, for during the 19th century, political meetings were not allowed in the park. 
 That changed on Suffrage Day in 1914, when a group of suffragists marched down the Central Park Mall. "The crowd was as large as that drawn by a municipal band concert," marveled The New York Times. In the early 1930's, during the Depression, a group of unemployed homeless men built a so-called Hooverville on the site of the planned Great Lawn to protest federal policies; the 200 temporary shacks remained in place for two years. 
 What is still the largest recorded public gathering in Central Park's history took place in the Sheep Meadow on Oct. 27 -- Navy Day -- in 1945, when an estimated one million people listened to President Harry S. Truman give a foreign policy address. Photographs show an attentive crowd, seated on orderly rows of wooden folding chairs. 
 The 1960's included a variety of distinctly disorderly public events -- love-ins, be-ins, kite-ins. The park continued to be a magnet for political causes: rallies for and against the Vietnam War, protests against nuclear weapons and apartheid, celebrations of Gay Pride and Earth Day. Such events would have surprised Olmsted and Vaux, who imagined the park as a contemplative retreat, not a public forum. But each generation of New Yorkers has redefined the meaning of Central Park to suit itself: a place to promenade, a place to listen to Sousa, a place to demonstrate, a place to Rollerblade. Whatever.
 Central Park was conceived with a very specific function, but it has not been static. It is a historical place, but it is also a place with a history, a changing history. It took a long time before the park was open at night, for example. A hundred years ago letting automobiles use the carriage drives must have seemed like a good idea; today it feels, and sounds, like an imposition. 
 One day, no doubt, we will further restrict the use of cars, and not only on weekends. (One group, Car-Free Central Park, advocates barring cars permanently from East and West Drives.) But that does not mean that there is a "correct" way to use the park. Uses come and go, users jostle each other, sometimes the odd elbow is thrown. Central Park is often described as a democratic space, but it is really a democratic arena, where there is no fixed consensus, just a constant conversation whose tenor rises and falls with the times. 
 OLMSTED had foreseen that the time would come when Manhattan Island would be covered by "rows of monotonous straight streets, and piles of erect, angular buildings" and there would be "no suggestion left of its present varied surface, with the single exception of the Park." But I'm not sure if even he could imagine just how precious its 843 acres would be to a city grown unimaginably large and dense. 
 Mayor Bloomberg, in a rare burst of eloquence, recently described the park as "our picnic spot, our playground, our nature preserve, our band shell, our field of dreams." Not only dreams, memories. There's something about parks that makes people want to fill them with commemorative statues. It must be the tranquil surroundings -- I always think that if he were able, William Tecumseh Sherman would leap his horse over the yellow cabs that circle Grand Army Plaza, and find himself a quiet spot overlooking the Pond. 
 He would have plenty of company. There are now more than 50 fountains, monuments and sculptures in the park, though there is no memorial to Calvert Vaux, who deserves one, and Olmsted, who disliked flowers, is honored by, of all things, a flower bed. 
 The monuments are a decidedly odd mix. The men on plinths reflect the city's various ethnic groups (Simon Bolivar, Columbus, the Polish king Jagiello), celebrate famous artists (Beethoven), notable New Yorkers (Alexander Hamilton), largely forgotten New Yorkers (the newspaperman Arthur Brisbane) and adopted New Yorkers (John Lennon). There are hallowed authors like Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, and literary characters like Mother Goose. My favorite statue is Balto, the heroic Alaska sled dog, whose bronze surface is rubbed bright by the stroking of innumerable tiny hands. Balto is back in the news with the publication of "The Cruelest Miles" by Gay and Laney Salisbury (W.W. Norton), about the 1925 trek to icebound Nome with serum to stop a diphtheria epidemic.
 New York is a city relentlessly driven by change, with one eye always cocked on the future, the latest fashion, the next new thing. Yet Central Park looks obstinately backward. It is a repository of the past; other peoples' pasts (Cleopatra's Needle) as well as our own. Perhaps that's why the park, picnic spot and playground that it is, is also, at times, a sort of shrine. It is where New Yorkers go to remember, tocommemorate and to grieve. When George Harrison died, bouquets piled up in Strawberry Fields, which also serves as the site of an annual memorial for John Lennon. 
 The day after the attacks of Sept. 11, the Great Lawn was one of the important places people gathered spontaneously, simply to feel the warmth of each other's companionship on that mournful day. On the first anniversary of the attacks, the park was a major place where flickering candles marked an evening vigil. 
 No one is buried in Central Park, but those little brass plaques on the park benches that memorialize loved ones -- privately famous people, as opposed to the public variety -- have always seemed to me as moving as gravestones. Here they once sat, the plaques testify, doing not much of anything, taking a break, listening to the birds, reading a book, eating a sandwich, watching the children play, hearing the hum of traffic far away, daydreaming, convivially alone. In the park.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE RESERVISTS; 
Balancing Their Duty To Family and Nation

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
Brian Schofield says he had to choose between serving his country and saving his family's dry-cleaning business. His country won.
 Mr. Schofield, a master sergeant in the Minnesota Air National Guard, was called up three days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He has been on active duty ever since. His job, helping guard an Air Force base in St. Paul, took him away from home for so long, he said, that he and his wife could no longer run the dry-cleaning store they owned. 
 "It came to the point where the war against terrorism had to take precedence," said Mr. Schofield, who had often worked 12-hour days with his wife at their store in Fairmont, in southwestern Minnesota. Though he tried to help on weekends, the strain was too great. So he and his wife sold the store, and have since seen their income cut by more than half. 
"It's been hard, but I don't regret it in the least," he said. "My nation needed me, and that's the least I could do."
More than 212,000 military reservists and National Guard members have been mobilized for war abroad and the battle against terrorism at home, with many spending more than a year away from their families and livelihoods. The resulting burden has been as much financial as emotional for many families, as onetime weekend warriors see their incomes shrink and businesses dry up.
In some cases, particularly when employers pick up the financial slack, the burden has been relatively minor. But many other families feel squeezed and some feel pushed to the economic breaking point, with reactions running from cutting back on cable television to selling one of the family cars. 
Many reservists with high incomes, like doctors and executives, have taken a 50 percent pay cut while mobilized. The self-employed have been hit especially hard, often having no one to run their businesses for months at a time. 
The squeeze has been felt especially hard in Minnesota because of the troubles that have beset Northwest Airlines and many other companies.
Janine Mickey's husband, Robert, a mechanic in the Air National Guard, was ordered to Kuwait three months ago to service cargo planes for the war in Iraq. It was his second call to active duty in less than a year. Although her overriding concern has been for his safety, Ms. Mickey now finds herself with some other big worries. 
Her husband's income plunged to $3,000 a month from the $6,000 he had been making as a mechanic at Northwest Airlines. Then came an even sharper blow -- while in Kuwait, he learned that Northwest would be laying him off.
At first, Ms. Mickey spent her days caring for their 5-year-old son, Shane, and working on a committee giving solace and support to Minnesota's 400 National Guard families with members overseas. But she recently took a full-time job as a mortgage processor to make ends meet.
"These families have been totally in support of the war effort," Ms. Mickey said, "but some of the employers just haven't been very helpful at all." 
Scott Sheard, a car salesman for a Ford-Mitsubishi dealership in LaCrosse, Wis., was called up in November 2001, two months after the terrorist attacks, to serve as a staff sergeant in the Minnesota Air National Guard. He has been on active duty ever since.
The prolonged call-up has devastated his civilian career, Mr. Sheard said, because his success as a car salesman depends on building loyal customers.
"If I go back now, it would be starting from scratch," he said.
Mr. Sheard, who has taken a $1,500-a-month pay cut while mobilized, said he recently decided to join the Army full time because of his desire to serve his nation and because of the damage the call-up has done to his career.
"In the field we're in -- security -- with the current world situation, we're likely to be called up again for an unknown period of time," he said. "Basically, I saw this was going to control my life. I'm happy to do whatever I can for my country."
One survey found that 41 percent of reservists took a cut in pay while on active duty. At the same time, many reservists' families are experiencing scant financial hardship because some companies, like I.B.M. and J. P. Morgan Chase, make up the difference when their employees' base salary is higher than their military pay.
There are 1.22 million Americans in the Reserves and National Guard. The one-sixth who are now mobilized have myriad responsibilities, among them flying cargo planes in Iraq, doing intelligence work in Afghanistan and guarding air bases and train stations in this country.
A 1994 federal law prohibits employers from discriminating against employees because of their participation in the Reserves or National Guard. The law requires employers to reinstate returning reservists to a comparable position with the same status, pay and seniority. Annualized pay ranges from $15,480 for a mobilized army private to $48,840 for a captain and $78,768 for a colonel.
But that law could not save Mr. Mickey, who was part of a layoff of 4,900 Northwest workers. Not only is he unable to look for work while overseas, but his family already suffered financially last year when he was mobilized for four months.
"Everyone knows you don't go to the military to get rich," Mr. Mickey wrote from Kuwait in an interview by e-mail. "My family has felt a change in the quality of life mainly because this is the second time in a year that I've been called up to serve. No complaints about serving, though."
Dr. James Schlimmer, an anesthesiologist from Mason City, Iowa, saw his income drop by 65 percent after he was called up in March and sent to Bulgaria to serve as an Air Force surgeon in support of American troops in Iraq.
"I had to dip into savings to make payments on the obligations I had -- on my mortgages and a loan on a car," he said.
Some reservists, on the other hand, are feeling no financial pain because their companies go beyond the requirements of the law to compensate them. For its 136 employees on active duty, I.B.M. provides health insurance as well as the difference between military pay and an employee's pay. Target, based in Minneapolis, is also making up the difference in pay for its workers.
Yvette Schue said her family's finances remained in good shape even though her husband, an executive at Target, was sent to Oman in March as a member of the Minnesota Air National Guard. 
"It hasn't been bad for us financially," Ms. Schue said. "Target has made it a lot easier. But there are a lot of other families who have to struggle."
The Pentagon has urged companies to go beyond the requirements of the law. 
"We're asking employers to show support for the troops," said Michael H. Lovitt, marketing director of the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, an arm of the Defense Department. "There are a number of companies stepping up and doing more than what's required by law because they want to share in the sacrifice and they want to be seen as sharing in the sacrifice. They want to do things that put service members' minds at ease."
West, a publisher of law-related materials, provides health insurance for its eight employees on active duty. The company, based in a Minneapolis suburb, also covers the difference between their base military pay and what they earned as civilians.
"We feel it's the least we can do to help them," said Thomas Moran, West's senior vice president for human resources. "The amount of good will from this is just phenomenal."
In today's sour economy, not all companies can afford such largess. Among those that cannot is Northwest, which, like many airlines, is suffering from a drop in passengers and profits. With Northwest making layoffs according to seniority, as required by union contracts, Mr. Mickey was laid off because he had been employed just six years. 
"I was in a way crushed, but in a way I expected it," he wrote by e-mail. "I don't think I was penalized for being in the National Guard."
Mr. Mickey estimates he lost more than $12,000 last year when he was called up. This year, his wife started cutting costs as soon as he was activated. She cut off premium cable, insurance on their 1989 Buick and swimming lessons for their son. With Ms. Mickey working full time, they now pay $800 a month for day care. 
"I'm trying not to think about not having a job when I get back," Mr. Mickey wrote.

HEADLINE: Small Investors, Once Burned, Lead New Bull 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Internet stocks are racing, even those with more promise than profits. Unsolicited pitches for obscure penny stocks inch out of fax machines, and stockbrokers are prospecting for customers. Mutual fund managers who have been in the doghouse for years are basking once again in the favorable publicity that shines on hot performers. 
 There is no denying it: the bull is back. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 13 percent this year, while the Nasdaq composite is up 23 percent. Individual investors are leading the charge back into the stock market, according to some brokerage firm executives who look closely at trading behavior. 
 "What we're seeing is the retail investor has been getting back into the market since the last couple weeks of March in a pretty broad manner," said R. Jarrett Lilien, the president and chief operating officer of the E*Trade Group, an online financial services business, who added that he was surprised by the shift. "There was a big question: When will broad-based retail come back to this market? All of us thought it would take years of healing time." 
Instead, investors appear to be returning to equities with their wounds barely healed. Three years of stock market torment seem not to have shaken the long-held view that stocks are best for the long haul.
Lyle E. Greenman, 55, a lawyer in Boston, has recently taken a much more active position in the stock market for the first time since the collapse of 2000. "I was one of those people who got caught up in the bubble -- I lost my shirt, boxers and briefs, all of it," he said in a telephone interview last week. "I've tried to use these last few years to figure out what I did wrong."
Mr. Greenman said he thought that individual investors -- and he includes himself in this group -- had learned a great deal since the stock bubble burst and were alert for hype and for advisers with conflicts of interest. "I think the public is a lot wiser about what the investment banks were up to in the 90's," he said. "The public is much more Internet savvy than they were a few years ago. They know people go on CNBC because they need people to sell their winners to. People are sensitive to what they should look for or not."
But to some Wall Street veterans, the market's recent action has a familiar and troubling feel, one that harks back to heady days of 1999. In their zeal to recover some of the losses in their portfolios, have investors become too willing to forgive and forget the lessons of the torturous bear market?
"The rally makes me nervous," said Jonathan H. Cohen, a portfolio manager at JHC Capital in Greenwich, Conn., and former head of Internet strategy at Merrill Lynch. "The Nasdaq is now up almost 25 percent, which is way ahead of the fundamentals. Sure, the market looks into the future and tries to discern the state of the world next year, but I'm not sure we've seen any meaningful indication that technology companies are doing better than they were six months ago. It's just that they're not doing worse."
Portfolio managers point to several pockets in the market where stocks are behaving a lot as they did in 1999. For example, the most speculative securities -- like biotechnology stocks, Chinese Internet shares and low-priced stocks -- are among the hottest today. Sohu.com Inc., the operator of an Internet portal in China, has risen more than 300 percent in 2003 and has jumped to $27.83 a share from $1.15 in the last 12 months. The Sina Corporation, an Internet company that operates Chinese-language Web sites, is up 160 percent in 2003 and has risen 900 percent in the last 12 months. 
Biotechnology stocks, by their nature another high-risk group, are also up smartly. The American Stock Exchange's biotechnology index has gained 33 percent so far this year. And in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks are soaring, in spite of little change in consumer demand for computers. According to a recent analysis by Fred Hickey, the editor of The High-Tech Strategist, an investment newsletter based in Nashua, N.H., only one of the 17 stocks in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor index had a price-to-earnings ratio below 40.
"I can almost understand why people were dopey about this stuff in the mania," said William Fleckenstein, the president of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle. "Nothing had gone wrong. Everything was coming up roses. But now we know things can go wrong; we have seen Enron and WorldCom; we know most states and local municipalities are bust; and there are lots of problems. To act the same way you did then?"
The stock market is famous, of course, for spotting economic rebounds before the data confirm it and for shaking off bad news when it is in the mood to rally. But in the last three years, the market has made several leaps that some professional investors saw as evidence of a new bull run. All turned out to have been false starts or so-called suckers' rallies. 
To some professional investors, the return of the individual to the stock market is a warning sign all its own. Traditional market lore states that individual investors are not shrewd enough to know when to buy and that when they swarm into stocks professional investors often sell.
But amateurs are not the only ones who are bullish. The most recent Investors Intelligence survey shows that 60.2 percent of investment newsletter writers are bullish, while 16.1 percent are negative. That is the lowest bearish reading since before the crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
The fact that the S.& P. 500 is trading at about 19 times the earnings that analysts expect from its companies in 2003 represents a decidedly optimistic view by many investors. As stock market veterans have often pointed out, bull markets do not typically begin when the index is trading at such a hopeful level.
In the most recent week, investors put $3.3 billion, net of the money they withdrew, into domestic stock mutual funds, according to data from Banc of America Securities. That was the 14th consecutive week that more money flowed into than out of stock funds, the investment bank said.
With so much bullishness about, companies are finding it easier to raise money in the stock market. On June 11, FormFactor Inc., a semiconductor maker, raised $84 million in an initial public offering of its stock, the first by a technology company this year. It had originally hoped to raise about $60 million. Interest in the deal was strong, and the company increased both its price and the number of shares offered. The stock rose 50 percent during its first day of trading, but settled back for a gain of almost 26 percent from its offering price.
Of course, for a hot new stock to close 26 percent higher on its first day out is nowhere near the delirium during the stock market mania of 1999. Then, according to research done by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, new stocks rose on average 60 percent the day they started trading. Roughly a third of the Internet companies issuing shares in 1999 paid more in investment banking fees than they booked in revenue during the previous 12 months. 
But FormFactor's first-day move was not shabby, especially when compared with typical first-day moves before the mania. From 1986 through 1994, Bernstein calculated, the average first-day move in an initial offering was about 10 percent. 
While speculative fervor has returned to some areas of the market, certain firms say that the increased interest they are seeing from individual investors is tempered. "From an equity standpoint, we are seeing clients dip their toes into the water. They are not jumping in, not diving in," said Jamie Wanless, the director of retail operations at Strong Investments, a mutual fund company in Milwaukee with $45 billion under management. 
Mr. Wanless said that investor interest had picked up at his firm in the last three to four weeks. One measure is a rebound in client calls; in January, client calls were down 30 percent from January 2002. Now, the calls are down only 5 percent to 10 percent from a year ago. "As we talk to our clients, there are those who know they should have been doing something about their investments but were paralyzed with fear. And they are taking action now." 
Even as investors begin to embrace more risk in their portfolios, almost no one expects a return to the anything-goes mentality that ruled during the bubble. For one thing, securities regulators have put some constraints on Wall Street firms, leading to fewer outlandish analyst recommendations. Another change: as of last Friday no brokerage firm had published a report recommending that investors buy FormFactor. During the mania, such reports would have been ubiquitous by now.
Analysts are much less enthusiastic now over all than they were three years ago. According to Zacks Investment Research, 71 percent of analysts' recommendations were buys or strong buys in 2000; today only 43 percent are. And three years ago, fewer than 1 percent of recommendations were sells or strong sells; now almost 11 percent fall into those categories. The remainder were neutral.
Warily, and a good bit wiser to the way Wall Street works, individual investors seem to be coming back to stocks. Mr. Greenman, the investor, said he has seen more people going into the brokerage office where he trades, and they seem to be asking questions about setting up accounts. 
"I don't think you need to caution the people like me who just got creamed," he said. "But a few people missed the whole bubble and now they think they're getting in on the next one."

HEADLINE: Trying to Stay Put in Florida Mobile Homes 

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: MARATHON, Fla. 

 BODY:
To Karen Melnick, the Gulfstream Trailer Park here is a tidy community of narrow streets and close ties, where she pays less than $500 a month rent and neighbors gather at a tiki hut to watch the sun set over the bay. 
 To developers in this Florida Keys city, where land is scarce, the park is a potential platform for 83 luxury apartments worth $300,000 to $1 million each. 
 So begins the battle for Gulfstream Trailer Park, as do fights for many older mobile home parks on prime real estate throughout the state. 
There are 849,000 mobile homes in Florida, the 2000 census reported, or 12 percent of the state's housing units. As the price of real estate in Florida has shot up, and suburban sprawl has reached its limits in some areas, many developers are looking at the ground beneath trailer parks as an underused resource. 
That trend has Ms. Melnick and her neighbors fighting for their homes. 
In February, she said, the park's owners announced that they had accepted an offer to sell the property. "They're telling us, when the developers take over you have to go away," said Ms. Melnick, 53, who sells advertising space for three local radio stations. "This is where I thought I'd live the rest of my life. Where can you go for $425 plus utilities? We've got nowhere to go."
Trailer parks containing a total of 3,000 homes closed in the last three years, said Don Hazelton, president of the Federation of Manufactured Home Owners of Florida, a tenants' group that has 56,000 members. In Mr. Hazelton's own hometown, Largo, the residents of 12 parks are facing eviction, he said. 
To live in a trailer park like Gulfstream, one of more than 2,600 in Florida, is to occupy a precarious niche in the housing system. Residents at Gulfstream own their homes, which cost $10,000 to $40,000, but rent the land. Most homes are mobile in name only, too old or anchored to survive a move. As the value of real estate skyrocketed through the 1990's, park owners found they could make more redeveloping the land for houses or condominiums or selling to redevelopers.
"I can sympathize with the park owners," said Robert Cintron, a lawyer representing the tenants of Gulfstream. "They're getting below-market rent." 
At the same time, said Joshua Mothner, a commercial loan officer in Marathon, without trailer parks the Keys' essential work force -- the teachers and police officers, hotel workers and bank tellers -- could not afford to live there. The price of houses in the area begins at around $300,000, apartment rentals at about $1,000 a month.
"I grew up on Shelter Island and saw this happen in the Hamptons," Mr. Mothner said, referring to the Long Island communities. "You lose whole strata of the population." Some workers already have two-hour bus rides to the area, often to jobs paying $7 an hour, said Jeff Pinkus, a Marathon councilman. 
Recently, Mr. Cintron stood on an empty lot on Route 1, the highway running the length of the Keys. Until last summer, the lot had been a 45-unit mobile home park called Coral Isle. Now an attractive sign at one end advertises "Key West's Newest Gated Community," with two- and three-bedroom apartments selling for just over $300,000 to $450,000.
When the park owners sold the property to a redeveloper, only two of the homes could be moved; the others were left like litter. 
"We all scattered," said David Ray, 48, a carpenter who left his 14-by-60-foot mobile home behind, and is now renting a trailer nearby. To move his home would have cost $18,000 to $20,000, he said. 
When owners decide to sell or redevelop a mobile home park, tenants have few legal protections. If they have formed a homeowners' association and registered with the state, they have the right to match the highest offer from a prospective buyer. Owners often prefer to sell to a well-financed developer. If tenants cannot buy the property, they may be eligible for a relocation payment of up to $6,000, depending on the size of their trailers and whether they can be moved. After an eviction notice, residents have six months to move.
At Gulfstream, Mr. Cintron said, the owners, Frank and Roseanne Mauro, announced that they had sold the park, not giving residents a chance to match the offer. On behalf of the tenants, Mr. Cintron sued to block the sale before it could be finalized, citing the rights of a homeowners' association. Tenants say they believe the sale price was $4 million to $4.6 million. 
Mr. Mauro refused to be interviewed for this article. His lawyer, William N. DeVane, did not respond to phone calls. The buyers, Southstar of Tampa, said through their lawyer, Douglas M. Halsey, that they would not comment. 
At Gulfstream, residents leave their doors unlocked and spend hot afternoons in a community pool. Recently, Dee Villa-Louis, 47, showed off her home, a single-wide with a sunroom added on, and one of the park's popular curiosities, her whirlpool tub. Ms. Villa-Louis and her husband, Patrick Louis, who are retired, moved to the park from Colorado last year and settled quickly into the swing of Keys life. 
"This is my grape room," she said, passing through a small room painted in a bold purple, "and this is my green room." When she bought her home and another nearby for her parents, she said, she had no warning that the land might be sold. Neither of her trailers can be moved. If the sale goes through, she said, her $30,000 investment will be worthless. 
"We'll be O.K.," she said, "but what's going to happen to our neighbors? A lot of the older people here are on fixed incomes. They don't want to change."
A neighbor, Donna King, said her fortunes had already been affected by the prospect of redevelopment. Miss King, 48, is a flight attendant for US Airways who has lived at Gulfstream for seven years, she said. When US Airways declared bankruptcy last year, Miss King made plans to move to Charlotte, N.C.
Miss King paid $8,000 for her one-bedroom mobile home here and estimates that she put another $4,000 into fixing it up. In a competitive market, she said, she could easily sell it for $15,000. But since word circulated that Gulfstream might be destined for the bulldozer, no one is interested in buying there. 
"I don't see how you can tell someone your house is now worthless," Miss King said. 
Under present law, homeowners and buyers often have no way of knowing whether a park might come up for sale or redevelopment, said Frank Williams, executive director of the Florida Manufactured Housing Association, a trade group that represents park owners, manufacturers and dealers. "How a consumer can deduce these things, I don't know," Mr. Williams said. 
Most of the parks being redeveloped, he said, were built more than 30 years ago. "The economics no longer work" for park owners, he said. If buyers see an old community suddenly being surrounded by supermarkets and upscale developments, Mr. Williams said, "a light bulb should go off," adding, "But if they're moving into a modern retirement community, the chances of change are almost nil."
There are no official statistics on park age. Al Hesselbart, a historian of manufactured housing and recreational vehicles, estimates that about half of Florida's mobile home parks are more than 30 years old. He added that many of them would not be candidates for redevelopment. 
Larry Shaffer, 52, a retired Navy chief warrant officer, moved to Gulfstream in 1997, when his previous trailer park, near Tampa, was closed to make room for a Home Depot. His single-wide trailer is filled with computers, supporting the Internet publishing company that has been his avocation since retirement. After spending most of his adult life in ship staterooms, the trailer seemed spacious, he said. 
When the Mauros announced in February that they were selling the park, Mr. Shaffer and others began meeting in the home of Emil Kuhn, a retired veterinarian who has spent winters in the park since 1986. Though they did not have an active homeowners association, they found documents they say show that a homeowners organization had incorporated in 1982 and never disbanded.
Mr. Shaffer said the residents would have no trouble raising the money to buy the park -- roughly $50,000 per homeowner -- and that mortgage and maintenance payments would not be much more than their current rents. The residents of a nearby trailer park, Lion's Lair, recently brought a successful suit to buy their property. 
Even if the Gulfstream tenants' suit is successful, it will do little to ease the crunch for affordable housing in the Keys, said Debbie Love, president of the Middle Keys Community Land Trust, a nonprofit group formed to create and preserve affordable housing. Changes in state regulations have made it easier and cheaper for owners to evict tenants and redevelop trailer parks. 
But she said public sentiment was starting to shift. Mr. Shaffer, motivated by his experience at Gulfstream, said he was resigning from the homeowners' board to run for city council, saying he wants to protect other parks. "I've been alone in the woods crying about this for years," Ms. Love said. "All of the sudden a light has switched on."

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Urges All Sides In Mideast to Press for Peace 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: SHUNEH, Jordan, June 21 

 BODY:
With continued violence between Palestinians and Israelis threatening Washington's latest drive for peace, King Abdullah of Jordan appealed today to international negotiators to "stay the course." The alternative, he said, "is that this region will slide back downhill."
 "At no other time has there been so much despair and so much hope, so much misery and yet so much promise, such risk and such opportunity," the king said as he opened an unusual session here of the World Economic Forum. The gathering of business and political leaders from around the globe is normally held in the Swiss Alps. 
 His remarks reflected the concern of many in the region that this newest Middle East peace effort will go the way of many others unless the main players and their backers show new resolve.
"The road map must be implemented, and this will require more than words," the king said in what seemed an appeal for the United States and its "quartet" partners, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, to maintain the intensity of peace diplomacy. "Friends of peace must stay the course," the king said.
He made his appeal in a symbolic setting on the shores of the Dead Sea -- the world's lowest point -- across from the West Bank and Israel and close to the site where John the Baptist is said to have baptized Jesus. 
"There must be no more missed opportunities," the king said. "It is time to listen to the prayers and dreams of those who live in and love the Holy Land."
King Abdullah spoke after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is staying at one of the resorts where the conference is being held, hopscotched the region on Friday. Mr. Powell continues his travels on Sunday to meet with representatives of the quartet supporting the peace proposals. Since President Bush presented his "road map" proposals to Israelis and Palestinians in Aqaba, Jordan, three weeks ago, the region has been struck again by violence from both sides.
King Abdullah blamed "extremists" who sought to push the diplomacy back to "the old peace" for the killing. But most people in the region, he said, wanted only to do their jobs and send their children to school. "People are crying out for a normal life," he said.
While the gathering here of some 1,200 participants has no formal status, it is providing an unusual platform, not only for discussions of Israeli-Palestinian issues but also for those involving lands from Iraq to Afghanistan now deeply entwined with American plans to reshape the region.
The high profile of the Americans drew barbs today from several Arab figures, including Ibrahim Helal, the editor of Al Jazeera, the satellite television network. At one session he compared the American occupation of Iraq to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.
"What we can see in Baghdad is that 85 percent of Iraqis do not believe in the American administrator," Mr. Helal said. But he added, "Criticizing the Americans does not mean we are in favor of the regime of Saddam Hussein."
Mr. Helal's audience included some Americans involved in the administration of Iraq.
Some critics in the audience accused Washington of seeking to divert Iraqi oil through its occupation without accounting for it.
But John B. Taylor, the undersecretary of the Treasury, said "every drop of oil" would be accounted for.
The gathering here is set to last until Monday, with participants including Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, and Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations.
American business and government representatives encountered criticism when the conference opened today, particularly from Arab leaders who said they felt unsettled by Washington's maneuvers in the region. "We feel, all of us in the Middle East, insecure," said Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League.
Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the foreign minister of Qatar, an important ally of Washington, said the Americans "know what they want -- maybe we don't know what they want."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: PROSPECTS; 
Overseer Says Iraq Economy Is Beginning To Recover

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SHUNEH, Jordan, June 21 

 BODY:
L. Paul Bremer III, who was installed five weeks ago as Washington's chief administrator in Iraq, came to the World Economic Forum this weekend with a message of guarded optimism about the country's prospects. He asserted that Iraq would soon resume oil exports and begin establishing an economy based on private enterprise. 
 Speaking to reporters today ahead of an address he will give to the forum on Sunday, Mr. Bremer sought to counter the image of an Iraq that is sliding into chaos, with rising attacks on American troops and frustration over the inability to find Saddam Hussein or unconventional weapons. 
 Mr. Bremer said Iraq had already "come a long way" in establishing law and order. Instead of fires burning in Baghdad, streets empty of traffic and constant gunfire, he said, 1,200 security patrols occur every 24 hours in the city, accompanied by several hundred Iraqi policemen.
As for the economy, he said his interim administration had begun paying pensions and financing emergency construction projects. "This is at least the beginning," he said.
The priority, Mr. Bremer said, is to shift resources from the state industries to the private sector. But shutting down money-losing state industries -- or keeping ones shut that have stopped functioning because of the war -- poses a problem for the United States.
Iraqis will have to choose, he said, which of the "several score" state enterprises that run the country's economy -- from oil to food to supplying commodities -- could become profitable, and which would be hard to shut because of the hardship for their employees.
Whatever happens, he said, employees cannot suddenly be thrown out of their jobs without some sort of safety net. He is soliciting Iraqi experts to make decisions like these. 
As for the budget for Iraq, Mr. Bremer was circumspect, saying oil revenues, seized assets and aid would help the government meet expenses this year. Most of the revenue will come from a forecast $5.5 billion in oil exports over the next six months.
But he declined to estimate the budget for next year. "How would you actually get that?" he asked. Only this week, he said, Iraq's ministries were asked to submit budget figures for perusal by his staff.
Mr. Bremer also met today with a dozen Senate and House members, and afterward Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Mr. Bremer's projections were unrealistic.
"People are telling him, you have to level with us on the numbers," Mr. Biden said, recounting what members of Congress were telling Mr. Bremer. He said the administration had been trying to underestimate the cost of the Iraqi reconstruction so as not to alarm Congress and send the federal budget further into deficit.
Mr. Bremer said work on setting up a political council of Iraqi advisers in coming weeks was proceeding, and he dismissed complaints from some Iraqi exiles that the administration had abandoned its idea for establishing an early interim authority in Iraqi hands.
A sovereign Iraqi government cannot be established until after elections, he said, and elections cannot occur until after a constitution is written and ratified by a constitutional conference. Both processes are under way, he said.
The process of removing Baath Party members from government is proceeding but will have to be carried out with the help of the Iraqis themselves. Still, sweeps of suspected Baathists in recent weeks have resulted in several hundred members being detained.
Mr. Bremer said a special council working with Iraqis would determine which of the several million party members would be disqualified from serving in the government. He estimated that its decisions would involve no more than 30,000 Iraqis.
"A lot of these are questions that I think properly belong with the Iraqi people," he said, adding that the Iraqis might also want to set up "some sort of reconciliation process" in which some supporters of Saddam Hussein were welcomed back into Iraqi society.
Mr. Bremer seemed to have little patience with the exile groups, including the Iraqi National Congress led by Ahmed Chalabi, that have openly complained about American delays in setting up a government made up of Iraqis. Without mentioning any names, he said of those groups, "You are going to have to broaden yourself to bring in a more balanced representation of this country," adding, "They were not able to do that."

HEADLINE: Experts See Initial Impact Of Rent Law As Minimal 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
A day after tenant groups were outmaneuvered in a last-minute battle over rent regulations in Albany, some housing experts predicted yesterday that the new law would have little immediate effect on the apartment market in New York City.
 The significance of the law, the experts said, is its extension of a six-year-old rule that allows landlords to charge market prices for the most expensive regulated units after they are vacated. 
 Tenant groups had lobbied aggressively to weaken the rule, contending that over time it would spell the end of the system of rent regulation, which has lasted for decades. Landlords countered that the threshold was so high, allowing decontrol only of vacated apartments renting for at least $2,000 a month, that the people who could afford such prices did not deserve legal protections. 
In the end, the Republican majority in the State Senate, which has traditionally been allied with landlords, pushed through a measure in the final hours of the legislative session that largely kept the 1997 rule intact, and then adjourned for the summer. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, supported the move.
Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, who had wanted to increase the threshold or do away with it, at the behest of tenant groups, felt they had no choice but to approve the Senate measure because all rent regulations would have otherwise expired.
"This won't have a major impact on tenants, beyond the impact that the 1997 law has already had," said Prof. Michael H. Schill, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. "What you are going to see over time is that more apartments upon vacancy will rent for more than $2,000 and therefore will be deregulated. But that is not a major change."
It is to some extent an indication of how the political landscape has evolved that the outcome was perceived as a victory for landlords even though they did not succeed in getting lawmakers to adopt new provisions that erode rent regulations. In 1997, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called for virtually abolishing all rent regulations, touching off a spirited months-long battle in Albany before he capitulated, gaining only the decontrol provisions.
This year, Mr. Bruno, seemingly scarred by the earlier fight, sought only to defend those provisions, with a few small exceptions. He was able to add a clause that seems to limit the power of the City Council, which has been friendly to tenants, to wield influence over the rent regulations.
There are more than one million rent-regulated apartments in New York State, the vast majority of them in the city, and Democratic lawmakers and tenant groups have asserted that the Senate legislation would lead to the deregulation of more than 300,000 apartments over the next decade.
But Professor Schill and other housing analysts questioned that figure, saying it was most likely too high. Still, they acknowledged that given the complexity of the city's housing market, it is extremely difficult to assess the effect of these regulations over time.
The experts also noted that the debate over the future of the system largely affects Manhattan apartments. In the other boroughs, regulated prices on apartments are often at the same level or higher than the market price.
The new law extends the rent regulations for eight years, which is longer than previous ones did. Tenant groups described that as a defeat, saying that it is all but impossible to reopen the debate on the luxury-decontrol provisions in the Legislature if the law is not about to expire.
But some housing experts said they were pleased that there would be a lengthy period without rent squabbles. They said that whenever the law expires, anxiety rises among tenants and Albany cannot focus on other housing issues, including finding ways of building more apartments for the poor.
"I think that this is going to be portrayed as a victory for landlords," said Frank Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a policy research group in Manhattan. "But it seems to me that eight more years of rent stabilization for the vast majority of tenants, without having to worry about all this last-minute brinkmanship, is a good thing."

HEADLINE: For Europe, Messages Differ on Size and State of the Union 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI and ANTHEE CARASSAVA

DATELINE: PORTO CARRAS, Greece, June 21 

 BODY:
Maybe the European Union should embrace not only Croatia and Bosnia but also Russia, its reach ever broader, its heft ever greater.
 Maybe it should stop where it is, with a planned membership of 25 nations by next May, leaving a geographic hole in the Balkans and an eastern border well short of Moscow. 
 Maybe the European Union should have its own formidable defense force, a global counterbalance to the military might of the United States.
Maybe it should confine itself to economic matters, because the rest is just too messy. 
As European leaders gathered here over the last two days for a special summit meeting devoted to drafting a first constitution for the union, all of those visions were on display, jostling for attention, along with many more.
The leaders' talks confirmed what months of debates about the constitution had already suggested and what, really, almost all discussions of the expanding and diversifying union make clear.
It is not just a trading bloc, and it is not just a project in the promotion of democracy. It is, increasingly, a Rorschach test, with no two countries and no two European politicians seeing the same contours and nuances when they ponder it.
That was the gist of antithetical comments made here on Friday by Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
As Mr. Simitis was telling one group of reporters that the evolving draft of the constitution reflected a shared belief among all the union's members in "a federal kind of Europe," Mr. Blair was telling another group of reporters that Britain was adamant about "a Europe of nations, not a federal superstate."
Different countries in the union feel differently, to say the least, about how much control and autonomy to cede to the union -- on matters of taxation, foreign policy or even culture -- and about how important that surrender is for the union to remain coherent and relevant.
"The Germans will say that the union is like a bicycle, and if you don't keep pedaling forward, you fall off," said Jeffrey Gedmin, director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin, a research organization devoted to trans-Atlantic issues. "The British will say that you can stop and park a bicycle from time to time without getting off it."
The motivation for producing a constitution was the recognition that the bicycle itself needed to be sturdier and more easily steered in order to accommodate 25 nations instead of the union's current 15.
But even as the elements of that constitution come under sharp dispute, union leaders and other Europeans talk about expanding their club even further, which could make consensus even more difficult.
As on other matters, they disagree about how much to grow.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, who is set to take over the union's rotating presidency for the second half of this year, said last month that the union should ultimately include Russia, Turkey and even Israel.
"This is my vision of the future Europe," Mr. Berlusconi said in an interview, suggesting that membership should be defined by commitment to democracy, global security and certain values, not traditional continental geography.
"That's absurd," countered a senior French official. "Israel just doesn't make the cut. It's not European, not by geographical, not by historical and cultural terms."
Some European politicians, diplomats and scholars say the union, if it is to retain its core values, must remain a predominantly Christian club, excluding countries like Turkey and Israel.
Others say there simply needs to be a limit, or the union would truly become ungovernable.
That ceiling is not likely to be drawn at 25 countries. Bulgaria and Romania seem to be on a course to gain admission later this decade. Representatives of Balkan countries came to this northern Greek resort today to press their case for membership, which union leaders promised to consider seriously.
"We are talking, by the end of this decade or soon thereafter, of a union with 32 or 35 members," said John Palmer, political director of the European Policy Center, a research organization based in Brussels.
Given that projection, he said, the constitution now being drafted might not last more than five years.
Additionally, he said, the union needed to contemplate "a post-enlargement strategy -- a larger, looser, less ambitious form of association" with countries that wanted to cooperate with the union but would not be given full membership.
Already, with the scheduled addition of 10 countries next year, the union has become more diverse than ever.
The per capita gross domestic product of those countries is about $5,500, according to union statistics from 2001, the most recent year available. For the 15 countries already in the club, that figure is about $23,000.
Even among the 15 current members, there are differences in industrial and economic activity, language and culture that make closer cooperation -- of the kind that the constitution is meant to promote -- a formidable challenge.
"Sometimes we get tangled in the E.U.," said Chris Patten, the union's commissioner in charge of external relations. "Our knickers get twisted on many issues."

HEADLINE: Answers, Not Excuses, From New Chief 

BYLINE:  By EVAN GOODENOW

 BODY:
CRUISING down New Haven's streets on a recent night earlier this month, New Haven's new police chief had every reason to be happy. At just 43, after nearly 25 years as a police officer, Francisco Ortiz has achieved his longtime dream of becoming Connecticut's first Latino police chief after being appointed by Mayor John DeStefano Jr. on June 3.
 Yes, there has been a spate of shootings in the first five months of the year, but Mr. Ortiz is proud of a police effort he oversaw that used computer triangulation and old-fashioned street sources to make several arrests in connection to the shootings. 
 The streets were nearly empty and the city seemed relatively quiet as Chief Ortiz's executive officer, Sgt. Ricardo Rodriguez, turned onto Poplar Street in the city's Fair Haven neighborhood. Displaying the kind of night vision that makes for a good police officer, Mr. Ortiz spotted a demolished car with a red sticker on it. 
The sticker meant that the police had tagged the car, but hadn't moved it because the city's Public Works Department must clean the debris from abandoned cars before they can be towed. 
This mix-up annoyed Chief Ortiz, because to him, when the police give up on moving an abandoned car, they are abandoning the neighborhood. Chief Ortiz, a disciple of the "broken windows" theory of community policing, which states that the same police apathy that allows broken windows to go unattended also leads to more serious crime.
"Abandoned cars are a pet peeve to me in the city," Chief Ortiz said. "They're monuments of failure, they make no sense at all. They remind me of the audacity and the spirit of desperation in this city. I tell my guys, 'I don't care if public works won't get that out of here. Take it out of here. Tow it to the police station!"'
Within seconds, Sergeant Rodriguez is on his cellphone calling to get a tow truck, and Chief Ortiz's first call the next morning was to verify that the car has been towed.
"Community police is about having answers, not making excuses. It's about being responsive and getting results," Chief Ortiz said.
His intensity over the car is typical of Chief Ortiz, who said he often puts in 16-hour days since he replaced the retired Melvin H. Wearing as chief. 
"It doesn't seem like he ever sleeps," said Bonnie Posick Winchester, a police spokeswoman. 
Chief Ortiz became a police officer almost by accident at 18, when he stopped by the department to get a background check and applied for a position after being recommended by a friend. Chief Ortiz said he showed up for agility and writing tests to get into the academy because he had nothing else to do on the dates they were held.
But by 1990, shortly after being named a sergeant, Chief Ortiz was involved in the birth of community policing as police coverage went from patrolling four quadrants to 10 neighborhoods. The philosophy of police as partners with the community rather than an occupying force took root. It was then that Chief Ortiz said he began to believe he could lead and set his sights on becoming chief. 
Handling a force of some 430 officers with a $29 million yearly budget, Chief Ortiz , a self-described micro-manager, will be expected to crunch numbers and delegate authority. He recently named a new head of the detective bureau and family services division and more changes are on the way. 
"It's going to be a whole different position on law enforcement and a whole different perspective on the workload," said Lt. Leo Bombalicki, a member of the police union's executive board who graduated from the New Haven Police Academy with Chief Ortiz in 1978. The two worked undercover narcotics together, the most dangerous work a police officer can do, and Mr. Bombalicki respects Chief Ortiz's hard-charging attitude.
Unlike Mr. Wearing, Chief Ortiz -- known as Cisco to his friends -- enjoys the spotlight. That was evident in the hours after the May 22 bombing of an empty classroom at Yale University's law school. Chief Ortiz, who was named assistant chief on March 3 and acting chief on May 1, fielded questions in two languages appearing on Telemundo, Univision and "Good Morning America." 
Chief Ortiz grew up in public housing in New Haven, the son of Puerto Ricans who came to New Haven in search of work. He is proud to be Connecticut's first Latino chief. It is an appointment he said he believed was long overdue. 
"Think about all the departments that exist and all the men and women who exist in law enforcement in Connecticut. It shouldn't be that I'm the only one," Chief Ortiz said. "It may be more of a sad commentary versus a compliment. We've still got a long way to go."
Not far removed from being a street officer, Chief Ortiz is on a first name basis with many of the pedestrians who walk along Grand Avenue. His fluency in Spanish allows him to duck into a small restaurant and tell the clerk to get the person with the stereo upstairs to turn the music down and joke with pedestrians in their native language. 
"He's always been able to cross ethnic lines and develop relationships," said Scott X. Esdaile, the president of the Greater New Haven N.A.A.C.P. and a golfing partner of Chief Ortiz.
Like several areas of the city, the Fair Haven area remains a high crime neighborhood, but Chief Ortiz said things have improved over the last two years as police targeted drug dealers and the locations where they worked. 
Standing at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Ferry Street, Chief Ortiz motioned to an abandoned convenience store across the street.
Several years ago, two teenage boys who Chief Ortiz had just rousted from a nearby corner were shot to death in a drug-related dispute by youths not much older than their victims. "Those are the times that you spend up at night thinking," Chief Ortiz said as he stood at the intersection after conferring with two bicycle-riding officers. 
"Young kids that had their whole lives ahead of them and the kids who are responsible for that homicide, their whole lives are destroyed as well."
To try to prevent similar crimes before they start, officers are using computer statistics to track chronic offenders and pinpoint hot spots. Chief Ortiz also said that officers will have greater input on where they patrol.
Despite being aggressive, Chief Ortiz realizes police officers must know when to back off. When a young man in dreadlocks showing off for neighbors in the Farnam Court housing complex berated Chief Ortiz and Mr. Rodriguez with profanities, they drove on with Chief Ortiz joking that the man was having a bad hair day.
Chief Ortiz, a husband and father of three, constantly rocks back and forth in his chair as he sits in his office speaking in a rapid fire tone. The police will be aggressive, but he knows that officers cannot arrest their way out of crime problems and that can only be addressed by much needed economic infusion in the depressed inner city, he said.
Chief Ortiz said officers will continue their collaboration with the Yale Child Study Center and maintain a proactive approach to handling domestic violence incidents, including counseling for officers who are involved in domestic violence.
The murder rate in New Haven dipped from a high of 31 in 1990 to a low of 9 in 2002, a 71 percent drop. However, shootings have been up this year with 51 occurring up to June 18. A 17-year-old boy who was shot in his car on Monday, died Tuesday. He became New Haven's third homicide victim of 2003.
At a time when many police departments have either dismantled or cut back on community policing due to shrinking federal funds, Chief Ortiz acknowledges keeping community policing strong won't be easy, but he said it's about more than dollars and resources.
"It's about a commitment and a passion and a drive to make neighborhoods healthy, to work with the residents and the businesses and the youth in the community to get a better understanding of what each other's role can be," Chief Ortiz said. "I'm going to work with every family in every neighborhood in every community to let them know that we're here to work with them and we work for them."

HEADLINE: In Connecticut Corruption Testimony, the Names Are Making News 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
It has been almost four years since Paul J. Silvester pleaded guilty to having used his office as Connecticut state treasurer to shake down people seeking state business, setting off the first of many scandals to disgrace a member of Gov. John G. Rowland's inner sanctum.
 But it is only in recent days that many seamier details behind Mr. Silvester's dealings have tumbled into full view as part of a federal trial in New Haven in which he is the star witness. And with each fresh revelation, and new name mentioned, political observers are indulging in a parlor game of trying to assess just how far the fallout might reach. 
 "Everyone in the capital is reading about it," said Andy Sauer, the executive director of Common Cause in Connecticut, a government watchdog group. Mr. Sauer was on a camping trip on Cape Cod on Friday but nonetheless knew of Mr. Silvester's latest name-dropping on the stand. "It's an insider's story because of all the people who are being mentioned in the trial. And for our purposes, it's exposing the dark side of money and politics." 
By law, Connecticut's treasurer has sole authority to decide how to invest state pension money. Mr. Silvester, besides implicating many investment firms, executives and politicians already on trial or awaiting trial, also testified last week about people of all political stripes who benefited from his influence but have not been charged.
On Thursday, he mentioned Wayne E. Berman, once a top Republican fund-raiser in Washington, and William A. DiBella, the former State Senate Democratic majority leader, as having reaped large fees from investment companies that won money-management contracts from the state.
The Associated Press quoted Mr. DiBella's lawyer last week as saying that his client had done nothing wrong. Mr. Berman has said recently that whatever fees he took were proper.
On the stand Friday, Mr. Silvester made glancing references to Mr. Rowland, though lawyers following the case say he stopped short of accusing him of anything a prosecutor would build a case on. Under cross-examination, Mr. Silvester said he had steered business to the Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund after a Hartford lobbyist promised that if he did, an Apollo executive would throw a fund-raiser for Mr. Rowland.
Mr. Silvester also testified that he had been asked by another lobbyist who some say is close to Mr. Rowland to increase the state's investment in Pioneer Capital. The investment was against his better judgment, Mr. Silvester said, and he demurred. Later, Mr. Silvester told the court, he asked Mr. Rowland to appoint his brother George as a judge and to hire 15 to 20 of Mr. Silvester's staffers who were losing their jobs at the end of his term. This time, he said, the governor demurred.
Not until he learned that Mr. Rowland would indeed hire some of his employees, Mr. Silvester said, did he put more state money into Pioneer.
Mr. Rowland appears to be trying to distance himself from the latest courtroom drama. On Friday, The Associated Press quoted him as saying not to expect a comment on his former treasurer's allegations. The governor said he was too busy trying to get a budget passed for the new fiscal year that begins on July 1 "to do a daily commentary on each and every day of the various trials that are going on."
Political scientists said that the governor is correct in acting as if the public cares more about the local economy and taxes than how his underlings abused their positions. "The public in Connecticut is scandaled out," said Christopher Barnes, associate director for the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
The center's most recent poll, of 500 residents, showed Mr. Rowland's popularity at a near low. Only 33 percent of the public described the job he was doing as good or excellent. The poll, taken from May 28 to June 1, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Mr. Barnes said he did not think the scandals in Hartford caused Mr. Rowland's approval rating to drop from the high of 73 percent it reached shortly before he was elected to the second of three terms in 1998. "The public expects politicians to behave like that," Mr. Barnes said. "So when it turns out that politicians are doing each other favors, they're not exactly shocked, maybe disappointed, and that may explain part of the lower ratings, but it's the economy that drove them down."
Connecticut has embraced some reforms aimed at closing loopholes that Mr. Silvester exploited. His successor as state treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, has established criteria that her office must use in choosing investment firms. The legislature also bolstered the power of the outside advisory council that oversees pension-related decisions. And it eliminated the ability of a lame-duck treasurer to make investments in the weeks before leaving office, a period that Mr. Silvester had used to cut deals that padded his own pockets.
Mr. Rowland named Mr. Silvester treasurer in 1997 to fill a vacancy between elections. By Mr. Silvester's own admission, he wasted little time, demanding kickbacks and other favors from people who could benefit from pension fund investments. One witness who testified last week under government immunity said Mr. Silvester went so far as to threaten that his brother Mark would harm the witness if he did not participate in a kickback scheme.
After he narrowly lost his post to Ms. Nappier in November 1998, Mr. Silvester attracted the attention of investigators by negotiating $800 million of long-term contracts with a dozen firms in the few weeks before he left office. Mr. Silvester has admitted that at least five of those companies accepted deals aimed at enriching him and associates including his former aide and mistress, Lisa A. Thiesfield. 
An oddity of the trial is that the big fish in the case, Mr. Silvester, has been caught and is taking the stand only in an effort to lessen his sentence by testifying against firms and individuals who have far less name recognition than he. Triumph Capital Group of Boston and its general counsel, Charles B. Spadoni, are the ones currently on trial. They are accused of pledging campaign contributions and jobs in exchange for Mr. Silvester's business and for tampering with evidence once the government began to investigate.
Three more people -- Ms. Thiesfield; Ben F. Andrews, the Republican candidate for secretary of state in 1998; and Triumph's chairman, Frederick W. McCarthy -- are expected to go on trial in the fall.
But unless the various investigative trails ultimately lead prosecutors to someone with more name recognition than Mr. Silvester -- either the governor or perhaps the people behind the Carlyle Group, a star-studded investment fund in Washington with connections to Mr. Berman -- the Silvester saga may never grip the masses the way other Connecticut soap operas have. In contrast, residents closely followed the two juries that convicted Joseph P. Ganim, Bridgeport's former mayor, of taking bribes, and Philip A. Giordano, the former mayor of Waterbury, of using official powers to sexually abuse two young girls.
If this were the first time that the governor's name had come up as a result of a corruption scandal, voters might be more shocked, political analysts said. But the scandals of the last four years have left many rather jaded. There is Mr. Rowland's former co-chief of staff, Peter N. Ellef, who federal and state officials say is under investigation for improperly steering state business. That came on the heels of a guilty plea by Mr. Rowland's former deputy chief of staff, Lawrence E. Alibozek, to charges of accepting cash and gold coins from a state contractor eager for business. The loot was found buried in Mr. Alibozek's backyard. And the governor himself recently agreed to pay almost $9,000 to resolve accusations that he did not pay full price for using vacation homes supplied by a favored state contractor.
All of which may be too much for the average voter, even as the cognoscenti savor every detail. "Everyone is just plain fed up," Mr. Sauer of Common Cause said. "To them, the Silvester story is nothing new, just one more corrupt politician."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Personal Bankruptcy Filings Rise

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
THE rocky economy has meant an increase in business for at least one group of lawyers: those who shepherd bankruptcies through the system. Lawrence Reich, a bankruptcy lawyer in White Plains, said his work was spilling over into the weekends. His services are so much in demand that there are more cases than he and his son, Jeff, who works with him, can handle. He has enlisted the help of his daughter, Robin Reich, a bankruptcy lawyer who has spent most of her time at home with her three young children in recent years. 
 The numbers of people filing for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in Westchester and Rockland Counties are still not large, but they are growing. In the first five months of this year, 197 people declared bankruptcy, a 26 percent jump from the same period last year, according to records of the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. The number of people filing for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 increased by 14 percent to 1,033. 
 Roughly three-quarters of both Chapters 7 and 13 cases processed in the White Plains division of the court have been filed by Westchester residents, said Marlene Guercy, the division's deputy clerk in charge. The number of Americans filing for bankruptcy reached 1.6 million in the 12 months ending March 31 this year, setting a national record, said the American Banking Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Alexandria, Va., that researches bankruptcy-related issues. The number represents a 7.1 percent increase over the previous 12 months. Bankruptcy filings nationwide first broke 1.5 million in the 12-month period ending March 31, 2002. 
The jump has brought more work to Westchester's bankruptcy lawyers, the bankruptcy court and the federally appointed trustee, who guards creditors' interests. It has also provided more job opportunities for graduates from universities in the New York metropolitan area specializing in bankruptcy.
But the process of filing for bankruptcy, which involves tallying all debt, counting possessions and, in some cases, creating a formula to repay the creditors is a painful one for the applicants.
"What we are seeing is a flip side of the booming economy," said Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American Banking Institute. "This is simply paying the bill. It is a hangover of the good times people felt they were in.
"Money was spent everywhere," he added, "on vacations, homes, automobiles, boats. They all add to household debts."
National consumer debt has been more than 14 percent of total personal disposable income since 2000, the highest since 1987, according to the American Banking Institute. 
"A lot of people are laid off," said Sidney Turner, the chairman of the Committee on Creditors' Rights and Bankruptcy, part of the Westchester County Bar Association. "People are stretched out. They do as much as they can to hold onto their homes. They refinance. But when they run out of options to refinance, one of the options is to choose bankruptcy."
Jeffrey Sapir, the sole trustee of Chapter 13 cases in the Southern District of New York, said bankruptcy court days now often run from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. instead of to 3:30 p.m. While Mr. Sapir maintained a private practice a few years ago, he no longer has time to see private clients. As a trustee, Mr. Sapir approves or rejects a repayment plan designed by the debtor and the bankruptcy lawyer before the plan reaches court. 
Kathleen Farrell-Willoughby, the head clerk bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York, said she was hiring an assistant deputy clerk for the White Plains division, a position created in response to the increasing case volume.
Robert Zinman, the director of the bankruptcy program at St. John's University Law School in Queens, said all 34 of the graduating students in the program last year readily found jobs.
The number of businesses filing for bankruptcy has also grown in Westchester, according to bankruptcy court records. While 39 businesses filed for bankruptcy in the first five months of 2002, 45 did in the same period in 2003, a 15 percent increase.
While lawyers usually advise debtors with few assets to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, they suggest homeowners to choose Chapter 13. Under Chapter 7, the applicant can be discharged of all debts but must liquidate all assets beyond a certain limit. Under Chapter 13, the applicant may keep his property but must pay the debtor according to a certain schedule with money from future income. 
Bankruptcy is a family business for the Reiches Mr. Reich's father started the family practice in White Plains in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression.
Mr. Reich, who is 63, often finds himself playing the role of a psychotherapist, an accountant and a lawyer all at once. He hands his clients tissues; he dispenses marital advice; he offers financial suggestions. Often he has to tease out information bit by bit.
"Many come in, distraught and traumatized," Mr. Reich said. "There is a lot of hand-holding going on."
For this service, bankruptcy applicants pay their lawyers up front, and lawyers' fees for a basic personal bankruptcy filing are around $1,500. 
"I find it very gratifying to be a bankruptcy lawyer," said Mr. Reich. "At the beginning of the process, they are depressed, they come crying and many are ill. At the end, they feel much better about themselves and they have a new start. It's one area of the law where you can really help people."
Often, the professions of his clients are a weathervane of the economy at large. In the early 1990's, when interest rate was high, Mr. Reich represented many real estate developers and construction company owners who had lost their businesses. Two years ago, when the Internet bubble burst, it was the Web entrepreneurs who sought out his services. Now it's bond traders, investment bankers, stockbrokers or corporate lawyers. 
Who will be next?
"Restaurant owners, maybe," Mr. Reich ventured. "People in the service industry who need the bankers and lawyers to spend. You throw a pebble in the pond, and there will be ripples."

HEADLINE: U.S. Statistical Shift Is Assailed on Island 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
NASSAU and Suffolk counties stand to lose tens of millions in government aid under a new system put in place earlier this month by the federal Office of Management and Budget, Long Island officials said last week.
 The officials, including members of the Long Island congressional delegation, said they would appeal to the White House to overrule the agency's action and restore the Island to its former status as a separate statistical area within the New York metropolitan region, a status held for 25 years. 
 "They are going to know that they are in a battle," said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, who blamed "bureaucrats playing their own games" for causing what he described as a serious problem.
Officials at O.M.B. seemed perplexed by the uproar. "There should be no impact as far as funding is concerned," said Trent Duffy, an O.M.B. spokesman. "They have the same status, only a different name." 
Under the former O.M.B. classification, Nassau and Suffolk were joined as a Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, giving Long Island what officials said was an undisputed, separate statistical existence from surrounding metropolitan areas and a distinct demographic and economic profile. Crucially, the officials said, federal grants and aid did not penalize the two-county area for being wealthier than New York City and most surrounding areas.
In the new classification, the Long Island counties remain joined but now become the Suffolk-Nassau Division, one of four divisions in a mega-conglomerate of 18 million people called the New York-Newark-Edison, New York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. It includes the 5 city boroughs; 12 New Jersey counties as far south as Ocean County; Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Putnam and Rockland counties in New York; and Pike County in Pennsylvania.
The Long Island officials said the change would mean drastic reductions in government block grants, housing aid and other types of aid based on income. This would be so, they said, because lower-income areas in New York City and elsewhere in the newly designated statistical area would secure virtually all the funding under income caps in many programs. "We would be viewed as too wealthy," Dr. Koppelman said. "And we could lose tens of millions of dollars."
Long Island would also suffer a sharp decline in government money for affordable housing, the officials said.
"It's a disaster," said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, an affordable housing group that relies on public and private financing. "If we are grouped with the five boroughs our income limits will come down. It will cut thousands and thousands of people from our programs." 
O.M.B. said the revisions, part of a national reconfiguring that the agency was required to undertake every 10 years based on census data, were for statistical purposes only. The agency and the Census Bureau outlined the proposed changes and sought comments as long ago as December 2000.
"This was the result of a multiyear, public process," said Michael Ratcliffe, a geographer for the Census Bureau. "It was a very public proceeding that folks in the New York area were aware of."
Long Island officials and planners said, however, that the agencies provided only partial information, making comment difficult. "It was like commenting on a shot in basketball before the guy takes the shot," said Roy Fedelem, a principal planner for the Long Island Regional Planning Board. 
Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington, said he and Representative Peter T. King, Republican of Seaford, would build a case against the change. "And we will take that case to the White House," he said. Mr. King is the only Republican in the Long Island delegation. Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for governmental affairs for the Long Island Association, said the O.M.B. change would undo decades of identity-building on Long Island and make the area more difficult to market to businesses seeking to compare it with other regions that remained separate statistical areas.
"It removes our identity as an economic area of our own," Mr. Pally said. "Long Island is being treated differently than many other areas of lesser population, and that's unfair and we won't stand for it."

HEADLINE: The Rising Price of Getting Well 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER

 BODY:
IRA ROSENBLOOM is an accountant, not a doctor, but he sees plenty of pain as his clients -- and his own firm -- struggle to pay health insurance premiums that are rising faster than they have in more than a decade.
 For the 55 employees at his firm, Mintz Rosenfeld & Co. in Fairfield, Mr. Rosenbloom, the managing director, has shopped around for lower rates and cut benefits -- though he can only cut so much. After all, he runs a service company, and contented workers are his most important asset. 
 Nonetheless, like an increasing number of employers throughout New Jersey -- where it costs more to insure a family than any other state -- Mr. Rosenbloom finds his company having to pass along a larger share of health care expenditures to the employees themselves. He does not even know where to place the blame: doctors, hospitals, government, insurance companies, or patients. "There seems to be pain all over for an industry that's supposed to make pain go away," Mr. Rosenbloom. 
 Throughout New Jersey, large employers are looking at increases of more than 10 percent in their premiums again next year. Small companies and people who buy insurance on their own face even steeper increases. After sweeping reforms in 1992 -- requiring insurance companies operating in the state to provide health care policies to all applicants regardless of age or illness -- state officials are now questioning whether those regulations have instead priced residents out of the market.
 At the same time, government health insurance plans for low-income residents are also under a strain. As recently as the late 1990's, the state was a leader in expanding health care coverage to low-income families and singles. But these days New Jersey, like more and more states, is staring at cutbacks in enrollment because of budget constraints. By June 30, New Jersey must overcome a $5 billion shortfall and approve a balanced budget. 
 What this all means is that an estimated 1.1 million New Jersey residents are without any health insurance this year, a number certain to keep rising.
 "When people are uninsured and have a major illness they run the risk of going bankrupt trying to provide health care for their family," Holly Bakke, commissioner of the state Department of Banking and Insurance, said in a recent interview. "We don't think that's acceptable."
 But for now, she said she had no quick solution. Not that the crisis in health care costs is limited to New Jersey. Rebuilding a health care system that many Americans say is in turmoil is likely to be a central issue in next year's presidential campaign, though candidates disagree sharply over how to do it. 
 "We have to be very careful not to solve the wrong problem," Ms. Bakke said of New Jersey's deepening quandary.
 For example, she said the changes enacted in 1992 were effective in requiring companies to carry policies regardless of age or illnesses, but were now prohibitively expensive, creating what insurers call a "death spiral" in enrollment. What happened was this: gradually, older and sicker residents sought individual policies, making insurance companies have to pay put more and, ultimately, charge more. 
 After several years of no increases in premiums, or slight ones, in the early to mid-1990s -- mostly because of the spread of health maintenance organizations -- the cost of providing benefits to workers rose 35 percent in the past three years, according to a survey released in March by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. 
 Employers surveyed said they paid an average of $6,325 in premiums for each covered employee, an increase of $823, or 15 percent -- the highest annual increase since the survey began in 1993 -- and two-thirds said they expected costs to rise again next year by an average of 13.5 percent.
 Another study conducted by the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy found that New Jersey ranks first among states in the premiums employers pay to insure their workers' families. On average, this study found, the premium is $7,592, compared with $6,772 nationally. For singles, the average premium in is $2,911, compared with $2,655 nationally, making New Jersey the fourth most-expensive state in this category.
 Only 3 percent of the companies surveyed by New Jersey Business and Industry Association said they dropped employee coverage last year, but a majority shifted costs to employees; 48 percent increased employee co-payments, 39 percent increased deductibles and 35 percent increased their employees' share of the premium.

Why Costs Are Rising
 Those premiums are going to pay health care costs that are rising across the board, mainly because of an aging population and advances in expensive new medical technology, said Robert Meehan, vice president of consumer and commercial markets at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state's largest insurer, covering 2.8million residents.
 Prescription drug costs and outpatient services are among the fastest-growing costs, Mr. Meehan said. And while soaring malpractice insurance rates for doctors have not been a direct factor in premium increases, he said, they may be adding pressure indirectly as doctors order extra tests as a way of practicing "defensive medicine" against lawsuits.
 Hospital costs are up too. Richard Miller, chief executive of Virtua Health, a four-hospital system in South Jersey, said his costs rose 8 to 10 percent this year alone.
 Adding to problem, charity care at Virtua will reach $16 million this year -- or about 3 percent of the hospitals' total budget -- up 5 percent from last year. Statewide, hospitals are expected to provide $700 million in charity care next year, Mr. Miller said.
 "That's significant," he said. "How do we deal with that issue and how do we deal with the increasing number of uninsured? It is a system in need of reform. You can't keep going at this pace for the next 5 to 10 years."
 At Saint Francis Medical Center in Trenton, charity care consumes 7 to 8 percent of the budget, said Jerry Jablonowski, the hospital's chief operating officer.
 Mr. Jablonowski said the hospital strives to provide a medical safety net for the urban poor, which includes an increasing number of uninsured, making the situation even more troubling than the economic uncertainties of the early 1990's because hospital operating margins are thinner. 
 "We're having much more difficulty," he said. "We are starting to see the aging baby boomers using more services, and the economy is still not recovering. As unemployment goes up, so does the number of uninsured."
 Adding to the problem is the shrinking number of managed care plans available. In New Jersey, the field has thinned out considerably in the past 5 to 10 years, reducing competition and driving up premium prices said Eugene Alexander, senior consultant in the Princeton office of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, a major national benefits consulting firm.
 As a result, Mr. Alexander said, "HMO's are getting more powerful."
 In the 1990's, health maintenance organizations drove down prices by negotiating lower prices with doctors and hospitals and reducing hospital stays. But in those days, HMO's were also concerned with building markets and offered low prices to sign up employers, said Mr. Alexander. Now, he added, many of them are under pressure from shareholders to raise prices and profit.
 Yet in defense of the higher premiums, Mr. Meehan of Horizon said insurance carriers typically spend 80 to 85 cents of each premium dollar directly on health care. After paying 10 to 15 cents for administrative costs, he said, insurers make 2 to 5 cents in profit on each dollar they bring in.
 Mr. Alexander agreed with Mr. Meehan that the largest share of the increase was a result of more people using the health care system more often.
 "Employees have become insulated from the real cost of health care," said Mr. Alexander. "Their $10 co-pay hasn't gone up much in 10 years, and nobody thinks twice about going to the doctor when they get a sore throat."
 Moreover, employers have gradually assumed a greater share of spending on health care, further distancing patients from the pain of rising costs. In the 1970's, employees paid an average of 34 percent of those costs; today, Mr. Alexander said, the average is 13 percent.
 Increasingly, employers are trying to spread the burden of health insurance to employees not only as as a way to reduce costs, but also as way to rein in overuse of the system. "That is the long-term trend," said Gary Cupo, president of Benefit Solutions, a consulting company in Wayne.
 In New Jersey, 74.1 percent of the population receives health care benefits through an employer, compared with 67.4 percent nationally, according to the 2000 Census data compiled by the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy. State and federal government provided health benefits to 6.9 percent of the population and 4.5 percent were privately insured. In New Jersey, 14.5 percent of the population was uninsured, compared with 15.5 percent nationally.
 Verizon Communications, for instance, which employs 17,200 workers in the state and subsidizes about 90 percent of its employees' medical costs, is expecting increases in health care costs of 10 to 15 percent next year.
 Ezra Singer, executive vice president of human resources at Verizon, says the company is struggling in a tough telecommunications market in which revenue is not growing. But for that reason, Mr. Singer said, Verizon needs the best employees it can get, and they expect good benefits.
 To that end, he said, the company is shifting more responsibility in the area of health care to its employees, in much the same was as they already manage their retirement savings through company-sponsored 401k plans.
 "As we move forward we have to change the paradigm in terms of the company's and the employee's responsibility for management of health care benefits," Mr. Singer said.
 Smaller employers and those who must buy their insurance individually out-of-pocket are already familiar with weighing benefits against the price of premiums.

Tough Laws Were Enacted
 In 1992, in response to insurers' failure to even write policies for many people in these two categories, New Jersey enacted some of the toughest laws in the country requiring insurance companies operating in the state to provide policies to everyone who applies at standard rates regardless of age or health problems.
 For a time the programs grew, though they have since dropped off. In 2000, 930,000 people were insured through small group plans -- for companies with fewer than 50 workers -- compared with 880,000 today. In 1995 the individual health program peaked at 180,000, but is now down to 75,000.
 Since the reforms of the early 1990's, the number of insurance carriers has dropped off from 29 to around 12 with full programs, said Wardell Sanders, executive director of the boards that oversee both individual and small employer programs in the state. Those companies still in the game are charging whopping rates.In New Jersey, for example, Aetna charges a single, 25-year-old male $405 a month for basic coverage, the same as a 60-year-old resident. In Pennsylvania, where there are fewer regulations, the same 25-year-old would pay $101 a month and the 60-year-old would pay $475, said Frank McCauley, Aetna's general manager for small group and individual business in the Middle Atlantic states.
 "The difference, obviously, is that New Jersey is an extremely regulated market," he said.
 But companies operating in Pennsylvania -- and other states with less stringent regulations -- can exact their price in other ways. For instance, a 60-year-old policy holder with health problems may well have riders in the policy allowing the carrier to refuse to cover pre-existing health problems, or refuse coverage at all.
 "The older folks with significant health considerations make out better in New Jersey than elsewhere," said Mr. Sanders.
 "The sole issue in New Jersey is affordability," he said.
 For low-income residents, New Jersey has been among the most generous states in expanding health coverage, though many of those programs are facing cuts under Gov. McGreevey's proposed 2004 budget.
 Under the governor's plan, Medicaid, the federal-state program health insurance program for the poor, would cut some dental and long-term benefits and increase co-payments for prescription drugs. And in the state's Pharmaceutical Assistance for the Aged and Disabled (PAAD), recipients will face new eligibility requirements that may require 16,000 aged residents to pay $65 toward each $100 in prescription costs, up from $5 now. 
 In addition, the proposed budget would eliminate 57,000 people from the state's FamilyCare health insurance program for low-income children and families, which has a total enrollment of 76,000 adults and 92,000 children.
 "There is always a concern, especially now with the budget cuts proposed, that the number of uninsured in New Jersey is going to increase," said Bridget Devane, an organizer with New Jersey Citizen Action, a nonprofit advocacy group. "New Jersey was a leading state in expanding coverage. Now it looks like we're rolling back on those expansions. Parents and individuals are being kicked out and they have nowhere to go for coverage. We will see the burden elsewhere. These people won't get preventive care and will wind up in emergency rooms where it is more expensive to treat them."
 Ms. Bakke, the banking and insurance commissioner, said the downturn in the economy and the price of insurance in the state had created pockets of uninsured even in affluent parts of the state.

Insurance or Groceries
 "When you think of the uninsured you think of the minority populations and the low-income people," she said. "But what we are finding is a lot of working-class people and people who have lost their jobs and their health care must choose between paying for insurance and buying groceries."
 Mr. Sanders said many workers who are eligible for employer-sponsored plans decline coverage because they do not want to pay their share of the monthly premiums. "If you're making $25,000 a year," he said, "$270 a month is a lot."
 The uninsured include many young adults willing to gamble that they will stay healthy rather than pay all, or part, of their health care premiums. More than 4 in 10 people between 19 and 29 can expect to be uninsured at some time during a year -- twice the rate of adults ages 30 to 64, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a New York0-based research organization.
 Another pool of newly uninsured are residents who have lost their jobs but are too young for Medicare. Mr. Meehan said people in this group are often able to get benefits through a spouse who is working.
 Going without insurance may save money, but it can be costly in other ways. A study released in April by the University of Pennsylvania found that the death rate for uninsured heart attack patients between 1990 and 1996 dropped from 12 percent to 8 percent in New York, but rose from 7.3 percent to 8.2 percent in New Jersey where funds for charity care were reduced by half. The mortality rate for insured patients remained the same in both states.
 Ms. Bakke said it is too soon to say what shape health insurance reform will take in the state. 
 Insurers have continually complained that New Jersey is among the states with the largest number of healthcare mandates, such as coverage for infertility. State officials estimate the infertility mandate raised premiums across the state by 3 percent.
 "I'm sure that helped a numberof people, but when we help a certain number of people there is an overall cost to the system," said Ms. Bakke.
 Mr. Rosenbloom, the accountant, said the complexity of the state's health care insurance system reminds him of trying to bring peace to the Middle East.
 "There are real issues on all sides," he said. "You need something like the roadmap to peace. You need everybody who has an interest in it to contribute to the solution."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT; 
Southern, With Soul

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
"MEASURING approximately 70 by 165 feet, the building is oriented with the apse facing east and the main entrance facing west. The structure consists of a tall central nave flanked by lower aisles and transepts The long nave has a steep, slate gable roof."
 The building is a restaurant - well, partly. It was built, in the 1870's, as St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, an imposing Gothic Revival edifice of brownstone and stained glass. (The description is from its entry in the National Register of Historic Places.) By the 1970's, its parishioners - largely Irish-Americans from the hilly precincts now called the Central Ward and University Heights - had left for the suburbs, and the Newark Archdiocese was forced to sell it. 
 Luckily for succeeding generations, including those of us who need a weekly or monthly fix of jazz and Southern cooking, St. Joseph's did not go the way of so much else in the Central Ward. Its new owner, the nonprofit social-service agency and housing developer called the New Community Corporation, had the vision to grasp its possibilities as a church-turned-into-something-else. Among the results is the Priory, one of the most striking eating spaces you'll ever encounter.
 You enter through the old church vestibule, into that central nave with its soaring vaulted ceiling. A glass elevator leads to a graceful second-floor balcony, which gives onto various New Community offices. The dining room and bar are at the far end, in the two-tiered space that once held pulpit and altars.
 The sensation of eating there - of having fried chicken, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and a glass of beer in a former sanctuary still watched over by stained-glass saints - is hard to describe. To this diner, at any rate, it felt not at all sacrilegious, largely, no doubt, because the restaurant's owner is a church-based agency whose mission of community renewal is both political and spiritual. And while the decor in the dining room itself is a bit dowdy and functional, the overall renovation, designed in the early 1980's by the New York architect Roz Li, is remarkably in keeping with the church's history and its place in the community.
 The Priory has been in business about two decades, its menu remaining fairly constant: Southern with a few continental detours. Past reviewers have complained of unevenness, and it's good to be able to report that like the Central Ward, the kitchen is on the upswing. Greg Gaglione, the 27-year-old executive chef and general manager, formerly cooked at the Old Bay, a Cajun-Creole pub and restaurant in New Brunswick. His cooking is robust and satisfying, unafraid of richness and heat.
 An appetizer of seafood gumbo is simply terrific, and a terrific bargain at $5.95. It incorporates clams, scallops and chunks of mild white fish in a deep-orange broth thick with okra and charged with cayenne. A whole crayfish lords it over the dish. Popcorn shrimp are fresh-tasting fun food enlivened by a sherry remoulade. Caesar salad is helped along by Cajun-spiced croutons and a sour-mellow buttermilk dressing. Fried ravioli in a wild-mushroom sauce, decidedly not of the South, proved wearying after a few bites - too chewy, too rich, to no great purpose.
 Mr. Gaglione gives a good account of that soul-food essential, fried chicken. While the batter crust is too salty for my taste, it's crisp and relatively free of grease, and even the white meat is moist and tender. Cajun crab cakes have a high ratio of crab to filler, and a pleasing jolt of spices, but they too would be better with less salt. Main-course jambalaya isn't as wonderful as the first-course gumbo, but it's abundant and agreeable, a smoky, spicy, paella-like melange of andouille sausage, ham, shellfish (including a lobster tail) in rice studded with tomatoes and peas. A 24-ounce steak called the Brick City beef chop is merely abundant, with an unwelcome mane of greasy onion rings.
 Side dishes here are predictable but well turned out. Collard greens are tender and full of flavor, not boiled into submission; so are red beans and rice. Macaroni and cheese is rich and soothing, with a burnished topping of cheddar. 
 All of the above were served on a weeknight, when the dining room was nearly deserted and faintly depressing. Sunday brunch was another matter. For $15.95 a person (the price includes coffee and a glass of generic Champagne), you serve yourself from buffet tables in the church's nave. Many of the weekday dishes and sides are offered here, and the temptation to gorge is powerful. Be strong, if you must, but do not bypass the waffle and omelet table, where a specialist presides over burners and pans and two of the most fearsome waffle irons I've ever seen - ancient metal implements black with age and grease. They turn out beautiful waffles, thick and nutty and so sweet and buttery they hardly need syrup.
 Sunday brunch offers another attraction: live jazz. The day we visited, the performers were the Greg Federico Trio, a drummer with bass and guitar. Like the fare from the kitchen, their playing was tasty, straightforward and generous. In this context it seems fitting to add that they were white, while the customers (many of them fresh from church) were a comfortable mix of black, white and Asian. The unself-conscious mingling of races is part of New Community's mission, no less essential in the long run than housing and economic development. That it has gained a foothold in this splendid old church on the hill is the most satisfying thing on the Priory's menu.

Modem, Schmodem. I Blew a Fuse.

BYLINE:  By RICH PLISKIN; Rich Pliskin is a resident of Princeton.

 BODY:
JUST as the joyous events in life help us mark the passage of time, tragedies, too, take their place on our calendars of memory: Being divorced. Losing a kidney. Having a new Internet Service Provider foisted on you just when everything else seemed to be going tolerably well.
 By that rule, I will remember these recent weeks as the Spring of My Customer Service Crisis. 
 In this part of Central Jersey, a company that goes by the flaggy name of Patriot Media recently succeeded RSN as cable Internet Service Provider. If Patriot sees itself as keeper of the national modem, then I regret that I have but one aneurysm to give to harassing it.
 Two important things happen during a forced transition from one I.S.P. to another. The first is a sudden, chronic loss of Internet service. The other is a modest erosion of customer service, which, consistent with cable industry practice, was atrocious to begin with and would hardly be noticed but for the accompanying modest rate increase.
 As a result, victims of I.S.P. transition move through what experts call the Five Stages of Sadness: fulminating rage; sputtering fulmination; humiliating sputtering; abject humiliation; and pitiable, pathetic resignation. It is in this last stage that the modest rate increase arrives.
 These are more than laws of economics. They are conditions of life, akin to the unknowability of God, gender confusion or baldness. You just have to live with it. Trying to fix things just makes them worse.
 To be fair, I acknowledge that I suffer from a personality disorder that inhibits me from behaving maturely toward customer service representatives generally. Many companies, across industries, have the audiotapes of our phone conversations to prove this, so there's no point in dissembling.
 I do not care to examine why this is so or what it says about me. I certainly don't care to overcome the condition. I believe that accepting our flaws can be as liberating as correcting them. This philosophy seems to work well for the cable industry, too.
 From my I.S.P.'s corporate mission statement, as shown on the official Montgomery Township municipal Web site:
 Take care of our customers.
 Do what we say we are going to do.
 Make it fun for our customers and employees.
 From my mission statement, as shown on page after page of journal entries made in an unsteady hand:
 Parade in front of company headquarters draped in a sandwich board declaiming corporate arrogance.
 Sue over the $10 credit given for last month's loss of service, which I believe should have been $13.50 instead.
 The company knows I will never actually parade in front of corporate headquarters with a sandwich board, or that I will sue for the disputed $3.50. It knows that I would not even know where to get a sandwich board. And it knows that someone of my temperament could not hope to find a licensed lawyer willing to work with me, regardless of the potential payoff.
 I don't know how the company knows these things, but I suspect it is related in some way to the buying and selling of customer lists by direct marketers. After I defeat the I.S.P., I intend to prove this.
 I may never prove this.
 Appalling service from the cable company is nothing new. But it is worth noting that in New Jersey, the state in which the electric light, Morse Code and the telegraph were invented, you get more sophisticated service at the gas station than at the modem. At some service stations, you don't even have to sign the credit card receipt. That's high-tech.
 Do I overstate the case? Of course. The truth is, there were only a few days during the transition when I was unable to log on. A few harassing phone calls to the chief executive's secretary, some anonymous, criminally threatening e-mails to the head of corporate operations from untraceable public computers -- and I was back online.
 Yes, I must first power down the PC; unplug every outlet in the neighborhood; reboot; and sing "Tura, Lura Lura (That's an Irish Lullaby)" in a proto-Mandarin dialect. This embarrasses the children when friends are over, but for Internet service, it's worth their humiliation.
 Besides, the sooner they learn that Internet service is not a right but a corporate dispensation, the better customers they'll be.

Steinbrenner Fears Facing a Good Fight

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
FOR all of the familiar noise being broadcast recently out of the Bronx and Tampa, the real story as summer begins here in New York is the makings of a pennant race. Far from the contrivance of an interleague series with the Mets, could this be the season the Red Sox and even the Blue Jays hang with the Yankees?
 For a change, maybe September will be about something more than Joe Torre preparing his rotation for the playoffs, should he survive the panic attacks George Steinbrenner is sure to continue having if his roster of riches fails to pull away from the pack. 
 When Thursday's game against Tampa Bay was called on an afternoon that was turning into one without rain, you had to know, all Yankee protests aside, that this was Steinbrenner's way of preparing for the weekend against the Mets, by guaranteeing that the hapless Jeff Weaver would not be part of it. Steinbrenner would call this strategizing. Others might consider it an overreaction to his own uncontrolled fear of being embarrassed by the Mets. 
People say that Steinbrenner hates losing. And somehow, in an economic climate where so many don't have enough of a market or enough money to compete with him, this has become the sign of a great American sportsman. Commitment to excellence is one thing. Fear of a good fight is another. For all his demands that his players perform as if programmed to be a lineup of high-priced I.B.M. ThinkPads, Steinbrenner has demonstrated season after season that he is the first on his side to blow his hard drive.
Isn't the mental discipline the most remarkable aspect about those we watch on the grand stages of sport? They are, to varying degrees, all blessed with size and skills, but there is no creatine for the mind, and how they deal with the stress of competition is what makes them different. It doesn't take courage to throw a 3-2 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded. It does take composure, something Steinbrenner has only in his wildest dreams.
Watching his team calmly march into Shea Stadium and brush off the Mets, 5-0, Friday night, I recalled a quotation from a lengthy story in the New Yorker by John Cassidy; Steinbrenner was going on about his advantages over his more buttoned-down competitors.
"These days," Steinbrenner said, "there are not many sports owners who have ever worn the jockstrap."
The inference was that he had, though to what extent he never reveals, beyond convenient cliches. He ran track and won races. When he lost, his father, Henry, berated him, making him a better man for it.
What we really know is what we see, what we hear, what he expects. If Steinbrenner truly believes the Yankees should win the division by 10 games every season and then the World Series, it is because, far from a jockstrap, his only protection from life's more painful realities has been his wallet.
When he refuses to let Gene Michael become the general manager of the Red Sox, a job he can't have in the Bronx, Steinbrenner demonstrates more of a fear of losing than a love of winning. When he whines about having to play the Cubs while the Red Sox play the Brewers, he demeans the competitive nature of his team. Do you think Jason Giambi and Roger Clemens care about scheduling quirks? Do you think they were up nights worrying about the rotation resulting in Weaver against Tom Glavine, until Thursday's game magically disappeared?
Do you believe they are terrified, as Steinbrenner obviously is, of the Red Sox and the Blue Jays chasing them all the way into September and having to deal with the threat of not making the playoffs at all?
Sitting in the visiting manager's office after yesterday's game was called in the fourth inning, Torre sighed while revealing that the game would be made up Saturday as the nighttime end of a home-and-home doubleheader, like the 2000 spectacle eclipsed by Clemens's beaning of Mike Piazza. Here we go again, more profundity on the quaintness of transferring from the No. 4 line to the No. 7.
"I don't care for it," Torre said of the total concept of interleague play. "It's an inconvenience in that it takes games away against teams you need to beat to win your division."
In other words, bring it on, Toronto and Boston. Bring on the race, for as long as it may last, and the pressure of honest competition, as opposed to the garbage Steinbrenner supplies.
Maybe Torre has finally had it with Steinbrenner's ignorance of the process. I don't know the motivation for his recent Boss-baiting, but I do know that although players would rather win by 10 games, they welcome the kind of challenge that once defined the long baseball season and that made it so different from other team sports. The Derek Jeters and Alfonso Sorianos live for the nights when they can stun a packed stadium of Mets fans with back-to-back home runs, as they did Friday night.
Jeter took one on the left wrist yesterday from the Mets' starter, Jeremy Griffiths, and had a precautionary X-ray.
"Fifty-fifty," Torre said on the chances of Jeter facing Tom Glavine tonight.
"I'll play," Jeter declared. "I enjoy playing in big games."
Contrived or otherwise. Only the owner loses his cool when facing a tough fight and his own fear. He doesn't need a jockstrap to run the other way.

HEADLINE: City Ordered to Pay Owners of Midtown Hotel Millions in Tax Incentives 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
New York City improperly denied the owners of a Midtown Manhattan hotel tax incentives worth millions of dollars and will now have to pay back those lost benefits with interest -- despite the city's deep fiscal crisis -- an appeals court has ruled.
 The ruling, by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, could have a wide impact on future development in Manhattan, broadening the possibilities for projects involving the renovation of landmark properties attached to new structures. It also will put additional pressure on a city squeezed for tax revenues. 
 Lawyers for the city had argued that the legislation governing the tax-exemption program did not cover multiple parts of a single project like the hotel in the court case, now called the Millennium Broadway, which now consists of a historic theater and two new wings. 
"We strongly disagree with the court's decision and feel that three separate structures over two tax blocks cannot be treated as one building for tax-exempt purposes," Carl A. Laske, senior counsel, in the tax and bankruptcy division of the city's Law Department, said in a statement issued after the court decision was released last week.
The city is considering an appeal. 
The hotel first generated controversy before it was even built. In 1985, the New York developer Harry Macklowe partly demolished two single-room-occupancy hotels on 44th Street, just off Times Square, in the middle of the night to make way for the new construction.
That action led to a review of city regulations of the S.R.O.'s. Mr. Macklowe went on to build a 46-story, 627-room hotel on the site, then called the Hotel Macklowe. He incorporated the adjacent Hudson Theater, which was converted into a conference center for the hotel.
Mr. Macklowe had applied for and received a property tax abatement for the hotel and theater project under the Industrial and Commercial DevelopmentIncentive program. Started in 1984, the program was intended to stimulate economic development in the city by offering tax exemptions for new construction, modernization, rehabilitation or expansion of existing structures.
The program was adjusted in 1995, 1999 and 2000, and is set to be renewed at the end of this month. At the program's peak, in 1999, the city received 905 preliminary applications for tax relief, according to Finance Department records. In 2001, the program cost the city $1.76 million in tax revenue, but proponents say the projects generated far more than that in sales, salaries and other economic activity. 
Mr. Macklowe ran into financial difficulties and lost the hotel in 1994. It was bought late that year by the current owner, CDL Hotels USA Inc., an arm of the international hotel group. In 1997, CDL applied for a tax exemption on a 22-story addition to the hotel it built on the site of the old three-story building that had been the headquarters of the Newspaper Guild, the union representing reporters, editors and others.
The owners argued that the new structure was an integral part of the existing hotel and theater, to which it was connected on several floors. The new structure lacked its own cooling system, garbage storage space and other facilities, which led the owners to take the position that it was one of three parts that make up the Millennium hotel, at 145 West 44th Street.
The city's Finance Department denied the application because it considered the addition a separate building, which led the owners to go to court. After being denied in State Supreme Court, the owners appealed to the Appellate Division, which ruled in their favor. That opens the way for the owners to receive a partial reimbursement of taxes paid on the addition since 1997, plus interest.
One of the lawyers representing the owners, Charles G. Moerdler, of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, said that even though the city was in deep financial trouble, fairness required that the owners be granted the tax exemption and the repayment.
He said the city offered the incentives because it felt it had to create additional construction or renovation in Times Square. "That is a policy judgment made by the municipality," said Mr. Moerdler, a former commissioner of Housing and Buildings. If the city no longer wants to provide such economic stimulation, he said, it can repeal the incentive program. But until then, he said builders who comply with the regulations have a right to receive the promised tax exemptions.

Online Bond Tr ading Is Gaining, Despite the Bumps

BYLINE:  By HOWARD ISENSTEIN

 BODY:
RESEARCHING and trading stocks online became common in the long bull market. During the bond rally of the last three years, a small group of do-it-yourself investors has begun to assemble portfolios of bonds bought online. 
 Online bond trading remains cumbersome, partly because information about bonds is harder to find on the Internet than data about stocks. And unless investors restrict their online purchases to Treasury and Ginnie Mae issues, which are backed by the government, they will need to devote a lot of time to monitoring their portfolios, many advisers caution. 
 Numbers for the entire industry are not available, but Charles Schwab & Company, the big discount broker, says its clients now average 10,000 online bond trades a month, up from 1,000 in August 2000, when it began to offer the service. By contrast, Schwab clients made 143,990 trades of stocks or mutual funds online on an average day in March, the company said. 
Other companies offering bonds online include the E*Trade Group, Fidelity Investments, TD Waterhouse and Vanguard Brokerage Services. Investors can also turn to TreasuryDirect.gov to buy newly issued Treasury bills, notes and savings bonds from the government, and to www.internotes.com, owned by Incapital, and www.direct-notes.com, a unit of LaSalle Funding, to buy newly issued corporate bonds.
Brokerage firms began offering online bond trading as an outgrowth of online trading over the last four years among dealers and large institutional investors.
The shift toward electronic trading platforms has allowed individual investors to see thousands of prices in a more timely way, said Sang Lee, an analyst at Celent Communications, a financial services industry consulting firm based in Boston.
"There is a lot more transparency," he said.
Still, Web pages for bonds are more difficult to navigate than those devoted to stocks, partly because the bond sites are relatively new and not yet fully refined, and partly because of the nature of bonds. Unlike stocks, bonds do not have ticker symbols. To find bonds, search engines use the name of the issuer as well as the bond's maturity, coupon, rating and other criteria. 
At some sites, not all bond trades can be made online. At Vanguard's site, for example, customers can research corporate bonds online but must call to execute an order; Treasury issues, however, may be bought online. 
Investors who buy in bulk can get better yields. For example, at 1:30 p.m. on Friday an investor on Schwab.com seeking to buy just one AAA-rated bond from GE Capital, due on Jan. 19, 2010, with a coupon of 7.375 percent, would receive a yield to maturity of 2.689 percent; someone buying 20 bonds would get a yield to maturity of 3.427 percent. Bond prices move inversely to their yield; a bond generally has a face value of $1,000.
Quoted yields reflect a small markup by the broker. Some firms also charge explicit commissions. In looking for the best deal, investors should calculate the yield after commissions are taken into account.
APRUDENT way to invest in individual bonds is through a strategy called laddering, said John Ladensack, executive vice president for fixed income at Schwab in Jersey City. To start building a laddered portfolio, an investor buys a collection of bonds with different maturities spread over a given time frame. For instance, in a five-year laddered portfolio, an investor buys bonds that mature in one, two, three, four and five years. When the first bond matures in a year, the investor reinvests in one that matures in five years, maintaining the ladder. By doing so, the investor seeks to diversify risk over time while keeping income relatively stable.
To minimize risk, most people who want to assemble bond portfolios on their own should stick to Treasuries or to securities issued by Ginnie Mae, said both Mr. Ladensack and Guy M. Cumbie, a certified financial planner and principal of Cumbie Advisory Services in Fort Worth. Ginnie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association, offers government backing for its bonds.
Mr. Cumbie suggests that investors need at least $50,000 to buy enough bonds, from different issuers and with different maturities, to achieve enough diversification. Schwab research, however, suggests that an investor can get enough diversification with 8 to 10 bonds, so investors can start with as little as $10,000, Mr. Ladensack said. 
An investor buying Treasury or Ginnie Mae issues can get decent prices even when buying so few bonds, but those interested in municipal bonds should have at least $50,000, because prices of municipal bonds are not as competitive, Mr. Ladensack said.
Still, buying individual bonds may not make sense for all investors, Mr. Cumbie said. Such purchases can be useful if an investor wants to lock in a specific amount of income over a particular period, or is seeking a set amount of money at a certain time for a specific objective, like paying for a child's education, he said. But investors seeking the highest total return -- interest income and capital gains from buying and selling bonds -- should probably invest in a bond mutual fund or a managed portfolio of bonds because monitoring a bond portfolio "certainly requires more competence or a heck of a lot more energy" than many people have, Mr. Cumbie said.
Mark Kiesel, an executive vice president of the Pacific Investment Management Company and a senior member of its investment strategy and portfolio management group, cautioned individual investors to be very careful if they want to buy bonds.
"The benefit of mutual funds is that you're buying a manager's expertise," Mr. Kiesel said. "You need an active manager" to buy and sell different maturities and classes of bonds over time, based on the changing economic environment, he said. 
Mr. Ladensack said people shouldn't trade bonds online in hopes of making a quick killing.
"You don't buy bonds to get rich, you buy bonds to stay rich," he said.

HEADLINE: Into the Politics of Economics 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FEW people try to get the attention of the president of the United States by tugging on the bottom of his suit jacket until he looks their way. But Peter Mankiw had an important message to deliver, and he was not going to let diplomatic procedure, or the president's personal space, get in the way.
 So, after President Bush had sworn in Peter's father, Gregory, as the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers last month, Peter, who is 4 years old, made a run for the presidential coat. 
 "Don't be mean to my daddy," he said, aware that, if nothing else, the man to whom he was speaking seemed like one of the few people who could tell his daddy what to do.
The president, looking downward, quickly spelled out his conditions. "As long as the economy improves," he told Peter, according to Gregory Mankiw. 
In his very first minutes on the job, Mr. Mankiw was hearing one of the two main yardsticks of his success -- the one over which he is likely to have relatively little control. His son was demonstrating the other: getting the president's ear as often as possible. 
A popular professor at Harvard who is quick to smile, and the author of a best-selling economics textbook, Mr. Mankiw has come to Washington to fill a job that was once held by Alan Greenspan and that has had a resurgence of influence in the Bush administration. Mr. Mankiw's predecessor, R. Glenn Hubbard, was a main architect of the three tax cuts passed in the last three years, and his handiwork was particularly obvious in the recent reduction in dividend taxes.
In his first interview in his new job, Mr. Mankiw (pronounced man-CUE) said those tax cuts were a major reason that economic growth was on the verge of improving, effectively tying the Bush administration to the economy as the 2004 campaign begins.
"I have no doubt that tax cuts will lead to higher growth," said Mr. Mankiw, 45, whose tousled dark hair and round, boyish face are set off by square eyeglasses. "Each quarter going forward is going to look better. By the end of the year, we will see growth above potential," causing the unemployment rate to drop.
Nicholas Gregory Mankiw grew up in North Jersey, the son of a teacher and an engineer who was active in the local Republican Party. He made his name in academia by writing about a great range of subjects and won tenure at Harvard before turning 30. Although his academic reputation remains excellent, his peers no longer see him as one of the members of his generation most likely to win a Nobel in economics, probably because his textbook writing has at times drawn him away from research.
His emphasis on the private sector and the forces that shape long-term growth, as opposed to government spending and the business cycle, made him a natural choice to lend intellectual cachet to a Republican White House. This administration is still looking for an economic spokesman with the credibility of Robert E. Rubin, a Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. 
BEYOND the chance for good timing, Mr. Mankiw brings one clear advantage to the job, in which he oversees a staff of about 35 and serves as one of the president's chief economic advisers. Unlike most academics, he has devoted hundreds of hours to distilling complicated ideas for general audiences -- through writing both the introductory textbook and an intermediate one, and through a column he wrote for Fortune magazine from 1997 to 2000. 
"Greg is broadly in ideological sympathy with the president," said J. Bradford DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and an ecomonic aide in Clinton administration. "And Greg is absolutely the best at describing economic principles in ways that make them seem necessary truths of nature."
Mr. Mankiw said he considered his new job "similar to textbook writing in a way." His audience is now policy makers, not college freshmen.
A big test for him, many economists say, is whether he will have an influence on what they consider the fiscal excesses of the Bush administration that have led to soaring deficits. In part because he has warned in his writings of the dangers of deficits, he is considered to be somewhat less enamored of tax cuts than Mr. Hubbard was. In 2000, Mr. Mankiw also wrote a column in Fortune that, while full of praise for Mr. Bush, said that his discussion of Social Security exaggerated how easy reform would be.
But whether Mr. Mankiw tries to shape the administration's message or simply amplify its current one, hefaces hurdles that many previous council chairmen did not. He has few previous ties to the administration, which is known for being centralized. 
Success "really depends very much on the relationship between the individual and the president," Mr. Hubbard said. "As I've told Greg privately, he really has to work to build that relationship."
He has also arrived at a time when the economy has surprised almost all forecasters with its persistent sluggishness, having lost 2.4 million jobs since Mr. Bush became president. Although the slowdown began on Mr. Clinton's watch, White House aides remain worried that voters might punish Mr. Bush if he becomes the first president since Herbert Hoover to oversee a decline in employment during an entire term. 
These concerns will almost certainly complicate Mr. Mankiw's job by requiring him to advise Mr. Bush on some issues, like the deficit and trade policy, in which good economics and good politics might argue for different solutions.
Mr. Mankiw got a taste of those tensions in the early 1980's as a junior staff member for Martin Feldstein, another Harvard professor, who was then serving as the council's chairman. By warning of the downsides of big deficits, Mr. Feldstein burnished his academic reputation but became a pariah within the Reagan administration.
Some Republicans worry that Mr. Mankiw has the potential for similar mischief. In the first edition of his textbook, "Principles of Economics" (1998), he dismissed as "charlatans and cranks" the supply-side economists close to Ronald Reagan who argued that tax cuts could pay for themselves by creating enough economic growth. The second edition, in 2001, omitted the section because people misinterpreted it as critical of tax cuts, Mr. Mankiw said., But the book still says that the "most basic lesson about budget deficits" is that they cause interest rates to rise and investment to fall.
The deficit is on pace to reach $410 billion in the current fiscal year, according to J. P. Morgan Chase. Three years ago, the government ran a surplus of $237 billion.
Reclining in one of the cushioned chairs in his office, with his long right arm reaching down to a bottle of water sitting on the floor, Mr. Mankiw said he still believed that lower taxes and a smaller government would lift economic growth by allowing the market to dictate decisions. The deficit is likely to shrink over the next 5 or 10 years because of the higher growth, he added. 
"I've expressed skepticism that tax cuts fully pay for themselves," he said. "But I have no doubt they partly pay for themselves."
WITH major parts of the recent tax cut set to take effect on July 1, interest rates still low and layoffs showing signs of slowing, consumer spending is likely to rise, Mr. Mankiw said. That increase would make companies more profitable and help persuade executives to end the long slump in business investment in the wake of the 1990's boom. 
Mr. Mankiw's forecasting record is hardly perfect. In the late 80's, he wrote a paper suggesting that the aging of the baby boomers could cause housing prices to decline 50 percent, adjusted for inflation, over the next two decades. But he has spotted an economic turning point before. When Mr. Clinton took office in 1993 and began studying how to stimulate the economy, Mr. Mankiw correctly said that it was recovering on its own. 
Over the long term, closing the budget deficit, which he called important, will require changing Medicare or Social Security, he said. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked Mr. Mankiw during his confirmation hearing whether these changes were the same as cuts, and he essentially avoided the question.
Many economists outside the administration predict that the recent tax cuts will eventually have to be reversed or require big reductions in government programs. 
Mr. Mankiw is clearly making an effort to remain consistent with the administration's message in a way that he did not as a professor. Asked about the recent controversy over a tax credit for poor families that was not included in the tax cut this spring, he started to speak, interrupted himself and looked at a White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, who was sitting in on the interview. Ms. Buchan then said that Ari Fleischer, the press secretary, had addressed the issue in his briefing that day.
BECOMING a confidant of Mr. Bush, however, will require more than just avoiding headlines. While Mr. Hubbard, the previous council chairman, worked on the 2000 campaign. Mr. Mankiw first met the president, briefly, at an economic summit in Waco, Tex., last year. The man who recommended him for the job, Mr. Hubbard, is now a professor at Columbia.
Making the task harder, Mr. Mankiw's staff members have recently lost their offices in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House, and been relocated to the decidedly unprestigious address of 1800 G Street NW. Other groups that have been pushed out of the Eisenhower building -- still commonly known as the Old Executive Office Building, include the White House Travel Office and the Office of Presidential Correspondence. Parts of the National Security Council were allowed to stay.
"The biggest effect will be on the morale of the council," said Martin N. Baily, the last council chairman in the Clinton administration. "I can't help but think that the separation will make it tougher on Greg."
Alone among the council staff, Mr. Mankiw still has an office in the Eisenhower building, as well as one in the nondescript building on G Street, where Mr. Bush swore him in. Mr. Mankiw talked about the relocation of his staff with typical good humor. "I get a lot more exercise," he said, by walking between the two offices a couple of times a day. 
Since it was created by the 1946 Employment Act, the Council of Economic Advisers, or C.E.A., has risen and fallen in status several times. Harry Truman had little use for it. Walter Heller, the chairman for John F. Kennedy, helped design a major tax cut. Mr. Greenspan mattered in part because he and Gerald Ford watched football games together, according to the late Herbert Stein, who also held the job under Mr. Ford. 
Mr. Clinton seemed to diminish the council by creating a separate group, the National Economic Council, that coordinates policy from the West Wing. Mr. Bush kept the group intact, and Stephen J. Friedman, a former Goldman Sachs executive, now runs it. Before sitting down with the president, Mr. Mankiw had to interview with Mr. Friedman. But the fact that Mr. Friedman is not an academic economist makes it less probable that Mr. Mankiw will be overshadowed by him. 
Mr. Mankiw said he envisioned his staff as a "think tank" that allows members of the administration to tap into the vast but often indecipherable world of economic research. 
He left little doubt, for example, that he would argue against trade tariffs and subsidies, saying that economists were nearly unanimous in favoring lower trade barriers. At the urging of some political advisers, but over the objections of Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Bush enacted new protections for American farmers and steel makers last year.
"The job of the C.E.A. is to present good economic analysis in a way that is understandable and persuasive to noneconomists," Mr. Mankiw said. But, he added, "ultimately the world is not run by economists."

WHAT HIS STUDENTS SAYIn his most recent class, students gave Mr. Mankiw a rating of 4.3 out of a possible 5. The two other professors teaching the class received lower grades. HIS MONEYMr. Mankiw received a $1.4 million advance to write "Principles of Economics" in the 1990's, considered the biggest ever for an economics textbook. His annual salary at Harvard, from which he is now on leave, was $164,981. His financial holdings are worth $1.5 million to $4.2 million, according to a government disclosure form. While many are in mutual funds, he also owns stock in Boeing, Berkshire Hathaway, Microsoft, Schering-Plough, SBC Communications, Wal-Mart and other large companies. HIS RESEARCHHe has written about the reasons that prices do not change as quickly as economic theory suggests they should, about the way that people allocate their assets and about the founding of the Federal Reserve. Other work looked at the role that education played in the economic growth of different countries. HIS BEST FRIENDMr. Mankiw's Harvard Web site still refers to his deceased dog -- a Border terrier named Keynes after the famous economist -- as his best friend. A picture of the dog appears with the caption, "Are you feeling full of animal spirits?" -- a reference to one of Keynes's most famous concepts. (pg. 10)

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: DISORDER; 
Across Iraq, the Dark Shadow Of Hussein Still Looms Large

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 21 

 BODY:
Professor Hilal al-Bayyati, the former director of Iraq's National Computer Center, is moving out of the country this fall because he does not want to live in fear of Saddam Hussein.
 "I had thought about entering politics, though I am not a politician, but then I thought I did not want to put my family through the risk that someone would come one day and kill me," Professor Bayyati said in an interview. "So I will leave until it is safe to come back." 
 As Mr. Hussein's rule collapsed, Professor Bayyati came to prominence when he led a revolt at Baghdad University against the administration that was dominated by senior members of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party. 
Motivated by two years of prison and torture under Mr. Hussein, Professor Bayyati was determined to help rid the country -- or at least the university -- of the remnants of the dictator's most ardent supporters.
But now he thinks the effort is failing, or going too slow. What really bothers the professor is that more than two months on, the specter of Saddam Hussein still lays across the land in Iraq.
Despite the presence of 140,000 American troops, Professor Bayyati and many other Iraqis of assorted political outlooks feel no sense of a consolidated victory. They see no power emerging that is capable of stamping out the vestige of the once all-powerful Mr. Hussein.
The attacks on American forces that have left 13 soldiers dead in the past month and the apparent sabotage against electrical and oil installations critical to economic and social recovery are feeding a new psychology of fear in Iraq.
Professor Bayyati, one of thousands of Mr. Hussein's victims, is taking the personal step of leaving because he fears becoming a victim again. "I think it will get worse if there is no real action taken," he said, referring to the so far unsuccessful efforts to disarm thousands of Husseinloyalists.
Many of Mr. Hussein's supporters are believed to have access to hidden funds and hidden weapons. Thousands of people have been denied access to government jobs because of their high rank in the Baath Party, but they remain free to subvert the status quo if they choose.
When crowds form these days in the capital, the loudest voices are often those of Mr. Hussein's supporters. Those who speak against the ousted leader often do so by pulling reporters aside to speak in whispered tones or in English, so that most bystanders cannot understand.
On a recent afternoon at Jassim's, a coffee house on the corner of Safina and Al Hara streets in the Khadamiya district of the city, Mohsen Abdel Hassan, 65, was going on about how much he hated Mr. Hussein.
He pulled out a box cutter and said, "If I were to see him, I would slit his throat," as he lightly pulled the blade across his own neck.
But when a man with close-cropped hair and a military bearing walked up to listen to Mr. Abdel Hassan's conversation with a foreign reporter, the conversation froze.
After the man walked away, Mr. Abdel Hassan arched his brow and explained his momentary silence. "He looked like a Baathist to me," he said. "They are not very easy people and they still exist."
Many Iraqis presume that Mr. Hussein prepared hiding places long in advance of the American and British invasion. They imagine him on a farm along the Euphrates River, in a house in a Baghdad suburb or in a military dugout protected by loyal aides, and those images still radiate a sense of power over Iraqis.
The capture this week of Mr. Hussein's closest aide, Abid Hamid Mahmoud al-Tikriti, sent a shiver of hope through the ranks of Iraqis who fear his ability to threaten their future.
Galab Sadiq Muhammmad has been baking bread since the time of the monarchy in Iraq four decades ago. Nowadays, he sits on a bench under an acacia tree most afternoons and drinks sweetened tea.
The only remedy that would rid the country of Mr. Hussein's shadow, he said, was a new Iraqi government that would project itself clearly and forcefully across an unruly land of ethnic and religious division.
"Whoever comes, we will call him father," he said as he ordered tea for a visitor.
The power of the fallen dictator appears sometimes in surprising places. Sadiq Abdel Amir, a Shiite Muslim and 23-year veteran of the Iraqi Air Force, was drummed out of the service after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 because the loyalty of all Shiites was suspect after hundreds of thousands rebelled against the government across southern Iraq.
Yet he was thinking about Mr. Hussein last week as the antidote for the disorder and chaos that Mr. Amir sees in the country. "We need Saddam Hussein with his iron fist," he said as he stood in the middle of the Jumhuriya Bridge across the Tigris River.
As Mr. Amir spoke, he was distracted by something in the river below. There, moving with the stream, was the body of a man in black trousers, floating face down.
No one was doing anything to retrieve the body. There were no Iraqi police officers in the area, no rescue squad or boat to recover the body making its silent and uninterrupted passage through the center of the city that is still largely lawless because there is no government.
The limits of American and British occupation authority were evident on the bridge that morning. There is an army of 55,000 here more than able to secure the streets with its tanks and mobile howitzers, but it is unable to protect Iraqis in their homes from random crimes, or, perhaps, from the the vengeance of Mr. Hussein.
Mr. Amir was making the bridge crossing as he fled a demonstration of former Iraqi Army officers demanding back pay. An American soldier had fired into the crowd, killing two of the demonstrators.
Mr. Amir gestured toward the body in the river as if it contributed to his point about the search for order. "We need someone with Saddam Hussein's power and his strength to control everything in Iraq," he said before uncertainly making his way across the span toward home.

HEADLINE: Criticism of Drug Benefit Is Simple: It's Bewildering 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
With both houses of Congress poised to pass a Medicare drug bill next week, lawmakers are increasingly anxious about the complexity of the legislation and its reliance on new and largely untested arrangements to deliver drug benefits to the elderly.
 This complexity, they say, may be daunting and confusing to beneficiaries, and even to insurance companies, which are supposed to manage the new benefits. Many lawmakers say they have just begun to examine the bill's intricate details and the web of political compromises behind those provisions. 
 Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, lamented the bill's "high level of complexity and prescriptiveness." Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said it would create "a Medicare maze, a whole new bureaucracy." 
Under the legislation, the elderly would face a series of decisions. They could stay with traditional fee-for-service Medicare or join a private plan. They could get care through a preferred provider organization, a health maintenance organization or other private plans, all conceivably with different rules and benefits, but supervised by a new federal agency.
If beneficiaries choose to stay with traditional Medicare and want to obtain drug coverage, they would buy it through private insurers offering "drug only" plans, a form of insurance that is not now generally available. The coverage and the premiums could vary, depending on the plan, as long as the "actuarial value" is equivalent to that of standard coverage described in the legislation. If fewer than two private plans enter a geographic region, the government would step in, under the Senate bill, and offer a "fallback plan." And much of this could change each year.
"You can have a circumstance in which a senior is in four different plans in four years, with different co-pays, different premiums and different drugs provided for, with different rules about what druggist they can go to," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota. "That's a lot of chaos and a lot of confusion."
Despite his reservations, Mr. Conrad is one of many Democrats who plan to vote for the bill, which they see as an opportunity to get $400 billion worth of assistance for the elderly in the next 10 years. Republicans see it as a chance to inject market forces into Medicare while showing their commitment to the elderly on an issue that has long favored Democrats.
The goals sound simple, but translating them into practice is difficult. The House and Senate bills are studded with arcane language like actuarial equivalence, risk corridors and sliding-scale premium subsidies.
Much of the complexity results from an effort to find a grand compromise on one of the longest-running divisions in American social policy: how much to trust the government and how much to trust the market. New rules to protect beneficiaries are grafted onto a bill intended to create a vibrant new health insurance market for the elderly.
The House and the Senate, urged on by President Bush, are expected to pass similar versions of the legislation before the Fourth of July recess, leaving differences to be ironed out in later weeks.
Some lawmakers point out that complexity is nothing new in American health care. "Medicare, by definition, is an incredibly complex mosaic," said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire. "It's got tens of thousands of moving parts. Any legislation dealing with it will have to be complex."
Still, lawmakers say, the 654-page Senate bill is a formidable challenge. "No one understands what the heck this bill says or will do," Mr. Gregg said as he emerged from a Republican caucus this week. 
Representative Cal Dooley, Democrat of California, said, "People will have to have an accountant to figure out what the premiums are and what the benefits are." Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said he was "still trying to understand the Rube Goldberg way the bill was put together."
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, a strong critic of the bill, said, "You're going to make a huge change in an entitlement program, and you don't even know how it would work, if it would work."
Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress say the government can pay for prescription drugs, but it must not set prices. Democrats say Medicare should use its vast purchasing power to get the best prices it can. The legislation reflects both aims.
Edmund F. Haislmaier, a health policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, said he was amazed at "the intricacy of the statutory provisions and the breadth of the regulatory authority" given to federal officials under the Senate bill.
For example, he said, insurers and health plans would negotiate prices with drug companies. The government would calculate "the average negotiated price" for each drug dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries each year. Medicare could refuse to pay costs exceeding the average.
Finding a middle way between a government-run program and an unfettered private market will mean big changes for beneficiaries.
Under existing law, most Medicare beneficiaries pay the same premium, $58.70 a month, and have access to the same benefits. By contrast, under the bills speeding through Congress, the drug benefits could vary. Conservatives say they hope insurers will vie with one another to offer different packages of drug benefits tailored to the needs of different beneficiaries.
Budget constraints have created some confusing anomalies. The House and Senate bills both include a gap in coverage, known as a doughnut hole. Beneficiaries would pay premiums every month, but would not receive insurance for drug expenses in a certain range: $4,500 to $5,813 a year under the Senate bill, $2,000 to $4,900 under the House bill. Coverage would resume after drug costs exceeded those levels.
A major goal of the Medicare bill for many lawmakers is to encourage private health plans known as preferred provider organizations. But after studying the complex payment formula, preferred provider organizations cannot say whether it would be economically feasible to operate in the Medicare market. "The legislation includes a lot of very creative and complex ideas," said Diana C. Dennett, executive vice president of the American Association of Health Plans. "It's taking time to understand how all the pieces fit together."
Here is one example, from the Senate bill, that illustrates the complexity: The new benchmark for paying preferred provider plans would be the greater of local fee-for-service costs (excluding graduate medical education) or the amount now paid to health maintenance organizations for each Medicare beneficiary.
Senator Craig, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said: "The bill unwisely imposes a ceiling, or benchmark, on the amount the federal government will pay the new Medicare plans. It creates an unnecessarily heavy-handed and restrictive bidding system."
Still, health policy experts said, big social programs have often been enacted in a flawed or confusing form, and Congress tinkers with them in later years. "The history of most great social legislation in our country, including Medicare and Medicaid, is ready, fire, aim," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The difference here is that there's such sharp disagreement about the direction we are aiming in."

 The Riverhead Development Corporation has given a preliminary approval to a New York City investment group that wants to build an amusement park, hotel and conference center on nearly half the former Grumman property in Calverton, the director of the town agency that owns the property said Wednesday.
 The investment group, known as FRP, received approval on Monday from the development corporation, which was set up to screen proposals for the Calverton site after the Town of Riverhead obtained it from the Grumman Corporation in 1994. The amusement complex would cost $60 million, Newsday reported on Wednesday. 
 Developers have submitted more than 50 proposals for the Grumman tract since 1994, said Andrea Lohneiss, the director of the Riverhead Community Development Agency, which owns the property. Until now, all of the plans have fallen through, she said. 
The current proposal does not require zoning variances, Ms. Lohneiss said, and for that reason it stands a better chance of receiving the necessary approvals and permits. She said the Town Board could begin negotiations immediately with the investment group. She would not identify the individual investors. 

Standard Microsystems' Profit
The Standard Microsystems Corporation (Nasdaq: SMSC) of Hauppauge said on Monday that revenues for its fiscal first quarter rose 26 percent to $42.7 million, producing a profit of $1.7 million, or 11 cents a share. The quarter's performance exceeded the company's expectations; it had originally expected to pay shareholders 6 cents a share. 
During the same period last year the company reported revenues of $34 million and a profit of $352,000. 
Steven J. Bilodeau, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected the company's expansion into new markets and growth in existing markets. The company is also selling more higher-margin products. 
Standard Microsystems develops hardware and software that support computer networks. 

Senior Officer at Symbol
Symbol Technologies (NYSE: SBL) of Holtsville has named Todd Hewlin as the senior vice president of the company's global products group, Symbol said on Tuesday. 
Mr. Hewlin had been the managing partner in the Chasm Group, a computer consultant in San Mateo, Calif.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
McGreevey's Ace in the Hole Turns Out to Be the Donald

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
If you're an elected official struggling with lousy approval ratings, one of the most reliable ways to improve your poll numbers is to pick a high-profile fight with someone even more unpopular.
 So Governor McGreevey must have felt lucky indeed this year when New Jersey's fiscal problems allowed him to portray himself as David battling the Goliath of Atlantic City casinos. 
 Trying to fill a projected budget shortfall of $5 billion, the governor proposed an assortment of increased taxes, including $135 million in new levies from casinos. The industry reacted with a furor, canceling construction projects, threatening layoffs and broadcasting radio ads that accused Mr. McGreevey of undermining the economic security of South Jersey. 
 To the governor -- whose personal foibles and budget-related troubles are so protracted that a Quinnipiac University poll this month found that only 24 percent of the respondents want him re-elected -- the opportunity was simply too rich to resist. 
 The Democratic State Committee began broadcasting response ads that featured the governor warning New Jerseyans that casino executives were trying to foist their tax bills off on middle-class families and the elderly. Even Republicans conceded that it was smart politics for Mr. McGreevey to cast himself as a the workingman's defender against a group of people who inspire almost as much mistrust as politicians: casino owners
 Unfortunately for Mr. McGreevey, he wasn't able to hold that moral high ground for long. No sooner had the governor's ads begun to run than the administration and Democratic legislators made a series of policy decisions that left Mr. McGreevey accused of kowtowing to the one man who embodies all that is excessive about Atlantic City -- Donald Trump.
 Less than a week after the governor began broadcasting his ads, the Division of Gaming Enforcement abruptly stopped challenging the financially viability of Mr. Trump's three heavily leveraged casinos, which are up for relicensing this month. The state had hired an accounting firm to analyze the finances, but the decision to drop the challenge will now spare Mr. Trump the ordeal of defending his finances during the licensing process.
 Mr. Trump, never known for his discretion with the media, was soon quoted in newspapers throughout the state urging the casino industry association to stop running the anti-McGreevey radio ads and threatening to quit the group unless they did. Then last Sunday, the governor and Democratic lawmakers agreed on a budget proposal that would settle for $90 million in additional revenue from casinos, but base the tax on casino profits on a formula that many political strategists say will help Mr. Trump because two of his properties are losing money.
 The McGreevey administration contends that all of the decisions were sound policy. But those arguments have not stopped Republicans from accusing Mr. McGreevey of giving Mr. Trump a sweetheart deal. In fact, when the governor held a news conference on Thursday to outline his budget plan, there was an ominous presence in the back of the room: Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican of Atlantic County, who is the casino industry's most boisterous supporter. 
 Once the governor finished his presentation, Mr. Gormley held an impromptu news conference and lambasted the casino tax plan as a boondoggle that would reward Mr. Trump for failing to turn a profit.
 "This is ludicrous policy because it will cost jobs," Mr. Gormley said. "And it's terrible politics because they've given me a villain, Donald Trump."
 Because casino taxes are one of the most bitter issues during this budget season, the McGreevey administration's actions have set off a variety of convoluted explanations. Some political strategists believe the governor was trying to split his adversaries in the casino industry and found a willing ally in Mr. Trump. 
 Others suggest that Mr. Trump has leveraged his friendship with George Norcross III, the bank executive and Democratic Party power broker, into a favorable piece of legislation. (Mr. Trump says he did not take an active role in negotiating the casino tax plan; Mr. Norcross did not return phone calls requesting comment.)
 Whatever may have caused the administration's recent policy decisions regarding Mr. Trump and the rest of Atlantic City, its effect is to leave Mr. McGreevey with a newfound ally whose paltry standing in public opinion polls actually rival his own.
 For his part, Mr. Trump insists he never received favorable treatment and maintains that his prominence has actually brought him far more scrutiny than other casino executives.
 "I get worse treatment because I'm Donald Trump," he said in a telephone interview last week.
 Perhaps. But it's doubtful the governor will be using that sound bite in his radio ads any time soon.

HEADLINE: EXECUTIVE LIFE: THE BOSS; 
A Tree Grows in Brazil

BYLINE:  By ALAIN J. P. BELDA; Written with Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
MY mother was Portuguese and my father was Spanish. I was born in Morocco, but we moved to Brazil when I was 3. Then, when I was 13, my father, who was a specialist in turning around businesses, saw an opportunity in Canada, so we moved to Montreal. Four years later, he was killed in a head-on collision with a truck, and my mother, sister, two brothers and I moved back to Brazil. By this time, I spoke Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and English. 
 In my first job, I was a sales assistant for a Brazilian chemical company. My boss was a Hungarian who gave management lessons in parables. I remember his saying that a lazy employee is like a prophet. He meant that by the time the lazy employee completes a project, it is no longer of any use to the boss. Therefore, he is a prophet: he has predicted his work won't be needed. 
 When I was about 28 and based with Alcoa in Sao Paulo, I went to a management training course in the United States. Lester Thurow, the economist, was there, and Daniel Bell, the sociologist, spoke about ethics. My colleagues were all Americans who had lived only in the United States and whose view of the world was purely from that perspective. Until then, I had always complained to my parents about moving around so much. But now I realized I had different ways of seeing the world; I knew how the Portuguese and Spanish and Brazilians and Canadians thought, too. It was an exceptional perception for me, and I went home and thanked my mother.
About 12 years ago, during a time of economic upheaval in Brazil, I visited Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao, a major processor and manufacturer of niobium, a steel alloy, and an Alcoa customer. I was invited to plant a tree at one of their factories. The new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, had just frozen all bank accounts. Alcoa Aluminio, the subsidiary of which I was president, was left with $15,000 of unfrozen assets for company expenses and to meet payrolls. At such an uncertain, nerve-racking time, it struck me that by dedicating this living thing in this way, Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao was making a symbolic statement of hope. It was saying that this moment would pass. And it was connecting the two companies together and to the future. I was very moved.
I took a spade and planted a 5-foot high sapling of a Brazilian hardwood tree. I have returned to visit my tree many times. When there is time, I go and look at it. It is now 23 feet tall and thriving. Every once in a while, the company sends me a picture. I have about five or six pictures at different stages of its growth in a scrapbook. It reminds me of the crisis we went through and how we survived and prospered. When a crisis seems insurmountable, it is good to think about the tree.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Short on cash, municipalities are renting out public spaces to marketers.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THIS property for rent. That's what an increasing number of strapped municipalities are proclaiming to Madison Avenue as they make available for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes an expanding range of public places -- whether zoos, parks and train stations, or museums, piers and beaches.
 And while you still may not be able to fight City Hall, in some instances you can rent it for an event. 
 The trend reflects cities' search for revenue alternatives to taxes as well as marketers' quest for alternatives to traditional advertising. The blue-chip companies using public spaces for private purposes -- like the Bronx Zoo, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas and City Hall in Beverly Hills, Calif. -- include AOL Time Warner, Advance Publications, American Express, DaimlerChrysler, Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, Unilever and Volkswagen. 
But as the practice grows in popularity, it is coming under scrutiny from critics who decry what they see as the intensifying commercialization of everyday life.
"We call it the city-for-sale phenomenon," said Gary Ruskin, the executive director at Commercial Alert in Portland, Ore., an organization dedicated to fighting what he terms ad creep. "Every one of these is a victory of crass commercialism over local values."
"Places like parks are intended to be sanctuaries from the more noxious aspects of our commercial culture, refuges from the hustle and bustle of marketing," he added. "Instead, they're now degraded into huckstering, up for bid to the corporations with the deepest pockets."
The fees paid by marketers, agencies and other private, profit-making companies to rent public spaces can vary from a few hundred dollars to a few hundred thousand. Factors include the prominence of the location, how often it is used for such events, the duration of the event and the nature of the promotion.
For instance, while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City charges $20,000 to rent Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal for an evening, the fee was $75,000 for a two-week exhibit of photographs, "Faces of Ground Zero," presented by Time magazine and sponsored by Morgan Stanley four months after Sept. 11.
"This is money put back into the system," said Tom Kelly, chief spokesman for the authority. "That point should never be lost." The authority expects to raise $1.3 million this year from renting Vanderbilt Hall for such purposes, up from $1.26 million in 2002 and $1.2 million in 2001.
Marketers must follow guidelines, Mr. Kelly said, that limit the advertising aspects of their tenancy by governing the size and number of banners and signs as well as the contents.
"The standards in effect are what would be tasteful," he added, "given the setting."
Advertisers say they are willing to adhere to strictures they would not otherwise consider in exchange for the chance to appear in prestigious public spaces.
"We put up some banners, in a tasteful, tactful way -- no 'sale' signs, nothing tacky," said Dale Persons, a vice president at the Viking Range Corporation in Greenwood, Miss., a sponsor with Bon Appetit magazine of a six-city promotional tour, Wine and Spirits Focus, that stops at public sites like Navy Pier in Chicago.
"These types of venues are lots of times more exciting and interesting than convention halls," Mr. Persons said. "There's an appeal, a natural connection that touches the upscale consumers who buy our upscale major appliances, cookware and cutlery."
Mary Ann Wilson, the national advertising manager at Audi of America in Auburn Hills, Mich., agreed. Audi, which is part of Volkswagen, is sponsoring, with Bon Appetit and 14 other magazines published by Advance, a campaign to introduce the 2004 Audi A8 L that includes the projection of images by Lucette de Rugy, an artistic light producer, onto such buildings as the Meyerson Center and the Beverly Hills City Hall in five cities.
"We don't see it as being commercialized," Ms. Wilson said. "It certainly is not a sell message. It's an artistic gift to a city."
Just as the cities help Audi by making the public spaces available, Ms. Wilson said, Audi helps the cities by sponsoring events that are "revitalizing downtown districts that could use it."
"The Arts District in Dallas is not exactly a hustling, bustling place," she added.
San Diego may be hustling more than any American city to solicit corporate marketing partners, raising more than $5 million since 2000 from companies like Global Safety Products, which supplies plastic gloves for dog walkers in city parks, and PepsiCo, which supplies all the soft-drink vending machines on city property.
"Oh, almost every day I get a call from a city that wants to know what we're doing," said Mary Braunwarth, the development director for the City of San Diego. "I wouldn't say that in a perfect world we wouldn't do this, and it's not a panacea," she said. "But if done correctly and appropriately, it can bring in revenue to pay for existing activities or for new programs that would be difficult to fund."
"I personally feel commercial advertising in public spaces is not appropriate, and that is the sense of the community we live in," she added. "But there are ways to involve the corporate sector by being creative, without having to cross the line into exploitation."
One city that needs no help from marketers to hustle and bustle is New York, which is reassessing its policies toward the use of public spaces for private purposes as part of a review of all municipal efforts to raise money through sponsorships, licensing, merchandising and marketing.
"New York City has one of the great brands of the world," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. "But how do you effectively use it to generate revenue?"
"A classic case, where we wrestled with all the issues, was the National Football League Kickoff in Times Square," Mr. Doctoroff said, referring to an event last September commemorating the start of the 2002-2003 football season. While "it's hard to overly commercialize Times Square," he added, laughing, it did require closing the area for the first time in the afternoon and evening of a day that was not New Year's Eve.
"The N.F.L. paid a lot of money -- $10 million worth of advertising time to promote New York City and $5 million in contributions to 9/11-related activities," Mr. Doctoroff said. "But it clearly was disruptive to Broadway and the restaurants."
"It made a lot of sense to do last year, because it was an important watershed in terms of people's images of New York shifting from looking back at Sept. 11 to looking ahead," he added. "That said, we won't do it again this year if Times Square and Broadway do not agree."

HEADLINE: Opera's Balancing Act, St. Louis-Style; 
Managers From Across the Country Consider Blending the Old and the New

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, June 20 

 BODY:
Another festival, another "Tosca." Or so the jaded opera lover, freshly arrived in St. Louis, might think. To someone who has spent years going to the opera, "Tosca" can display traits in common with "The Rocky Horror Picture Show": the same gestures done in the same costumes to the same music, over and over and over.
 Then the curtain went up -- well, no. At the Opera Theater of St. Louis, now in its 28th season (through June 29), there is no curtain: the stage thrusts out into the intimate 987-seat auditorium. But the lights went up, and Angelotti, the escaped prisoner, ran into the church where Act I is set and began singing, in English. And as trite as it sounds, a veil lifted: all those words that many of us know by heart seemed, in their English translation, to take on a new, even more immediate meaning. 
 Finding ways to keep opera fresh in the 21st century is a task faced not only by Charles McKay, Opera Theater of St. Louis's general director, but also by the manager of every opera company. And many of those managers were in town for St. Louis's season. Opera America, the world's largest association of opera professionals, held its annual meeting here this week to discuss the state of its art. 
It's a pressing issue. On one hand Opera America touts opera's growth in the last 20 years: more than half of its 119 member companies were founded after 1970, and the organization reports growing and increasingly younger audiences. 
On the other hand the troubled economic climate has meant shrinking endowments, a falloff in donations and a consequent need for companies to rethink and even to restructure along conventional business lines. (One whole afternoon of the conference was devoted to topics like "Strategic Planning in Lean Times.") And if there is a third hand, it is that opera is still struggling for a place in the popular consciousness beyond images of elitist audiences and buxom sopranos. The reality of opera has developed a long way past that stereotype, but in its contemporary form the genre faces the same problems as the rest of so-called classical music: the audience for contemporary work may not be the same as the core traditional audience, which (in opera) wants its famous fat ladies.
The term "opera" may even get in the way for some people who are perfectly open to new forms of theater, as the coming closing of Baz Luhrmann's acclaimed Broadway "Boheme" may attest. At a conference panel on Wednesday, Kevin Smith, president of the Minnesota Opera, said that for the American premiere of Poul Ruders's "Handmaid's Tale" in May, the company ran an entire -- successful -- advertising campaign that did not mention the word "opera," subtly aiming for a potential audience of theatergoers and of fans of Margaret Atwood, who wrote the novel on which the opera is based.
Opera Theater of St. Louis also mounted an unconventional contemporary opera this year: "Flight," by Jonathan Dove, which is about a group of travelers stranded in an airport. "Flight" had its premiere in 1998 at Glyndebourne, where it was a huge popular success, and its brand of humor, a realism overlaid with Monty Pythonesque absurdity, drew belly laughs from the audience in St. Louis. With strings of heavy punch lines, it is in a tradition of British humor that has much in common with opera buffa (think "Fawlty Towers"). Its characters include a pair of oversexed flight attendants, a man and a woman, who seize every possible opportunity for satisfaction; a middle-aged woman (the outstanding Myrna Paris) hoping her vacation fling will arrive for a visit; and a bickering couple on vacation, armed with a manual on how to improve their marriage. 
Entertaining it may be, and Colin Graham, the company's artistic director, gave it a colorful staging that played up the story's allegorical elements: large birds, for example, instead of airplanes. But "Flight" is not a piece for the ages. Mr. Dove writes glibly and fluently, but for effect: punchy ensembles with deft rhythmic figures a la Bernstein, poignant solo passages with echoes of Britten, even traces of Wagner, all combining to create a surface that's both colorful and ephemeral. The big, loud ensembles forced the singers, including the countertenor David Walker as the stateless Refugee doomed to live in the airport forever, practically to shout at uncomfortable extremities of their range.
A piece like "Flight" seems a clear attempt to overturn a perception that dogs new work: patrons' idea, articulated by Mr. Smith, the Minnesota Opera president, that new music is like the vegetables in a meal, not enjoyable but good for you. And yet as the opera repertory grows ever older, regular patrons may be hungering for new dishes. There has been a marked increase in new works presented in the last two decades, and people may be interested in them. Here "Flight" has done better at the box office than "Tosca," just as last year at Santa Fe "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho proved the festival's hottest ticket. And Mr. McKay said that, contrary to the accepted image of the conventional opera patron, there were "murmurs from the board" when he broached the idea of doing another production of "Madama Butterfly." 
You can't keep warming up the same meals forever, but you also have to try to please every sector of the public. As a result America's reputable companies and festivals have developed a season plan akin to a bride's outfit on her wedding day, with something old, something new and, given the financial advantages of co-productions, often something borrowed as well. (St. Louis's new "Thais," the Jules Massenet opera staged by Renaud Doucet and Andre Barbe, will go on to Montreal.)
But the most important requirement of any meal is thatit satisfy, and here St. Louis acquitted itself well, with home-cooked fare rather than haute cuisine. Overshadowed somewhat in recent years by larger festivals like Santa Fe, St. Louis generally upheld its standards this season, mainly with some solid music making. 
It fielded an impressive team of sopranos: Jennifer Welch-Babidge and Celena Shafer almost rescued a clunky "Abduction From the Seraglio" from cartoonish ignominy; Cynthia Lawrence showed the warm, full, natural sound of a very respectable Tosca; and Mary Dunleavy was radiant as Thais. Conductors like Stephen Lord ("Tosca") and George Manahan ("Thais") put the St. Louis Symphony through its paces, and the company's young-artist program showed its merits with alumni like Brian Kontes, a bass-baritone, giving striking performances in small roles (the jailor in "Tosca," Palemon in "Thais").
Opera, W. R. McPhee, general director of the diminutive Calgary Opera, said at the conference, competes less with symphonies for its audience than with film: it is visually led. Presenting it in the vernacular of its audience is not a panacea. But while the director of St. Louis's "Tosca," Neil Peter Jampolis, struggled to break with the piece's "Rocky Horror" tradition by introducing pale new moves in Act II, the piece stayed notably fresh. There is a place for opera in English. And it is in St. Louis.

HEADLINE: Labor Standoff at Baltimore Sun Gets Serious 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The protracted labor wars that famously divided so many big daily newspapers throughout the last century have lately gone the way of hot type and the manual typewriter.
 So it has been something of a throwback in recent weeks for The Baltimore Sun to be riven by a labor dispute that has featured the training of potential replacement workers by management and a weeklong byline strike by reporters. 
 Since late April, The Sun, which is owned by the Tribune company, has been negotiating a new contract with the union that represents more than 600 of the paper's editorial and business employees. The talks, which have been conducted with the assistance of a federal mediator, have so far forged little agreement on such basic issues as salary increases, job security and performance evaluations.
The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, whose members voted last Wednesday to authorize their leaders to begin preparations for a strike, has scheduled another membership meeting tomorrow night, only a few hours before the current four-year contract is to expire. 
The talks in Baltimoreare being watched closely within the newspaper industry. They are the first between Tribune and the union local since the company bought the paper in 2000, absorbing it, The Los Angeles Times and other Times Mirror publications into a stable that already included The Chicago Tribune and television stations in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Like other media companies, Tribune, which has a representative at the bargaining table, has been trying to raise profit margins in a faltering economy. The negotiations also come as Tribune is gathering its resources in anticipation of buying more newspapers and television stations as permitted under regulations, approved earlier this month by the Federal Communications Commission, that ease so-called cross-ownership deals.
All this at a company that has been willing, at least historically, to endure long strikes, as it did at The Chicago Tribune in the mid-1980's and The Daily News in New York in the early 1990's.
"They are prepared to play hard ball, no question about it," said Lauren Rich Fine, a research analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Since owning The Times Mirror properties, Tribune has done a pretty aggressive job of trying to find costs to take out as well as revenue enhancements."
"They're not under any particular, distinct financial pressure," Ms. Fine added of Tribune, which in January reported a 42 percent increase in earnings per share on an operating basis for last year over the previous year. "This just strikes me as blocking and tackling, when you have an opportunity at a newspaper to change your cost structure."
Longtime reporters say the mood at The Sun's headquarters on North Calvert Street is reminiscent of that in 1970, when the paper's pressmen walked out for 10 weeks, in 1978, when the guild struck for three days, and in 1987, when a strike lasted six days. Previous to those actions, the guild had struck for nearly two months in 1965.
Escalating the tension has been the paper's acknowledgment that it has been training temporary advertising salespeople and editorial employees, including some reporters who, the guild says, are being relocated from nonunion Tribune newsrooms like that of The Orlando Sentinel. 
Asked whether Tribune papers in Orlando and elsewhere were being asked to help The Sun prepare for a potential strike, Mireille Grangenois, the vice president for marketing and interactive media at The Sun, said, "Let's just say we have a broad array of resources we can draw on if we need to."
The paper's editorial and business employees have responded in kind. On June 10, they chartered a plane towing a banner -- "Union to Sun: Fair Contract Now" -- that flew over Camden Yards as the Orioles played the Tribune-owned Chicago Cubs. Since June 16, the paper's reporters have engaged in a byline strike, which has meant that, with only a few exceptions, every staff-written article published since then, even one reporting on the byline strike itself, has carried the byline, "A Sun Staff Writer."
Walter F. Roche Jr., an investigative reporter at the paper who kept his byline off five articles last week, acknowledged that such a gesture likely meant little to readers. "It's more of a message to our editors that we're not about to give up any of our rights," he said.
Among the paper's proposals, so far rebuffed by the guild, are those that would freeze wages in the first year of a new contract, tie future salary increases for the most experienced reporters, photographers and advertising salespeople largely to their productivity and other barometers of performance, and give management the authority to transfer or lay off some employees without regard to seniority. 
Earlier this month, the company offered each employee a $1,000 signing bonus if a new contract could be ratified by 11:59 p.m. tomorrow, an offer that the union has thus far rejected as inadequate. 
"We're proud of our work and think we have a good paper and think we're contributing to that," said M. William Salganik, the president of the guild and a reporter who has worked at the paper for 25 years. "The Tribune proposals indicate that where they're starting from is the position that they have so many lazy and incompetent and unqualified workers that the way to deal with us is to deny us pay raises, deny us cost-of-living increases, transfer us to any other job or lay us off at random."
He added: "The Sun's pattern, even in good years, is that we don't see the real offer until the last day. But we're usually closer than we are."
For salary increases, the guild is seeking terms consistent with those contained in a recent agreement between Tribune and the union representing editorial workers at Newsday in New York, another former Times Mirror publication. In a "reopener" to a contract originally signed in 1999 and not due to expire until 2006, Tribune stipulated a wage freeze through next April, followed by 3 percent raises in each 2004, 2005 and 2006, as well as bonuses totaling $4,000 per employee over that period.
Ms. Grangenois, the Sun vice president, said she saw a better role model in the guild's most recent contract with The Washington Post, which has provisions that permit management latitude to transfer employees and to distribute merit pay. She added that The Sun was intent on forging a "flexible contract that allows us to move swiftly and smartly in a rapidly changing environment" and that "creates a performance-driven culture." (The guild points out that the contract for The Post, which is not part of Tribune, has no wage freezes and does provide for cost-of-living increases.)
If an agreement is not in place by early Wednesday morning, Ms. Grangenois said, the paper's editors and business managers are prepared to put out "a full-size, full-run newspaper" without the assistance of its reporters and photographers, or its advertising sales staff, all of whom are covered by the guild contract.
Mr. Salganik, who covers health care for the paper's business section, said that he had been on strike against the paper twice in the 1980's -- for a total of nine days -- and that "it's no fun."
"I hope I'm here Wednesday," he said, "making calls on my beat."

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae's Accounting Finds Critics Of Its Own 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Regulators, lawmakers and investors have battered Freddie Mac, the country's second-largest mortgage financier, since it fired its president two weeks ago, after the company said he failed to cooperate with an internal inquiry into its accounting.
 Now some money managers and independent accounting experts are raising questions about the profits reported by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac's even larger corporate cousin. Fannie Mae appears to have suffered a big loss last year that was obscured by the complexity of its accounting, they say. Fannie Mae strongly disputes their analysis. 
 Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored company that owns or guarantees about 25 percent of all mortgages in the United States, is known for its political savvy in Washington and is highly respected on Wall Street. The company reported $6.4 billion in profit in 2002, the seventh consecutive year its earnings increased more than 10 percent. 
But the money managers argue that Fannie Mae's fair-value balance sheet, a short statement that offers a once-a-year snapshot of the market values of all the company's assets and debts, presents a more accurate picture at its earnings than its cheery income statement. The balance sheet shows that Fannie Mae lost billions of dollars when interest rates plunged last summer, nearly wiping out its profit for the year, the money managers say. Accounting rules enabled Fannie Mae to keep those losses out of its profit report, but the losses will reduce the company's earnings in the future, the managers say.
"On an economic basis, they made no money last year," said Lawrence Kam, president of Sonic Capital, a Boston hedge fund that has sold Fannie Mae stock short, betting that its price will decline. "That's the simplest way to put it."
Dwight Jaffee, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied mortgage markets for 35 years and who wrote a paper last year on interest-rate risk at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, said the Sonic Capital analysis appeared to be "exactly right." Mr. Jaffee cautioned that he could not confirm the details of Mr. Kam's analysis. (Mr. Jaffee said that in the last week, he had sold short a small amount of Fannie Mae stock. "I'm putting my money where my mouth is," he said.)
Mr. Kam, Mr. Jaffee and others are not contending that Fannie Mae broke any accounting rules, but rather that standard measures of profit and loss do not capture the underlying economic reality of its business. Last year, Fannie Mae reported $6.4 billion in "core earnings," a nonstandard accounting measure that is used by the company and widely followed by Wall Street analysts, and $4.6 billion in profits under standard accounting rules.
Fannie Mae disputes the Sonic Capital analysis and says that its reported profit reflects the reality of its business, although it acknowledges that it was hurt when interest rates dropped. Several company officials said in interviews last week that investors were wrong to try to determine the company's profit simply by measuring year-over-year changes in its balance sheet.
"Our core business earnings provide a better measure of our financial results and better reflect our risk-management strategies," a spokesman for Fannie Mae, Chuck Greener, said. Jayne Shontell, the director of investor relations, said investors shouldlook at the company's core earnings, its earnings under standard rules and its balance sheet.
The details of the argument are complicated, but it boils down to this: last year, Fannie Mae underestimated how fast interest rates would decline and homeowners would refinance their mortgages, Mr. Kam and others say. As a result, it did not protect itself from the risk that some of its higher interest-rate mortgages would be replaced with lower-yielding ones, and it lost money as a result. Those losses will only become evident in Fannie Mae's income statement over the next several years, as the company receives less interest than it had expected, but they are already obvious on its balance sheet.
On the other hand, Freddie Mac, which hedged more of the refinancing risk, has acknowledged that it understated its profit in 2001 and 2002. It has said it expects to restate them upward when it completes an audit of its financial statements later this year. Freddie Mac fired David W. Glenn, its president, and forced out two other executives for failing to cooperate with the internal inquiry.
In arguing that Fannie Mae had large losses last year, Mr. Kam and others are relying on the fair-value balance sheet, which gives a once-a-year picture of the company's assets and debts, calculated as of Dec. 31.
Under standard accounting rules, Fannie Mae measures the changes in value of some of its assets and debts each year, while ignoring changes in others until later, leading to very complicated accounting treatments. Fair-value balance sheet accounting is conceptually much simpler. It tries to measure how much money would be left to shareholders if Fannie Mae were forced to liquidate all its assets, including all derivatives contracts, and use the money to repay its debts.
Fannie Mae's assets are mainly the mortgages it has bought from banks, while its debts are mainly bonds it has sold to investors to pay for those mortgages. Essentially, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are giant, highly leveraged bond funds. They make some money from providing guarantees that mortgages held by other investors will be repaid even if homeowners default. But most of their profit comes from the spread between the interest they pay on their debt and the interest they receive from mortgages.
For example, if Fannie holds a mortgage paying a 7 percent interest rate and finances it with a bond on which it pays 6 percent, it keeps the one percentage point difference. The business is complicated because homeowners can prepay mortgages whenever they like, while the lenders do not have that option with the majority of the bonds they issue. If rates fall, and the 7 percent mortgage on Fannie's books is replaced by a 5 percent mortgage while the company still must pay 6 interest percent on its debt, its profit has turned into a loss.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use a variety of strategies to hedge that risk. They exploit computer models to figure out how many mortgages are likely to be prepaid, and to adjust their mixture of short- and long-term debt in response. They also issue some callable debt, which gives them the option to prepay bondholders, and enter into some derivatives contracts whose value will rise if rates fall.
But neither company hedges all its prepayment risk, because doing so is expensive and lowers profit. Fannie Mae hedges less than Freddie Mac, according to risk models published by both companies, as well as a study last year by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
Last year, as interest rates on 30-year mortgages fell to about 6 percent in September from 7.1 percent in April, homeowners rushed to refinance, and Fannie Mae found itself with too much long-term debt and not enough mortgages.
Generally, Fannie Mae tries to keep what it calls the "duration gap," a measure of the difference between when it receives payments on mortgages and when its debts are due, to six months or less. By August 2002, that had grown to 14 months. 
To balance its portfolio, Fannie Mae bought more mortgages and called back some debt, the spokesman, Mr. Greener, said. But in doing so Fannie Mae replaced older, higher-interest mortgages with lower-interest mortgages.
The effect can be seen on the company's 2002 balance sheet, Mr. Kam said. While Fannie Mae reported $6.4 billion in "core profits" from its existing portfolio of mortgages, its net assets actually fell slightly, indicating that many of the new mortgages it had bought during the year would not be as profitable as the ones they replaced.
"When you don't properly hedge, and interest rates move in a direction faster and more brutally than you expect it, then you incur economic losses," he said.
A comparison of Fannie Mae's balance sheet with its reported profits shows that since 2000, the income that the company has reported to shareholders has risen almost $10 billion more than the value of its net assets, even after adjusting for cash it has paid to stockholders in dividends and share repurchases.
Mr. Greener, of Fannie Mae, said relying too much on the balance sheet to judge results is a mistake. Fair-value accounting can produce counterintuitive results, he said. For example, the company benefits from a widening spread between the interest rate it receives on its mortgage portfolio and the rate it pays on its debt, he said. But the wider spread can actually lower Fannie Mae's net asset value, he said, since the debt it issued earlier will be revalued upward.
Mr. Kam acknowledged that Mr. Greener's example was possible, but he said that it did not explain the difference between the balance sheet and the income statement at Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac, which has roughly the same spreads as Fannie Mae, has had a much smaller divergence between the two, which he said proves that the gap at Fannie Mae was related to its failure to hedge, not changes in the interest rate spread.
"They're trying to make something that was a calamity into some sort of positive," Mr. Kam said. "It's disingenuous."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 24, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the accounting practices of Fannie Mae, the mortgage financing giant, referred incorrectly to the recent departure of two executives at its corporate cousin Freddie Mac. While Freddie Mac dismissed its president, David W. Glenn, and accused him of failure to cooperate with an internal accounting investigation, it did not cite that reason in seeking the resignations of Leland C. Brendsel, the chief executive, and Vaughn A. Clarke, the chief financial officer. The company has not elaborated on their departures.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Vote to Limit Hospital Malpractice Costs 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In the dying hours of this year's legislative session, New York State lawmakers approved changes to an arcane law that, after years on the books, was blamed for threatening a malpractice insurance crisis for hospitals this year.
 On Friday, the State Senate and Assembly, in an agreement with Gov. George E. Pataki, passed a bill altering the law, responding not only to hospitals' complaints, but also to a rare plea from the state's highest court. In April, a reluctant but unanimous Court of Appeals upheld a $140 million judgment against New York Presbyterian Hospital, but in an unusual departure from their customary detachment, the judges disparaged the result and the law that produced it, and asked the Legislature to consider changing the statute. 
 Hospital and insurance executives said the case set a dangerous precedent, and even provided plaintiffs' lawyers with a road map to winning inflated malpractice awards. Insurers notified hospitals that their malpractice premiums would double or triple as a result, possibly as soon as July 1 if the law were not changed before then, and they warned that some smaller hospitals might be unable to find insurance at all.
Lawyers' groups and some consumer advocates dismissed the predictions of doom as little more than scare tactics reflecting a national campaign to limit personal injury lawsuit judgments, and they noted that the law in question was one the hospitals themselves had largely devised.
In the end, though, even liberal lawmakers who are often closely allied with the lawyers and consumer groups concluded that a change was needed, and argued that the altered law would head off hundreds of millions of dollars in malpractice premium increases for hospitals.
"The results of the law were so bizarre, just so outrageous, and the danger to hospitals was so real and imminent, that we had to do something," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Insurance Committee, who pushed for the change.
The New York Public Interest Research Group had questioned the need to amend the law. But after the change was passed, the group's legislative director, Blair Horner, said, "We didn't believe the claims that one case was somehow going to bring down the system, but what the Legislature did looks like a good attempt to balance all the considerations, though it's very hard to know how it will play out in the long run."
Until 1985, malpractice judgments in New York were awarded as lump sums, even if they were meant to cover many years of care, prompting hospitals and insurers to complain that it was an undue burden on them to pay, up front, for what was, in some cases, decades' worth of anticipated medical needs.
In 1985, a law was passed that changed the system to one of "structured judgments" for large malpractice awards. A jury determined the damages, year by year for the life of the award. The judge then determined what the average annual payment would be, set that as the first year's payment, and then increased it by 4 percent per year, an adjustment seen by many lawmakers as compensating for inflation.
The law applied only to hospitals and medical malpractice cases. Other kinds of personal injury cases were covered by another, similar, structured judgment law, which still stands.
The main problem with the malpractice law, as insurance companies and hospitals came to see it, was that there was nothing in the law to prevent a jury from applying its own inflation adjustment to an award, or to stop plaintiffs' lawyers from encouraging juries to do so. That would greatly inflate the final judgment, and the longer the duration, the more skewed the result.
In the case decided by the Court of Appeals in April, the outcome was especially striking, because the dollar amount involved was unusually large to begin with, and because the jury concluded that the plaintiff, Samuel Desiderio, had a life expectancy of 55 years from the time he was injured.
In 1990, the plaintiff, not yet 4 years old, suffered severe, permanent brain damage after a surgical procedure, and he needs constant medical care. At trial in 1999, a Manhattan jury determined his medical needs -- by far the bulk of his damages -- at less than $300,000 per year, and then applied an annual inflation adjustment. In all, including damages for pain and suffering, the jury awarded him $40 million over 55 years.
The law then required the judge to set a first-year starting point for the award at more than $700,000 -- the average of the 55 annual payments determined by the jury -- not the less than $300,000 the jury had settled on. The judge was then required to increase that amount by 4 percent per year -- in effect, counting inflation a second time. The final result was an award of $140 million over 55 years.
Last week, the Legislature did away with a judge's role in recalculating the award in future cases. A jury can adjust for inflation, but the judge will no longer then reset the first year's award to a higher figure, and will no longer apply a 4 percent annual increase.
But the amended law also accelerates payments to plaintiffs in several ways. It provides that 35 percent of long-term medical costs be paid in an initial lump sum, where none were previously. The new law allows up to $500,000 in damages for pain and suffering to be awarded as a lump sum, rather than the old limit of $250,000. And any pain and suffering awards beyond the lump sum will be paid over 8 years, rather than 10.
Under the 1985 law, a plaintiff could outlive an award. If a jury projected a 10-year life expectancy, the money ran out after 10 years, even if the injured patient, still in need of expensive care, lived for 20 years. The amended law guarantees that payments for medical costs will continue as long as the patient lives.

HEADLINE: Gifts to Charity in 2002 Stayed UnexpectedlyHigh 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Charitable giving held up last year, in spite of an uncertain economy, international turmoil, increased unemployment and other factors that might have put a damper on it.
 Americans gave an estimated $240.92 billion in 2002, a 0.5 percent decrease on an inflation-adjusted basis from the previous year, according to Giving U.S.A., an annual tally of charitable contributions published by the A.A.F.R.C. Trust for Philanthropy, a unit of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel, and compiled by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. 
 Estimated giving amounted to 2.3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, extending a trend that began in 1999, the first time since 1971 that charitable contributions exceeded 2 percent of the total output of goods and services.
Also, based on new data from the Internal Revenue Service, the trust has revised its estimate of giving in 2001 to $238.46 billion, an increase of more than $26 billion over its original estimate.
"Giving did hold its own in spite of reports of great difficulty in fund-raising," said Leo P. Arnoult, chairman of the trust, referring to the data for 2002. "Giving is still pervasive and broad, perhaps because our culture treats all philanthropic activity, even the widow's mite, respectfully." 
In general, the report mirrored earlier gauges of giving, both statistical and anecdotal. But it differed significantly in one area: Giving U.S.A. put charitable contributions by corporations and corporate foundations at $12.19 billion for last year, an 8.8 percent increase over the previous year when adjusted for inflation.
That runs counter to anecdotal reports from charities and other fund-raising entities that say corporate gifts have fallen more significantly than others. Mr. Arnoult said he believed corporations have gotten better about accounting for their gifts, particularly those of materials and products, and he noted that corporate profits fell only 2 percent in 2002, compared with 17 percent in 2001.
While giving may have remained stable last year, many nonprofit organizations say they have struggled to raise money to support their activities. Many report lower corporate giving. Foundation endowments have declined, mirroring the stock market, and fund-raisers say that individuals are reassessing the way they give, for example, making larger donations to two or three organizations instead of five or six.
"This is cheering data, but it's macro data," said Jon Small, executive director of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, a trade group representing more than 1,100 organizations. "I believe it masks a wide range of fund-raising successes and failures on an organization by organization basis."
Take E.M.Q. Children and Family Services, an organization based in Campbell, Calif., that provides mental health services in Silicon Valley for emotionally disturbed children and their families. Charitable contributions to the organization fell by almost $500,000 in the fiscal year that ends June 30, a decline of roughly 25 percent.
Scott Staub, vice president of fund development at E.M.Q., would not release figures because he has not yet given them to the organization's board, but he said that a direct-mail campaign had had disappointing results and that donors who might have given $10,000 in the past had given $2,500 or $5,000 this year instead.
While those gifts account for a tiny part of E.M.Q.'s budget of roughly $50 million, their worth has increased because E.M.Q. knows it will receive far less from federal, state and county governments, which supply the bulk of its revenues.
"We have increased our fund-raising goal by about 15 percent in spite of our experience," Mr. Staub said. "I think we'll be successful because we are going to try to communicate more effectively with our donors. We have to."
Giving U.S.A. reported that organizations providing human services suffered the steepest decline in charitable contributions, which fell 11.4 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis, to $18.65 billion. These groups have seen increased demand as unemployment worsened and costs of living rose. 
"Human services is traditionally the third sort of charity that people will give to," said Julia Erickson, executive director of City Harvest, which supplies food to soup kitchens and food banks in New York City. "They normally give first to some educational institution, their alma mater, maybe, or their children's schools, and then to health-related things because almost everyone has someone in their family who's had a serious health problem. Human services is the third cause, and if they're tightening their belts, it'll be the first to go because people who are donors don't think of themselves as needing those services."
City Harvest faced a $2.4 million budget shortfall and laid off 22 of its 108 employees in March, blaming a sharp fall in direct-mail receipts and disappointing product from those campaigns. 
Ms. Erickson said she was surprised giving had held up in 2002 when many had thought it would fall because so much philanthropy had been directed to charity related to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Instead, donations began plummeting this year, she said. 
City Harvest, which ends its fiscal year on June 30, was one group that was able to regain its footing, however, thanks to the widespread publicity that its woes generated, Ms. Erickson said late last week. Its spring direct-mail campaign, which began the week that City Harvest announced layoffs, brought in $200,000 -- $60,000 more than anticipated -- and several foundations increased support for the organization.
"We'll end the year just under what we did last year, but next year is a different story," Ms. Erickson said. 
Like City Harvest, many organizations have posted steady or even slightly increased fund-raising results because of unexpected gifts. "We anticipated that we would raise only $10,000 or $12,000 on our last fund raising event, and we raised $28,000," said Robert A. Shamy, director of fiscal and human resources at the El Paso Child Guidance Center in Texas. "We were able to keep our costs real low, but I really can't explain it."
Dartmouth College's class of 1978 raised a record-setting $14.4 million in its 25th reunion year, a gift that the college president, James Wright, called "astonishing." The report showed an inflation-adjusted 2.6 percent drop in giving to educational institutions last year.
Carrie Pelzel, Dartmouth's vice president for development, predicted that giving would remain constant this year. "Donors are continuing to make large commitments to institutions and causes that are making an impact somehow," she said. "They are being careful about the timetable for their giving, slowing down their payments, and making contributions to the annual campaign rather than to the capital campaign, but they're continuing to give."
The Pan-Massachusetts Challenge, a bicycling event that raises money for the Jimmy Fund, which supports research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, raised $15 million last year, $1 million more than it did in 2001. More riders participated in the race, but each rider on average also raised more money, said David R. Hellman, director of operations.
Many nonprofit executives are hoping that Congress will pass legislation that will stimulate charitable giving through tax breaks. The Senate has passed a bill that is intended to encourage billions of dollars in additional giving by allowing older individuals to take a deduction for charitable contributions from retirement accounts and other incentives, but the House version has bogged down over a provision that would force foundations to spend more of their assets.
Five major associations representing fund-raisers have come out in support of the legislation.
"That legislation would be a powerful inducement for individual donors to give more," Mr. Arnoult said, "and if it doesn't pass for some reason, it will certainly be very hurtful to philanthropy in 2003."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: ECONOMY; 
Overseer in Iraq Vows to Sell Off Government-Owned Companies

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: SHUMEH, Jordan, June 22 

 BODY:
L. Paul Bremer III, the chief United States administrator in Iraq, vowed today to dismantle that country's state-run economy by selling off government-owned companies and writing new laws to encourage foreign investment.
 Recognizing that a rapid shift would cause pain to many in the short term, Mr. Bremer also raised the possibilities of distributing part of Iraq's oil revenues as "dividends" to citizens or creating a national trust fund that would help finance a "social safety net." 
 "Every individual Iraqi would come to understand his or her stake in the country's economic success," he told business and political leaders gathered here for a meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Taken together, Mr. Bremer's comments amounted to a blueprint for turning Iraq into a Middle East model of free trade and deregulation. 
He made it clear that he wanted to start privatizing more than 40 government-owned companies that make products ranging from packaged foods to steel. Many of those companies, he acknowledged, would not be able to survive in the face of real competition.
"A fundamental component of this process will be to force state-owned enterprises to face hard budget constraints by reducing subsidies and special deals," he said. "Iraq will no doubt find that opening its borders to trade and investment will increase competitive pressure on its domestic firms and thereby raise productivity."
Senior officials in the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which Mr. Bremer heads, have said they hope to agree on a plan in the next few weeks to sell state-owned companies to private investors. But they are vague about how quickly the process should proceed, acknowledging that new owners would almost certainly slash the work forces at many companies and that some companies would not survive. 
Many foreign investors, especially in neighboring Kuwait, Jordan and Turkey, said they were eager to enter the Iraqi market. But they also said the situation was too unstable and the laws too undefined to make any commitments yet.
A senior allied official here said today that work had already begun on drafting a modern commercial legal code that would protect investors and property rights. But he also acknowledged that the work was in its early stages.
The problem confronting allied officials is that the mood of Iraqis is turning more sour by the day, as basic services like electricity remain erratic and joblessness mounts.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: COMBAT; 
G.I. Is Killed in Grenade Attack on Convoy; Another Blast Starts Fire on Oil Pipeline

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 22 

 BODY:
An American soldier was killed today in a grenade attack on a military convoy south of the Iraqi capital, and another soldier was wounded.
 The attack followed a pipeline explosion and a separate mine attack in the western city of Hit on Saturday that wounded an officer on his way to train Iraqi policemen. 
 The soldier killedin the grenade blast, who has not been publicly identified, was the 14th to die in a series of small-scale assaults against American military convoys and checkpoints in the past month. The attack occurred about 15 miles south of this city near the town of Khan Azad. 
Last week, assailants fired a rocket-propelled grenade along the same highway and killed a soldier in nearby Iskandariya. 
One witness of today's attack south of Baghdad, Imam Khadom, 27, who runs a small shop near where the convoy was passing, said he heard the explosion as he was opening his shop at about 6:45 a.m. He ran to the site of the explosion and saw a wounded soldier inside a Humvee, and another wounded soldier in a truck whose tire was blown out.
Mr. Khadom said he later saw military investigators following a wire from the site of the explosion to a spot under a nearby highway overpass, indicating that an explosive device may have been planted and detonated remotely. Convoys often use the road, he said. 
A military statement described the incident as a grenade attack and provided no details. Mr. Khadom said that soon after the explosion, reinforcements arrived with tanks and helicopters. The soldiers set up two inspection points, and also went into a nearby residential compound. Mr. Khadom said he had seen a truckload of Iraqis -- he estimated 20 to 30 -- being taken away. 
A military spokesman said the two soldiers had been evacuated to the 28th Combat Support Hospital. One was pronounced dead, and the other was treated and returned to duty. 
Late today just outside Hit, fire was raging out of control at a pipeline station where an explosion severed the line just before dark on Saturday and sent a fireball skyward that was visible for 20 miles, said Lt. Col. Henry Kievenaar of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment. 
Colonel Kievenaar said it was too early to say whether sabotage had caused the explosion, but the blast was the second to damage Iraq's pipeline system this month. The first ripped through a pipeline near Kirkuk in northern Iraq.
He said that military officials in Baghdad had not been able to tell him whether the pipeline carried natural gas or crude oil, and that the military was seeking assistance in shutting down pressure on the line so the fire could burn itself out. 
Some local residents, said they believed it was a likely case of sabotage. "It was a bomb," said a truck driver who identified himself by his first name, Muthana. "The fire went way up into the sky, and it was like daylight in the evening."
There were conflicting reports on whether the pipeline provided natural gas to power plants in Baghdad, or crude oil to export terminals on the Mediterranean coast.
"Nobody from Hit would do this," the driver said. "It was probably people from the former regime." 
The explosion occurred within a half hour of a mine detonation that seriously wounded one of Colonel Kievenaar's officers, who was driving into Hit to conduct a police training course at a soccer stadium.
"He went down a dirt road we haven't used in a while," the colonel said. A sweep of the road found two more mines that had been buried in the last several days, he said. "I am almost positive that those mines had been there for a day or two."
In Baghdad today, American soldiers, fitted in riot gear for the first time, lined up in front of the the Republican Palace, which serves as the headquarters for the American and British occupation authorities. 
That would prepare them for a new demonstrations, though there was no crowd to control tonight. Military officials last week cited the lack of riot-control gear during a demonstration of former Iraqi Army officers in which two Iraqis were killed. A soldier fired into a crowd blocking the gates of the palace and pelting military vehicles with stones. 
The officers have been demanding back pay and pension payments. The American administrator in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, disbanded the Iraqi Army last month, and the occupation authorities have debated whether they should provide compensation to several hundred thousand commissioned and noncommissioned officers who are now unemployed.

Senators Critical on Time Issue
By The New York Times
WASHINGTON, June 22 -- Three ranking senators from both parties criticized the Bush administration today for not communicating clearly the need for American forces to stay in Iraq for a long time.
"We're involved in nation-building," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. "It's important we all understand that -- that the president say that, that it's a five-year plan of stability." He and the other senators spoke on the ABC News program "This Week." 
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat, agreed. "It's time the president go to the American people and tell them the facts," he said. "And the facts are Johnny and Jane ain't coming home anytime soon."
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, a frequent critic of the administration's war policies, said the American public would "need to know the long-term investment here, and that means in resources and in lives and in presidential leadership."

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Shows Guests Some Flair 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: SHUNEH, Jordan, June 22 

 BODY:
The performance was as seamless as the schedule was packed.
 In less than 24 hours King Abdullah II of Jordan, the 41-year-old ruler of this land sandwiched between Israel and Iraq, opened a major international conference; held a banquet; presided over a moonlit concert with Palestinian and Israeli performers; watched fireworks on the shores of the Dead Sea here; initiated a new educational program; laid out his thoughts on a range of issues from Middle East peace to Arab democracy; and made a computerized PowerPoint pitch to to investors. 
 If nothing else, King Abdullah, the newest descendant of the Hashemite dynasty that took over this land at its creation in 1921, has set out to prove that he is a king for his time. And, four years after the death of his father, King Hussein, King Abdullah seems also to have created his own style, in part extending his father's courtly manner, but with its own hallmarks -- certainly not regal-lite but not aloof, either. 
"Of the two, the old king had the greater gravitas," said an international diplomat who has met both men. "King Hussein was such a dominating figure. When you had a conversation with him, he dominated. With King Abdullah, it's a dialogue."
Of course, diplomats are paid to be, well, diplomatic, and there are others in this modest kingdom who fault King Abdullah harshly for dissolving Parliament and postponing elections for two years until they were finally held last week.
In that period, this argument goes, Jordan's influential internal security services accumulated greater powers. The occupation of Iraq by the United States was deeply unpopular here and so was the King's decision to allow American troops onto Jordanian soil. Even when the elections were held, critics assert, the constituencies were gerrymandered to counter the influence of his land's Palestinian majority -- centered in the capital, Amman -- and to strengthen his tribal followers.
Still, in a region ruled generally by fiat of one kind or another, King Abdullah seems to have won other plaudits if only for holding elections at alland for emerging relatively unscathed from the serial shocks of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States that reverberated across this region, the resurgence of the Palestinian uprising on his western border and the relatively short war in Iraq to the east.
"You are such a leader in advancing economic and social but also political reforms," Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum, said at the opening yesterday of an unusual gathering of the organization in a so-called Royal Tent in the grounds of a luxury resort here.
The meeting opened just weeks after King Abdullah was host to President Bush in the southern port of Aqaba at a meeting that brought together the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers and pressed Washington and the region onto the newest Middle East peace initiative.
With the latest gathering here, moreover, King Abdullah has cemented his prominence in regional peacemaking, an exposed and risky position. With Iraq to the east and Israel to the west, the fortunes of both king and country are hostage to events on both flanks, particularly since some 70 percent of Jordan's population is of Palestinian descent. The balancing act between a restive population, a rough neighborhood and close ties with Washington in the quest for peace is part of the king's legacy from his father.
For all the weight of his heritage, though, King Abdullah seems to want to blend the dignity of his job with a more open manner. For example, he maintains his own Web site. He arrived at the conference on Saturday chauffeured not in an armor-plated sedan but in a golf cart, albeit surrounded by armed bodyguards. (Peace has exacted a high price for earlier champions of Arab-Israeli reconciliation, including Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who were both assassinated, as was the King's own grandfather, King Abdullah the First, in 1951.)
For his PowerPoint presentation, he wore blazer and slacks, eschewing the robes and headdresses of some of his Arab peers at the gathering. He apologized with a noblesse-oblige quip for having so little time to stay at a lunch with investors because of another commitment: "What's the difference between terrorists and protocol?" he said. "You can always negotiate with terrorists." 
Like King Hussein before him, he has sought to encourage investment here, but has taken the economic opening much further, signing an unusual free trade agreement with the United States and ordering that some state businesses and military sites be sold to private buyers.
He has projected his land as a haven of economic reform and technological advance. And like his father, who signed Jordan's 1994 peace with Israel, he is a cornerstone of American regional diplomacy. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called Jordan today the "land of hope."
King Abdullah is the son of King Hussein's English-born second wife, Princess Muna, who was born Antoinette Gardiner. He was educated in England from the age of 4 and completed his high school education in the United States. He later studied international affairs at Oxford and Georgetown Universities.
In 1980, he entered Sandhurst, the British military academy, and served in the British Army before joining the Jordanian Army, where he commanded special forces that put down riots in 1996. His schooling in Britain and the United States and his fluency in English has led some critics to say he does not have his father's understanding of his people.
Indeed, Abdullah had not been groomed for the monarchy, and when his father died in 1999, he was chosen to succeed him only at the last moment. At the time he was reported to have donned disguises, including that of a television reporter, to learn what his countrymen were thinking.
These days, King Abdullah has plenty to think about on his own account, be it in Iraq or in the Arab-Israeli dispute or within a region primed for further disenchantment if peace efforts falter and Iraq descends into chaos.
"Never have we been more in control of our fate," he said on Saturday. "At no other time have we had such clear choices in our actions and decisions. And certainly, at no other place can we better hear the cries of those who so desperately need us to succeed."

HEADLINE: Europe Snubs World's Poor 

 BODY:
The European Union held one of its splashy, self-congratulatory summit meetings over the weekend in a Greek resort, complete with the unveiling of a draft for a new constitution for the peoples of Europe. The gathering featured the usual photo ops and rhetorical flourishes about the ever-closer union.
 What it lacked was much substance. Most glaringly absent was any reform of Europe's subsidy-rich common agricultural policy, which gobbles up half the union's budget and manages to simultaneously victimize both European consumers and poor farmers in the developing world. 
 The European Commission, the union's executive body, has been pushing a modest reform of farm policy aimed at ending the link between payments to farmers and their actual production levels. The idea is to reduce Europe's chronic overproduction of cereals, beet sugar and other agricultural products. The farmers would still receive the same level of payments, but the change would ease the gluts in certain subsidized products that are driving down global commodity prices. For the millions of impoverished farmers worldwide who cannot compete with the rich nations' subsidized harvest, Europe's reluctance to embrace even modest reform must be disheartening. 
It is too bad that in their weekend discussions about illegal immigration and asylum policies -- perennial political hot potatoes on the Continent -- Europe's leaders couldn't have reflected on how their agricultural policies contribute to the very desperation that provokes such migratory flows. Sadly, the United States is a willing co-conspirator in this tale, betraying its supposed belief in free markets and trade with its own lavish handouts to politically powerful farm lobbies.
Britain and the Netherlands, along with the Scandinavians, were strong proponents of the commission's proposed reform. The plan would be only a modest step, but it would constitute an important acknowledgment that the union's sacred cow -- a system of agricultural supports that pays earthly cows a $2 daily subsidy -- is not untouchable.
That is why the union's 15 national agricultural ministers were locked in a drab conference room in Luxembourg for the past two weeks, and will reconvene there this week. The group may produce a version of reform so watered down as to be virtually meaningless. So far France, the largest beneficiary of the union's handouts, has opposed even the most minimal changes in the status quo with startling vigor. Once it seemed a consensus had formed behind a compromise, but President Jacques Chirac, a former farm minister, killed it late last week by threatening a veto.
The willingness of Germany, traditionally a champion of reform, to back France's intransigence has been most disappointing. There is much speculation about what Chancellor Gerhard Schroder may be getting in return for his U-turn on these issues. What is clear is that the union's reinvigorated Paris-Berlin axis, so evident in the debate over the Iraqi war, does not always act in Europe's best interests. And it definitely is not acting in the interest of the world's poorest.

HEADLINE: Israelis and Palestinians Pressed To Compromise in Mideast Talks 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: SHUNEH, Jordan, June 22 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell joined with top European, Arab and United Nations diplomats today to press for concessions in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, but their efforts were punctured by violence in the Gaza Strip that left four Palestinians dead.
 In an illustration of the frustrations of the Middle East, diplomats here reported that before the latest deaths in Gaza, negotiators had made some progress in their talks over transferring security in most of the Gaza Strip from Israel to the Palestinian Authority. There was no telling tonight whether that progress would be set back. 
 The four Palestinians from the Aksa Martyrs Brigades were first said to have been killed today by Israeli tank fire, though other reports said they might have died when a bomb they were planting exploded prematurely. Page A10. 
The day's events lent a surreal cast to the scene here at the World Economic Forum in a resort on the Dead Sea, where more than 1,200 envoys, officials, business leaders and other conferees hailed recent progress in the Israeli-Palestinian situation even as the bitterness of that dispute coursed through countless conversations.
Coming to the end of one of his longest trips as secretary of state, Mr. Powell started in the morning by expressing mild but unmistakable criticism of Israel's killing of a top Hamas leader on Saturday night.
"I regret we had an incident that could be an impediment to progress," Mr. Powell said, referring to the killing of Abdullah Qawasmeh, a leading Hamas figure. "I would much rather on a Sunday morning wake up to find that we are moving forward, and it was not necessary to have this kind of activity on either side."
The secretary's terse reference to Israel's latest strike against suspected Palestinian terrorists marked the second time in two weeks that the United States felt compelled to criticize Israel, if only obliquely. The week before last, President Bush rebuked Israel for an attempt to kill a Hamas leader, saying it had undercut peace talks.
But the rebuke for Israel was mixed today with exhortations directed at the Palestinians by Mr. Powell and others to take action to stop attacks on Israeli soldiers and citizens so as to fortify Middle East peace efforts that have looked more promising recently than at any time in the past two and a half years.
Two diplomatic tracks were under way in Israel that were the focus of much of the discussion here on the Dead Sea. One was Israel's negotiation with the Palestinians on Gaza. The other was the Palestinian Authority's negotiations to achieve a cease-fire with Hamas.
A cease-fire with Hamas is supported by the Palestinians' leadership and by its main Arab backers, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. All of them say they would prefer such an arrangement to a civil war between the militant groups and the shaky security forces under Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister.
American and Israeli officials say they are less impressed with the cease-fire talks, explaining that if there is a cease-fire, it almost certainly will have to be followed by aggressive actions by Palestinian security forces against Hamas, including arrests, forced disarmament and potential clashes.
For now, the negotiations on the Gaza Strip and the Hamas cease-fire talks, while not officially connected, appear to be intertwined, making progress on both even more difficult. Arab, European and American diplomats all say, for example, that Mr. Abbas may be waiting for a cease-fire before reaching an accord to take over the Gaza area.
On the other hand, Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, may be holding up approval of a deal on the Gaza Strip until he sees how Mr. Abbas is going to handle Hamas. Some here speculate that Mr. Sharon may also be waiting to close the Gaza deal when Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, visits Israel late next week.
Arab diplomats attending the economic forum here assailed Israel for the killing of Mr. Qawasmeh and for its policy of pinpoint killings of militant leaders. Mr. Abbas's son said here that he thought Israel was deliberately trying to sabotage the cease-fire negotiations.
Mr. Powell, who left Washington a week ago for Cambodia and then traveled to Bangladesh before arriving here on Thursday night, made an emotional appeal for restraint by both Palestinians and Israelis at a news conference and in a speech this afternoon.
No less significant, Mr. Powell joined with Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and the foreign ministers of the European Union and Russia to sound the same theme. The four officials, sometimes referred to as the quartet, devised the staged peace plan for a Palestinian state known as the road map.
In a statement read by Mr. Annan, the four officials said they "deplore and condemn the brutal terror attacks against Israeli citizens" carried out by Palestinian militants, citing not only Hamas but Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. "All Palestinian individuals and groups must end acts of terror against all Israelis, anywhere," the group said.
But there was also tough talk directed at Israel, including "deep concern over Israeli military actions that result in the killing of innocent Palestinians and other civilians."
Mr. Annan, going beyond the statement, called on Israel "not to use disproportionate force in civilian areas," to stop demolitions of Palestinian homes and to stop engaging in "extra-judicial killings." 
The talk in the corridors here was about the Hamas and Gaza negotiations next door in Israel, however. A diplomat close to the negotiators said they seemed "pretty close" to resolving the Gaza dispute, which has centered on Israel's demand that it be allowed to maintain a security presence along the main road that runs the length of the Gaza Strip.
Israel maintains that it must keep some forces on the road both to protect Israeli settlers in several pockets of Gaza and to make sure that Hamas and other groups do not regroup and arm themselves to carry out attacks in Israel itself.
A source of surprise to many Arab and European diplomats here is the increasing evidence of the United States' willingness to make demands on Israel to take parallel actions -- not only by giving up the Gaza Strip, but also by dismantling "outposts" of settlements and releasing prisoners.
The American demands on Israel are thought to be based on the belief that without such actions, Mr. Abbas will not have the political support to act against Hamas, diplomats say. "The Americans are not really letting the Israelis off the hook on this," said a diplomat. "We all realize that time is running out."

HEADLINE: COST OF INSURANCE FOR WORK INJURIES SOARS ACROSS U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, June 19 

 BODY:
Across the country, the cost of workers' compensation insurance is soaring at the highest rate in nearly a decade, adding yet another heavy burden on businesses and the struggling national economy.
 The governors of Florida, West Virginia and Washington have called special sessions of their Legislatures this year to find ways to contain costs, and elsewhere, thousands of bills on workers' compensation have been introduced. 
 The system covers 127 million workers nationally but is regulated state by state, with no federal oversight. Unlike with Medicare and Medicaid, Congress has no role in the regulation of workers' compensation.
Nationwide, the average cost of workers' compensation insurance has risen 50 percent in the last three years, according to Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. 
But nowhere in the country have prices been rising faster and with more debilitating impact than here in California. The average cost of workers' compensation insurance here has nearly doubled over the past three years, said David Bellusci, the chief actuary of the Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau in San Francisco, another insurer-backed organization.
As a result, dozens of businesses in California -- big and small -- have laid off workers, according to state officials and business leaders. Some businesses have closed and a few have moved to other states where insurance costs have not risen as much. 
Prices are escalating, government and industry officials said, because of rising medical and legal costs; a recent devastating price war by insurers; and, many insurers and business executives say, a significant amount of fraud.
In the last few years, the cost of almost all kinds of insurance has been rising sharply. But workers' compensation insurance, which pays for treatment of on-the-job injuries and lost wages, is a particular problem because its purchase is mandatory. Businesses cannot trim their workers' compensation coverage to save money because, every employee must be fully insured.
"The only way to reduce your cost is to reduce your payroll," said Allan Zaremberg, the president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
Part of the problem has been created by the insurers and the boom-and-bust cycle of their industry.
In the mid-90's, expenses for workers' compensation insurers dipped and profits skyrocketed just as the stock and bond markets were at their most exuberant. 
Now, after dropping their prices below the cost of covering claims in a fierce battle for market share, and confronted with dismal investment returns, the insurers are hitting their customers with astounding price increases. The pace of the premium increases picked up after the insurance industry lost at least $40 billion in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
Another factor pushing up workers' compensation prices has been medical costs. While a shift away from manufacturing jobs to less-dangerous service work, broad improvements in safety and reductions in workers' eligibility for benefits has led to a drop of 36 percent in workers' compensation claims over the last decade, the average medical cost per claim has nearly doubled, to $15,300, Mr. Hartwig said.
In California, the average medical cost has nearly quadrupled, to $35,201 over the past decade, according to Mr. Bellusci.
As striking as the premiums seem, they do not capture the depth of the problem, said John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner. Since taking office in January, Mr. Garamendi said, he has yet to find a business that is paying only the average price increases.
"I just talked to a maid service business that said it was looking at an increase from $20,000 to over $120,000 over a two-year period," he said.
In Los Angeles on Tuesday, trainers at the Hollywood Park thoroughbred racetrack told the insurance commissioner and a reporter that premiums for grooms and exercise riders had jumped 70 percent in the last year and had at least doubled for jockeys. Ed Halpern, the executive director of the California Thoroughbred Trainers, said some owners were shipping horses to racetracks in other states to reduce costs.
Joe Heidelmaier, the vice president of City Sea Foods, a fish wholesaler, said his premiums jumped 68 percent this year, to $398,288 -- an average of nearly $7,000 per worker -- and that, as a result, he planned to lay off about 7 of his 57 employees.
At the family-owned Pioneer Supermarket in Los Angeles, Leonard R. Leum, the president, said premiums had quadrupled in the last three years, to $240,000.
In West Sacramento, just outside the state capital, Bill Campbell said he had to fire his own grandsons. The four boys, in their late teens and early 20's, worked for him in the family's small manufacturing business in a big white, blue-trimmed barn on West Capital Avenue. Sales of Mr. Campbell's snow blowers and highway plows had been down, but it was his bill for workers' compensation insurance that forced his hand. The annual cost suddenly jumped to nearly $36,000 for his eight employees this spring, 40 percent more than the year before.
"I realized I had to do something drastic," Mr. Campbell said.
By cutting his work force in half, he ended up reducing his insurance costs by about $5,000 but with fewer employees, he is no longer building most of the machines he sells.
"We just came to realize, 'Hey, we're kidding ourselves,' " Mr. Campbell said. "It wasn't just the insurance, but that's what brought it all to bear. All of sudden, geez, the rates have gone sky high."
Some payments to injured workers are lower in California than they are in other states. But workers typically receive longer, more expensive -- and, critics argue, more unnecessary -- medical care in California than in other states. The Workers Compensation Research Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which is financed by insurers and employers, found that injured workers seen by chiropractors in California received an average of 34 treatments compared with about 17 in a dozen other states. 
Insurers, government officials and business executives are also quick to blame lawyers, who they claim, pursue injured workers and encourage them to run up big bills.
When workers' compensation was introduced in the United States in the early 1900's, it was supposed to reduce disputes over on-the-job injuries and largely eliminate the need for litigation. But researchers say that the workers' compensation system has become such a dense patchwork of rules and regulations that seriously injured workers often find they need lawyers to guide them.
"For workers, it is a very intimidating system," said John F. Burton Jr., an expert on workers' compensation at Rutgers University.
As the lawyers see it, they provide a critical service. "They come knocking on my door with denials from insurance carriers," said Arthur V. Azevedo, a partner in the firm of Green & Azevedo, who has been handling workers' compensation cases for 30 years in Modesto in California's heavily agricultural central valley. "What are they supposed to do? They are forced to get a lawyer, because the system is screwed up."
In a few states, including New York, regulators still control rates. But the insurers in those states can refuse to sell coverage when they think the risk exceeds the maximum they are allowed to charge. That forces customers into state-run pools where the rates are even higher. Since 1999, the premiums collected by state pools have quadrupled, to $1.2 billion.
In California, where there have been virtually no limits since 1995 on what insurers can charge, commercial insurers have still found it impossible to turn a profit. As insurers have withdrawn from the state or gone bankrupt, a California state fund has absorbed more than 50 percent of the workers' compensation business and become the single largest workers' compensation insurer in the country.
Mr. Garamendi says the fund is rushing toward collapse, with its liabilities outpacing premiums. Typically, the insurance industry makes up any shortfall in the claims payments of state funds, with none of the costs borne by taxpayers. But in California, industry experts said, the few remaining commercial carriers would probably not be able to cover the liabilities of the state fund.
About 50 workers' compensation bills are pending in the California Legislature, including several backed by Mr. Garamendi. He wants standardized medical procedures and fees, the use of generic drugs and a medical panel and an ombudsman to resolve disputes and reduce litigation.
He has also ordered the insurance department's 200 investigators to begin concentrating on fraud in workers' compensation.
"There's fraud in every part of this situation," Mr. Garamendi said. "You have a situation where doctors and lawyers and chiropractors are involved in organized crime and ripping off the system. You have workers faking injuries, and you have companies not reporting the nature or the number of their employees," whose jobs are an important factor in determining how much the employer pays. "It's not unusual to see a roofing company paying premiums for one roofer and 30 secretaries."

HEADLINE: TENNIS; 
Prize Money Monopolizes Wimbledon Chatter

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

DATELINE: LONDON, June 22 

 BODY:
From the lofty vantage point of the players' restaurant, all looked right with the tennis world today on the eve of Wimbledon. With the ivy-covered water tower for a backdrop, men in green shirts and green shorts mowed the outside courts as a steady flow of players meandered along the flower-lined pathways on their way to and from practice.
 It was a peaceful, reassuring scene, but to discover the true state of tennis, all one had to do was stop the tallest of those players and ask about the intermittently contentious negotiations between representatives of the four Grand Slam tournaments and the workaday men's tour, the ATP. 
 "Somehow, some way, there are going to need to be some olive branches extended from both sides," said Todd Martin, the 6-foot-6-inch president of the ATP player council. 
 The issue, a familiar one to all modern sports fans, is money. The Grand Slam events are generating plenty of it; the ATP is struggling to do the same.
 Prize money on the regular tour decreased for the first time in its history this season. The ATP's initial attempt to secure a huge pay raise was dismissed during the French Open by the Grand Slam Committee, which deemed its request for about $50 million in increased compensation and promotional money for the game to be outrageous. 
 The Grand Slam events pay about $50 million in total prize money each year to the players. Any increase in the men's pay would have to be matched by an increase in women's pay, which means the ATP proposal would have required the Grand Slam events to come close to tripling player compensation.
 Since then, there have been discussions between the parties, as well as an announcement by the United States Open that it was increasing prize money by 6.2 percent this year, a move that was viewed as an encouraging gesture by Mark Miles, the ATP's chief executive. But the players still want considerably more, and at a meeting on Saturday night at Wimbledon that attracted more than 100 players, including Andre Agassi, ATP leaders made it clear that if negotiations broke down, they would recommend that alternative events be created to compete with the Grand Slam tournaments.
 "Right now we're very confident that conversations will continue to go in a productive manner," Martin said. "In my opinion, I don't think we'll ever need the alternatives for the players. If we do, we're making plans for that."
 The players could take action against the Grand Slam events next year, although probably not in January at the Australian Open, which remains the weakest of the four major events economically and which allocates by far the biggest chunk of its revenue to player compensation: about 25 percent.
 The French Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open have much larger purses -- a record $17 million for this year's United States Open and $15.4 million for Wimbledon -- but those figures represent only about 10 percent of their revenue.
 Regular men's tour events allocate about 30 percent of their revenue to prize money, and the ATP's request for $50 million more was based on the belief that the Grand Slam events should do the same, bringing them closer to the revenue-sharing approach of major North American sports leagues like the National Basketball Association. 
 "It's not like we want to be tennis players complaining about money, but the players are the show; they are why people are coming and why the U.S. Open gets millions from CBS," the seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras said in an interview last month. "It's fair to ask for a little more."While the men take the risk of looking greedy in a recession, the women's players are, for now, more interested in the fight for equal prize money at Wimbledon and the French Open. 
 Nonetheless, they would benefit from whatever the men extract.
 "The WTA players don't have exactly the same agenda as the ATP," said Larry Scott, who left the ATP in Aprilto become the WTA's new chief executive. "But they are very committed to the fact that the Grand Slams should play a bigger role in terms of supporting the growth of the circuit."
 Grand Slam officials argue that tennis players are independent contractors, not employees like N.B.A. players. 
 The tennis officials also argue that their events are nonprofit, pumping their extra revenue after operating costs into infrastructure improvements, tennis development programs and their own countries' tennis federations.
 "You're not comparing apples to apples," said Arlen Kantarian, the United States Open's chief executive for professional tennis.
 Kantarian said the best comparison for tennis was golf. "The four majors in golf provide roughly 13 percent of the total prize money, and that's just for the men's and women's U.S. tours," he said. "The four Grand Slams in tennis provide 38 percent of all prize money, and that's worldwide."
 The players will certainly settle for less than $50 million increase. The question is how much less, and whether they have the solidarity to make a unified stand. Still, despite the two-year contract extension Miles received this year, there is dissatisfaction among the players about ATP management, which was why another players' group, the International Men's Tennis Association, was formed earlier this year. It has received support from more than 50 players, including the defending Wimbledon champion, Lleyton Hewitt. For now, the new group is content to act as an internal watchdog, but its representatives, led by the veteran player Wayne Ferreira, also met with the Grand Slam leaders in Paris.
 "I found his proposals extremely interesting," Christian Bimes, the French tennis federation president, said.
 Bimes was dismissive of the ATP after the French Open, saying it should be a players' union only and not involve itself in running the game worldwide or negotiating television or marketing deals. Such comments raised hackles at the ATP, and Martin said he and other player representatives sent Bimes a letter of protest. More meetings are scheduled at Wimbledon, along with the usual two weeks of tennis

HEADLINE: Congress Finds Rare Unity in Spam, to a Point 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
At a time when lawmakers are sharply divided on everything from Arctic oil drilling to Medicare drug benefits, spam has emerged as a powerful bipartisan issue.
 Lately this has become abundantly clear as the first bill this year promising to control unwanted messages that clutter e-mail in-boxes flew through a Senate committee on Thursday by a unanimous vote. Meanwhile, the Christian Coalition, which rarely sees eye to eye with Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has endorsed his separate proposal for a do-not-spam registry and labeling pornographic messages. 
 As with a variety of other technology debates about privacy and copyright, Congressional positions on spam have little to do with political ideology and turn more on interpreting the balance between the rights of consumers and the rights of the businesses that sell to them.
"This hasn't resonated with standard partisan positions," said Lawrence Lessig, a professor of law at Stanford University. "It's an advantage because I think something will happen. It's a disadvantage because just anything will happen." 
In this case, spam frustrates everyone -- Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural residents alike. Lawmakers themselves are consumers with overflowing in-boxes. Crises also cut across partisan politics. Spam, the consensus says, has reached a crisis point -- consuming an estimated 40 percent of all e-mail traffic. Technology solutions have not been a panacea. As a result, various other business interest groups (with the exception of the spammers themselves) that might normally defend the free play of market forces have converged in support of some kind of federal regulation.
Technology companies, which traditionally eschew intervention from Washington, now fear the economic potential of the Internet will drown in the vast volumes of spam. Microsoft, America Online, Earthlink, eBay and Yahoo have rallied behind a fairly stringent Senate antispam bill sponsored by Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. And even the marketers have repositioned themselves.
"Legitimate industry has a benefit from cleaning up," said Louis Mastria, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, which originally advocated industry self-regulation, but now endorses the Burns-Wyden bill.
The consumer-marketer dynamic spawns a spectrum of antispam proposals. One general approach centers on the collective consumer desire to protect in-boxes by requiring prior consent, creating do-not-spam databases and allowing individuals to take spammers to court.
Another approach emphasizes how marketing e-mail can be legitimate if it has options called opt-outs for consumers to remove themselves from mailing lists; postal or street addresses; and clear labeling. This approach also outlaws spamming techniques like using automated programs to harvest or generate e-mail addresses. The intent is to eliminate the bottom feeders (the generic Viagra and buy-a-diploma ads), while preserving the right for mainstream companies to market to consumers. 
But any regulation will be crude compared with the agility of elusive spammers. Even the bill's sponsors acknowledge that no matter what legislation passes, spammers will find loopholes, including moving more of their operations overseas. The hope is to at least slow the deluge.
A flurry of antispam bills has been introduced and reintroduced in Congress in the last several months. The bills rival one another as much for their attempt to create catchy acronyms as for legal content: the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing), the SPAM Act (Stop Pornography and Abusive Marketing Act), REDUCE Spam Act (Restrict and Eliminate the Delivery of Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail or Spam Act), and the RID Spam Act (Reduction in Distribution of Spam).
But only bills with either a long history or the backing of key committee chairmen have credibility. This narrows the field to four: two rival bills in the House and two bills that are expected to be merged on the floor of the Senate.
In the Senate, the competition has become who can add another tough provision or close another loophole.
Senators Burns and Wyden updated their original bill to require opt-outs and advertising labeling for all commercial e-mail, solicited or unsolicited. They also clarified that a mere visit to a Web site does not create a prior business relationship.
Senator Schumer pushed for a provision calling on the Federal Trade Commission to explore creating a do-not-spam registry similar to the national do-not-call list it is about to begin compiling for telemarketers. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the influential Commerce Committee, which approved the bill, added his own amendment that would hold businesses accountable for hiring spamming services.
The two leading members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican chairman, from Utah, and Patrick J. Leahy, the committee's senior Democrat, from Vermont, have introduced their own bill that would give spammers up to five years in prison. Those provisions would toughen the Burns-Wyden bill.
But the Burns-Wyden bill also makes a concession to marketers. It allows initial unsolicited e-mail messages, as long as there is a clear way for consumers to opt-out from receiving additional ones.
By contrast to the Senate, two bills have emerged in the House. One is sponsored by two longtime antispam advocates. The other, which is backed by two powerful committee chairmen, has been criticized for being too sympathetic to marketers.
On the surface, the two look remarkably similar -- both create prison terms for spammers, forbid harvesting of random e-mail addresses from the Internet and demand opt-outs and street addresses in marketing e-mail. The differences, as with so much legislation, lie in the definitions and the enforcement provisions.
Billy Tauzin from Louisiana, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, of Wisconsin, who are both Republicans, have overcome their traditional rivalries to introduce a spam bill with Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina.
The bill started out as a collaborative effort, but ultimately a number of lawmakers defected because they were dismayed by the active role the financial services industry, among other industries, had in shaping the legislation.
"In the end I wasn't willing to sign on to that bill," said Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, who has been pushing antispam legislation for the past four years. "The reason is that there were too many loopholes that would allow junk e-mail to continue."
Critics note that one loophole is that the Burr-Tauzin-Sensenbrenner bill defines marketing e-mail messages as those whose "primary purpose" is to promote a product, as opposed to a message which promotes a product in any capacity, primary or not.
State attorneys general are not given the authority to enforce the opt-out provision, though they are able to enforce other aspects, like fraudulent subject lines. "It's a fundamental consumer protection issue," Senator Wyden said. "If recipient asks to be taken off the list and there are no consequences, it's not on the level."
The omission is rooted in Representative Sensenbrenner's skepticism about overly aggressive state attorneys general, say people who worked on the bill. 
In response, Mr. Wilson and Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, revived an antispam bill they had introduced in two previous sessions of Congress. In 1999, the bill passed the House by a 427-to-1 vote. In 2001, the bill passed out of committee and never made it to a floor vote, in part because of resistance from Mr. Sensenbrenner.
The Wilson-Greene bill requires warning labels on pornography, has a tighter definition of prior commercial relationship and forbids the sharing or selling of e-mail addresses with third parties.
But in order to broaden its appeal, the Wilson-Green bill eliminated the right of individuals to sue spammers, leaving that right to the F.T.C., states and Internet service providers.
In the last few weeks, the Wilson-Green bill has gained considerable momentum in the House. It has gathered over three dozen co-sponsors, including the ranking Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, and on the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers Jr. from Michigan. Both had been disappointed in the other proposal.
This attention has not gone unnoticed. "There is enough support behind the Wilson bill to stimulate a dialogue between our two committees," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Tauzin.
But outside of Washington there is still considerable skepticism as to the effectiveness of the emerging legislation.
"There just seems to be that there is a simpler cheaper way to enable enforcement," said Professor Lessig, who has proposed setting bounties on spammers, an idea introduced by Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. "We are going to have another Homeland Department of E-Mail Security or something like that."

HEADLINE: The Homes of Argentines Are at Risk in I.M.F. Talks 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 22 

 BODY:
After a decade as renters, Ariel and Norma Brofman were finally able to buy a small house here four years ago. But if the Argentine government yields to International Monetary Fund pressure to rescind emergency legislation meant to protect ordinary families like the Brofmans, the couple stand to lose their home and the $32,000 they have paid for it so far.
 Like other middle-class Argentines, the Brofmans, whose household includes their two daughters, aged 9 and 13, and their widowed mothers, were severely battered by the collapse of the economy here last year. In just a few months, Mr. Brofman lost his job as an electronics technician, exhausted his scant savings and fell behind on the monthly $555 mortgage payment on their two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot house. 
 "We did not create this situation," said Mr. Brofman, 38, who now tries to make ends meet by repairing cellular telephones. "The rules of the game were changed on us from one day to the next, and we were hoping the government would take steps to defend us until this country is back on its feet and we can begin paying again." 
So nearly a year ago, at the peak of the crisis, the Argentine Congress approved a bill that suspended mortgage foreclosures for 90 days on homes that were a family's "sole and permanent residence." That law has since been renewed three times, but will expire in August unless Congress extends it again.
It has, however, brought the Argentine government into conflict with the I.M.F., whose managing director, Horst Kohler, is scheduled to arrive here Monday for a two-day visit. Though Argentina now has a budget surplus and has taken numerous other steps urged by the I.M.F., government officials say that the fund is insisting that the freeze on foreclosures be lifted as a pre-condition for any comprehensive agreement.
In January, the fund agreed to reschedule payment of nearly $7 billion that it was owed by Argentina. But that accord expires in August, around the same time as the mortgage foreclosure bill. The new president here, Nestor Kirchner, who took office late last month, wants to negotiate a long-term agreement with the fund that would restore credit lines and bring back the foreign investors who fled the country when the economy imploded.
Other issues are also on the table in the negotiations, including an even larger government budget surplus and the end of a freeze on utility rate increases. But the foreclosure issue is the most politically explosive for Mr. Kirchner and has come to symbolize for many Argentines what they consider to be the I.M.F.'s intrusive and callous attitude.
Most mortgages here were contracted in the 1990's, when the Argentine peso was linked to the American dollar at a value of one to one as part of a policy intended to end Argentina's chronic four-digit annual inflation rate and attract investment. But that system collapsed early last year after the I.M.F. suspended Argentina's credit line, complaining, among other things, that the country had not fulfilled agreements to slash government spending. The government then in power here defaulted on most of its $141 billion in public debt. Several months of financial chaos ensued.
Bank accounts, many of which were denominated in dollars, were frozen by government decree. For a time, banks suspended normal operations. As a result, many debtors did not have access to the money they needed to meet their obligations, and when the freeze was eased, they found that their dollar assets had been converted into pesos, which had lost more than 70 percent of their value against the dollar.
The Argentine Debtors' Association, a group that represents mortgage holders, calculates that as many as 40 percent of the estimated 5.5 million households with bank mortgage loans have fallen behind on their payments. That compares with just over 10 percent at the end of 2001, before the freeze on bank accounts and the crisis that shrank the economy by more than 10 percent last year.
Estimates vary on the number of homeowners against whom foreclosure procedures have begun and who theoretically would face evictions the day after the protective legislation is revoked. Statistics from the Central Bank suggest that 22,000 mortgage holders are in that category, though bank associations say the actual numbers are lower.
"We want to pay what we owe because we are working people, honest people," said Hilda Gumprich, a leader of the debtors group. "But it is not right that the same I.M.F. that remained silent when our savings were stolen from us is now pushing to have us thrown out of our homes."
The I.M.F. representative here, John Dodsworth, was not available to provide an on-the-record response. In a written message, an I.M.F. spokesman in Washington, Francisco Baker, said that a mission sent here early this month was trying to "quantify the scope of the stay and discuss the issue with the authorities" here, but that "we have nothing to add at this point."
But free-market advocates here who approve of the I.M.F.'s position argue that the foreclosures are necessary to guarantee investors and other creditors what they call "judicial security." The sanctity of contracts must be protected, they argue, and, unlike a natural disaster, the financial upheaval that has swept up homeowners here does not constitute a force majeure.
"How can a market economy function without an adequate degree of contractual certainty?" asked Juan Luis Bour, the director of the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research, a leading business consultancy here. "For the past two years it has been difficult to enter into a contract here because you can't be sure that the terms can be enforced in a court if they are broken."
But even many of the banks that are presumed to be the main beneficiaries of mortgage foreclosures say they oppose so drastic an approach. While they have stopped issuing new mortgages, they are on record as favoring a system of mediation that would allow debtors to renegotiate their repayments on more favorable terms.
"This country is still in a state of emergency, and we have to recognize and adjust to that," said Carlos Heller, president of the Argentine Association of Private and Public Banks, which represents domestically owned banks here. "This crisis has severely damaged the image of banks in Argentine society, and the only way to regain that confidence is with policies that are flexible and tailored to individual cases."
Banks appear to be especially fearful of a flood of repossessed properties coming onto the market when the economy here is still reeling and demand is depressed. That would lower real estate values even further, hurt the banks' bottom lines and leave them with a stock of unsellable houses and apartments that they would have to maintain at their own cost.
President Kirchner has expressed sympathy for the mortgage holders. "Judicial security should be for everyone, not just those who have power or money," he said in his inaugural address on May 25. On a popular television program last month, he also said that he would "try to find a just and equitable solution" to the problem.
Meanwhile, the Brofmans and others like them can only wait and hope. The terms of their mortgage prohibit them from selling their house, which has lost nearly half its value as a result of the crisis. 
"For the past 18 months, we haven't been able to get a proper night's sleep because we worry so much about this," Mrs. Brofman said. "The girls are afraid we will have no place to live, and are always asking, 'What is going to happen to us? Where will we go?' We feel impotent, and we are in agony."

HEADLINE: Caracas, California 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Voters of Venezuela and California have this in common: a growing number of disgusted voters are determined to upset, through referendum, the election of their chief executive.
 Neither President Hugo Chavez nor Gov. Gray Davis has committed an impeachable crime. But both men's popularity has plummeted as a result of a sloppy or mismanaged economy, many voters' sense of betrayal and in Chavez's case, ever-deepening division among the electorate. 
 Is "recall" of a leader -- elected by a majority for a fixed term but supported only by a minority -- a good idea? Or should voters stare decisively at election returns and wait for retribution on a regular schedule?
First consider oil-rich Venezuela, long run by a corrupt oligarchy. Chavez and his populist party rode in on a wave of reform, captured the National Assembly and started packing the courts. His reach for greater power led to strikes, riots, capital flight, an abortive coup and, despite high world oil prices, an economy nose-diving by 10 percent a year.
Chavez is an ardent admirer of Fidel Castro. Like the Cuban dictator, he intimidates those who dare to oppose, encouraging violent attacks on his critics by thuggish supporters.
In a deal to permit re-election, he agreed to a referendum on his rule. But now Chavez is throwing up procedural roadblocks. His party is denying the National Assembly a quorum (an old Texas trick). Chavez is resisting a recall vote because he presumes that if the referendum to oust him succeeds, his currently divided opposition will unite against him in the election to follow.
California's governor, Gray Davis, though not a Castro follower, is in a similar position. Last year, as Republicans were about to choose a strong candidate in a primary to oppose him, he poured millions into TV advertising to tear down Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles; when a weaker Republican candidate won, Democrat Davis easily defeated him. Picking one's opposition, though unprecedented, was considered a nifty trick.
Not so nifty was Davis's failure to disclose a looming huge deficit, necessitating nearly $40 billion in budget cuts or tax increases. Now that his heavy-spending chickens are coming home to roost, a bipartisan he-lied-to-us crowd is out in force and his approval rating is in the low 20's.
Seizing on what has been aptly called "voter remorse," the wealthy Republican Representative Darrell Issa is financing a recall campaign to dump the term-limited Davis. Bettors on the left coast tell me that with enough money, a million signatures could be collected in initiative-happy California to indict a ham sandwich (on whole wheat toast, of course, with alfalfa sprouts). If enough voters are egged on by TV advertising, talk-showboating and Weblog fury, the governor's recall will be on the ballot along with a separate list of potential successors.
Speculation centers on G.O.P. opponents like Issa, Riordan, previous opponent Bill Simon and "Arnold" (whose last name, Schwarzenegger, is too long for headline writers but somehow fits on a movie marquee). Democratic candidates such as Senator Dianne Feinstein are too shy to come forward lest they be considered backstabbers. 
Thus, if Davis is afflicted with total recall, a replacement with as little as 15 percent of the total vote could be the next California governor. Is this any way to run a state as large as Iraq, to reverse a favored comparison?
With the world's fifth-largest economy and the world's fifth-largest oil exporter both in such a fix, a pundit should take a consistent stand. Thus:
Venezuelans should be given their right to oust their power-expanding president, because Chavez would then have the right to run in a subsequent race against the choice of the opposition. If that bunch cannot unite, they deserve their Castroite bully.
But Californians should suffer Gray Davis for three more years, voting like grown-ups not as penance for their mistake last year, but to uphold the principle thatelection results are final for a fixed term and officeholders should not be removed merely when ratings fall.
Wait -- is it inconsistent to root for ouster of Chavez while espousing the retention of Davis? Walt Whitman: "Very well then I am inconsistent." Ralph Waldo Emerson: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. . . . With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do."

HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates Court Black Voters, and Get Some Advice From Jackson 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 22 

 BODY:
As the Rev. Jesse Jackson looked on from the front row, center, most of the Democratic candidates for president courted his followers in a hotel ballroom this afternoon, presenting the image of a group generally united behind issues of social justice and racial equality and against a single man, President Bush.
 To the cheers of hundreds of people at the 32nd annual conference of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Mr. Jackson's organization, seven Democratic hopefuls told of their firm support for affirmative action, their concerns about the criminal justice system and their blunt disgust at Mr. Bush's policies on just about everything, including education, tax cuts and poverty. 
 For this day, at least, these competitors seemed to disagree on little.
"We're united in a single goal, which is to get rid of George Bush," said Carol Moseley Braun, the former senator from Illinois. "We are witnessing a failed presidency."
The audience was mostly black, and the candidates in attendance, all of them white except for Ms. Braun and the Rev. Al Sharpton, made it clear they were aware of that fact.
In his opening comments, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said he had fought beside an African-American man in Vietnam. In answering a question, Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, noted that he had traveled to Africa. And several of the candidates, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, quoted the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., some weaving his words into their comments on more than one occasion.
It has been 15 years since Mr. Jackson ran for president, but he had advice for these Democrats. Before the candidates' forum, Mr. Jackson, who ran in 1984 and again in 1988, urged Democrats to pursue a "Southern strategy," and not to abandon the South to Mr. Bush, as he said the Democrats did in their 2000 loss.
"We must not write the South off, it is the key to the emancipation of the whole country and the preservation of the Union," Mr. Jackson said. "We must launch a new Southern strategy of reconciliation, shared economic security and hope and healing."
For his part, Mr. Jackson said he planned a "massive" voter registration drive for 2004. And for those who suggest that his role as one of the nation's leading black voices might be slipping away, Mr. Jackson was quick to point out that he and his organization had registered an endless string of voters over a period of decades.
"We have currency in the field," he said in an interview.
In this ballroom, Mr. Jackson remains a rock star. He draws standing ovations. And his endorsement for president, which he says will come "no time soon," is a coveted prize. One sure sign of that: Only two candidates missed his forum, Senators John Edwards of North Carolina and Bob Graham of Florida. Mr. Edwards had a scheduling conflict, his spokeswoman said. Mr. Graham had to take care of personal business in Miami, and had called Mr. Jackson to let him know that before the weekend, his spokesman, Jamal Simmons, said this morning.
One person he has not been invited to meet with over the last two and half years, Mr. Jackson said, is Mr. Bush.
During the two-hour forum, the candidates took every opportunity to criticize the president. They said he was supporting the rich and forgetting the poor, dividing the nation by race, creating the circumstances that have left millions of people, particularly black people, behind bars. 
"The reason we have so many in jail today is because so many are not given the opportunities, usually at a very young age," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said, adding that Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind education policy is "a fraud, a phony gimmick."
The administration's posture on affirmative action, in particular, drew repeated fire. At least two candidates, Mr. Gephardt and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, said that if elected president they would issue executive orders reversing any Supreme Court ruling that might jeopardize affirmative action.
"The president has divided us," Dr. Dean said. "He's divided us by race, by using words like quota."
Issues of race filled the room. Asked whether he would pick a person of color as his running mate, Mr. Kerry did not answer directly but said he had always had people "who represent America" on his staff, in every post he has held. He said he had an "enormous" number of people of color on his campaign staff and intended to do the same if elected president.
At that point Mr. Sharpton,of New York, stepped in. Hiring a black person in an important role should not be the only goal, he said. Hiring like-minded people mattered too, he added.
"I don't think we should be about getting some black faces in high places," he said, adding, in reference to the Supreme Court justice, "Clarence Thomas is my color but he's not my kind."
Mr. Sharpton was particularly popular with the crowd. The audience exploded, repeatedly, at his quips.
"There's more than an election at stake, this very Union is at stake," he said. "We must next year make it clear that we will not be mugged by those who mugged us in Florida," in a reference to the 2000 presidential vote count.
He announced that he came to the forum as "a Jesse Jackson Democrat," but Mr. Sharpton has at times had a complicated relationship with Mr. Jackson. They are old friends, but there also have been indications in recent years that Mr. Sharpton thought Mr. Jackson might be past his prime as a civil rights leader.
Clearly, Mr. Jackson does not see it that way. This afternoon he introduced to the crowd and the candidates a group of young people that he had brought from Benton Harbor, Mich. Late last week, Mr. Jackson visited the site where the death of a motorcyclist during a police chase had touched off civil disturbances in the troubled city, just across the lake from Chicago.
Mr. Jackson pointed to Benton Harbor as a microcosm of the nation's current ills, from unemployment to police brutality, and the need for political change.
"It is perhaps a metaphor for America's abandoned urban poor who have been left behind, with affluence on a one-way bridge across the river," Mr. Jackson said. "On one side of the river, $40,000 median income, the other side, $17,000. One side, flourishing schools, the other side 60 percent drop out between fifth and 12th grades."
As the forum ended, Mr. Jackson climbed to the stage and called on the seven candidates and a long list of political leaders that he pulled from the audience to hold hands while he prayed. So they did.

HEADLINE: Major Stars Not So Crucial As Concept Trumps Celebrity 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
A new kind of conjured celebrity has overtaken the American pop culture landscape.
 Entertainment producers are relying more than ever on high-concept movies, reality television shows and manufactured musical projects, tilting the balance of power away from big-name, big-ticket stars in favor of franchises that mint, rather than require, famous faces. 
 "2 Fast 2 Furious," a star-free, street-racing sequel to "The Fast and the Furious" in which the cars outperform the actors, has made more than $100 million in 17 days. Recently, "Dumb and Dumberer," a goof-fest that features two no-names as the younger versions of the nincompoops played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in the original, almost matched the box office receipts of Harrison Ford's pricey star turn in "Hollywood Homicide."
Seven of the top 10 programs in the recently completed television season were reality shows like "Joe Millionaire" or procedural dramas like "C.S.I." and "Law & Order" that depend on the story, not easily replaced cast members. And Kelly Clarkson, the fresh-faced winner of the first "American Idol" popularity contest on Fox, released her album in April just one week before Madonna and has outsold the one-name star by a ratio of more than two to one. 
In this plug-and-play entertainment economy, concepts and marketing have become so dominant that performers are increasingly finding themselves treated like one more bit of product placement. Abundant, disposable celebrities and a proliferation of entertainment options on cable, the World Wide Web and game systems have created a cluttered environment where easy-to-understand conceits -- like "The Bachelor" and "X-Men" -- are needed to break through. As a result, entertainment companies in pursuit of sturdy, long-running franchises are less willing to balance them on something as unpredictable as the popularity of a single star.
"You need concepts that can be easily grasped," said Walter Parkes, co-head of motion pictures at DreamWorks SKG, "that can be described quickly in the schoolyard or at the grocery store checkout. You need urgent word of mouth."
Of course, celebrities will always endure, as a glimpse of "Entertainment Tonight" or US Weekly demonstrates. And being a star can still make for a good day job: Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington all receive $20 million or more to show up for a movie, while Ray Romano recently signed a $40 million deal for another season of "Everybody Loves Raymond."
But a high-priced star is no longer the only answer to the high velocity of today's entertainment world, where people grant the latest film or record release a nanosecond of attention before moving on to the next big thing.
As recently as 1997, the casting for top 10 box office films looked like an A-List party: Leonardo DiCaprio, Ms. Roberts, Mr. Ford, Jack Nicholson, Nicolas Cage and Will Smith were among those who had huge hits. So far this year, cartoons, concepts and sequels like "Finding Nemo," "2 Fast 2 Furious" and "X-Men 2" rule.
Last weekend "Hulk," Ang Lee's $120 million dark vision of a man battling against both inner and outer demons, opened on Friday on more than 3,600 screens across the country with the relatively unknown Eric Bana in the lead role. It has taken in an estimated $62.6 million so far.
And in the coming TV season, the networks have shown more restraint than usual in handing stars their own shows, after the resounding failures in previous years of shows built around actors like Bette Midler and Richard Dreyfuss.
"A good concept gives you a rifle shot instead of a shotgun when it comes to marketing," said Chris McGurk, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio that has ridden the last four James Bond movies to gross revenues of $1.5 billion. "It gets back to simple, iconic messages and characters."
Studios, seeking to regain the leverage they used to have over those pesky (and unpredictable) stars, are also trying harder to manage celebrity as a fungible commodity. When Tobey Maguire, the star of the successful "Spider-Man," suggested that certain stunts asked of him in the sequel might not be good for his back, the folks at Sony Pictures Entertainment let him know they would be more than happy to cast Jake Gyllenhaal, another bright young actor, in his place, according to Variety.
The parties eventually made up, but the changing balance of power between the studios and the talent was clear.
Todd Garner, a partner in Revolution Studios in charge of movie production, credits the actor Eddie Murphy with a fine performance in "Daddy Day Care," which has already brought in more than $90 million. But, he added, the true magic is in the name of the project, not the name of the actor.
"Eddie's last few movies didn't do that well, but here you have a film and a concept that plays to his strengths," Mr. Garner said, referring to films like "Pluto Nash" and "Showtime." 
Concept and star can still work in tandem, as Mr. Carrey's playing God proved in "Bruce Almighty."
"There are a handful of legitimate stars who can open movies and fill theaters," said James A. Wiatt, president and co-chief executive of the William Morris talent agency. "And they can make a big special-effects film or a concept film much more successful by their presence." 
But, according to Doug Belgrad, co-president of production at Columbia Pictures, "Studios are being much more selective about who is a movie star as the investment in production and marketing costs escalate."
Executives in television have done the same math.
Dick Wolf reinvented the crime genre when he started "Law & Order." Now he has three versions of the franchise, all highly rated, and would like to add a fourth. He says the programs are "pure concept," all cast and recast as he sees fit.
"The play is the thing," he said. "You know, it's a very funny thing, but Hamlet works. As long as the actor is good enough, it doesn't really matter who is in the role. It's the writing. If the writing is good you can replace anybody."
Jerry Bruckheimer, whose formula of loud, special effects-laden extravaganzas has proved successful in the film world, has engineered a similar work-around on celebrity on television. "C.S.I." -- which follows the crime-solving efforts of a forensic crime lab in Las Vegas -- successfully spun off a Miami-based version this last season. At the same time, he transferred the police procedural motif to another law enforcement unit, the missing persons division of the F.B.I., in "Without a Trace," and this fall, Mr. Bruckheimer will offer "Cold Case," which will investigate long-unsolved crimes.
Indeed, the networks are placing fewer bets on well-known actors for their new shows this fall. Back in 2000, Ms. Midler, Geena Davis, John Goodman, Michael Richards and Gabriel Byrne all had their shows canceled quickly. This season, Alicia Silverstone's and Whoopi Goldberg's new shows effectively begin and end the A-list outings.
As personality-driven comedies have withered on television, reality shows -- which manufacture their own back-stories as they go -- have more than filled the gap.
"It is completely about the story telling," said Mark Burnett, the creator of "Survivor." "It is not about 'The tribe has spoken' or any of that. It's about a concept where the story unfolds."
If a concept is strong enough, it can manufacture its own appeal across any number of mediums. Ms. Clarkson climbed the slippery pole of fame on "American Idol," then had a top-selling record with significant radio play, and this summer, she and runner-up Justin Guarini will appear in a teenage-friendly movie.
Thomas D. Mottola, the former head of Sony Music Entertainment who discovered Mariah Carey, among other artists, said that combining the "Idol" format and the right talent could be like "igniting gasoline."
"You could break that artist as the next global superstar," said Mr. Mottola, who now runs his own entertainment company. "The platform in and of itself is enormous in terms of direct marketing."
Musical stardom has always been a very calculated affair -- Elvis might just have just been another hillbilly if it were not for Col. Tom Parker -- but the music industry is looking for sure things in perilous times. That means stars are conceived as much as discovered. 
Clay Aiken, a runner-up on the latest version of "American Idol" who has unruly hair and a gee-whiz stage presence, was signed by the music impresario Clive Davis to an RCA deal.
"This Is the Night," his just-released CD single, sold nearly 393,000 copies in its first week on sale, the most since Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" remake to honor Princess Diana in 1997, according to Nielsen SoundScan. 
Celebrity has been defined down to the guy or girl next door, riveting consumers who secretly hope to be the stars of their own movies. 
"The wattage of celebrity has cheapened because they are absolutely everywhere," said Kim France, editor in chief of Lucky, a shopping magazine that has found success with a celebrity-free formula. "Its very ubiquity has killed it. An actress has a movie come out, she's on the cover of all sorts of magazines and on all the television shows until you know what kind of hair gel she uses.
"When Madonna first came out," she added, "an interview in Rolling Stone was a thrilling event. A trillion stories later, it doesn't have the same punch."
Unlike a star, concept has the twin virtues of low maintenance and ease of manufacture. Whether it is movies, television or music, it is often the spectacle, not stardom, that is being marketed.
Producers can even draw on veterans of past reality shows or characters created and controlled by movie studios to produce programming and bigger profits.
Mr. Burnett said he was willing to use stars in his shows, but they would be of his own making: In "Survivor 8," the winners from past seasons will face off in an All-Star version.

HEADLINE: DANCE FESTIVAL REVIEW; 
An Artist Dares the World to Change

BYLINE:  By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., June 23 

 BODY:
The world is not a happy place, the French choreographer Maguy Marin told audiences at the American Dance Festival, in two strong but different kinds of statements. 
 The first was the United States premiere of "One Can't Eat Applause," a powerful, metaphoric dance piece about oppressive societies in general and Latin American dictatorships in particular. 
 The second was a call to arms for dance to help change society. In accepting the prestigious annual Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award for lifetime achievement in modern dance on Sunday night at Page Auditorium at Duke University, the festival's summer home here, Ms. Marin minced no words: 
"I don't recognize myself in this world that is being made for us with its market economy, media, consumerism and varieties of increasingly complex oppressions, one of which is identified with war," she said. "I am not a fanatic, but I don't accept this world as it is." 
Dance, which questions premises, is a challenge to the establishment, she continued in French, aided by an English interpreter. "The stage is part of the world, not a place for entertainment," she said. "Artists need to take responsibility, to confront horror and violence through independent thought. Dance is inscribed in the present, and as violence increases and liberty lessens, dance challenges us to work for the idea of freedom."
Poster art, however, is not Ms. Marin's style in dance. No uniformed junta struts around in "One Can't Eat Applause," whose French title is "Les Applaudissements ne Se Mangent Pas." Instead the action is abstract, albeit sinister. 
On a stage surrounded by three curtains of colored plastic strips, eight dancers walk in repeatedly, glare, and have brief encounters. Some fall and are dragged away like torture victims or people shot in the street. The action is deceptively simple but relentless, evoking power games and occasional indifference to routine slaughter. Human relations are universalized into a metaphor for societies that devour their own. 
"Applause," presented on Saturday night by the Compagnie Maguy Marin at Page Auditorium, is one of Ms. Marin's sparest pieces, but it would be wrong to mistake its tightly compressed distillation of emotion for any kind of minimalism. When I first saw it as "Applause Is Not Edible" at the Lyon Dance Biennial last September, it was part of that festival's focus on dance in Latin America and Latin American themes. Its atmosphere was deliberately dramatic, built on growing tension. Obviously a Latin American context made it easier to understand. But the piece transcends its pretext and can be understood in human terms. 
That Ms. Marin is a politically committed artist is not in doubt. She was part of a hunger strike by French arts personalities to protest the massacre of Bosnians at Srebrenica in 1995. The daughter of anti-Franco exiles from Spain who settled in Toulouse, France, where she was born in 1951, she has included a social critique even in opera-scale productions like her familiar and spectacular doll-house version of "Cinderella" for the Lyon Opera Ballet. But from the time her own modern dance troupe made its United States debut at the American Dance Festival (the 20th anniversary was recalled at the Scripps Award) with "May B," a piece inspired by Beckett, Ms. Marin has never let her deep interest in movement exploration dim her concern with how people live and what they do to one another. 
Humor is often her tool and weapon: "Pour Ainsi Dire," her comic essay on broken connections in human discourse, was the most brilliant piece of the France Moves festival in New York in 2001.
Ms. Marin has "constantly reinvented herself as a choreographer," as Linda Shelton said in presenting the Scripps Award to Ms. Marin. Ms. Shelton, executive director of the Joyce Theater in New York, which has presented the Marin troupe, followed three other speakers: Samuel Scripps, the arts philanthropist who established the award, now $35,000, in 1981; Rene-Serge Marty, the French consul-general in Atlanta; and Charles Reinhart, the American Dance Festival's director. 
There is, atypically, no humor or satire in "Applause." Ms. Marin is now angrier, but she has kept her cool. Unlike American choreographers she does not work with a signature idiom but explores a new vocabulary to fit each piece; here it is influenced by martial arts. Unlike Pina Bausch, to whom she has been misleadingly compared, she does not use realistic images to suggest the universal. Instead she makes the generic or archetypal look specific. 
This is why people in street clothes in "Applause" can suggest oppressors in general and yet conjure up specific images of "the Disappeared," the victims of dictatorship in Argentina and Chile. When dancers in the piece fall, they are often pulled into the blackness behind the hanging colored strips. They disappear. 
In a program note Ms. Marin refers to Latin America as an exploited continent and rejects "a world where the success of a few stands in the face of powerlessness of billions of others." 
The power games in her piece are rendered with ingenious abstraction by nine dancers (there are never more than eight onstage). Three come to the forefront. Ulises Alvarez, who is Chilean, mixes brawn and grace. He is more executioner than victim but he also affects a passive man-in-the-street air. Ennio Sammarco has the stealth of a secret policeman and he peers into corners. Dominique Uber, in a red dress, has the same multiplicity of roles as others. But she is the nimble woman who climbs up the backs of others in the architectural clusters that suddenly break the deliberate monotony of people walking across the stage. 
Yet they do not walk without rhythm or haphazardly. Denis Mariotte's score on tape is a continuous hum shattered by percussive blasts (machine gun symbols). Francois Renard's lighting can dim menacingly and, like an interrogator's lamp, brighten excessively. The dancers flick the strips with increasing violence as they enter and exit, walking or racing in confined trajectories. The cumulative effect is meant to be oppressive and it is.
By the end the audience is no less worn out than the faces that peer apprehensively from behind the strips as if they were lifting curtains in fear. Ms. Marin's ever-committed dancers included Teresa Cunha, Isaias Jauregui, Sylvie Pabiot, Cathy Polo, Marcelo Sepulveda and Brigitte Valverde.

HEADLINE: Heineken Warns About a Sluggish First Half 

BYLINE:  By GREGORY CROUCH 

DATELINE: NIJMEGEN, the Netherlands, June 23 

 BODY:
Heineken, one of the world's biggest brewers, warned today that its profit for the first half of this year had stagnated, saying that woes ranging from weak economies to the war in Iraq were causing consumers to drink less beer rather than more.
 Heineken, based in Amsterdam, said the profit would not exceed the 330 million euros ($383.1 million) it earned in the first half of 2002. The company said it would not make a full-year forecast until it saw sales results from July and August -- crucial months in the beer business. The company, which sells Heineken, Amstel and Murphy's Irish Stout, is scheduled to release first-half figures on Sept. 10. 
 In trading in Amsterdam, shares of Heineken tumbled 12 percent, to 29.89 euros, their lowest level since October 1998.
Shares of other brewing companies also fell today amid a broad sell-off in European and United States markets. In London, both SABMiller and Scottish & Newcastle fell more than 5 percent. Interbrew fell 3.5 percent in Brussels. Anheuser-Busch slipped 1.3 percent, to $50.69, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Over all, beer markets in various nations are down even more than Heineken's performance," said Remco van der Meij, a financial analyst with the Amsterdam brokerage firm of Oyens & van Eeghen.
Heineken said today that its sales were down in the United States, the Netherlands, Greece, France and the Far East.
But the company noted that while sales volume fell, its market share did not decline.
"Heineken brands performed better than the underlying markets," the company's chief financial officer, Rene Hooft Graafland, told analysts in a conference call.
Besides political tensions, economic uncertainty and the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, on tourism, Heineken also cited bad weather for its weak sales. In particular, sales have fallen 10 percent in the Northeastern United States, company officials said. Heineken has a 23 percent market share in the imported beer business in the United States.
Mr. Graafland said that the company was abandoning its forecast for 7 percent sales growth in the United States this year, based on May figures. The recent smoking ban in New York City bars has hurt sales, too, the company said. 
"We clearly see that 7 percent is not realistic anymore," Mr. Graafland said. 
The strength of the euro against the dollar reduced Heineken's profits in euro terms by 10 percent in the period, the company said. Even so, Heineken said it was going ahead with its planned takeover of BBAG of Austria for 1.9 billion euros.

 Five years ago, one may recall, he abruptly closed his doors, ending a once promising career. And so forth and so on. Always something of a showman, as he dashed down his runway in velvet slippers waving a cigarette -- half Coward, half Crawford in "The Women" -- Mr. Mizrahi went on to perform on the stage and to have his own television talk show (on the Oxygen network). Last year, joining the race of designers going from class to mass, he signed up to create a fashion line for Target, the merchant based in Minneapolis. Those clothes, priced about $20 to $50 for cotton shirts, driving moccasins and corduroy shirtdresses, will be on sale in August. 
 Now, at the opposite extreme, Mr. Mizrahi has brought out a small line of made-to-measure clothes with prices from about $7,000 for a black silk faille dance dress to $18,000 for a fitted wool evening suit with fox sleeves. The clothes combine Mr. Mizrahi's wit (a camel's-hair coat was the obvious inspiration for a halter dress with an opulent fur collar) with his love of American sportswear (a polo dress striped in bugle beads). Notices have been sent to 100 potential clients, and fittings will be done in his design studio in Greenwich Village, where last Thursday afternoon he met with a couple of reporters and a photographer.
Looking mildly nonplused when asked why he chose the middle of a stinky economy to return to high fashion, Mr. Mizrahi replied: "I love clothes -- that's what made me want to do it." He added: "This is my idea of a tonic for a stinky economy. I wouldn't buy something that costs $1,800, but I would buy something that cost $8,000 -- or $8. I like very cheap clothes and very expensive clothes, what can I tell you?
"I mean, does Aerin Lauder not go to Target? People shop at both."
And though he is discussing licensing deals for other garments, he does not regard these ventures as a restart of his career. "I don't think I was ever really out of the fashion business," he said. "I could be deluding myself. I am a very delusional person."
He then turned his attention to the photographer, who was studying a model as she arranged her many-layered skirt on a bright orange chair.
"Are those suede, your pants, or doeskin?" Mr. Mizrahi asked.
The photographer looked up and then down at his trousers, as if he had never seen them before. "Australian brushed cotton," he said.
Whatever this venture means, Mr. Mizrahi, 40, says he is mentally in a different place than he was, say, seven years ago, when he had to meet the demands of retailers and editors. Now, he said, "there's nobody to tell me I can't do something I love." His new clothes reflect that less encumbered attitude. 
Just how many new and old customers he will find is hard to gauge. He was known for well-made clothes but not exquisitely detailed garments that justify huge prices. At the same time, a lot of young society women around town are used to borrowing clothes. 
He still plans to pursue other interests. He hopes to direct his first feature film, "The Extra Man," based on the Jonathan Ames novel about an older gentleman who goes to B-list dinners. He and Christine Vachon, who produced "Boys Don't Cry" and "Far From Heaven," own the film rights and are in the process of casting. "I'm going to direct that movie if it kills me," he said.
Mr. Mizrahi doesn't see a downside to designing a few more dresses. "I'm doing all the things I love," he said. "I tape three times a week. Sometimes I have one or two fittings, sometimes a lot. I go to Minneapolis. I don't really find it's time-consuming. In the end, I still have time to play computer bridge and freak out."

HEADLINE: Freeing a Nation From a Tyrant's Grip 

BYLINE:  By Colin L. Powell; Colin L. Powell is secretary of state.

 BODY:
Abrave man recently met with me and described how life in his country has become unbearable. "There is too much fear in the country, fear of the unknown and fear of the known consequences if we act or speak out," explained Pius Ncube, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Yet Archbishop Ncube speaks out fearlessly about the terrible human rights conditions in Zimbabwe, and is threatened almost every day with detention or worse.
 For hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans, the worst has already come. Millions of people are desperately hungry because the country's once-thriving agricultural sector collapsed last year after President Robert Mugabe confiscated commercial farms, supposedly for the benefit of poor blacks. But his cynical "land reform" program has chiefly benefited idle party hacks and stalwarts, not landless peasants. As a result, much of Zimbabwe's most productive land is now occupied by loyalists of the ruling ZANU-PF party, military officers, or their wives and friends. 
 Worse still, the entire Zimbabwean economy is near collapse. Reckless governmental mismanagement and unchecked corruption have produced annual inflation rates near 300 percent, unemployment of more than 70 percent and widespread shortages of food, fuel and other basic necessities. Is it any wonder that Zimbabweans are demanding political change, or that President Mugabe must rely on stepped-up violence and vote-rigging to remain in office?
On June 6, the police again arrested Mr. Mugabe's most prominent opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai. They paraded him in a courtroom in shackles and leg irons before releasing him on bail on June 20. His offense? Calling for work stoppages and demonstrations to protest economic hardship and political repression.
Like Myanmar's courageous opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Mr. Tsvangirai wages a nonviolent struggle against a ruthless regime. Like the Burmese junta, President Mugabe and his Politburo colleagues have an absolute monopoly of coercive power, but no legitimacy or moral authority. In the long run, President Mugabe and his minions will lose, dragging their soiled record behind them into obscurity. But how long will it take? How many good Zimbabweans will have to lose their jobs, their homes, or even their lives before President Mugabe's violent misrule runs its course?
The United States -- and the European Union -- has imposed a visa ban on Zimbabwe's leaders and frozen their overseas assets. We have ended all official assistance to the government of Zimbabwe. We have urged other governments to do the same. We will persist in speaking out strongly in defense of human rights and the rule of law. And we will continue to assist directly, in many different ways, the brave men and women of Zimbabwe who are resisting tyranny.
But our efforts are unlikely to succeed quickly enough without greater engagement by Zimbabwe's neighbors. South Africa and other African countries are increasingly concerned and active on Zimbabwe, but they can and should play a stronger and more sustained role that fully reflects the urgency of Zimbabwe's crisis. If leaders on the continent do not do more to convince President Mugabe to respect the rule of law and enter into a dialogue with the political opposition, he and his cronies will drag Zimbabwe down until there is nothing left to ruin -- and Zimbabwe's implosion will continue to threaten the stability and prosperity of the region.
There is a way out of the crisis. ZANU-PF and the opposition party can together legislate the constitutional changes to allow for a transition. With the president gone, with a transitional government in place and with a date fixed for new elections, Zimbabweans of all descriptions would, I believe, come together to begin the process of rebuilding their country. If this happened, the United States would be quick to pledge generous assistance to the restoration of Zimbabwe's political and economic institutions even before the election. Other donors, I am sure, would be close behind.
Reading this, Robert Mugabe and his cohorts may cry, "Blackmail." We should ignore them. Their time has come and gone. As Archbishop Ncube has said, "Things in our country can hardly get worse." With the perseverance of brave Zimbabweans, strengthened commitment from their neighbors, and the strong support of the international community, we can rescue the people of Zimbabwe. This is a worthy and urgent goal for us all.

International Fares Increased in May
 Domestic fares continue heading down, but international fares are rising, according to May statistics from the Air Transport Association. 
 The average fare for a 1,000-mile domestic trip was $117.83, down 4.3 percent from May 2002, the trade group said. The average fare for a 4,000-mile international trip was $399.35, up 3.8 percent. 
 The averages do not include taxes and fees and reflect all fares, including the deepest discount ones, for eight major domestic airlines.

China Southern Airlines Offers Discount Fares
 China Southern Airlines, www.cs-air.com/en, the largest airline in China, is trying to attract business with a "Welcome Back to China" post-SARS sale that is offering big discounts on its Premium Economy service between Los Angeles and China. The fare, which is available through July 11, is $999, with no minimum stay restrictions or weekend surcharges.
China Southern said the fare was also intended to entice new customers to sample its Premium Economy service, which features seats with a 40-inch pitch (comparable to first and business-class seat pitch in many airlines). 

Business-Jet Airline Suspends Operations
 Indigo, the start-up airline that offered scheduled flights between Chicago and northern New Jersey on business jets, has suspended operations. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: The Hawaiian Prints That Wouldn't Fade 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In the early 1980's, Tony Margolis would languish at his second home, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, and construct a fantasy familiar to anyone who has ever been on a vacation: what if you just never returned to wherever it was you came from? Mr. Margolis had an accomplice in these imaginings: his business partner Bob Emfield, who lived down the shore from him, on Bonita Beach.
 "We started kidding around about this guy who didn't have to go home, who never had to leave the beach," Mr. Margolis said. "When he needed beer money, he'd go into his closet and pull out a shirt, one of many, from a seamstress he'd met in Bora-Bora. He'd sell it to a friend, and make whatever he needed to get by." 
 Mr. Margolis and his partner never gave up work to sit permanently under a straw umbrella. Sportswear executives, they started three separate men's wear lines in 1992, one meant for the man whose sense of abandon had freed him of ever having to file another expense report. They called the label Tommy Bahama. A third partner, Lucio Dalla Gasperina, designed the line, which consisted primarily of silk Hawaiian shirts.
By the end of 1993, its first year in business, Tommy Bahama had generated $3.5 million in sales. The following year, the figure nearly tripled. Today, the company operates 32 stores around the country, and annual sales exceed $300 million, Mr. Margolis said. That is about $100 million more than the yearly revenues for Sean Jean. (The partners' two other lines, one geared toward skateboarders and the other bearing the unfortunate name Linguine & Bob, were failures.)
Tommy Bahama has met with such success that this month Oxford Industries of Atlanta acquired the brand (and its parent, Viewpoint International) for $325 million. The new capital will allow for 30 new Tommy Bahama stores, selling not just polo shirts and washed silk trousers but plates and bed linens, to open over the next three years, said Mr. Margolis, who will continue as chairman from his office overlooking Bryant Park in Manhattan.
To some, Tommy Bahama may conjure images of middle-income actuaries, yet the clothes have shown up at charity polo matches in Greenwich, Conn., and in the dining rooms of exclusive country clubs like Piping Rock on Long Island. At the Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove, N.Y., the head golf pro, Andrew Pohalski, said that in the last few years, the clothes, worn mostly for after-the-fairway lounging, have sold out in the club's shop. "I don't always want to order a lot because I'm apprehensive about it," he said. "Then they're the first clothes to sell out."
The enduring appeal of island kitsch (remember Trader Vic's) may in a way be responsible for Tommy Bahama's success in that demographic stratum. "There are so many parties out here themed toward the tropics," said Tom Tinling, manager of Rothman's, a men's shop in Southampton, N.Y. "People come in, and they want Tommy Bahama."
The company has worked to attract the more upscale man as well. In the mid-to-late 1990's, motivated in part by its wish to distinguish the line from competitors' knockoffs, it began to buy fabrics in Europe and to use more muted prints, Mr. Dalla Gasperina said. Two years ago, it began to run ads in magazines like W and Town & Country.
In retrospect, it hardly seems that the early 1990's were auspicious for a new clothing line embracing visions of lassitude. Status attached to professionals who worked the hardest. The high-tech world was beginning to flourish, and the era quickly produced an aesthetic that telegraphed the new premium placed on industry. The machine-age nylons and sleek economical lines advocated by Prada caught on largely because the style made you look neurotically pressed for time.
But Tommy Bahama's initial emphasis on silk Hawaiian shirts was not intended as an antidote to that cultural ethos. Rather, Mr. Margolis said, the founders chose the style because silk could be imported cheaply. Besides brightly colored shirts with giant printed images of flora and fauna, the company offered loose-fitting shorts and knit tops, none intended for the office.
The clothes first sold in small men's shops. Eventually they made their way to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. In 1996, the company opened its first store, in Naples, Fla., and included a restaurant, Jamaican Bay Rum in theme. The shop and dining room brought in $9 million that year, far surpassing expectations. Today, Hawaiian shirts make up only about 20 percent of Tommy Bahama's business, the rest coming in part from slouchy pleated pants and an emerging line of women's clothes designed by a vanished star of 80's fashion, Christian Francis Roth.
"When we opened the first store in Naples, it was kind of a laboratory," Mr. Margolis said. "What we found is that most who gravitated to it were not New York types, but Midwestern types and Canadian types." No stores are in the Northeast.
But the Tommy Bahama man is not so easily defined. "Could he barbecue?" Mr. Dalla Gasperina said. "Absolutely. Could he fly around in a private jet? Absolutely."
The company's founders refer to Tommy Bahama as "an aspirational lifestyle brand," but the label is in some sense just the opposite, given that the term is used to denote fantasies of patrician breeding, or at the very least a cool, acquired urbanity. Tommy Bahama dress shirts cost about $110, $40 or so more than the average white cotton dress shirt at J. Press, but the brand is trafficking in the spirit of solid middle-class populism and nostalgia for a time when 5 p.m. was not thought of in the workplace as midafternoon. All the clothes are cut generously enough to accommodate waistlines never reduced by personal trainers, and the line still has shirts emblazoned with sentiments like "Maximum Martinis, Minimum Bikinis."
Jim Schutter, a real-estate broker in Chicago, is in some ways the company's typical and dream customer, because he wears Tommy Bahama not only to play golf but also to his office, when temperatures permit. He does not exclude Hawaiian prints from his professional wardrobe.
"I have one of those stressful jobs," said Mr. Schutter, who is 54 and the father of a 5-year-old. "I'm a very conservative person, and this is my own small rebellion."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- Memphis; 
Graceland And FedEx Call It Home

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN 

 BODY:
FedEx is by far the biggest employer in Memphis, with 30,000 workers at its corporate headquarters in East Memphis and at its superhub at the airport; it alone gives the city a significant service industry. Manufacturing accounts for a larger share of the Memphis economy than for the country as a whole, from artificial hips made by Smith & Nephew to pumps made by Memphis Pump & Manufacturing Company. Manufacturing in Memphis has dwindled, causing the regional economy to shrink in 2001 and to grow slowly even now. But there are signs of improvement: In March, Toyota decided to build an engine block plant in nearby Jackson, Tenn.

AIRPORT
 Travelers say congestion at MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is remarkably light for a major hub airport -- Northwest or its affiliates accounted for 80 percent of the passenger traffic in 2002 -- but the concourses are long, putting the gates far from each other, from ticket counters and from ground transportation. 
 "It's a pretty friendly place to fly into," said Laurie Tucker, senior vice president for global marketing at FedEx and a Memphis native. "But you have to be prepared to walk." Sir Christopher O'Donnell, the chief executive of Smith & Nephew, a British medical instruments maker that has a factory in Memphis, said in an e-mail message that the airport is "generally good" for passengers. Its best feature may be the presence of FedEx, because, Sir Christopher said, "it helps us get our medical device products out quickly to our customers around the world."

HOTELS
Memphis's best-known hotel, the PEABODY (901-529-4000, $219 to $319), has recently been remodeled. It has an indoor swimming pool and an athletic club. "The Peabody offers close proximity to Beale Street or downtown attractions near the Mississippi River and the Redbirds baseball park, which is good for business entertainment," Sir Christopher said.
For longer stays, the TALBOT HEIRS GUESTHOUSE (901-527-9772, $150 to $250) is a group of apartments in the guise of a small, full-service hotel. There is no health club, but it offers to bring a treadmill or stair-step machine to any room at no charge. It also can arrange for a chef to prepare meals in guests' rooms.
Travelers with business in East Memphis, where many businesses have plants and offices, often recommend the EMBASSY SUITES (901-684-1777, $199 to $209). Sir Christopher said he liked having "a room for working and a room for sleeping" and appreciated that it was close to his company's Memphis office.

RESTAURANTS
Barbecue and soul food are plentiful and good in Memphis. Among the best places to find them are ALFRED'S (901-525-3711, $50 for dinner for two including drinks and tip) and ALCENIA'S DESSERTS AND PRESERVES SHOP (901-523-0200, $40). Ribs, pulled pork shoulder, fried chicken, catfish, meatloaf, fried green tomatoes and turnip greens are on the menus. Alcenia's also is praised for its desserts, particularly its bread pudding and German chocolate cake.
CIELO (901-524-1886, $140) serves beef and game with exotic ingredients in what used to be the owner's house, a four-story Victorian built in the 1880's. The interior decor is eclectic, an acquired taste for some.
McEWEN'S (901-527-7085. $120) serves elegant dishes and has a large wine list. Reservations are essential.

ENTERTAINMENT
BEALE STREET is one of the most storied addresses in popular music, having housed clubs that nurtured the blues and rock 'n' roll. The three-block-long historic district bustles with clubs and shops -- and enough tattoo parlors and dive bars to evoke its historic atmosphere.
GIBSON LOUNGE (901-544-7998), in the Gibson guitar factory, is perhaps the best live-music venue in Memphis. It is just outside the Beale Street historic district, and the cover charge is generally $10 or less.
Through August, the MEMPHIS REDBIRDS (901-721-6000), a Triple A minor league baseball team affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals, play in AutoZone Park, a new downtown stadium. The Triple A All-Star game will be played there July 16.

ON YOUR OWN
The MEMPHIS BROOKS MUSEUM OF ART (901-544-6200) is one of only two museums in the United States to show "The Glory of the Silk Road: Art from Ancient China." Through Aug. 3.
The NATIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM (901-521-9699) at the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, chronicles the history of civil-rights movements from the 17th century.
For an unusual afternoon out, there is the NATIONAL ORNAMENTAL METAL MUSEUM (901-774-6380).
And then there is GRACELAND (901-332-3322), Elvis Presley's home. From the meditation garden to the auto museum, it is almost not to be missed, at least once.

BUSINESS LORE
FedEx is exploring the possibility of buying out the Air National Guard facilities at the Memphis airport to give it room to expand. The Guard needs bigger hangars to accommodate the giant C-5 transport planes that are replacing its C-141's.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: New Products for Sale in Africa: Company Shares 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, June 19 

 BODY:
Owino Market is probably most people's idea of an African market. It is open from dawn to dusk, and each muddy, crowded path offers a different cut-rate commodity: rat poison at one stall, used brassieres at the next. "Shoes here!" yells one seller. A few feet away a rival is shouting, "Good pants!" at the top of his lungs.
 Blocks away, on Pilkington Road, is another market -- far quieter, far more orderly and without much to offer. It manages to conduct all its business in about 10 minutes a week. 
 This is the Uganda Securities Exchange -- one of the world's newest and smallest stock markets. There are only five stocks on the little board, and two of them are Kenyan companies that are also listed on the more robust Nairobi Stock Exchange. With just three young traders calling out orders, the action can be over minutes after it starts with the ringing of the tiny dinner bell.
On June 17 there was a single trade of a few hundred Bank of Baroda shares. Two days later, the market opened again and there were three speedy trades of 815 shares in British American Tobacco. Shares for Uganda Clay Ltd., East African Breweries and Kenya Airways remained idle.
It is a long way from Wall Street. Still, Africa today has 18 securities exchanges, up from just 10 a decade ago. The continent may still be known for its tumultuous open-air markets, but this is the coming thing. 
"African capital markets represent the final frontier of global capital," Robert Bunyi, a senior analyst at Liquid Africa, which gathers and distributes market data, said in a recent United Nations survey. 
At the top of the heap is the venerable Johannesburg Securities Exchange, which began in 1887 and has 472 listed companies and a market capitalization of more than $180 billion. Egypt and Nigeria are also stock market heavyweights, relatively speaking.
At the other end of the spectrum is the Ugandan exchange, which began four years ago. It uses a small conference room for trading, in the same building as the Uganda Lottery. Its market capitalization last year was $52 million.
But with the world'sgreat stock markets in the doldrums, investing in Africa is becoming an option for some adventurous money managers. The United Nations Development Program recently organized a conference in New York to open the eyes of more investors to the possibilities.
Two of the world's best performing stock exchanges last year are in Africa -- in Tanzania (where prices rose 40 percent in local currency terms) and in Botswana (which posted an increase of 32 percent, largely because the local currency strengthened). Indeed, the cumulative returns across sub-Saharan Africa for the past five years amounted to 4.3 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent drop for Standard & Poor's 500 and a 15.5 percent fall in the main London index.
This is not to suggest that investing in Africa is not risky. Tanzania has only recently opened up to foreign investors, having slowly turned its back on its socialist past. Lawmakers there have privatized most state-run enterprises, but foreigners are limited to a 60 percent stake in any company, and citizens get first crack at initial public offerings.
Volatility is a major concern. Ivory Coast's market, the hub for a regional exchange that includes seven other French-speaking countries in West Africa, has been thrown into turmoil since civil war broke out three years ago. 
One of the challenges the market here faces is educating Ugandans on how an equity market works. The exchange stages a road show that tries to teach the basics of stocks and bonds to villagers and city dwellers alike.
"I tell people that our market is just like the other local markets," said Jonathan Bushara, the bell-ringer and floor supervisor at the Uganda exchange. "It's just like someone walking into Owino and yelling, 'I want belts!' Sellers will come running from all over with belts."
Even if they grasp the concept, however, many Ugandans remain skeptical. Banks have regularly collapsed in this country for decades and many people have seen their life savings disappear. No wonder, then, that some regard the exchange as just another get-rich-quick scheme, not all that different from the slot machines and blackjack tables at the nearby Kampala Casino.
Still, the arrival of the exchange is beginning to generate an investor class, as well as people like Timothy Baguma, a tea grower and entrepreneur, who now speaks out at annual stockholder meetings and studies what little trading activity there is like a seasoned Wall Street analyst. 
"I'd like to play around a bit on our market," said Mr. Baguma, sitting at a desk stacked with annual reports, "but there's so little to play around with. We don't have enough companies. We don't have enough activity."
The managers of the Ugandan exchange like to point out that, puny though it may be, it is growing steadily. Even the New York Stock Exchange, they note, started with just a handful of stocks, though they grant that was more than two centuries ago. 
Kenya and Tanzania, which have larger exchanges, have agreed in principle to a joint East African stock exchange, a move aimed at strengthening the economy of the region.
Uganda's economy is one of the fastest growing in Africa, although it is buttressed by substantial donor assistance. 
President Yoweri Museveni notes that Uganda still has high unemployment and widespread poverty, but that the economy is on far more solid footing than it was 30 years ago, when Idi Amin expelled 50,000 Indian business owners and the country tottered on the brink of collapse.
"Assuming there is political stability, the potential for Uganda is very exciting," said A. M.Balihuta, deputy director of the Institute of Economics at Makerere University.
Perhaps the Uganda Securities Exchange will thrive and become a capitalist engine, producing jobs and wealth in Uganda and beyond. Still, its managers do not want to lose touch with its African market roots. 
Harriet Kiwanuka, the exchange's manager of research and market development, recently visited a high-tech trading center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that limits its stock transactions to computer screens. 
"It was so quiet it was like a hospital," she said. "There was no commotion at all. I like a little activity. A market is a market. It's buyers and sellers coming together. I don't want us to ever lose that."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Off as Investors Cash In Ahead of Fed's Meeting

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Without significant earnings or economic news to guide them, investors fell back on profit taking yesterday, sending stocks sharply lower and knocking the Dow Jones industrials down more than 120 points.
 Analysts expect the market to pull back or make little progress ahead of a decision tomorrow on interest rates. Investors anticipate that the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve will again cut rates to stimulate the economy, and analysts say that expectation has largely been factored into higher stock prices. 
 "The market has been extended," said Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla. "You have some people saying, 'I am not going to wait for the news to come out, I'm just going to book profits now.' " 
After tumbling as much as 162.46 points, the Dow ended the session yesterday down 127.80 points, or 1.4 percent, at 9,072.95. The decline came after a weekly gain of 0.9 percent, the Dow's fourth consecutive winning week.
Entering the last week of the second quarter, the Dow is up 13.5 percent, making this the best quarter for blue chips since the fourth quarter of 1998, when the index soared 17.1 percent.
The broader market also retreated. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 33.97 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,610.75, having risen 1.1 percent last week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.05 points, or 1.4 percent, to 981.65, having climbed 0.7 percent last week for its fourth consecutive weekly gain.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan, Beck & Company, said investors had been broadening their appetite for stocks, "but only to a certain price." 
"Now we see investors being more discriminating," he said.
The losses yesterday were moderate compared with more than three months of strong rallies on Wall Street, spurred by surprisingly strong first-quarter earnings and encouraging economic data. Even with the session's sell-off, the technology-focused Nasdaq is 26.7 percent above where it stood on March 11, the recent low point. The Dow has climbed 20.6 percent since March 11, while the S.& P. has gained 22.6 percent.
Among the losers, Tenet Healthcare, the hospital chain, dropped $4.22, or 26 percent, to $12.01, after warning that second-quarter earnings would be significantly below analysts' forecasts calling for 34 cents a share.
JetBlue fell 94 cents, to $38.01, after Bear, Stearns downgraded it to peer perform from outperform. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco declined 64 cents, to $36.36, after Morgan Stanley cut its rating to underweight from equal weight.
News of a merger pushed Idec Pharmaceuticals down $2.01, to $36.96, and Biogen, which also issued a profit warning, down $2.25, to $41.55. The companies, both searching for cures for cancer and autoimmune disorders, announced plans to combine in a stock swap.

Treasury Prices Climb
By Bloomberg News
 Treasuries rose yesterday as declines in stocks and expectations the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates tomorrow bolstered demand for government debt.
Interest rate futures show traders expect the Fed to lower its target rate for overnight loans between banks for the 13th time since January 2001, during a two-day meeting that starts today.
The benchmark 10-year note rose 11/32, to a price of 102 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.32 percent from 3.36 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond gained 19/32, to 115 18/32. Its yield dropped to 4.40 percent from 4.43 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Istanbul Journal; 
Europe's on Notice: Don't Mess With Our Lunch

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, June 23 

 BODY:
After a rough morning at the office, few things are as satisfying as a sandwich full of lamb guts. 
 At least that is the case in Istanbul, where people fan out at lunch hour to bite into a kokorec, a greasy bit of Turkish tradition consisting of toasted bread and fried lamb intestines that is as common here as the hamburger in the United States, 
 In rapidly modernizing Turkey, where elected officials are busily preparing the country for its hoped-for membership in the European Union, the kokorec (pronounced, appropriately enough, ko-ko-retch) has come to stand as a symbol of national pride amid the uncertainties of economic integration. 
When the word spreads here, as it often does, that the European Parliament has restricted and, in some cases, banned the sale of animal intestines, brains, livers and other organs, the Turks rally round the kokorec as if it were a wrongly accused member of the family. They sing songs. They don T-shirts. They go on television to defend its virtues. 
Most of all, though, the Turks keep eating the thing, celebrating a form of fast food that, on first encounter, often makes foreigners recoil. 
"You see, for Turks, the kokorec is like morphine," said Galip Tokoz, the owner of Sampiyon Kokorec, which has five franchises around the city. "They're addicted. It won't matter what Europeans say. People are going to keep eating their kokorec." 
After the outbreak of mad cow disease in the 1990's, the European Union banned the sale of a number of sheep organs and parts. 
The order sent a shudder through Greece, a European Union member, where the kokoresti, a sandwich almost identical to the kokorec, enjoys a similar place in the country's culinary heart. And when Turkey began its push to enter the union in the late 1990's, many Turks feared that the kokorec would have to disappear for the greater good of a larger gross domestic product. 
As the fear spread, a Turkish singer named Mirkelam composed a song about the sandwich in which the European Union was cast as an overbearing parent coming between two lovers. It became a hit.
Kokorec, ko-ko-ko
Kokorec, ko-ko-ko
How happy we are together, morning noon and night
Let's get together and defy the strangers who have come between us.
At Mr. Tokoz's stall in the city's main bazaar, the scene at lunchtime is a cacophony of talking, eating and the crackle of offal frying on an open griddle. Rolls of cold intestines, wound around a spit, stand in a pile, waiting for the next customer. Around the griddle is a remarkable cross section of the Turkish people: a judge, an office clerk, a computer technician, even a government health inspector. 
For many Turks, particularly those who migrated from the villages when they were young, the kokorec is a link to a more traditional past. Few urban Turkish families prepare the kokorec at home anymore, and the specially rolled and roasted spits of intestines are largely unavailable in retail food markets. 
"If I tried to cook this in my home, it would leave an awful smell," said Sibel Gurcan, who ate kokorec while growing up in a town outside Istanbul. "My mother used to make them, and I miss having them." 
For a sandwich made of guts, the kokorec is a delicately prepared affair. The miles and miles of intestines required to make a year's worth of sandwiches at Mr. Tokoz's restaurants are all bought in late winter. Mr. Tokoz, who has been working in restaurants since he was 10, believes that young lamb should be bought before the heat sets in, when, he believes, the meat toughens. Each February, he goes to an auction in Istanbul and buys thousands of lamb intestines. 
At that point, Mr. Tokoz wraps three large and two small intestines on a spit and roasts them in an oven until the outer skin is toasted. Then he places into a vast freezer some 80,000 spits, which will provide his shops for the next 12 months. 
At Mr. Tokoz's kokorec shop in the main bazaar, the rolls of intestines, fresh from the freezer, are stacked up and on display. When a sandwich is ordered, the cook hacks off a slice, chops it up and fries it in a pool of oil. The bread is toasted, and the meat is sprinkled with cumin and red pepper. 
The result is surprisingly subtle and tasty. One American reporter began with a tentative flirtation, which led first to daily binges and then to a mature appreciation of the delicacy as an occasional pleasure. 
Most Turks do not indulge everyday, either, but when they feel a craving for kokorec, they will go to great lengths to satisfy it. 
Turker Aksu, a computer technician in central Istanbul, rode a bus for 30 minutes across town the other day to have one of Mr. Tokoz's sandwiches. 
"If they ever banned the kokorec, I would be very sad," Mr. Aksu said. 
Happily, the kokorec will probably survive. The European Union is considering a revised ban on lamb organs that will affect only adult animals, not the young lamb Mr. Tokoz and others use for their delicacy. 
For his part, Mr. Tokoz says he is confident that not even the bureaucrats in Brussels could kill the prized Turkish delicacy. 
"Even if you banned it, you could never take it out of the Turkish home," he said. "The Turks will always want their kokorec."

GRAPHIC: Photos: To foreigners, it can sound wretched: kokorec -- ko-ko-retch -- consists of toasted bread and fried lamb intestines. Still, it is a favorite of Turks, drawing big lunchtime crowds in Istanbul. The European Parliament, however, looks askance at the sale of animal intestines, causing Turks to rally round the kokorec. They sing songs. They don T-shirts. They go on television to defend its virtues. (Photographs by Lynsey Addario/Corbis Saba, for The New York Time)

HEADLINE: Time to Re-engineer the Corps 

 BODY:
The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has a rare opportunity tomorrow to strike a blow for both fiscal sanity and the environment. Before the committee is a bill that would bring a measure of discipline and independent oversight to the Army Corps of Engineers, an incorrigibly spendthrift agency whose projects over the years have caused enormous damage to the nation's streams, rivers and wetlands. 
 The corps, a Pentagon agency with about 35,000 civilian employees, is basically the country's master builder, a giant engineering firm charged by Congress with dredging harbors, building levees, managing dams and replenishing beaches. According to studies by the General Accounting Office and the National Academy of Sciences, the agency has historically cooked the books by overestimating the economic payoffs of its projects in order to justify steadily greater budget outlays. On the environmental front, corps projects have turned free-flowing rivers into lifeless canals and destroyed millions of acres of wetlands -- usually in the name of flood control and navigation but mostly to satisfy Congress's appetite for pork. 
 The bipartisan reform bill before the committee would subject all projects costing more than $30 million to independent review -- an idea supported by the Bush administration. The bill would also make environmental and economic benefits co-equal considerations, and require the corps to replace wetlands it destroys with wildlife habitat of equal value.
The vote is expected to be close, and a handful of moderate Republicans from the Northeast could make the difference. They are Sherwood Boehlert, Sue Kelly and Jack Quinn from New York, Rob Simmons of Connecticut, and Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey. A victory for this bill would virtually ensure its success on the House floor and give a big push to a similar measure in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Indian Premier's Talks in Beijing Signal Better Relations 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 23 

 BODY:
India and China signed agreements here today that could warm the often chilly relations between the two most populous countries, and India's prime minister proclaimed that a long era of mutual suspicion was ending.
 "We should focus on the simple truth: that there is no objective reason for discord between us and neither of us is a threat to the other," Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said. He was on the second day of a weeklong visit to China, the first by an Indian leader in a decade. 
 Mr. Vajpayee and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China signed a joint statement that they described as a road map to improving relations between the countries. Among the steps were efforts to promote cultural and scientific exchange, increase trade and ease visa rules. China promised to invest $500 million in India. 
But it was not clear if the two sides had made much progress in mapping their mountainous border, a serious impediment to close relations since the two fought a savage territorial war in 1962.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, referred to the still sensitive border dispute when he said the two countries were trying to "aggressively resolve historical problems."
"The basic thinking is according to what the leaders of the two countries agreed upon in the past, and that is negotiating on equal footing, mutual understanding and giving in," he said.
He did not provide details of whether the visit by Mr. Vajpayee would produce more than a commitment to talk further about the border issue.
Since India broke free of British rule and China came under Communist control more than 50 years ago, their relations have been strained by distrust and strategic rivalry.
China resented India's decision to give shelter to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, after the 1959 uprising in Tibet against Chinese rule. Tensions increased as both sides sought to stake their claims to territory, resulting in the 1962 military conflict along three fronts.
It took nearly a quarter of a century to resume normal relations.
Rajiv Gandhi and Li Peng, the Indian and Chinese prime ministers, reached the first major diplomatic agreement in 1988 and began a series of 15 high-level meetings to promote a stronger relationship, including this visit by Mr. Vajpayee.
Economic ties have begun to expand. Bilateral trade grew to $5 billion in 2002, from $338 million a decade ago, though neither country is a major trading partner of the other.
India and China have both expressed concern about the United States' use of military power around the world, and both were publicly opposed to the war in Iraq. That has led to predictions that the two Asian powers could put aside their differences and cooperate more closely, possibly in tandem with Russia, to limit American influence.
But individually, both China and India have been developing closer ties with the United States as well. It is not clear that India's weariness about American power is sufficient to overcome its suspicious about China's intentions, especially during a period when China's fast growing economic and financial power have left India well behind.
Strategic relations are not close. 
Beijing has favored ties with Pakistan, India's archrival, since the 1962 war. India accused Beijing of helping Pakistan develop nuclear weapons. It used Beijing's support for Pakistan as a justification for becoming a nuclear power itself.
China denies it helped Pakistan build a nuclear bomb. But in 1998, India identified China, rather than Pakistan, as its main long-term security problem.
During his visit to Beijing, Mr. Vajpayee made clear India's concern about China's relationship with Pakistan when he accused Pakistan of failing to crack down on militants fighting Indian rule in disputed Kashmir.
Mr. Vajpayee, who has opened a new bid to seal a peace agreement with Pakistan, told Prime Minister Wen that he was disappointed by what he described as Pakistan's refusal to end its involvement in Kashmir, which has seen 13 years of strife.
Mr. Vajpayee "mentioned to him our concerns regarding Pakistan and the need for Pakistan to bring cross-border terrorism to an end as quickly as possible," the Indian foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, said after Mr. Vajpayee met Mr. Wen.
Still, the two countries emphasized their areas of agreement and their similar positions on global issues.
"With identical or similar views on many significant international issues, the two countries' need for coordination and cooperation is increasing," Mr. Wen said.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: INSURANCE DISCLOSURE; 
Court Rejects Law Designed to Help Holocaust Survivors Get Insurance Information

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court yesterday struck down a California law designed to help Holocaust survivors receive payment on insurance policies that European companies have long denied, saying that the law improperly interfered with United States foreign policy.
 But California officials, several members of Congress and private lawyers said they would increase their efforts to force the companies to publish lists of their Holocaust-era policyholders and to make good on what some Holocaust and insurance experts estimate could be several billion dollars worth of unpaid life insurance policies. 
 "These companies must still deal with California," said John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, who has broad authority to regulate insurers. "I am sure that companies that operate now and wish to continue operating in the fifth-largest economy in the world will do everything they can to address this issue." 
The American Insurance Association, which took the case to the Supreme Court on behalf of member companies that are subsidiaries of European insurers, said it was gratified by the decision. But in response to Mr. Garamendi's remark, a spokeswoman, Nicole Mahrt, would only say, "We'll have to review any decisions or actions he takes."
The California governor, Gray Davis, said in a statement that he would do "everything in my power to bring some measure of peace to survivors and victims' families."
Writing for the majority in the 5-to-4 decision, Justice David Souter said letting the California law stand would "hamstring the President's settling international controversies."
The California law, adopted in 1999, required the subsidiaries of European companies to produce the names of millions of policyholders who bought coverage from their parent companies in Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe between 1920 and 1945. Failure to comply could have cost the companies their licenses to do business in the state.
California officials and historians have contended that because documents were lost in the Holocaust and many with knowledge of the insurance died in concentration camps, the only way survivors can know if they are owed money is if the names of policyholders are published.
But the insurers have persistently refused to produce full lists of policyholders. They say European privacy laws bar publication of names, that producing such lists would be costly and that in any case many records have been destroyed -- a point disputed by some Holocaust experts.
In both the majority opinion and a dissent written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court noted that during the Holocaust, the German authorities confiscated many life insurance policies and that insurers simply refused to pay claims on many others, sometimes insisting that claimants meet the impossible demand of presenting copies of policies and death certificates. As a result, the court said, the rightful beneficiaries were never paid.
In 1998, facing more than a dozen lawsuits and under the threat from regulators of having their licenses to do business revoked, a half-dozen European insurers agreed to join in the founding of the International Commission on Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims. One goal of the commission, which included regulators and Jewish groups, is the publication of the names of policyholders.
It has so far published on the Internet about 422,000 names, most obtained through a settlement between the United States and Germany over several Holocaust issues. But Holocaust experts say millions of policies remain unaccounted for.
In the settlement with Germany, the United States also agreed to discourage lawsuits or regulatory action against German companies, and it filed a brief in the California case.
For several years, Justice Souter noted, the United States policy has been to try to resolve Holocaust insurance issues through negotiations, rather than litigation or unilateral lawmaking. Washington has regarded the international commission as the proper forum for resolving the insurance disputes. But the commission has been criticized by many people as being ineffectual.
In the decision yesterday, Justice Souter wrote that by trying to force action by the insurance companies, "California seeks to use an iron fist, where the president has consistently chosen kid gloves."
"We have heard powerful arguments that the iron fist would work better," he continued, adding that it was not for the court to decide between the two. Rather, he said, it was the court's task to deal with the conflict over foreign policy.
"The evidence," he concluded, quoting an earlier decision, "is more than sufficient to demonstrate that the state act stands in the way of diplomatic objectives" of the president.
Two lawyers pursuing lawsuits over Holocaust-era insurance policies against Assicurazioni Generali, an Italian company -- Linda Gerstel in New York and Bill Shernoff in California -- said the decision would not derail their cases. Both have said they hope to obtain full policyholder lists in their litigation.
Earlier this year, four congressmen introduced legislation requiring -- or permitting states to require -- publication of the lists. One of them, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said in a statement that he had signed up 50 co-sponsors and that he believed the court's decision "would spur momentum to get more sponsors and move this legislation forward."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE CAMPUS; 
Diversity Still Crucial Issue At University, Students Say

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 23 

 BODY:
On the steps of the Michigan student union, in the heart of the campus where the affirmative action cases began, students declared the Supreme Court decisions a victory this afternoon.
 No matter the nuances of the decisions, students said they viewed the outcome as a victory for the University of Michigan's goal of diversity. 
 "It's the principle of affirmative action that we really care about," said Rahul Saksena, a senior who worked with Students Supporting Affirmative Action, one of several groups that emerged in response to the challenges to the school's policies. "We're confident that the administration will find a way to handle the part they need to change." 
While there were students disappointed by the decision, they were far quieter. But many people have left Ann Arbor for the year, and the spring half-term of classes ended just last week. 
Along State Street near campus, several students said they disagreed with the manner with which race is considered in admissions at the university and were disenchanted by the ruling, but that they were reluctant to say so because they felt uncomfortable disagreeing with what they viewed as a widely accepted political position on campus.
Today's decisions will require a shift in the school's undergraduate admissions policy, which had included race as one factor in a numeric point system. But the policy for the university's law school, which takes race into account in a "highly individualized" manner, will stand.
University officials intend to modify the undergraduate policies by this fall, said Mary Sue Coleman, the university president, in a teleconference this afternoon. Although the details of the new policy still need to be sorted out, the law school's method, now endorsed by the courts, might be a model, university officials said.
Ms. Coleman said she viewed the decision as a "tremendous victory," and said she did not expect to have trouble adjusting to a new undergraduate policy that looks at race in a more individualized way.
John Adams, who just finished law school here, interpreted the court's ruling this way: "You can use race, but don't be too obvious about it."
In the halls of the Michigan Union, some students wondered whether an individualized approach was practical. How, asked Jeremy Fields, a medical student, could admissions officers consider tens of thousands of undergraduate applicants on an "individualized" basis? Getting rid of the number system, he said, sounded unlikely. "I think what you'll end up seeing is it'll be a de facto point system -- and they'll just say they aren't points."
Ruben Duran, the editor in chief of the Michigan Review, a student-run conservative publication, said he feared the new undergraduate system, whatever it is, will wind up being "even less transparent." 
Mr. Duran, a senior who said he is opposed to affirmative action, called the court action "pretty muddled."
But Concepcion Escobar, who graduated from the law school here last month and was studying for the bar exam this afternoon, said she believed the ruling was perfectly clear. "This has consecrated diversity in the law books," Ms. Escobar, 31, said. "The policy is safer now."
She said she probably would not have been admitted to this university if not for its policies on race. "It wouldn't have happened without affirmative action," she said. She described herself as part Native American and part Mexican-American and said she grew up in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood of Chicago. 
One question, however, remained in the minds of several students, including Ms. Escobar, even after the court's decision -- the matter of economic diversity. 
"When I look at this law school, there are so few poor minorities," Ms. Escobar said. "I'm a poor minority. I grew up poor. But if you grew up rich -- a rich white person, a rich black person, a rich Latino -- you don't need anything extra. So many people here come from the same rich white suburbs as the white people come from."
Though the long court battle finally reached its conclusion today -- as noted in blue and yellow chalk on the sidewalk outside the union -- the most vocal students said the issue of how to maintain and nurture diversity is not over. 
Clair Morrissey, a senior, said she wanted to push for new ways to keep minority students at the school once they were admitted. Neal Lyons, who is starting his fifth year here, said he wanted to encourage more integration and diversity elsewhere, like in the nation's grade schools.
"This reinvigorated us," Mr. Lyons said. "It's not good that affirmative action was attacked, but in every challenge, there's also an opportunity."

HEADLINE: As Organizers Feud, a Rally for Jobs and Justice Stalls in Los Angeles 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 23 

 BODY:
It is understood on the streets of gangland that a rivalry can leave you dominant or it can leave you dead.
 But sometimes it can leave you nowhere at all, and that is why there has so far been no march for jobs and justice through the streets of South-Central Los Angeles. 
 This is where a rivalry simmers between Tony Muhammad, the Western regional minister of the Nationof Islam, and Daude Sherrills, a broker of a 1992 cease-fire in the Watts district between the Bloods and Crips street gangs.
The two men possess an uncommon credibility in the less recommended corners of Los Angeles County that are home to 112,000 men and women believed to be gang members or "wannabes." 
Mr. Muhammad, 45, a man with an affinity for biblical metaphors and tailored suits who wears a diamond encrusted ring as large as a goiter, strikes an avuncular tone when he speaks of gang leaders as "heads of state," "giants" and "city leaders."
Mr. Sherrills, 35, a former Crip who has spent his life in the notorious Jordan Downs housing projects, calls the more violent gang members "lost brothers in a broken city."
The two men had plans to bring together more than 300 gang factions for a 100,000 Man March to protest the lack of jobs in Los Angeles's ghettoes, in the spirit of the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., in 1995.
But a barnyard can accommodate only so many roosters, and the two men bickered over who should receive credit as the event's organizer. They had words over penmanship, business acumen and, of course, money. The march was to be held in January, but it turned out that organizing men who are organized against each other proved too big an obstacle.
The march, postponed several times, has never materialized. Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Sherrills have agreed to meet on Wednesday to try to revive the event.
This may prove difficult, since Mr. Muhammad maintains the march was his idea and Mr. Sherrills disagrees, stressing his point with withering expletives. Most important, $2 million is needed to pay for the event, and less than $4,000 has been raised.
"Politics, man," Mr. Sherrills said. "The Nation of Islam, that scares people away. It's got to be nonreligious, but the minister's trying to make it all about himself. That doesn't go over with the Christians and the city officials and the brothers on the block."
A drive-by shooting at Mr. Muhammad's mosque in late March seemed to amplify the possibility that the march might never happen and underscore the shifting allegiances and sensitive egos that contribute to the perception of South-Central as an area of terror and shiftlessness.
So pervasive is this perception that city elders recently decreed that the area south of First Street should no longer be referred to as South-Central, but as South Los Angeles. Whatever it is called, the area is troubled. Unemployment is estimated at 15 percent in a population of 765,000. Violence is endemic. It is isolated by freeways that bind it and pass over it. There is tension between blacks and the growing Latino population. Half the households make less than $25,000 a year.
Last year, with the murder rate escalating, Mr. Sherrills began circulating the statistic that one in four men murdered on the streets of Los Angeles had been wearing Nike athletic apparel.
There was no science behind it. "I just noticed it, that's all," Mr. Sherrills said. "I see a lot of dead brothers in the streets."
The observation became the stuff of urban legend, and people in South-Central now commonly quote the proportion of those murdered in Nike as 85 of every 100.
Mr. Muhammad, a former drug dealer from the streets of Atlanta, was intrigued.
"The young men of this community are killing each other for shoes," he said. "Young Brother Sherrills came to me with this statistic and I began to formulate the idea that the companies that make their money on our people should contribute jobs for our people."
Mr. Muhammad, at the request of Nike, drafted a letter in the name of the organizing committee asking the company to underwrite the march and commit $40 million toward the construction of an apparel factory in South Los Angeles.
Mr. Sherrills was annoyed that the minister had put the letter together without his consultation.
"A shakedown," he called it. The minister's letter was never sent. A few weeks later, the mosque was shot up. Though the authorities believe the attack was unrelated to the dispute over leadership, it offers a window into the waning influence of the Nation of Islam on the Los Angeles streets, the reason Mr. Muhammad was selected by Louis Farrakhan, the nation's leader, eight years ago to resuscitate the movement.
Years ago, a drive-by shooting at a mosque would have been unimaginable. In the past, it was precisely the sort of disaffected young man who today might join a gang that was drawn to the nation, which preached black separatism and an unorthodox brand of Islam.
"Minister Tony thinks he's got more influence out here than he really does," he said. "People see him trying to steal this march for himself," and they do not want to be involved.
Indeed, those close to the Latino gangs said the Nation of Islam and brotherhood with black, white and Asian gangs meant little to them.
"These guys don't think they're going to make it past 25, and the last thing they're thinking about is organizing," said Alex Sanchez, director of Homies Unidos, a gang outreach group. "They know money gets made off their signatures. But before they sign, they want to know how much bread can you put in their stomachs."
Before any young man participates, Mr. Sanchez said, Mr. Sherrills and Mr. Muhammad will have to decide who is the chef.
