HEADLINE: Madrid Journal; 
Trying to Quiet Another City That Barely Sleeps

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
With the roar of traffic in the very heart of Madrid it is hard to make out the murmur of voices coming from a group huddled on the pavement, but as the volume increases the babble rises to an incomprehensible if audible peak and then fades into shushing, followed by a staccato chorus: "Listen. To. Your. Noise. Control. Your. Noise."
 This brief performance, repeated several times over by half a dozen actors in exaggerated makeup is part of a municipal campaign to silence residents in a city that may sleep (sometimes during the day) but rarely shuts up. 
 Madrid's noise ordinance, instituted last year, defines five "acoustic zones." Sound levels in mainly residential areas, known as "type II" zones, should not exceed 65 decibels during the day and 55 decibels at night. "Type III" zones, commercial areas with bars and restaurants, carry limits of 70 decibels by day and 60 decibels at night, but data from the city's sound-monitoring stations show that sound levels routinely exceed 70 decibels in both areas around the clock. 
The city's two-year campaign is aimed mostly at 9- to 14-year-olds, on the theory that -- besides being some of the greatest offenders -- they are most receptive to education and might even nag their parents into changing their bad habits. But for the first few days, adults were also targets.
"Some people respond to us by making even more noise, but most have been very nice," said Alberto Diaz, one of the actors, as he handed out balloons bearing the campaign logo "Control Your Noise."
"They're not sure what the solution is, but they all know that noise is a problem," Mr. Diaz said, struggling to be heard over the sound of a street-cleaning machine and the trilling of passing cellphones.
The main sources of acoustic pollution in central Madrid -- which, like most European cities, was designed and built long before the advent of motor vehicles -- are traffic, public works and the chatter of people, mostly at the tops of their voices. 
The shrieking car alarms that are a target of an anti-noise campaign in New York City are not an issue here: the problem of stationary cars is usually that they are double- or triple-parked, causing congestion, hard feelings and, inevitably, honking.
On main roads, the thunder of traffic penetrates even offices and homes with double windows, while at traffic lights, horns will inevitably sound to signal green a nano-second after the lights change -- even at 4 a.m. on Sunday, when traffic jams are quite common in central Madrid. 
Add a construction boom, coupled with an urban renewal plan that is replacing bridges over the streets with tunnels, and a continuing project to lay underground cable, and one result is a chorus of jackhammers. 
But what really makes this city -- and makes it noisy -- is life lived out of doors, especially in summer. Sidewalk cafes, children's playgrounds, park benches are all packed with people, young and old, until the small hours. Most are speaking loudly, if not actually shouting, to be heard over the music, traffic or the sounds of other people.
A new European Union directive requires all large cities to cut noise levels by five decibels between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m., and by 10 decibels between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., but Madrid will be unable to comply. "To cut noise levels by five decibels, a third of the population would have to go indoors," said Placido Perera, director of Madrid's acoustic control unit. "The levels were set mainly by the Germans and Danes, who are all at home by 5 p.m. because it's so cold." 
In addition to education, the campaign is trying to lower the volume by persuading people to make modest lifestyle adjustments, like wearing slippers at night and refraining from slamming doors or using washing machines after 11 p.m.
This effort has been greeted with bemusement or angry derision by many citizens, especially those tortured by the "botellon" -- the teenage culture of gathering in squares and on sidewalks to party.
"They have the nerve to tell us how to quiet down when they don't even respect their own laws," fumed Carlos Delgado, who lives in a neighborhood known for its happening night life.
Mr. Perera's office sits on Plaza Barcelo, a favored teenage hangout. A new municipal law bans open-air drinking, but residents complain that it is rarely enforced. 
"It's pathetic," Mr. Delgado said crossly. "They went to the school in Plaza Barcelo to tell the kids not to shout at home when they know that they are out at 5 a.m. on a Friday night in the same square throwing firecrackers."
The botellon culture is indeed a target for reform. Jose Luis Blanco, who is coordinating the anti-noise campaign, said the young people were very receptive to the message that "it is possible to hang out with your friends in the park without shouting."
The anti-noise campaign will visit more than 320 local schools, and next year, Mr. Blanco and his team of actors plan to branch out to bars. "We will try to persuade people that it is possible to speak more quietly, that there's no need to shout at 2 a.m.," he said, even if they are drunk.
Mr. Perera said that the campaign was meant to be a long-term re-education process, and that the city was also restricting late-night bar licenses, subsidizing the soundproofing of affected houses and calming traffic by widening sidewalks and restricting parking.
In November, parking meters will go into operation around central Madrid. But most people here say they are more likely to set off a rebellion -- as a similar plan did some years ago -- than to solve the noise problem. This is, after all, a city where residents consider it their constitutional right to double-park.

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood Clinic Helps Fill the Gap for Latinos Without Health Care 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
MariBel Garcia lives near several good doctor's offices and hospitals, but as far as she is concerned they might as well not be there at all. Her housecleaning and restaurant jobs have never provided health insurance. Few local facilities have Spanish-speaking staff members. Even making an appointment, given her limited English skills, is a daunting, often humiliating, experience.
 "They don't understand my language, my culture, my issues," said Ms. Garcia, 40, who came to the United States from El Salvador 15 years ago and is now a legal resident. "I would rather wait and see a doctor on a visit to El Salvador than go through that difficulty." 
 Although Ms. Garcia recently got insurance through a new city program for the poor, she prefers to rely solely on La Clinica del Pueblo, a scrappy but welcoming neighborhood clinic in the heart of Washington's Latino community that operates primarily in Spanish and treats anyone regardless of legal status or ability to pay.
In Latino enclaves nationwide, facilities like La Clinica are filling gaps in the health care system that sometimes leave Hispanics feeling shut out. The number of Americans without health insurance rose significantly last year, new census figures show, to 14.6 percent. An estimated 30 to 37 percent of Hispanics living in the United States are uninsured, the figures indicate, the largest percentage of any ethnic group.
For immigrant communities in particular, neighborhood clinics address a number of barriers to health care. The majority of Latinos who are uninsured are working poor, juggling part-time jobs that do not provide benefits. Those in poverty are often barred from aid as a result of 1996 welfare changes, which cut access for new immigrants to programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
Some forms of public assistance have been reinstated since 1996, and additional restorations, such as the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, are pending before the Senate. But figuring out who qualifies for assistance in immigrant families, which often have members of varying legal status, is difficult.
Many of those who qualify for aid are afraid to apply, fearful that being perceived as a burden on society will hurt their residency or citizenship applications.
Ms. Garcia had all of those concerns when she first used the Washington clinic more than 10 years ago. "I don't know what we'd do without La Clinica," said Ms. Garcia, whose entire family has used the clinic for everything from routine checkups to emergency care.
Housed in an old Presbyterian church turned multipurpose community center a few miles north of the White House, La Clinica del Pueblo is not known by many outside the neighborhood.
But ask nearly any neighborhood resident and he or she will automatically point the way -- past the street vendors selling fresh sliced mangoes, through the double doors papered with colorful fliers, up the dimly lighted stairway -- to the main reception area abuzz with activity. 
Started with a volunteer doctor in 1983 to serve the influx of Central Americans into Washington, La Clinica initially was open only on Tuesday nights. Today, with a $4 million operating budget provided by the city and federal governments and by private donors, the clinic operates full time with 46 staff members and more than 100 volunteers, all of whom speak more than one language. Of the roughly 500 patients who file in and out each week more than 90 percent are uninsured. 
"We've always had to come through the back door of the health system," said Dr. Juan Romagoza, La Clinica's executive director. "So here we open the door as wide as possible." 
Government and mainstream health care institutions are becoming more appreciative of community facilities like La Clinica. Chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes are increasing rapidly among Latinos, as are socially transmitted diseases like H.I.V. and hepatitis. Poor access to primary care, health care officials realize, will result in greater long-term costs to the system.
In August, President Bush announced a plan to pay for 1,200 new community health care centers over the next five years.
"It's fundamental to the entire health system, and to the economy, to improve the health status of Hispanics in the U.S.," said Dr. Elena Rios, president of the National Hispanic Medical Association, a Washington-based organization of Hispanic doctors. 
One of the programs being expanded by La Clinica and other centers is the "promotores de salud" or "health promoter" program. The program trains community members to be lay health workers who circulate through neighborhoods espousing the benefits of healthy habits and preventative care. 
The centerpiece of La Clinica's promotores program is "Domingos saludables" or "healthy Sundays." The once-a-month health fair, usually held at neighborhood churches, offers free blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol testing, nutrition and exercise guidance and counseling on substance abuse, mental health care and H.I.V. prevention.
Rebeca Munoz, a dental assistant who stocked hospital supply rooms in her native El Salvador before coming to the United States in 1994, works several nights a week as a promotora in H.I.V./AIDS prevention.
"It's not like doctor and patient," said Ms. Munoz, 49, a soft-spoken wife and mother of four who spends hours at self-service laundries, parks and bus stops talking to people about safe sex and intravenous drug use. "We respect the people, and they respect us. Everyone is just talking in Spanish, and soon people are not afraid. It's like family."
Similar health promoter programs operate in other cities, including Chicago, El Paso and Providence, R.I. 
"We've seen that these people have enormous credibility in their communities," said Yanira Cruz, director of the Institute for Hispanic Health at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy agency that is helping La Clinica pay for a new promotores position dedicated to diabetes. 
In April, La Clinica received a $900,000 grant from the District of Columbia Department of Housing and Community Development to renovate a 12,000-square-foot facility a few blocks from the existing clinic. Dr. Romagoza is thrilled, but he says the growing support given to clinics such as his does not lessen the need for federal and state agencies and local hospitals and doctors to better serve changing populations.
MariBel Garcia could not agree more. She hopes to become a citizen, and, she adds, she intends to vote.
"The politicians, the leaders, they want to ignore us," she said. "They think they can speak a slogan in Spanish and this is enough -- but it is not enough for me. They have to pay attention to our issues." In the meantime, La Clinica, she knows, is there.

If Nobody Lifts An Umbrella, Can It Rain?

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
YOU can tell that Election Day is just a month away, with the major candidates for governor competing energetically over such matters as who can raise and spend more (Gov. George E. Pataki) and who can suffer the most self-inflicted wounds (Comptroller H. Carl McCall, virtuoso of that fine political art of writing for jobs).
 Would that the candidates lavished as much attention on a matter that touches every New Yorker more directly: the budget. It is suffering in the weakened economy, and the state has few resources left to make up for dropping revenues. Mr. Pataki, betting that the economy would recover, spent nearly all of the state's rainy-day fund to buffer the impact of Sept. 11. Critics have noted that the strategy is in line with the state's well-worn tradition of upbeat election-year budgets. 
 The governor seems to have gambled badly. The economy is still slow, Wall Street is still in trouble -- so much that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is finally weighing tax increases -- and a transit-fare increase is looming.
At the same time, the state's revenues are falling, with personal-income-tax collections declining for the second year running, down by 21 percent through August, compared with the same period last year. And income-tax collections have dropped even more steeply in the city.
The state relied so heavily this year on one-time revenues by spending about 80 percent of its reserve funds that it is not at all clear how New York will close a budget deficit that the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, recently predicted could be as high as $10 billion. The subject seems worth a public airing. But the public has little concept of how the candidates would address the problem. "I think they just can't talk about it until the election," said Frank Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute. "They are saying this year's budget is balanced. The response is, it is very precariously balanced." Another budget analyst predicts the coming of "a perfect storm -- enormous deficits in all parts of government. And nobody talks about it."
The one exception is the Independence Party candidate, Tom Golisano, the wealthy businessman who is running as an outsider, and so has made an issue of Albany's budget woes. Mr. Pataki disputes the severity of the problem, and Mr. McCall, while acknowledging the difficulties, is only mildly critical and has not made the budget the centerpiece of his campaign.
Perhaps neither major candidate wants to face uncomfortable questions, among them the prospect of tax increases and agency cuts, and whether it would help if the governor froze spending immediately. Standard & Poor's recently said the state had done well covering revenue gaps to date, drawing on those depleted reserves. And now? "We're not saying there's no challenge now, and not just for New York," said Robin Prunty, director of the company's public finance department.
Nor are the challenges in New York limited to Albany -- thanks to Albany. The state took a large portion of the city's new cigarette tax, contending that the higher fee would hurt sales and therefore reduce state tax revenues. The Pataki administration is using part of a federal welfare surplus for state budget relief, rather than letting localities spend the money. And local and county governments are, through Medicaid payments, financing part of the raises that Mr. Pataki granted to the politically potent hospital workers union. 
The governor and legislative leaders could already be confronting the fiscal problem. But that would mean acknowledging it before Election Day. Before the perfect storm breaks over the state capital.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS -- A recent column puzzled over the failure of an independent consultant, McKinsey & Company, to interview former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani about its analyses of the city's emergency response on Sept. 11. Those studies praised the heroism of the Police and Fire Departments that day, but also found serious organizational and communications flaws.
Mr. Giuliani has disputed some findings and argued that if he had been queried he could have corrected, or at least addressed, them. Why wasn't he questioned?
McKinsey declined to comment. Officials of the Police and Fire Departments said the reviews, undertaken at their request, analyzed the nuts and bolts of department operations, not administrative leadership, so interviews were limited to hundreds of police and fire personnel.
Those officials said on Friday that while they still thought the approach was right on the merits, they also wished in hindsight that Mr. Giuliani had been interviewed, if only to try to avoid inviting his disapproval.

HEADLINE: Enthusiasm By Democrats Over Elections Is on the Wane 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Democratic leaders who two months ago predicted a strong showing in Congressional elections this fall have markedly scaled back their views, saying their hopes had been dimmed both by a concerted White House effort to focus attention on Iraq and by disarray in their own party over how to respond to the threat of war.
 Democratic leaders said they were far from giving up on winning control of the House and holding on to or expanding their lead in the Senate. They pointed to polls showing voters were upset about the economy and the overall direction of the nation. 
 But in a series of interviews, Democrats said the party's fortunes had shifted measurably since the optimistic days of last summer, when some party leaders were saying they might take back the House and expand their one-seat Senate margin. 
Democratic leaders said they believed party candidates had been hurt by the visible emergence of a powerful antiwar Democratic lobby, including the visit by three Democratic members of Congress to Baghdad last week that Republicans noted with more than a little glee.
Party leaders also noted the contrast between the public displays of division by Democrats arguing over when to have a vote, and what the resolution should say, with the relatively solid front presented by Republicans, whose dissent of last summer appears to have vanished. 
"It's gone from robust optimism six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, to some real pessimism," said Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, in assessing his party's prospects.
In Georgia, Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat who is often critical of his party, said the Democrats were allowing themselves to be outmaneuvered on the Iraq issue and in the debate on a homeland security bill.
"It could not have happened at a worse moment," he said. "I am feeling a lot less optimistic than I was two weeks ago. This is a total disconnect with the American people."
The expressions of concern came at what Democratic and Republican officials described as a pivotal time in the midterm Congressional campaigns. The middle of October has traditionally been the time when many voters begin tuning in for the first time on campaigns that have been going on all summer.
Democrats expressed hope that the agreement reached by some senior Democrats to support Mr. Bush's Iraq resolution could help remove it from the political arena. Democrats said they were eager to return to campaigning. 
"What they have successfully done is distract people off our issues," Terry McAuliffe, the national Democratic chairman. "It is our job to get us back on message, and I believe that in the last three weeks it will go back to the economy." 
Representative Martin Frost of Texas said: "I'm still very optimistic. I may be running contrary to some other people. There is no way the Republicans can recover from the state of the economy."
But that optimism was in short supply in some Democratic circles. Some party members argued, with frustration, that the campaign had been complicated as much by what the Republicans had done in pushing the Iraq resolution as by the way Democrats had responded.
"Karl Rove has got to be doing somersaults," said Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant who was the spokesman for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000, referring to Mr. Bush's top political adviser. "While I respect everybody's views, the continuing debate on Iraq plays right into Karl Rove's hands."
The discussion in the Democratic Party about Iraq has been vibrant, reflecting ideological fissures between the party's left wing and moderates who, over the years, have argued that moving the party to the center was vital to maintaining its electoral viability. Some moderates said they thought images of prominent members of the party's liberal wing attacking Mr. Bush on the Iraq could be a setback.
"The greatest sin of the left wing of the Democratic Party is that they make it easier for George Bush and the Republicans to win because they present an argument that the bulk of the country doesn't agree with," said Representative Adam Smith of Washington.
Of particularly concern to some Democrats was the visit of a three-member Democratic delegation to Baghdad, where Representative Jim McDermott of Washington suggested that Mr. Bush might be misleading Americans as he made the case against Saddam Hussein.
"He combined the judgment of Neville Chamberlain before World War II and Jane Fonda in Hanoi," Representative Chet Edwards of Texas, who faces a tough re-election battle, said of Mr. McDermott.
Mr. McDermott offered no regrets. "I think people want candidates who say what they think and will stand for it," he said, "and I think the Democratic Party is better off when everybody is doing that."

HEADLINE: The Hudson at Risk 

 BODY:
This time of year most lawns suddenly sprout election placards. But in Columbia County, N.Y., the election placards stand alongside signs that say either "Stop the Plant" or "Support the Plant." The plant is a proposed coal-burning cement manufacturing facility that would be built, if approved, along the Hudson River near the city of Hudson and the town of Greenport. In effect, St. Lawrence Cement, which is owned by the Swiss company Holcim, would create an industrial city on the waterfront, including 40 acres of buildings, a 1,200-acre open-pit limestone mine, a new dock, a two-mile-long conveyor belt and a smokestack that would stand 400 feet high. The plant is inappropriate, and Gov. George Pataki and his environmental conservation commissioner, Erin Crotty, must stop it. 
 Opposition to this plant has been growing steadily among environmentalists and local residents. Their biggest worry is the huge plume that would pour out of the smokestack, a plume containing 20 million pounds of pollution a year, including high concentrations of fine particulate matter and other health hazards. Beyond that, a cement kiln happens to work very well as a hazardous waste incinerator, and St. Lawrence Cement has insisted on obtaining a permit to use the plant as an incinerator. The company says it does not plan to burn waste. But if the chance exists, it may well be seized. 
 Last December, an administrative law judge in the state's Department of Environmental Conservation ruled that further hearings were needed before the department could decide whether St. Lawrence Cement's application could move ahead. The hearings would examine basic issues like the problem of emissions and the potential effect of the plant on fish life, on traffic, on local historical and cultural resources and on the esthetic quality of the region. St. Lawrence Cement appealed to Commissioner Crotty, asking her, essentially, to skip the hearings and jump to the next stage in permitting the plant. 
At the very least, Ms. Crotty should insist that full hearings proceed, as dictated by state law. This plant is wildly out of scale for its setting, and important questions about the potential effect of its emissions and its daily operations have not been answered. Supporters argue that the plant will create jobs, but even St. Lawrence Cement has estimated that when its old Catskill plant closes, the net increase in jobs will be just one. The plant would also have a negative effect on an area that has been revitalized by its scenic, cultural and historic resources. The economic future of the Hudson River depends on them, not on cement.
Ms. Crotty will presumably have to take into account the views of her boss, Mr. Pataki, but there is no obvious reason why the governor would want this plant. Mr. Pataki has painstakingly built a strong environmental record, particularly when it comes to the Hudson, and this plant is fundamentally inconsistent with his hopes for the river. Mr. Pataki and his fellow Northeastern governors have made a point of trying to get coal-burning power plants in the Midwest to cut their emissions. To build a coal-burning cement plant right on the Hudson makes no sense at all.
The governor of Maine, Angus King, has expressed his concerns, as has the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. Mr. Pataki should listen to them and, most of all, to the concerned citizens of the Hudson Valley.

HEADLINE: A Little Off the Bottom Line; 
As Hard Times Linger, Customers Spend Less at the Hair Salon

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
Jessica Guzman is serious about her hair. Every two months, she takes a day off work to get her dark curls lightened by the colorist that she has seen for the last two years. She spends over an hour -- and close to $200 -- at the salon.
 But one recent morning, Ms. Guzman was sitting in the reception area at Vidal Sassoon on Fifth Avenue and 14th Street, waiting to get rid of her hair's highlights. Her hair is important, she said, but so is her pocketbook. 
 "With highlighting, you always have to maintain," Ms. Guzman said. "That's why I'm trying to go back to black. I can save $200 every couple of months."
Faced with a sluggish economy, more New Yorkers are rethinking their spending on their hair. Many are choosing to cut their hair less often. Some are considering the difference between the $105 haircut and the $35 one. Others, like Ms. Guzman, are ridding themselves of high-maintenance services. It has created a pattern around the city: from $12-a-buzz-cut barber shops to $300-a-visit salons, those who take care of hair are seeing less of their clients.
It was with his most loyal customers that Orin Saunders, the manager of Locks N Chops on West 34th Street, noticed something was awry. His salon has a steady clientele for his services styling black hair into Nubian twists and African locks that cost anywhere from $70 to more than $100. When he noticed a slew of cancellations, he began calling his regular customers. They admitted that they were taking care of their hair at home while job-hunting.
It was even harder with customers who used to come in twice a month for a $20 haircut.
"When the economy makes that dip, that client who came every two weeks comes every three weeks," Mr. Saunders said. "The haircut is where you lose it first."
At Vidal Sassoon, some customers are waiting up to nine weeks (instead of the usual six) between haircuts, according to Claudia Weldon, the salon's manager. She and her staff immediately felt the impact of the jobs lost in downtown Manhattan, Ms. Weldon said, because many of their clients worked in the financial district and came for haircuts on their lunch breaks.
Those who do come now are watching their spending, she said, and skipping the "little treats" like deep conditioning treatments.
"Right now I think so many people lost their jobs, so they're very picky," Ms. Weldon said. "If you go back to last year, people were spending their money right and left."
Brandi Grooms, 25, a photography student at the School of Visual Arts, admitted that she had more dreams for her hair than her budget allowed. Wearing a black choker necklace and a series of earrings on both lobes, Ms. Grooms carefully studied the catalogs of short haircuts at the Michael Giovan Salon on Third Avenue and 18th Street. Cuts here start at $30. 
Ms. Grooms said she hadn't cut her hair since February. She wanted to wait until moving to New York from Little Rock, Ark. So for a week, she had been making the rounds at city salons. One gave her a quote of $95 for a haircut.
"I wasn't ready to spend that kind of money," Ms. Grooms said. "I don't have a job yet." She has also decided that she cannot afford the highlights she wanted for her light brown hair.
Paying for a haircut, unlike other personal care like manicures, is not discretionary spending because a haircut is a necessity, according to Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist and publisher of The New York Stat, a newsletter on the local economy. For this reason, the industry suffers from a "substitution effect" -- if times are tough, consumers substitute a less expensive option until the economy picks up again.
Downtown, at Astor Place Hairstylists, where a buzz cut costs $12, business has been steady. But haircutters and clients alike point out that the neighborhood is not hopping the way it once was. The Wiz electronics store around the corner is going out of business, and the shoe stores on Eighth Street have lost customers.
One barber thinks the economy and the general mood of the city are tied to his personal paycheck. "People get more haircuts when they're happy," said Joseph Kleynberg, who works at Astor Place. "When people make money, they want to look good."
But even when people have less spending money, hair does not lose its importance, according to Nancy Etcoff, author of "Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty," and a faculty member at Harvard University's medical school.
"Hair is the Swiss army knife of beauty tools," she said. "It conveys so much. It conveys health. It conveys sex appeal. But it also conveys taste. It's one of the ways we reinvent ourselves."
Yet reinvention has a price tag, especially at a luxury salon. At the John Barrett Salon on Fifth Avenue and 58th Street, where cuts start at $100 and cost $350 with the master himself, customers have been cutting back on their appointments in the past year. But these high-end customers have been spending more with each visit, according to Deborah Hardwick, the salon's co-owner. A customer treating herself to a morning with a stylist or colorist might add, for example, a manicure and a pedicure.
The salon has also experienced a decline in visits by its international and national clientele, whether because of a slower economy or a reluctance to travel by airplane. Even some customers who live in Texas and consider Mr. Barrett's New York City salon their salon are coming three times a year instead of the regular six.
In Gramercy Park, Antoni Marra, a barber with his own one-man shop, has lost customers, too. "Some of my customers moved out," he said. "They don't want to live in Manhattan. They have houses in Florida." 
Those who rent houses in Italy are another story. According to Olga Plitt, manager at another Vidal Sassoon salon, on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, she saw more of her clients this summer. Those who once rented homes in Europe spent this summer nearby. "A lot of people are staying local," she said.
Ms. Denham of the newsletter said she watches nail salons as one quirky but important economic indicator, because she says thinks they constitute completely discretionary spending. In this economic downturn, she said, nail salons are not suffering as badly as they did in the downturn of the early 1990's -- perhaps, she said, because this time, many of the jobless are high-earning, white-collar workers who can still afford an $8 nail job. 
Ms. Weldon, the Vidal Sassoon salon manager, is optimistic that things will pick up. "I've had two or three people call," she said. "They said, 'I got a job, so I can come back now.' "

HEADLINE: Judging McCall By the Numbers: Scrutinizing A Pension Fund 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The charge is one of the nastiest anyone can make against a political candidate in upstate New York: he blew a chance to create jobs.
 That is what Gov. George E. Pataki is saying about H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate for governor. Without explicitly conceding that upstate has been ailing economically, Mr. Pataki has been pounding Mr. McCall for failing to invest much of New York State's enormous pension fund there. 
 Mr. McCall's campaign has responded by invoking the vagaries of venture capital, the demands of due diligence, the fetters of fiduciary responsibility. 
But what it really boils down to, Mr. McCall's supporters say, is that creating jobs in upstate New York, however necessary, was not Mr. McCall's responsibility. It was Mr. Pataki's.
"The governor's job is to do economic development," said Steven Greenberg, the spokesman for the McCall campaign. "The comptroller's job is to manage the pension fund."
Mr. McCall would like to be judged mainly on his stewardship of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which supports hundreds of thousands of retired state and local government workers and must support hundreds of thousands of them in the future.
The fundamental question about Mr. McCall's record is whether the fund -- at $105 billion, the second largest in the country -- has been managed well and invested wisely. Mr. McCall, of course, says it has been.
But so do other people who know and who care: union leaders, retirees, government officials, taxpayers and an array of pension experts. Mr. McCall "has endeared himself to our members based on the way he's run the pension fund," said Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents many of the state and local government workers covered by the pension fund. The union endorsed Mr. McCall in July.
The Business Council of New York State is also satisfied with the way the fund has been managed, said David F. Shaffer, president of the Public Policy Institute, the research arm of the business group.
And in the pension fund world, New York has a strong reputation. "McCall has been fairly responsible on the investment side -- he gets good investment advice," said Michael J. Clowes, editorial director of Pensions & Investments, the leading publication on pension investing.
Moody's Investors Service recently noted that the fund uses conservative accounting, has had strong results despite the sagging stock market, and "enjoys a solidly funded status" -- pension speak for having enough money to pay retirees' benefits.
Of course, the outlook will worsen if the stock market continues its precipitous decline, which has already wiped out several years of gains. In addition, state and local governments may have to make a substantial increase in their contributions to make up for the investment losses, at a time when their tax revenues have been tumbling.
New York's fund, unlike those in other places, is run solely by the state comptroller rather than by a committee. "The buck stops here," Mr. McCall said recently. "I'm responsible."
Mr. McCall is no investment guru, a la Warren Buffett. He is advised by a group of investment-world luminaries, as well as by a professional staff that makes recommendations (which he usually accepts). The fund also hires consultants and outside managers for some of its holdings.
Mr. McCall, a former state senator who was appointed comptroller in 1993 and has been elected twice, says he is proud of his successful efforts, including two lawsuits, to keep the cash-starved state government from raiding the pension fund.
But he cites as his most important contribution "the overall performance of the fund."
Over a 10-year period ending June 30, the fund's investments gained an average of 9.9 percent, well above the returns of most other large pension funds, according to data from Wilshire Associates, a California firm that tracks institutional investments. The median return for big funds was 9.3 percent, and the difference translates into millions of dollars a year.
Despite two years of steep stock market losses, New York's fund has continued to do better than most of its competitors. In the 12 months through June, New York's fund lost 5.6 percent, but its biggest rival, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, lost almost 5.9. New York City's funds, by contrast, lost 8.3 percent, while the Wilshire median loss was 5.8 percent.
Almost three quarters of the New York fund's stocks simply mimic the composition of stock market indexes like the S & P 500 in a program run by the fund's staff.
For a big fund like New York's, indexed investments are necessary, even though they don't fare that well when markets are down. "You put the money there to buy broad diversification, cheaply," said Catherine A. Higgins, a senior consultant at Frank Russell Company. "You didn't expect them ever to be the top performers."
Indexing has caused some problems for the fund, because as long as a stock stays in an index, it stays in the fund no matter how far the price falls.
So while one of the fund's outside investment managers, Alliance Capital, sold Enron last summer for $41 a share, Mr. McCall said, the stock remained in the indexed portion, causing a $58 million loss. (To put that in perspective, if you had a similar loss in your $10,000 401(k), you would be down by about $5.)
The outside money managers have generated their own share of controversy, in part because they tend to make generous contributions to Mr. McCall's campaigns. Mr. McCall insists the contributions have no influence on his choice of managers, most of whom are well known in the pension-management business.
Under Mr. McCall, the fund has diversified into real estate, increased its holdings of foreign stocks, and started to invest in private companies. And as its gains in the stock market ballooned in the 1990's, it took money out of the stock market so that American stocks never accounted for more than half of the investments.
While that dampened the fund's results during the market boom, it protected New York from the losses experienced by some more aggressive pension funds. "It was a strategic decision that paid off," Mr. McCall said.
Not all of the fund's choices have worked out well in the last fiscal year. A bet on foreign stocks was largely a loser, with some investments in big countries down almost 10 percent. Foreign investments make up almost 15 percent of the fund's portfolio.
It was a bad year for investing in private companies, which make up about 6 percent of the fund's investments. Nationally and in New York, venture capital investing has dried up as the stock market plunged and the outlook for high-tech companies dimmed. The fund's private equity investments lost almost 12 percent of their value in the 12 months ending in March. 
Those are the very kinds of investments for which Governor Pataki has criticized Mr. McCall, saying he has put a smaller percentage of the pension fund's direct (non-stock market) investments in state businesses than his predecessor, Edward Regan, did. Mr. McCall's camp says the overall dollar value of New York investments, including stocks, has grown to $24 billion from $14 billion since the comptroller took office. 
Mr. McCall said he, too, is disappointed by the slow pace of the state's $250 million Venture Capital Investment Program, which the Legislature authorized in 1999. He has hired four investment managers and promised them $115 million, but only $14 million has actually been invested in companies, and half has gone to firms outside of New York.
Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the comptroller's office, said it had put out a request for proposals from investment managers five days after Governor Pataki signed the bill creating the program. "We heard from numerous interests who were very willing to invest our money, but who were not qualified to do so or who had insufficient track record to meet our risk tolerance or who were unable to raise capital to match our money," he said.
By late 2000, when the fund picked some outside investment firms, the venture capital boom was ending.
Experts note that investing in private companies is always a slower process than investing in public companies, because it is virtually impossible to extract yourself from a bad deal. Michael P. McQueeney of Summer Street Capital in Buffalo, one of the firms hired by Mr. McCall, said "We look at 100 deals for each one that we do."
Mr. McCall allows that the money managers he hired "have been slow, and I have been disappointed."
"But the bottom line is, you don't throw money away," he said.
Despite the problems with private investments and the poor performance of the stock market, the fund's overall performance in recent years has been strong enough that Mr. McCall could push to increase the benefits. Public employees with 10 years on the job no longer have to contribute 3 percent of their salaries to the fund, and retirees now get an annual cost-of-living raise in their pensions because of legislation that Mr. McCall backed.
Not everyone thinks the automatic annual raise, called a COLA, is a good idea, because it means that even in bad investment years, the fund will have to dispense more money to retirees. "It seems to me that the COLA could do far more long-term damage to the fund than the stock market has done," said Mr. Clowes of Pensions & Investments. 
Retirees disagree, said Kevin F. Murray, executive director of the Retired Public Employees Association in Albany. He argues that the annual adjustment, which is set at half the inflation rate, is easier for the pension fund to plan for than the occasional erratic raises granted by the Legislature.
The huge investment increases, which pushed the fund's assets to as high as $127 billion in fiscal 2000 up from $56 billion in fiscal 1993, also made it unnecessary for the state and local governments to contribute much to have their employees covered by the plan.
The contribution rate, which in the early 1980's was more than 15 percent of most employees' salaries (and close to 30 percent for police and firefighters), was zero for several years and has recently gone up to about 0.5 percent. And it may well increase; the pension fund assumes that its investment will gain 8 percent annually, a rate it has not achieved in two years.
"The poor performance of the fund is going to cost taxpayers real money across the state," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Pataki campaign. Mr. McCall, he said, "needs to be held accountable for that failure." 
Mr. McCall said he knew that some local government officials were worried that they would have to boost contributions.
"I say, let's keep it in perspective," he said. "You used to have to pay between 7 and 8 percent, and for four years you've been paying almost nothing. That's not bad."

Asia Gains in Chip Market

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
The America's share of the $131 billion worldwide semiconductor market has continued to plummet this year, dropping to only 22 percent of worldwide revenue in the second quarter of 2002, as communications and other high-technolgy companies cut costs by sending more of their chip making offshore. (The data, compiled by the market research firm InStat/MDR, groups North, Central and South America; the United States' chip output represents the vast majority of the region's total.) 
 In 1998 and 1999, at the height of the Internet boom, the Americas' share reached an all-time high of 33 percent, primarily as expanding technology businesses in the United States made their chips locally to react more quickly to the changing market, said Steve Cullen, an Instat/MDR market analyst. 
 During that period, the Asia Pacific region had less than a quarter of the market. But in April 2001, the Asia Pacific region passed the Americas and has remained ahead since. That trend has been fueled by the low labor costs in China, along with China's recent membership in the World Trade Organization. LAURIE J. FLYNN

HEADLINE: New Jersey Redraws Party Lines 

BYLINE:  By John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira; John B. Judis, a senior editor at The New Republic, and Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, are the authors of "The Emerging Democratic Majority."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Robert G. Torricelli's withdrawal from the New Jersey race last week could mean defeat for the state's Democrats. Not only did they lose the advantage of incumbency, but the legal and political battles over his replacement could linger through the remainder of the campaign.
 Yet unless the United States Supreme Court reverses the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision allowing the Democratic Party to replace Mr. Torricelli on the ballot with former Senator Frank Lautenberg, the Democrats stand a good chance of winning the election. That's because New Jersey, which voted for Republican presidential candidates from 1968 through 1988, is part of a nationwide swing -- particularly strong in the Northeast, Far West and parts of the Midwest -- toward the Democratic Party. 
 The first and most obvious reason for this trend is that the parties have changed. The New Jersey Republican Party used to be dominated by New Deal liberals, but since the late 70's conservatives have played a growing role. Republicans would nominate some moderates like former governors Thomas H. Kean and Christie Whitman, but they would also regularly back conservative candidates like gubernatorial nominees Jim Courter and Bret D. Schundler, whom Democrats easily defeated. Meanwhile, after voters denied re-election to Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, in 1993, largely because of his tax increases, New Jersey Democrats have moved to the political center. Gov. James E. McGreevey was the chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council in New Jersey and is fiscally cautious.
But the state's electorate has also changed dramatically. New Jersey used to be known for its heavy industry and its midsized immigrant cities, but it has become the nation's pre-eminent suburban, postindustrial state. It's a leader in financial and commercial services; it still makes goods, but many of them, like pharmaceuticals, are the products of extensive research and design. Professionals make up almost a quarter of New Jersey's work force, compared to 15 percent nationally.
In the 1950's, professionals voted Republican. But since the 1960's they have come to care more about clean air and water, women's rights, gun control and campaign finance reform. Many professionals, like doctors, worry that the quality of their work is being undermined by market forces. They don't like budget deficits and are leery of big spending programs, but they are concerned about inequality and injustice. And they increasingly vote Democratic.
Take upscale Bergen County, next to New York City, which is a bastion of professionals and which used to vote solidly Republican. In the 1988 presidential election, George Bush defeated Michael Dukakis by a margin of 58 percent to 41 percent there. Four years later, Mr. Bush's margin of victory over Bill Clinton was a mere 2 percent. In 1996, Mr. Clinton defeated former Senator Bob Dole 53 percent to 39 percent, and in 2000 former Vice President Al Gore defeated George W. Bush 55 percent to 42 percent. Within the county and across the state, Mr. Gore actually did best among more affluent and educated voters.
Democrats in New Jersey, as elsewhere, could also count on votes from women and from minorities. As the Republican Party became socially conservative in the 1980's, women, who once voted disproportionately for Republicans, began voting disproportionately for Democrats. In 2000, Mr. Bush won only 35 percent of the women's vote, compared to 62 percent for Mr. Gore. Democrats also gained the support of New Jersey's minorities, who went to 33 percent of the population in 2000 from 26 percent in 1990. In the 2000 presidential election Mr. Gore won 88 percent of the black votes and 58 percent of the Hispanic vote.
Democrats also benefited from the return of many white working-class voters -- the "Reagan Democrats" -- who had abandoned the party in the 1980's over civil rights, crime and welfare. After the 1991 recession, which took the bloom off Republican economic policies, and after the Democrats' turn to the center on crime and welfare, many of these voters began supporting Democrats. In Gloucester County, just outside of Philadelphia, where chemical plants still provide many blue-collar jobs, Ronald Reagan won 62 percent of the vote in 1984; George Bush won 59 percent of the vote four years later. By 2000, however, Mr. Gore won 57 percent of the vote while George W. Bush won just 39 percent.
These groups, particularly the professionals, women and minorities who live in the new postindustrial metropolitan areas, are changing American politics. California and Illinois, like New Jersey, also voted for Republican presidential candidates from 1968 through 1988. Like New Jersey, both states are now strongly Democratic.
Republicans can still win elections in these states. But to do so, they must either run as centrists, as did Mr. Kean and Ms. Whitman, or hope for a tarnished Democratic opponent like Mr. Torricelli. In the absence of these conditions, the Democrats are more likely to win -- in New Jersey next month and, increasingly, across the nation in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: Debate to Intensify on Copyright Extension Law 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments this week over the constitutionality of a 1998 law that extended copyright protection by 20 years. Experts on both sides of the closely watched case say that its outcome could reshape the way cultural products are consumed and how their profits are divided.
 The court's decision will determine whether a host of material -- including early Mickey Mouse movies, Cole Porter songs and Robert Frost poems -- will become available for free to the public or remain in the control of their copyright holders. 
 Since the court agreed to hear the case in February, it has become a touchstone in an increasingly acrimonious debate over how to balance the rights of consumers with those of big media companies at a time when digital technology is threatening both.
Under the 1998 law, material whose copyright formerly would have lapsed 50 years after its creator's death became protected for an additional 20 years. Copyrights held by corporations, meanwhile, were extended to 95 years, from 75 previously. 
Over the long term, supporters of the law say, it will promote creative work by offering a bigger economic payoff to those who invest in it.
The 1998 law also aligns the United States' copyright terms with those of European countries.
But detractors say the statute inhibits creativity by making it harder and more expensive for other people to obtain and build upon existing works. The 1998 law, these critics argue, mainly benefits powerful corporate copyright holders like the Walt Disney Company, whose intensive lobbying helped pass the legislation. 
The law's challengers say that it disregards the public's side of the balance that the Constitution sought to strike when it authorized Congress to issue copyrights "for limited times" to "promoted the progress of science and useful arts." The initial Copyright Act, in 1790, set a maximum term of only 28 years. 
Opponents of the 1998 law say that by issuing a series of 11 extensions over the last 40 years -- the latest being by far the longest -- Congress has exceeded its powers by, in effect, giving copyright holders a permanent monopoly over the use of their material. 
Lawrence Lessig, the Stanford law professor who has spearheaded the case since its inception almost four years ago, says that the rise of the Internet makes the copyright issue all the more urgent, because works that fall into the public domain would for the first time be easily accessible via the Internet for millions of people to enjoy and to incorporate into new digital works of their own.
"Imagine you want to do something with the New Deal, and you get images and songs and stories and put it together on the Internet for everyone to see," Mr. Lessig said last week in a telephone interview from a Washington hotel room, where he was preparing for this Wednesday's oral argument. "Just at a point where technology is making all of this available, the law ought not to get in the way for no good reason."
Mr. Lessig said that he planned to argue that throughout the last century, copyrights primarily governed only commercial entities -- companies with the printing presses, movie studios or broadcast stations capable of widely distributing information and entertainment. But now, Mr. Lessig said, copyright law touches everyone who has an Internet connection, which makes it more important than ever to adhere to the limits the Constitution intended to place on the duration of copyrights. 
The government, to be represented on Wednesday by Theodore B. Olson, the solicitor general, is expected to argue that no one, including the Supreme Court, can impose an arbitrary definition of "limited times." In its filings on the case, the government has argued that the Constitution leaves such definitions up to Congress.
But the law's opponents argue that any law limiting speech must satisfy a compelling state interest in the least restrictive way possible. The copyright term extension, they say, should be tested under the First Amendment to see whether it is overly restrictive of the free-speech rights of would-be users of copyrighted material that previously would have been in the public domain. 
Courts have traditionally rejected that position. It is also rebutted in the government's filings and in a brief by Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer. Mr. Abrams argues that free speech is protected under the extension because of the fair-use provisions built into copyright law, which enable scholars, critics and other individuals to make some use of copyrighted material in their own work. What is more, he argues, the copyright law protects only the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. 
Jack Valenti, the chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, said that, in practice, a longer copyright term would serve the Constitution's goal of harnessing copyright for the public good. Private ownership is the necessary incentive to make material widely available, he said. 
"Who is going to digitize these public domain movies?" Mr. Valenti said. "To digitize a movie costs a huge amount of money. Who would spend the money if they didn't own it? If you didn't own your house would you spend a lot of money to bring it up to snuff?"
The entertainment industry is particularly sensitive to copyright issues these days. File-swapping services like KaZaA are enabling Internet users to easily exchange free digital copies of copyrighted music. And the impending transition to digital television raises copyright concerns about viewers' ability to trade high-quality digital copies of movies and television shows over the Internet. 
The case has attracted 38 friend-of-the-court briefs from prominent intellectuals, artists, elected officials and advocates in numerous fields -- who in some instances seem to defy traditional political lines. Fifteen economists from across the political spectrum, including the Nobel laureates Milton Friedman and Kenneth Arrow, for instance, wrote a brief in support of the challenge, arguing that it is "highly unlikely that the economic benefits from copyright extension" outweigh the additional costs.
The conservative advocate Phyllis Schlafly, who is the founder of the Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund, also submitted a brief in support of overturning the law, as did the Intel Corporation, besides more predictable partisans like the Free Software Foundation and several library associations. 
Mr. Lessig filed the suit on behalf of Eric Eldred, a New Hampshire computer administrator who had published dozens of public-domain books online as a hobby until the copyright extension act prevented him from posting a selection of Robert Frost poems in 1998.
In an elaborate demonstration of what it means to have a public domain, Brewster Kahle, the founder of the nonprofit Internet Archive in San Francisco, is driving across the country in a van that has an Internet-linked satellite antenna on top and a laser printer inside. 
Last week Mr. Kahle made several stops at schools and libraries, as well as a bookmobile conference, to distribute "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," "Heart of Darkness" and other books in the public domain that have been scanned and are available free online. He plans to park outside the Supreme Court and do the same on Wednesday.
Lined up on the government's side are Mr. Abrams; Dr. Seuss Enterprises; Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican; several members of the House Judiciary Committee, and virtually all of the major copyright holder trade associations. 
It will fall to Mr. Lessig, who is a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and who has become a kind of rock star for the digital liberties set, to convince the justices to accept the unconventional analysis.
If they do, the decision could be a turning point in redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers -- and the technology companies that are often in the middle. 
Among the points Mr. Lessig likes to make is that extending copyright terms for works of great artists who are deceased, like George Gershwin, cannot promote the creation of new works because the original artists themselves can no longer create.
Only about 2 percent of works protected by copyright produce continuing revenue for their owners, Mr. Lessig says. But no one can use the rest without hunting down the owners and negotiating licenses. 
Disney faced no such restrictions, he says, when the company drew on Victor Hugo's work to produce the animated film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" or the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to make "Cinderella" and "Snow White."

HEADLINE: Brazil's Markets Wait To Exhale After Vote 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
With the outcome of Brazil's election leaning toward a second round between the left-wing front runner, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and the governing coalition's candidate, Jose Serra, markets were expected to call a truce on Monday and give the country's embattled currency and bonds a chance to recover.
 Depending on the final result, investors will be waiting to see whether Mr. da Silva, a former metalworker known as Lula, will move swiftly to assuage market nerves by naming a credible economic team, or trying to determine what chances he will have against Mr. Serra, an accomplished technocrat and the markets' favorite, in a runoff election in three weeks. 
 "It's a cliffhanger result, but assuming there's a second round, I think we might see some good news in the market," said Doug Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "On the other hand, if Lula ends up winning in the first round, people will resign themselves to thinking he won't be as bad as they thought." 
"There is some good will in the market for him," he added. "For the sake of Brazil, everybody wants things to work out." 
Nervousness about just how radical Mr. da Silva's economic policies would be has severely punished currency, stock and bond markets in recent months. The real has slumped to nearly four to the dollar, worth less than the peso of Brazil's bankrupt neighbor, Argentina, while the benchmark C-bond has plumbed depths of less than half its face value, levels normally reserved for a country about to default. 
Mr. Smith said that a second round would rally markets because it would allow Mr. Serra, a former health minister, an accomplished technocrat and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's handpicked successor, to focus more on economic issues, widely seen as Mr. da Silva's principal weakness. But lacking charisma, Mr. Serra has failed to capture the hearts of many of Brazil's 115 million voters. 
Analysts said that, after months of writhing over the uncertainty of Sunday's outcome, most of the markets' worst fears had already been discounted in prices. "I think the panic will calm down as the uncertainty recedes," said Walter Molano, chief Latin American economist at BCP Securities. "You might even get a rally Monday." 
In recent weeks, Mr. Molano has been one of the most vocal advocates of dumping Brazilian paper, predicting that the country was on the slippery slope toward defaulting on its debt. 
Allan Conway, head of global emerging markets at WestAm, an asset management company in London, said, "Brazil has been ridiculously oversold and should never have gotten down to these levels." 
Should Mr. da Silva triumph, though, he will have to move swiftly to name an economic team capable of winning over the markets and of persuading banks to keep open vital credit lines to Brazil and its exporters. 
Those credit lines have been drying up just as Brazil needs all the hard currency it can get to bolster its accounts. 
The names of top-level managers like Henri Philippe Reichstul, former chief of the state oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro, and Henrique Meirelles, former chief of global banking at FleetBoston, are making the rounds on Wall Street as possible candidates for Mr. da Silva's team. 
But party stalwarts like Aloisio Mercadante and Guido Mantega, economic aides who have dragged Mr. da Silva's Workers' Party toward the center in recent years, are also in the running. 
Mr. da Silva worried analysts with his recent rejection of extending the term of Arminio Fraga as central bank president and his veiled threats of intervention in state companies. 
"The old-style Workers' Party is coming out of the woodwork," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist at WestLB in New York. 
He predicted that Mr. da Silva would be "horribly emboldened" by a first-round win and could raise the national minimum wage or loosen the grip on inflation, which could further destabilize Brazil's already precarious finances. 
But even supporters of Mr. Serra predicted that Mr. da Silva would not adopt radical policies, partly because his party is unlikely to win a majority in Congress and will have to make deals with pro-market parties. 
"There's absolutely no feeling of panic -- everything's normal," said Marcelo Lima, partner in the Sao Paulo advertising agency EugenioWG and a former investment banker, who was voting today. "Just four years ago, with Lula so far ahead, things would have been different."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC SAYS BUSH NEEDS TO PAY HEED TO WEAK ECONOMY 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
A majority of Americans say that the nation's economy is in its worst shape in nearly a decade and that President Bush and Congressional leaders are spending too much time talking about Iraq while neglecting problems at home, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The poll found signs of economic distress that cut across party and geographic lines. Nearly half of all Americans are worried that they or someone in their household will be out of a job within a year. 
 The number of Americans who said they believe the economy is worse than it was just two years ago has increased markedly since the summer. The number of Americans who approved of the way Mr. Bush has handled the economy -- 41 percent -- was the lowest it has been in his presidency. Many people said they worried that a war in Iraq -- which most Americans view as inevitable -- would disrupt an already unsettled economy. 
The poll found that despite the emphasis by Mr. Bush since Labor Day on the need to move against Saddam Hussein, support for such a policy has not changed appreciably since the summer. While most Americans said they backed Mr. Bush's campaign against Iraq, the sentiment was expressed with reservations and signs of apprehension about its potential repercussions.
Americans said they feared a long and costly war that could spread across the Middle East and encourage more terrorist attacks in the United States. They said they did not want the United States to act without support from allies and did not want the United States to act before United Nations weapons inspectors had an opportunity to enter Iraq. 
As Congress prepares to resume debate on a resolution supporting the use of force in Iraq, Americans said they thought members of both parties were trying to manipulate the issue for their political advantage.
"Bush is spending way too much time focusing on Iraq instead of the economy, and he's doing it as a political move," said Gladys Steele, 42, a homemaker from Seattle who is a political independent, in a follow-up interview yesterday. "He thinks keeping us fearful about going to war will distract us from how bad the economy is."
The poll was conducted a month before what Democrats and Republicans view as an extraordinarily competitive round of midterm Congressional elections. 
In recent days many Democrats have grown glum about the upcoming election, arguing that Mr. Bush and the White House have successfully drowned out domestic issues that the Democrats had hoped to capitalize on with his talk of war. Many Democrats had even feared that the debate over war had undermined their chances of winning the House and holding on to their one-seat margin in the Senate.
Mr. Bush is to deliver a national address on the subject tonight.
But the Times/CBS News poll suggests that no matter what is happening in Washington, voters are more concerned with the economy and domestic issues than with what is happening with Saddam Hussein, presenting the Democrats a glimmer of hope as Congress prepares to vote on the Iraq resolution and adjourn to campaign. 
Whether any of this makes a difference in an election that will most likely be decided in a handful of Senate and House races is an entirely different matter. A nationwide poll, while revealing of broad sentiments in the American electorate, cannot be used to predict results accurately in the relatively small number of Congressional races that are considered competitive. 
This poll, conducted by telephone Thursday through Saturday, was taken of 668 adults nationwide. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
By every indication, the subject of Iraq should dominate the news out of Washington for at least the next week. There is Mr. Bush's speech tonight, and then the debate in Congress is expected to last at least through Friday. 
In addition, in a handful of competitive races, Republican candidates are seeking to use the issue of acting against Iraq as a way to undercut Democratic opponents.
Two-thirds of Americans say they approve of the United States using military power to oust Mr. Hussein. A majority of Americans say that Mr. Bush has a clear plan to deal with Iraq; by contrast, a majority say the White House does not have a clear plan to deal with terrorism at home.
But there are signs of ambivalence.
With Mr. Bush pushing for quick action against Baghdad, nearly two-thirds of respondents said they wanted to give the United Nations more time to try to send weapons inspectors into Iraq. 
Similarly, most Americans said Mr. Bush should not act until he wins approval from Congress -- and they applauded Congress's pushing the administration for details on its Iraqi plans.
There were also clear suggestions that some Americans suspected that Mr. Bush's intentions went beyond simply disarming Iraq. More than half said that Mr. Bush was more interested in removing Mr. Hussein than in removing potentially lethal weapons.
Fully 7 in 10 respondents said they expected that war with Iraq was inevitable. More than half said they believed that Iraq poses a greater threat to the United States today than it did two years ago.
On a number of measures, the poll suggested that politicians in Washington were out of step with the concern of Americans. Again and again, in questions and in follow-up interviews, respondents talked more about the economy than Baghdad and expressed concern that leaders in Washington were not paying enough attention to the issues that mattered to them.
"There is no balance right now between finding solutions to our domestic problems and our foreign affairs," said Michael Chen, 30, an independent who works as a sales manager in Beaverton, Ore. "No one is talking about how to solve the economic downfall." 
Geoff Crooks, 44, an independent who lives in Lincoln, Neb., said: "We are paying way too much attention to Iraq."
"Meanwhile, the stock market has fallen 25 percent and tons of people are unemployed -- including myself," said Mr. Crooks, who had worked as a travel consultant.
Democrats have hoped that concern about the economy would allow them to turn this election into a referendum on Republican fiscal policies, in a way that would sweep out of office a large number of Republicans -- what politicians refer to as a nationalization of the election. So far, there is no evidence that that has begun. 
But the concern about the economy would seem to be a matter of concern for Mr. Bush, who is two years away from his own re-election campaign. More than two-thirds said the president should be paying more attention to the economy than he is.
"I hate to say this because I'm a Republican, but the economy was better when Clinton was in office,' said Donna Doolittle, 42, a benefits coordinator who works at a hospital in Holiday, Fla. "Maybe interest rates are low now, but health insurance is going up; there are layoffs."
Mrs. Doolittle said she thought that Mr. Bush was trying to make the country "feel safe after what happened" but added, "We need to feel safe about the economy, too."
There were other findings that could prove important over the final weeks of the campaign. Over the summer, Democrats had hoped that the turmoil on Wall Street and reports of corporate malfeasance would give them an issue to use against Republicans. The poll found that nearly half the respondents thought that Mr. Bush was more interested in protecting corporations than in protecting ordinary Americans.
There was unhappiness as well among Americans about Congress. Nearly half of the respondents said they disapproved of the way Congress was doing its job, and 70 percent said they thought it was time to throw out some incumbents and bring in some new members. In 1994, when Republicans, lead by Newt Gingrich, swept Democrats out of control of the House, that figure was 84 percent.
But at the same time, in a not-unusual bit of discordance often found by poll takers measuring the view of Congress, more than half of registered voters said they would vote to re-elect their own local representative.
Not unusually, among all respondents, Republicans were seen as stronger on the military and in dealing with terror -- the issues that have largely dominated the news out of Washington over the past month. Democrats are seen as the stronger party in dealing with domestic issues; in particular, Social Security and prescription drugs. Those are the issues that party leaders said they were planning to try once more to emphasize once Congress leaves Washington and the campaigns move into their final days.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Saturday with 668 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: A Spirited Race for Congress Brings Politics to the Arizona Desert 

BYLINE:  By Andres Martinez 

DATELINE: SEDONA, Ariz. 

 BODY:
The other night George Cordova came to the public library here pursuing votes in one of the more improbable battlegrounds in the fight for control of Congress. Sedona's serene and otherworldly red-rock buttes in the high Sonoran Desert have long lured visitors, retirees and New Age spiritualists seeking to get away from it all. This year they are luring the politicians.
 The First Congressional District is one of two new House seats in Arizona. Covering 60,000 square miles, it is the largest Congressional district in the nation that is not a whole state. It also has one of only 35 or so competitive House races nationwide. That's why President Bush and Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, have stopped by recently. 
 Arizona is fertile ground in the Democrats' long-shot quest for a net gain of seven seats, which they need to wrest control of the House. The other new district, to the southwest, is heavily Hispanic and Democratic, a sure thing. If Mr. Cordova wins, Democrats will have cut the Republicans' edge in the Arizona House delegation from 5-to-1 to 5-to-3. The fact that the three Democrats with the best chances of winning are Hispanic speaks volumes about the threat demographics could someday pose to Arizona's Republican hegemony. 
The First Congressional District is the West writ large -- encompassing the Grand Canyon, numerous mining communities, the Navajo and other Indian nations and towns like Flagstaff, Prescott and Casa Grande. There are sizable Mormon, Native American and Hispanic populations. Washington may seem like a long way off, but in truth the federal government here looms far larger than it does almost anywhere else. For starters, it owns much of the land. When Mr. Cordova, a 36-year-old businessman, addresses federal policy regarding water disputes, mining rights and forest fires, he is talking about pressing local issues. 
Unlike many contests these days, this one offers strong contrasts, with Mr. Cordova wanting government to do more and his Republican opponent, Rick Renzi, 44, wanting it to do less. Mr. Cordova supports abortion rights and is sympathetic to environmentalists' concerns. Mr. Renzi opposes abortion rights and scoffs at his opponent's "anti-ranch" environmental views. Mr. Cordova thinks widespread economic anxiety should help the Democratic Party, here and nationally. Mr. Renzi disagrees, arguing that district residents are more concerned about environmental obstacles to economic development and bureaucratic mandates imposed on small businesses than about falling stock prices. Mr. Renzi thinks he is a better fit for a district where he claims 72 percent of the residents go to church and have conservative views on issues of "life, morality and family values."
Mr. Renzi also emphasizes that he has 12 children -- all of whose names begin with "R" -- while his opponent has none and is single. As for the growing Hispanic vote, this need not be a threat to Republicans, in his view, as long as Hispanics "stay true to their Catholic heritage." 
In his talk at the Sedona library, Mr. Cordova focuses on health care. Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, he says, should be Congress's top priority. "Something is wrong when we must run shuttles to Nogales so that the greatest generation can afford their medications," he says, referring to the Mexican border town. 
Parochial issues might ordinarily determine this election's outcome, but this is no ordinary year. The country is still suffering the aftershocks of 9/ll, and of the stock market's meltdown. There is also the talk of war. "The economy and Iraq are such overpowering issues right now that they crowd out the usual local concerns," says Zach Smith, a political scientist at Northern Arizona University. "In coffee shops in places like Prescott and Winslow, people are talking about the same two topics people are talking about in New York and Washington."
On the war issue, Mr. Renzi's more obvious hawkishness could help in a state that, one Sedona Democrat, Jackie Young, concedes with a sigh, is "pro-gun" and "pro-war." Mr. Renzi calls his opponent "undecided and soft." However, these charges have been blunted to some extent by the support Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has given to President Bush.
Mr. Cordova doesn't mention Iraq during his presentation. But when the issue is raised during a question-and-answer period, he insists there is no "sunlight between me and our commander in chief," though when he elaborates, some rays do come through.
With neither candidate well known in a district so vast it takes eight hours to drive across it, the Democrats' slight numerical advantage is offset by the Republicans' vast material superiority. Mr. Renzi is expected to spend at least twice as much as Mr. Cordova, and Mr. Cordova's strongest potential supporters are the least likely to turn out at the polls. 
In the end, however, the way the two great issues of the day unfold in coming weeks could determine the outcome of not just this race but others across the country. Consider two different Nov. 5 scenarios. In one, Washington presents a unified front on Iraq while new revelations of corporate malfeasance and economic weakness trigger new rounds of selling on Wall Street. In the other, renewed partisan bickering on Iraq breaks out while signs emerge of a stronger economic rebound. 
It is hard to imagine that the outcome of the race in Arizona's First Congressional District would be the same under both scenarios.

HEADLINE: October Heroics in Anaheim? In the Bronx, It's Blasphemy 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Somewhere heroes fought on. Somewhere dreams were still alive. But in the Bronx, it was all over yesterday. The Yankees, whose season ended abruptly in an obscure town in California Saturday night, came home on the red-eye, their mystique in tatters, their fans a shattered army.
 It was hard to believe. The Bombers had seemed to carry the city all summer, through economic woes and the grim recollections of a heartbreaking year. They seemed to embody New York's superiority, its pugnacious grit, its soaring hopes and towering ambitions. Once again October would be glorious and Yankee Stadium a magical place where time never changes and people never have to grow up. 
 But yesterday, along the Grand Concourse and in the bars and delis where the Yankees are celebrated almost every autumn, there was a sudden realization that the season of hope had passed. There would be no brass bands, no parade up the Canyon of Heroes. Monday would be an ordinary workday in an ordinary town.
Outside the silent stadium at 161st Street and River Avenue, Freddy Schuman, 77, who is known as Freddy the Frying Pan Man and is a fixture at games where he bangs his pan to support the team, held up a placard proclaiming: "Freddy Sez: 'I feel depressed, destroyed, dismayed. I'm heartbroken.' "
He looked it too. "I'm so depressed, I had to get out of the house," he moaned. "I tried watching TV and playing computer games, but it didn't help. I even took a bus ride and met other people who are miserable like me. What are we gonna do? Now that I've talked about it with other people, I don't feel so alone."
A day after the Yankees became the first big league team to be knocked out of postseason play in a humiliating 9-5 loss to the Anaheim Angels, a perennial noncontender once best known for its former owner, the crooning Hollywood cowboy Gene Autry, many fans seemed benumbed, like dolls staring out from the shelves of a shooting gallery.
"We're feeling pretty down right now," said Gary Santiago, 34, a furniture salesman who said he had been a Yankee fan since infancy.
At the Yankee Sports Bar and Restaurant on East 161st Street, Peter Johnson, 58, who lives nearby and was wearing a Yankee cap, put down his beer and poured out his disappointment. "This upsets me," he said, scowling at the painful memories. "That team carries the neighborhood. When the Yankees play, it's alive. Now it's soft."
But there was more than punctured pride in the Bronx. For the first time since 1997, there will be no World Series at the stadium, and no free-spending hordes of fans patronizing businesses in the area. That raised a businessmen's lament at fast food outlets, sports memorabilia stores and other enterprises.
"No Yankees means no money," said Vasilios Michialis, 47, the owner of the Unity Coffee Shop at 58 East 161st Street. A short, stocky man in a gray shirt unbuttoned halfway down a hairy chest, he sat in a booth and looked about at a nearly empty shop. "When they stop playing I always hurt," he said. "I may have to lay off a few dishwashers, a cook and a waitress."
Nearby, at Sammy's Fashions -- winter clothing, designer sportswear, Yankee caps and jerseys -- the manager, Naji Assam, said that October prospects looked grim without more playoff games or a World Series. "Business will definitely go down 25 percent," he predicted.
Around the corner at US Fried Chicken, 860 Gerard Avenue, Caesar Caesar, 30, the owner, said he expected business to be off by 65 percent, compared with the Octobers of recent years, although it had fallen after Sept. 11 last year when the Yankees stopped letting patrons bring food and drinks into the stadium. "It's a nice alibi for them to sell their $6 hot dog," he said.
Not everyone was sorry the Yankees' season was over. At the Ball Park Bar and Grill at 810 River Avenue, which has bowling lanes and a 40-foot bar that is always packed on game days, Tony Alexander, 54, a security guard who bowls in a league on Sundays, looked about the all-but-deserted place and said he was not sorry the Yankees were out of it.
"As a bowler here, I've got to be honest," he said. "I'm kind of glad. Fans get in the way. You can't get in the bar, get a parking place or a beer."
Steven Dickerson, 49, a hospital worker, had a conspiratorial grin for the anguish of Yankee followers. "I'm glad they're depressed," he said. "Now Yankee fans can do what us Met fans do at this time of the year. Watch somebody else play on TV. Look around. All these people are my enemies."
Outside the barroom shadows, it was a beautiful autumn Sunday in New York, a youngster's fantasy of Indian summer, with gold shafts of sunlight falling through an archipelago of white clouds that barely moved, as if painted on blue enamel. But it was a monochrome day for fans like Bill Pacheco, a banker who has lived near the stadium for most of his 44 years.
"They're the greatest team in the history of baseball," Mr. Pacheco said of his beloved Yankees. "I was all ready to get playoff tickets. Each year I get caught without them, so this year was my chance. What am I going to do now? Watch the Knicks?"
Instead of bleak winter, however, many fans looked back over a proud season in which the Yankees won 103 games. They remembered Bernie Williams loping like a gazelle in center field, Jason Giambi's roundhouse swing, Derek Jeter's rifle arm, Alfonso Soriano's plastic-man moves and Joe Torre's decision-lined face in the dugout.
And somebody had to say wait till next year, so Colby Khuns, 21, a Fordham student, did it. "This isn't the end of the dynasty," he insisted. "They're the Yankees. They're going to come back twice as hard. We're going to win three more World Series championships in the next three years."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Quietly, the First Lady Builds A Literary Room of Her Own

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
David Levering Lewis, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of W. E. B. Du Bois and an eminent black historian who considers President Bush's policies on Iraq "a menace," was flabbergasted when he received an invitation from Laura Bush's office to be the keynote speaker at a White House symposium on the writers of the Harlem Renaissance.
 Ursula Smith, who with her partner, Linda Peavy, has chronicled the ordinary lives of the American frontier, was similarly taken aback when Mrs. Bush's office extended an invitation for both historians to speak at a symposium on the women writers of the West. "I didn't think I could with any kind of integrity walk into a White House that I take such exception to," said Ms. Smith, who disagrees with Mr. Bush on Iraq, the environment and many other issues. 
 And Justin Kaplan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Mark Twain who says Mr. Bush has a "troglodytic" approach to social and economic problems, was so surprised by his invitation from the White House to a symposium on Twain that he told the aide in the first lady's office he would have to get back to her.
But all four not only turned up in the East Room, they came away startled and impressed by a first lady who is quietly creating her own separate space within a presidency focused on war. While Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, gives the president political biographies and invites like-minded historians to speak, Mrs. Bush has reached out beyond ideology.
"There's nothing political about American literature," Mrs. Bush said in a telephone interview Saturday, acknowledging that some of her guests were not sympathetic to her husband. "Everyone can like American literature, no matter what your party."
Mrs. Bush, a former teacher and librarian who will be the host of the second annual National Book Festival on the lawn of the Capitol this weekend, has so far held three White House events showcasing American literature, all of them open to the press but largely ignored except for reruns on C-Span. "I wish they had a bigger audience," she said. Each symposium -- Twain last November, the Harlem Renaissance this past March and the women writers of the West in September -- was held on a day when news of Afghanistan or Iraq overshadowed it.
But many participants are convinced that publicity is not Mrs. Bush's primary motive and that the events are rooted in the identity she established before she married into what became an American political dynasty. Certainly the audiences of 200 invited by the White House for the events -- District of Columbia high school students, spouses of administration officials, old friends of the first lady -- are not designed to impress social Washington or otherwise attract attention. 
"I think it probably nourishes her and feeds her," said Patricia MacLachlan, the author of the children's book "Sarah, Plain and Tall," who was a speaker at the symposium on women of the West. "It validates who she is, where she came from and what she values."
Participants have also been surprised by the contents of the two-hour events. Although they do not break academic ground, they are often highly literary and tackle topics, like race, feminism and class, not normally discussed in the formal splendor of the East Room. Mr. Kaplan, for example, bluntly told the crowd last fall that Mark Twain was far more interested in writing about money than about sex.
"It was a kind of pornography of the dollar," Mr. Kaplan said. "He adored money, but at the same time he was terrified of it."
Mrs. Bush always sits in the front row, often nodding and beaming. "I chose Mark Twain to start with because I believe that Mark Twain is the first real American writer," she said in the interview. "I think Mark Twain really talks about everything that is at the crux of what America is, even now."
Participants have also been surprised by the choice of authors, who are always selected by Mrs. Bush. When Patricia Nelson Limerick, a leading historian of the American West and the author of the influential revisionist history "The Legacy of Conquest," was asked to speak about the Western writers Willa Cather, Edna Ferber and Laura Ingalls Wilder in September, she had to read Ferber's "Giant" for the first time -- and came away stunned.
"It is quite a penetrating, mocking portrait of Texas rich people, and particularly of people making their money in oil," Ms. Limerick said, adding that she at first could not imagine that the first lady, with her roots in Texas, would have selected such a book for White House discussion. But when Mrs. Bush spoke in her opening remarks at that symposium of Ferber's shock at "the swaggering arrogance of men in 10-gallon hats," Ms. Limerick knew that Mrs. Bush was no stranger to the themes of "Giant."
"I did Mrs. Bush a terrible disservice thinking that maybe she didn't know, that she thought these were all little houses on the prairie," Ms. Limerick said.
Mrs. Bush said she chose the Harlem Renaissance as a topic because she has always loved the poetry of Langston Hughes. Not surprisingly, one guest at the Harlem symposium was Arnold Rampersad of Stanford, Hughes's biographer, who recalled overhearing Mrs. Bush talk informally after the event about what writers she should select for the next symposium.
"She talked about Willa Cather and Katherine Anne Porter," Mr. Rampersad said. "That was the moment when it became very clear that she was seeing this world from the inside, not the outside."
Mrs. Bush, who is currently rereading the memoirs of Lillian Hellman, said she was already thinking of what writers should be next. She said she was toying with the idea of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, but was also thinking of Faulkner, Hemingway and Fitzgerald.
"And I love Truman Capote," she said. "I think he'd be fabulous."

HEADLINE: Fire on French Tanker Off Yemen Raises Terrorism Fears 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
A French oil tanker was on fire off the southeastern coast of Yemen after an explosion this morning as it headed for an oil terminal in the Gulf of Aden. By late tonight, the cause of the blast aboard the tanker Limburg was still unclear, but the incident immediately raised fears that terrorists had attacked one of the most vulnerable links in the oil-dependent global economy two years after an explosive-filled boat in nearby waters ripped a hole in the United States Navy destroyer Cole.
 French diplomats and executives at the company that owns the tanker were quoted in early news agency reports as saying that they suspected a terrorist attack by a small boat that reportedly approached the tanker shortly before the explosion. 
 Yemeni officials, however, denied that there had been an attack and said the small boat had been sent to guide the tanker into port. 
"We in Paris have no clue," said a senior French official here monitoring the investigation. "We fear that it is a terrorist act, but we probably need a couple of more days to see what happened."
In Washington, United States military officials said they had not yet received solid indications that the tanker blast was the work of terrorists and, at least temporarily, were classifying the incident as a shipboard accident. "Reports of a terrorist attack are, at this point, conjecture," an American military officer said.
All but one of the tanker's 25 crew members were rescued from the ship, which sent an inky plume into the sky and thousands of barrels of black oil into the sea. The French Embassy in Yemen said 12 crew members were hospitalized in the port city of Mukalla.
Even if the blast turns out to be an accident, the snap suggestion that terrorists were to blame is a measure of the anxiety in the region.
Yemen is Osama bin Laden's ancestral home, and some reports have placed him in the mountains there, where he is reported to have once said he would like to live. The explosion today occurred just one week before the two-year anniversary of the attack on the Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and has been blamed on Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist network.
Maritime companies had been alerted early last month to possible terror attack on ships in the region. In advance of the Sept. 11 anniversary of the attacks in New York and Washington, Navy officials in Bahrain, home to the United States Fifth Fleet, issued an advisory to shipping lines warning of possible strikes by Al Qaeda against oil tankers.
Successful attacks on lumbering, oil-heavy tankers would be likely to roil world financial markets and could raise oil prices and batter confidence in a global economic system already shaken by the terrorist attacks in the United States last year and the prospect of a winter war in Iraq.
The Middle East accounts for more than half of the world's oil exports, including more than 90 percent of Asian crude oil imports and one-third of American and European net crude oil imports. But it is unlikely the impact of such a terrorist campaign would last very long.
"This is really a scare story," said Gary Ross, chief executive of Pira Energy Group, a New York-based oil-industry consulting firm. "It would put everyone on heightened alert and raise insurance rates, but it wouldn't materially affect supply."
During the so-called "tanker war" of the 1980's, when Iran and Iraq attacked oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to damage each other's economies, insurers raised war risk insurance premiums for ships sailing into the gulf by 50 percent at one point but oil prices barely budged.
Since the Cole attack, Yemen has tried to assure the world that it is not a haven for Al Qaeda. It arrested more than 100 suspected members of the terrorist network and other Islamist groups in the months after Sept. 11, 2001, and has sent military patrols to hunt for Qaeda members in the mountains.
Last month, Yemeni security forces killed one man and seized four other suspected Qaeda members following a shootout in a northern suburb of Sana, the capital. Other suspected members got away.
Meanwhile, the Yemeni government has said it plans to put suspected accomplices in the Cole attack on trial in the next few days.
The Limburg, leased by the Malaysian state oil company Petronas, was carrying 397,000 barrels of crude oil from the Kharg Island terminal in Iran and was preparing to take on 1.5 million more barrels of Yemeni crude at an offshore terminal near the Red Sea port of Mina al-Dabah. The French-registered ship, which weighs 298,997 tons when fully loaded, is owned by Euronav, a subsidiary of the Belgian firm Compagnie Maritime Belge. It has a crew of eight French citizens and seven Bulgarians. One Bulgarian was reported missing.
President Jacques Chirac of France placed a telephone call to Yemen's president, Ali Abdallah Saleh, thanking him for the efforts to save the tanker's crew, Reuters reported. Mr. Chirac said French investigators would go to Yemen to join local experts in examining the tanker.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 8, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about an explosion on a French tanker approaching a Yemeni oil terminal misstated the number of Bulgarians among the crew. It was 17, not 7. With the eight French crew members, they brought the total to 25, as given in the article.
Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 7 about an explosion on the French supertanker Limburg off Yemen confused two ways of measuring the ship's size. The Limburg weighs 341,097 tons fully loaded; 298,997 tons is its deadweight tonnage, or the total possible weight of its cargo, fuel, stores and everything else removable from the ship.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Identify New Menace: Discarded Cellphones 

BYLINE:  By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
As the nation's fondness for cellphones grows, the environmental effects do, too.
 According to industry figures, cellphone use in the United States has surged, to more than 128 million subscribers last year from 340,000 in 1985. Typically, each phone is used for 18 months before being dropped for a newer model. 
 That is starting to add up to a huge amount of waste, says Inform, an environmental organization that issued a report this year on old phones. The Environmental Protection Agency helped finance the study. 
By 2005, the report estimates, 130 million cellphones will be thrown out each year. Counting the phones, batteries and chargers, that comes to 65,000 tons a year, the report said. Although some phones may just stay unused in desk drawers, the report said, most will end up in landfills or being incinerated. 
"This is becoming a very serious problem, because the amount of cellphone waste is growing tremendously," said Eric Most, director of the solid waste prevention program at Inform. "These chemicals accumulate and persist in the environment. They get in the plants, soil, water, and then move up the stream to humans." 
The threat of cellphone waste is not restricted to the United States. More than a billion cellphones are used worldwide, and Japan and several European countries have started pressuring manufacturers to eliminate toxic chemicals. 
Researchers at Inform say companies can act to eliminate waste by creating take-back programs that offer discounts on new phones or phone service in exchange for returned equipment.
"If producers have to take back their cellphones, they have an incentive to make products that generate less waste and are easier to recycle," said Bette K. Fishbein, an economist who was lead author of the study. "Australia has a nationwide take-back program, and Europe is about to mandate that companies take back their electronics. The same should be done in the U.S."
Some companies, including Verizon and Sprint, do have take-back programs, but the main industry group, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, opposes mandatory programs. Rather than requiring manufacturers to dispose of old phones, the industry prefers programs in which old phones are turned over to charities or resold in less developed countries, said Travis Larson, a spokesman for the group. 
Some states have taken small steps to promote reusing cellphones. A government-financed program in Maryland collects used cellphones that are recycled or reprogrammed and given to the elderly so they can call 911 in an emergency.
"Recovery of cellphones is occurring on a much larger scale in other countries, often with the cooperation of manufacturers and retailers," the Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement in August. "E.P.A. is interested in working to encourage similar developments in the United States."
The agency is working with Inform on a follow-up study to examine the effectiveness of reusing and recycling cellphones. 
In the meantime, Ms. Fishbein said, American manufacturers should limit waste by standardizing design elements so consumers have fewer reasons to buy new phones. 
Although manufacturers are working to reduce their use of toxic materials, they oppose a mandated technical standard, Mr. Larson said. 
"If we had had a government standard in the beginning," he said, "we'd still all be speaking on analog phones. And that means no e-mail, no text messaging, no Caller ID. Competition equals innovation in this case."

PERSON: Nancy Stephenson Nichols 

HEADLINE: Nancy S. Nichols, 57, Executive Recruiter for Cultural Elite 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Nancy Stephenson Nichols, an executive recruiter who helped stellar educational and cultural institutions find stellar executives to lead them, died last Wednesday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 57 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Clinton Corners, N.Y.
 The cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, her family said. 
 Dr. Nichols was a managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles, a worldwide executive search firm based in Chicago, which she joined in 1996. Working in its New York office, she headed its education/nonprofit section until illness forced her to take a leave this summer. 
Dr. Nichols helped bring together Vartan Gregorian, a former president of Brown University and the New York Public Library, and the Carnegie Foundation, of which he became president in 1997. In 2000, she played matchmaker between Lawrence M. Small, former vice chairman of Citicorp, and the Smithsonian Institution, where he is now secretary.
She helped the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation find its new president, Joan E. Spero, in 1997. Another match she worked on was that of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and Michael M. Kaiser, who took over as president in 2001 after serving as executive director of the Royal Opera House in London.
She assisted the boards of many other museums, universities, foundations and the like in filling vacancies at the top, poring over the fine print in resumes and soliciting references from scores of people who worked with or for prospective candidates.
She also received assignments from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cooper Union and Public Broadcasting Service. Her museum clients included the Metropolitan, the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
Nancy Stephenson was born in Wilmington, Del., and graduated from Smith College in 1966. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Islamic fine arts at Harvard University and spent a year as a Fulbright fellow in Turkey in 1979-80.
At Harvard, she worked at the Institute for International Development and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Derek Bok, the president of Harvard, made her his special assistant for Harvard's offshore programs.
In the early 1990's, she was the vice president for planning and development in New York for the American University in Beirut, Lebanon. She then spent three years with Norman Broadbent International, an executive recruiter based in London, before joining Heidrick & Struggles.
Dr. Nichols is survived by her husband, Rodney W. Nichols; two daughters from a previous marriage, Courtney T. Pyle of Manhattan and Lindsey S. Pyle of Austin, Tex.; a stepson, Christopher McK. Nichols of Charlottesville, Va.; her parents, Thomas and Elizabeth Stephenson of Boston; a brother, Thomas F. Stephenson of Atherton, Calif.; and a sister, Susan S. Gates of Winston-Salem, N.C.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Manhattan Leads a Surge in Lower-Cost Hotels

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
Although Bob Risse, a venture capitalist in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., often flies first class, his accommodations in Manhattan are anything but. He stays at the Ramada Inn Eastside, at Lexington Avenue and 30th Street, usually for $89 a night.
 Mr. Risse, 40, learned about the hotel last June from another traveler on a flight. Always frugal, he was in first class on an upgrade purchased with frequent-flier miles. 
 Once a regular at the more expensive Paramount, Mr. Risse now stays 7 to 10 nights each month at the Ramada, a 96-room hotel that opened in April and is owned and operated by Apple Core Hotels and franchised by Cendant. Amenities include free continental breakfast and local phone calls, business and fitness centers, phones with dataports and wireless Web television in each room.
"It's an awesome deal," he said. "I don't see the value in paying for the extra services of a five-star hotel."
Nor do a growing number of other budget-minded business travelers. All across the country, they are choosing low-cost lodgings, and both the national hotel chains and local developers are moving to accommodate the demand. Mark Lomanno, president of Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., says there has been a rise in the industry's two cheapest hotel categories -- economy and midscale without food and beverage -- the last year in many large cities, including Boston, Detroit, New Orleans, Orlando and San Francisco.
The greatest increase, 13 percent, has been in New York City. The phenomenon is especially striking in Manhattan, if only because of its sky-high real estate costs.
According to Smith Travel Research, the number of chain hotels in these two categories in the New York market that cater to business clients has grown to 26 from 17 just two years ago. A third category, midscale with food and beverage, has 37 chain hotels in the New York market, compared with 33, in 2000. More are planned in all three categories.
Choice Hotels International, whose brands are Comfort Inn, Clarion and Quality, is at the forefront of this trend, operating nine of Manhattan's less expensive hotels. Best Western, an association of hotel owners, and Cendant, whose brands include Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Super 8 as well as Ramada, each operate seven of these hotels. Other budget hotels are franchised by Holiday Inn, a brand of Six Continents, and Red Roof Inns, an Accor brand, while still others are owned and operated by independent local companies like Citylife Hotel Group and Triumph Hospitality.
In addition, in the next two years in Manhattan, Hilton Hotels will open three Hampton Inns, and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide will open a Four Points by Sheraton hotel. Cendant plans to add more Days Inn and Ramada hotels and to introduce its Wingate Inn brand, while Best Western and Comfort Inn are both considering new hotels near Wall Street. Low-cost hotels in SoHo and TriBeCa are also under discussion, according to John Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hotel consulting company.
This spurt in budget hotels is Manhattan's first since the 1964-1965 boom to handle visitors to the World's Fair, according to Sean Hennessey, a consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers who specializes in the New York lodging market.
Mr. Hennessey says the current increase came about because franchisers told developers that they had "85,000 customers who want to stay in New York but no place to put them." These included clients like "salesmen still on a budget, who used to stay in New Jersey and drive in during the day."
He also said that developers were more willing today than in the past to build hotels in out-of-the-way neighborhoods, like the Best Western and the Comfort Inn that are near the Jacob C. Javits Convention Center or the Howard Johnson Express Inn on East Houston Street, all new in the last 18 months.
Less expensive hotels often have tiny rooms and some, like the Days Hotel Midtown on Eighth Avenue and the Howard Johnson Inn on West 34th Street, are dreary and musty. Others, however, are bright and clean, with tasteful furnishings, like the Best Western near the Javits Center or On the Ave, a Citylife hotel on West 77th Street. Patrick Aiello, a Los Angeles screenwriter and producer, says the decor at On the Ave reminds him of a W, the luxury chain operated by Starwood.
Amenities also differ widely. Apple Core hotels offer free continental breakfasts, but not all Best Westerns do; Citylife's free breakfast policy varies by season. Some hotels permit smoking, while the Comfort Inn Midtown does not.
What most hotels share is their guest profile: the bulk of their business comes from the self-employed or small-business owners or executives. One is David Eisele, owner of a men's clothing store in Reston, Va., who stays at the Best Western on West 32nd Street several nights each month for $89.
Before opening his store 10 years ago, Mr. Eisele, 48, worked for large jewelry retailers, and on visits to Manhattan paid $165 a night at the Omni Berkshire Place. 'When I worked for a corporation, it was easy to stay at a higher-priced hotel, but it's not when you're spending your personal money," he said.
In the first eight months of this year, the average daily rate of Manhattan hotels in the economy and "midscale without food and beverage" categories was $108, compared with $176 for all hotels, Smith Travel Research says. But regulars say the low cost is not the only advantage.
Because these hotels tend to be small, guests can know the manager, who can expedite last-minute arrangements. They are also often less crowded. Paul Nardone, chief executive of Annie's Homegrown in Wakefield, Mass., and a frequent traveler to Manhattan, likes the ease of checking in and out of On the Ave. He also likes that it does not charge him for using toll-free phone numbers or receiving faxes.
Patrick Bolek, an executive of the Grammy Foundation in Los Angeles, appreciates On the Ave's willingness to bill his employer directly. He says a Wyndham hotel in Atlanta told him that it would offer that service only if the foundation guaranteed 50 room nights a year.
Of course, even the most loyal guests occasionally find fault with low-cost hotels. Kevin Jeter, a marketing consultant in Oak Hill, Va., who frequented the Best Western Manhattan earlier this year, said he could not call up his America Online account through the wireless Web television there. Mr. Risse acknowledges that he misses "the Paramount's great lobby."
Even so, for people drawn to cheaper lodgings, the rewards outweigh the drawbacks. "I hate wasting money on a hotel room," said Steve Greenberg, a video producer from Miami who visits New York every five weeks and stays at the Ramada Inn Eastside for $79 or $89 a night. "I'd rather spend it on better restaurants, grabbing a cab whenever I like or theater tickets."
He added, "My clients really appreciate the fact that I'm not spending a lot of money on a room."

HEADLINE: Growth in Borrowing Slowed in August 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Growth in household borrowing slowed sharply in August, posting its smallest gain in eight months, according to a Federal Reserve report released today. 
 The Fed said outstanding consumer credit rose $4.2 billion in August, its smallest gain since a $3.9 billion advance in December 2001. 
Most of the gain was concentrated in revolving credit, like credit cards. 
 Only about $200 million of the August gain came from nonrevolving debt, like loans for cars, boats, mobile homes or education. That was the slowest monthly increase since an outright decline in June 1999.
Revolving credit grew $3.9 billion in August, the Fed said. But even that was a slowing from the $6.4 billion advance the previous month. 
July total credit outstanding was revised downward slightly, the Fed said, to a $10 billion gain from the previously reported $10.8 billion gain.
The August gain was much weaker than Wall Street analysts had been expecting and may raise worries about consumer spending ahead.
The small increase in nonrevolving credit surprised analysts, who had been expecting a gain reflecting strong auto sales. Those sales have been helped by the renewal of cheap financing by automakers.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Deep Change Ahead for Corporations

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH 

 BODY:
SOUTH BEACH is looking a little anxious and tapped out these days -- sort of like a Bourbon Street with better shoes and haircuts. So it was probably an appropriate spot for a gaggle of travel professionals and writers to gather last week to gaze at the horizon and speculate.
 With a hurricane churning through the Gulf of Mexico far across the cloud-hugged Everglades to the west, while blue skies and blazing sun bathed the ocean to the east, you could pick up conflicting signals depending on which horizon you were gazing at. But still, some useful and clear trends seemed to emerge at the two-day gathering, the American Express Global Corporate Travel Press Forum, which drew business-travel writers from a dozen countries, including a contingent from China, where business travel is rapidly growing. 
 Here is the most important highlight that came from these sessions:
Despite souring economies in the United States and elsewhere and despite lingering uncertainty about terrorism, airline-service deterioration and the so-called airport hassle factor, 91 percent of world business travelers say they expect either to maintain current travel levels or increase them next year, according to a new American Express International Traveler Survey.
While some travel companies -- especially some online travel-booking sites -- are notorious for publishing giddily optimistic surveys based on notoriously unreliable user-generated replies, the American Express survey's methodology looks sound. Conducted by an independent market research firm, the survey was based on telephone interviews with 1,400 frequent business travelers -- 100 each in 14 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia.
"True road warriors, those who travel across the globe, are not slowing down," said Mark Webb, the senior vice president for global business partnerships, who manages the travel and credit card relationships with American Express's top 47 multinational companies.
They are, however, drastically changing some of the ways they arrange and conduct their trips both domestically and around the world. "It does appear that a revolution is under way," Mr. Webb said.
Obviously, a new terrorism catastrophe or a war in Iraq, will negate predictions of a resumption of robust travel. Right now, the revolution driving that resumption is being waged on several fronts, and I'll explore some of them more fully in future columns. But the main forces are gathered on the field where airline prices are set. Everyone I spoke with here agreed that casualties are going to continue piling up before this industry settles into a new, working model.
"The business-travel industry is currently in a greater state of flux than at any time in my 26-year experience in this business," said Charles Petruccelli, the president of American Express Global Travel Services, which operates the company's worldwide corporate travel and foreign exchange businesses.
The travel industry was long known for its cozy, cordial business relationships among suppliers, distributors and clients. No more, he said. "Traditional relationships are under pressure, and the structure is buckling under the strain," he added.
One clear indication of how certain relationships are buckling, a phenomenon that has been addressed in this column frequently the last 18 months, is the sharp growth in so-called interactive travel booking for business travel. This is a system in which you arrange all of your own business travel directly on your company's internal travel-booking engine, which is managed by a third party like American Express, Navigant International or others to squeeze every possible cost-saving and negotiated-discount advantage from travel spending, which is one of the biggest controllable corporate expense.
This process typically is automated in a manner that puts pressure on often reluctant employees to adhere to corporate travel policies, which are partly set based on discounts negotiated for volume use with preferred airlines, hotels and other suppliers.
American Express has been rapidly expanding its operations, called Global E-Fulfillment Centers, to handle these kinds of bookings, which are now being used by more than 1,400 of its corporate clients. The largest such operation, near Miami, employs about 250 travel counselors and is open around the clock to handle technical problems and to assist the relatively small percentage of corporate online users who have extraordinary travel itineraries or needs.
By largely eliminating the personal interaction of travel agent and client and allowing clients to make their own bookings in a controlled environment, companies routinely save 15 to 20 percent on airline ticket costs.
One of those companies, Motorola, which spent $102 million on plane tickets in 2001, began requiring its employees to use the internal online booking system for domestic travel last January, said Pam Borgeson, the corporate travel manager.
With 90 percent of bookings done internal and online, travel savings for the first half of 2002 were $4.7 million over 2001, she said. Much of that came from the greater use of cheaper advance-purchase nonrefundable tickets, which can be more readily found, booked and managed using online reservations systems designed to extract the best fares under whatever specific conditions the company requires for its employees.
It does not matter that the airlines are trying mightily to resist this trend, she said. No matter how the airlines try to force corporate nonrefundable users back into the full-fare category, the technology now available to company travel buyers makes it a lost cause, she said.
"I don't know any travel manager who is going to pull back and say we're going to start buying full-fare tickets because that's what the airlines want us to do," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Two Magazines Are Shut And Red Herring Is Sold

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR and NAT IVES 

 BODY:
Mutual Funds magazine, a personal finance magazine owned by AOL Time Warner, and Upside magazine, a privately held publication in Silicon Valley, announced yesterday that they were shutting down. And Red Herring, another Silicon Valley publication, announced that it was selling itself to a majority investor in an effort to restructure financially.
 The November issue of Mutual Funds, which is on newsstands now, will be the last, while the October issue of Upside, which was in production, will not be published. 
 The publishing economy, hurt by declining newsstand sales and disappearing ads, has been difficult for all consumer magazines over the last year, but publications with a business focus, especially anything related to the digital economy, have been suffering even more. 
At a time when many Americans are tossing their 401(k) notices into drawers without opening them, the magazine Mutual Funds, which had a circulation of 825,000, was fighting a difficult battle for consumer attention. Jack Haire, vice president of Time Inc., said that the depressed stock market played a role in the decision but indicated that changes in the way that mutual funds are marketed essentially eliminated an entire advertising category.
"Mutual fund companies used to market directly to consumers, but now they sell their products through middlemen like Schwab and Merrill Lynch," Mr. Haire said. "Essentially, 80 percent of the ad pages in the category went away."
Mr. Haire said that the only possible route to survival would be to broaden the subject matter in Mutual Funds, a move that would put the magazine into direct competition with Money, the Time Inc. personal finance magazine.
In an announcement, the company said it would try to place the 33 people who lost jobs at Mutual Funds at other Time Inc. magazines but that some would receive severance and assistance in finding another job. The publisher of Mutual Funds, Michael Dukmejian, has been named the new publisher of Money, while the former publisher of Money, Kathleen Kayse, will move to People as its new publisher. (In an unrelated announcement, Paul Caine, former associate publisher of People, was named publisher of Teen People.) 
The personal finance category of magazines, which ballooned along with the bull market in the 1990's, came back to earth in lock step with the market. In 2001, three boom-era publications closed, including Individual Investor, Your Money and Family Money. 
The collapse of the so-called new economy crippled magazines like Upside and Red Herring, which focused on digital technology and the venture capitalists who financed it. In August 2001, The Industry Standard, a newsweekly covering technology and the Internet, closed. Last week, Forbes Magazines announced that it was closing Forbes ASAP, which was founded in 1992 to cover the digital economy.
Upside magazine was founded in 1989 by Richard Karlgaard and Anthony Perkins, who later left to found Red Herring. The magazine covered Silicon Valley throughout the 90's, but in 2001, as the Web bubble burst, it was forced to shut down its Web site and was taken over by the MCG Capital Corporation in Arlington, Va. Upside was mailed free to 250,000 people. It was primarily aimed at technology executives.
"It has been there so long, it was sad to see it go," said John Battelle, former chief of Standard Media International, publisher of The Industry Standard. 
Eriq Gardner, New York editor of Upside, is one of 75 people who lost their jobs yesterday, he said.
"It has been a perpetual state of knowing the magazine was going to be dying," Mr. Gardner said. "The only question has been when, and I have actually been surprised that it has been ticking this long."
The staff at Red Herring has gone from more than 400 employees to fewer than 50, leaving the magazine with huge real estate commitments and excess space. Andy Plesser, a spokesman for Red Herring, said that RHC Media Inc., which is owned by Broadview Capital Partners, would acquire the assets of Red Herring Communications. The staff is moving to smaller space in San Francisco.
"This has been undertaken to liquidate liabilities," Mr. Plesser said. "The magazine needed to do something to get out from under the enormous burden of real estate leases."
Red Herring was founded by Mr. Perkins in 1993 after he left Upside. The magazine has a circulation of about 350,000 subscribers, and ad pages have fallen 72 percent through August of this year compared with the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Texas Republican to Join UBS After He Retires From Senate 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm, an author of legislation that helped to create financial conglomerates like Citigroup, said yesterday that he would become a vice chairman of the UBS Warburg investment bank after retiring from the Senate.
 Mr. Gramm, Republican of Texas, is finishing his 18th year in the Senate and his 24th in Congress. Mr. Gramm said he would advise UBS Warburg on political matters and would work with corporate clients to help them grow and create jobs. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was passed in 1999, eliminated Depression-era barriers that separated financial companies. It cleared the way for banks to merge with securities firms and drove up the value of brokerage firms. In 2000, Warburg's parent company, UBS, bought the PaineWebber brokerage firm for $12 billion.
Mr. Gramm said he thought he had been hired for his expertise and abilities, not as a reward for his work in Congress. He said that Citigroup, the biggest beneficiary of the legislation, was not among the firms that offered him a job. Citigroup was formed with the merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Group. 
"I'm as excited about being an investment banker as I was on the day I was elected to Congress and the day I got my Ph.D.," Mr. Gramm said, referring to his doctorate in economics from the University of Georgia.
"When they give me a testimonial at the end of my time here, I don't want them to say, 'He was the best political adviser we ever had' or 'He had the best connections.' I want them to say, 'He was one of the best investment bankers we ever had.' "
At Warburg, Mr. Gramm, 60, will be one of three vice chairmen and will report to John P. Costas, the chairman and chief executive. Sitting beside Mr. Costas in a conference room in Warburg's offices in Midtown, Mr. Gramm said he would work from various offices, including those in Stamford, Conn., and London.
He lives near San Antonio and is married to Wendy Gramm, the former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who was a director of the Enron Corporation before it collapsed. Warburg acquired Enron's energy-trading business after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
Mr. Costas said he had not met Mr. Gramm before the firm considered hiring him. "I never met him before several weeks ago because I never go to Washington," Mr. Costas said.
He said he preferred to focus on the firm's business not on political or regulatory matters, but has found that approach impractical as scandals have swept Wall Street. Given the range of issues surrounding corporate managers and their investment bankers, Mr. Costas said, there has never been more need for the type of advice that Mr. Gramm can provide.
"He's going to be value-added as a banker Day 1," Mr. Costas said.
Warburg's client list is filled with chief executives, but not many people like Dicky Flatts, whom Mr. Gramm often cites as his barometer. He has spoken of subjecting his political decisions to the "Dicky Flatts test," considering the reception they might get from Mr. Flatts, the president of a printing company in Mexia, Tex.
Mr. Flatts said yesterday that Mr. Gramm had not consulted him about his career change, though the two had attended a Texas A&M football game together three weeks ago.
"He said he was going to be in New York three days a week," but did not say why, Mr. Flatts said.

HEADLINE: Where Biking Blossomed, Now the Wheels Come Off 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
In this, the land where the automobile is king, at the busiest human crossroads in the world, the lowly bicycle had a brief moment of glory. For a time, two wheels were faster than four.
 This was in the days and months after Sept. 11, when border agents were checking every trunk and lifting every hood, and the inspection lines for cars were three hours long. The pedestrian lines were no shorter, since they had swelled with people who had gotten out of their cars. 
 But people in the bike lane breezed through. Word got out. A bike rental business bloomed.
It didn't last. Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service shut down the outdoor bike lane in midsummer, saying they were afraid that the 3,000 commuters from Mexico using it -- among them housekeepers, schoolchildren and even some people in wheelchairs -- were a danger to themselves as they slipped out of the lane to weave in and out of the lines of idling cars.
As a result, local lawmakers are boiling, a group of border entrepreneurs are broke, and again it is left to the Mexican workers to suck it up and rise five hours before the workday begins to beat the rush.
On any given day, about 50,000 people with legitimate working papers commute from Mexico, where the rents are cheap, to San Diego, where the rents are not. They come to clean toilets, lay bricks and clip hedges. Their workday begins when the sky is still purple.
Gonzalo Contreras is one of them. Mr. Contreras, a lugubrious, heavy-eyed man, slept until 5 a.m. when the bike lane was open and he could clear customs in 30 minutes. These days, he rises at 3 to beat the foot rush. 
He takes the $2.25 trolley from the border to central San Diego, where he loiters for an hour before going to his $10-an-hour job separating municipal filth from recyclables.
"There's a lot of tension in the lines," he said. "They check through all your papers and put your name in the computer. Before, the bikes went freely. They stopped doing that, and now I get four hours' sleep."
When they shut the bike lane, which was roughly a foot wide and skirted auto traffic, immigration officials promised to look into a more functional permanent one. A study commissioned by the immigration service showed that one could be built for about $500,000, but no government agency wants to pay for it.
"It's just not cost-effective, I suppose," said William B. Ward, port director of the border crossing. 
The local congressman, Bob Filner, sees bureaucracy at its worst. "The whole thing is a joke," he said. "They found a way to get 3,000 people out of their cars, and they say, 'Hey, we better get rid of this.' "
The total northbound movement through the crossing here is now 55 million people a year, not only workers but also children who go to school in the United States, Mexican shoppers who pump more than $3 billion into the economy of San Diego County and American tourists returning home. Yet no new capacity has been added at the border since the 1970's.
"The inefficiency is mind-boggling," Congressman Filner said. "You don't know if it's going to take three hours or 10 minutes to cross. The flow of people is irreversible. Most of America doesn't understand it, they fear it, and there is no will to fix it."
The lines have improved somewhat since federal agents stopped searching every trunk and hood, and pedestrians have gone back to their automobiles. But the waits are still long, sometimes two hours by car or foot or bike, commuters say. With bike traffic folded into foot traffic, the advantage of riding or renting a bike is gone.
And so the arbitrage opportunity has evaporated for Anell Gonzalo.
Mr. Gonzalo rented bikes for $5 on the Mexican side of the border and retrieved them on the American side. He made outrageous money, and is proud of it.
"Nothing but a good deed done," he said. "Helping my fellow man."
Mr. Gonzalo expanded his company, Border Bikes, to 200 bicycles and 17 employees. In addition, four competitors quickly jumped in. At any one time, there were a thousand rent-a-bikes rolling through traffic.
Now Mr. Gonzalo sleeps late. Business is off 70 percent since its peak in June, he said. Worse, he is stuck with 200 bicycles. Since there is nothing to be gained by renting a bike for an hour's wage, Border Bikes is just another small business staggering in these wobbly economic times. The others have gone bankrupt, he said.
Still, Mr. Gonzalo encourages bullish Wall Street types looking for investment opportunity on the border to give him a call. 
In the meantime, he is philosophical about his sinking fortunes and the fortunes of the Mexican commuter.
"Mine was a moment in time," he said. "But the uneducated Mexican, he will keep coming. If he can find a job cleaning a toilet in San Diego, then he will live like a king in Tijuana."

GRAPHIC: Photos: This is what border-crossing commuters to San Diego were trying to avoid when many of them took to bicycles after Sept. 11 last year.; With the outdoor bike lane shut down, cyclists are just pedestrians, and some signs near the border crossing no longer have their old appeal.

HEADLINE: Governor and Challenger Clash in First of Four Debates 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., Oct. 7 

 BODY:
In a debate tonight that often degenerated into acerbic exchanges, Gov. John G. Rowland did his best to portray his Democratic challenger, William E. Curry Jr., as a dilettante unfit to hold high office, while Mr. Curry tried to paint the governor as an ethically challenged insider who has failed Connecticut's families.
 Neither man inflicted a mortal wound on the other. Rather, they appeared to hold the line, maintaining their momentum among core supporters and beating back their opponent's predictable attacks. 
 Mr. Rowland, a two-term Republican, seemed intent on projecting the image of the established, accomplished and confident executive that his public campaign has portrayed him to be. Dressed in a dark suit and tie, he repeatedly offered viewers what he called his "positive vision for the future," including tax cuts and promises of urban renewal.
To guard against a flood of uncomplimentary statistics that Mr. Curry had at the ready, moreover, Mr. Rowland vowed at the outset to "say something positive" every time Mr. Curry said something negative.
Across the stage of the Garde Arts Center here, Mr. Curry, in a dark suit and red tie, wasted no opportunity to belittle the governor for a record that over eight years, he said, produced a 31 percent increase in residential property taxes, more than $1 billion in accumulated state debt and the smallest return per federal tax dollar of any state in the nation.
"We have the most congested highways in America," said Mr. Curry, a former state comptroller and White House aide in the Clinton administration. "We have an urban strategy that's failed. You have to decide who you believe here, the governor or your own wallet."
Trailing by more than 15 percentage points in the latest polls of likely voters, Mr. Curry could not afford to glide through tonight's clash, the first of four scheduled debates.
With a multimillion-dollar campaign war chest, Mr. Rowland, a two-term Republican who has made turning around Connecticut's beleaguered big cities his priority for a third term, has been airing one re-election advertisement after another for the past several weeks to portraying his tax-cutting, environmental and education accomplishments.
Mr. Curry, meanwhile, with less than $1 million on hand and only an occasional television ad, has struggled to keep a similarly high profile, largely through the free news media.
So while Mr. Rowland pointed out how far the state has come, cutting $2 billion in taxes and, he said, creating an education system that has produced fourth- and sixth-grade pupils who lead the nation in reading, math and science, Mr. Curry focused on scandals, high property taxes and urban decay that has forced middle-class families out of cities like Hartford, Bridgeport and Waterbury, Mr. Rowland's home town.
Each man tried to turn his opponent's argument against him. At one point, Mr. Rowland quoted a statement by Mr. Curry during a debate on the talk show "Firing Line" some years ago: "Show me a low-income family and I'll show you a kid on the way to jail."
Mr. Rowland called the comment outrageous. "I can't believe that Bill made this statement," he said.
Mr. Curry, conversely, hammered Mr. Rowland for not being more forthcoming about what role his administration may have played in a deal last year between the state trash agency and Enron that resulted in a loss to Connecticut of almost $200 million in public funds.
The state attorney general has called the deal, engineered by aides and allies of the governor, an illegal loan. Mr. Rowland has denied any knowledge of the deal and of exerting influence in securing it.
"Who really gave the order to make this loan happen?" Mr. Curry asked, clearly implying that perhaps Mr. Rowland had. "The governor sees himself as the innocent victim. He didn't hear anything, he didn't say anything, he didn't know anything."
Later, Mr. Curry told viewers: "You look for someone first of all who takes responsibility for their own actions. You seek someone who tells you the truth." 
Mr. Rowland decried such "silly talk" as that of an amateur unfit to be governor, and he contrasted Mr. Curry's wit with his own record in office.
"I didn't hear one positive thought," Governor Rowland chided during his concluding remarks. "I didn't hear anything about the future of this state." The difference between him and Mr. Curry, Mr. Rowland emphasized, "is criticism versus accomplishment."

To the Editor:
 Re " 'Hey, Keep It Down, Will Ya?' Mayor's Noise Plan Insists on It" (front page, Oct. 3): 
 Sirens create the loudest and most frequent noises New Yorkers suffer. The city needs to reassess their use. Are they really so effective in getting emergency vehicles through traffic? Might the high-pitched wail be abandoned for the intermittent bleep used in Europe? Might there be some hierarchy that restricts sirens to serious emergencies? Are police escorts really necessary for every visiting dignitary? It implies no criticism of emergency workers to ask these questions.

HEADLINE: Canada Economy Grows Where Others Falter 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
It only takes one look at this city's fast-changing skyline to see that Canada is defying the slowdown throttling much of the world economy.
 From Vancouver to Regina to Toronto to Montreal, cranes and earth-moving equipment are roaring at a rate not seen since the 1980's, creating high-rise condominiums in city centers, new single-family houses in the ever-sprawling suburbs, and tens of thousands of well-paying jobs. 
 The building boom is a primary reason the frequently underperforming Canadian economy now has the fastest growth rate among the major industrial countries.
Government statistics released last week showed that Canada's economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate in July, the 10th consecutive month of improving economic performance. In a new report, the International Monetary Fund forecast growth for the full year at a less torrid 3.4 percent pace, and the same in 2003 -- still, a more robust performance than in the United States. 
The cheerful statistics, and expectations of a big budget surplus to go with them, amount to a windfall for the governing Liberal Party at a time when infighting and cabinet scandals have forced Prime Minister Jean Chretien to drop thoughts of running for a fourth term. He is due to step down as party leader in early 2004, but his general economic policy line has support from several of his potential Liberal successors.
With 400,000 new jobs created over the last year, and unemployment declining, the Liberals expect to remain strong with their working-class voter base. They also expect to reverse the cutbacks of the 1990's and expand services. Just last week Mr. Chretien announced that next year's budget would include new spending on urban low-income housing, health care and transportation, national parks, education and programs to aid the impoverished Indian population. The spending should ease the way for the next Liberal leader to defeat a badly divided opposition.
Canada's good economic fortunes may also prove helpful to the slowing United States economy, given that Canada buys 25 percent of all American exports.
Finance Minister John Manley, one of the potential candidates to succeed Mr. Chretien, recently described Canada as "the new Northern Tiger." He noted that his country was "advancing against the tide of a global downturn and overcoming years of weak fiscal management to become the fastest-growing economy in the G-7 and likely the only one to remain in surplus this year."
Mr. Manley's boosterism was intended in part to renew investors' appetite for the Canadian dollar and stock market, both of which have been slipping in recent months in large part because of investors' worries about trends in the United States.
Though the weak Canadian dollar has eroded consumers' purchasing power somewhat, it has also had a positive effect on the economy, making its all-important exports more competitive overseas.
Economists note that when Canada did not follow the United States into a recession after the Sept. 11 attacks, it was the first time in 25 years that the country had been able to avert being tugged into an American tailspin. Low interest rates, the construction boom, surges in car and truck production and higher prices for the oil and gas that Canada produces have enabled the country to go on thriving, at least so far.
Canadians, economists note, did not invest as heavily in high-technology companies in the 1990's, so the collapse of that sector has not hit the Canadian economy as hard. While American households had 63 percent of their wealth in stocks before the bubble burst, Canadians had just 45 percent, a recent report from Merrill Lynch noted; as a result, "household net worth in Canada is down just 6 percent from the peak, while it has plunged 27 percent Stateside."
The Canadian economy was helped by American growth in the 1990's, but it remains a step or two behind the American business cycle. While the American home-building boom is five years old, for example, Canada's is only a little more than a year old, and probably could run for several more years before saturating the demand.
Still, economists warn that Canada would have a hard time remaining aloof from a long American downturn, because 86 percent of Canadian exports go south of the border.

HEADLINE: Bargaining With Russia 

BYLINE:  By Mark Brzezinski; Mark Brzezinski, a Washington attorney, served as director for Russian and Eurasian affairs on the National Security Council in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
At last week's meeting of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Russian delegation insisted that the terms of reference for arms inspection in Iraq already provide adequate legal basis for access to relevant sites. The Russians believe that negotiation of a new resolution would only delay further the return of the inspectors. They have in private questioned the validity of the Bush administration's assertion that Iraq is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.
 What is driving Russia's actions at the United Nations? Self interest, of course. Iraq owes Russia about $8 billion on loans dating back to the Soviet era; Russia fears the debts will be renounced if there is regime change. Private contracts benefiting Russian oil companies are in place. Under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, Russian contractors have been by far the biggest beneficiaries. Forty percent of Iraqi oil traded under the program is sold via Russian intermediaries. Considering the dismal state of Russia's economy, the $1 billion a year Russia gains from the program is alone an important motivating factor. 
 The Russians also fear regional instability precipitated by regime change. They worry that, after Saddam Hussein, conflict between Arabs and Kurds could destabilize the region. Iraq might break up -- and the Russians have their own reasons to be highly protective of the principle of territorial integrity.
Domestic politics also play a role. Russian hard-liners, including Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the far-right nationalist, have traveled to Baghdad and continue to push for Saddam Hussein's interests in Moscow. President Vladimir V. Putin cannot politically afford to be perceived as doing America's bidding on Iraq, particularly considering lingering Russian resentment against American pre-eminence in global affairs.
But Russian leaders know how badly the Bush administration wants a tough United Nations resolution on Iraq. They know that if they play their cards right, they can extract a high price for what Mr. Bush wants. What might Russia want in exchange for its support, or an agreement not to exercise its its veto power, at the Security Council?
First, Russia wants clear guarantees that its economic interests in Iraq will be protected (this means guarantees on debt payment and giving Russian oil interests a big stake in a post-Hussein Iraq). Second, Russia would love an unfettered right to intervene in Georgia against Chechen rebels. Third, Russia wants normal trade relations with the United States, which would require that the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions be lifted. The administration may indeed try to strike a bargain on the first demand, while the second would be an unwise and dangerous proposition in terms of the larger interests of the international system. The last problem the administration can do only so much about, since it is Congress that must act. The Jackson-Vanik amendment was imposed in 1974 to punish the Soviet Union for not allowing free emigration. President Bush has asked Congress to scrap the law but so far little progress has been made.
As the United States bargains with Russia for its support for tough resolutions, two points should be remembered. First, it is highly unlikely that, in the end, Russia will not stick with us. Three years ago, Russia had the choice of siding with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, or siding with the West. The Russians turned themselves into a key dealmaker, with Prime Minister Viktor D. Chernomyrdin engaging in shuttle diplomacy -- as Germany, Greece and other European countries wavered. Russia decided that its future was in the West. Today, even though the economic stakes are higher, the Russians will likely make a similar determination that a future with us is better than a future with Saddam Hussein. But they will try to extract the maximum price.
Second, if Russia succeeds in extracting a high price, Russian leaders may demand other concessions from the West as we attempt to deal with Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's leaders. It is up to President Bush to convince our international partners not to exploit the war on terrorism but to join us in fighting it.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Calls Banks Healthy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today that despite a sharp climb in business failures and investor losses in recent years, the United States financial system remained in good shape.
 "At commercial banks, troubled loans -- including charge-offs, classified loans and delinquent credits -- have also climbed to quite high levels," Mr. 
Greenspan noted in an address delivered by satellite to the American Bankers Association here. "At the same time, banks in this country remain quite healthy -- with strong profits and rates of return and with capital and reserves not much below recent historical highs," he said. 
 Banks have done a significantly better job at remaining strong during the current business cycle than was the case in the early 1990's, he said, "when so many either failed or had near-death experiences." He said it was important that banks had strong earnings "going into the current period of stress."

Documents Suggest Credit Suisse Linked Banking and Stock Ratings

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Credit Suisse First Boston used its research analysts' rosy stock ratings to attract investment banking fees from companies hoping to raise money from investors, according to documents obtained by securities regulators investigating the firm and its research practices.
 The documents add to evidence that upbeat research reports were a crucial sales tool for Wall Street firms interested in generating lucrative investment banking fees from corporations. The documents, whose details were reported yesterday in The Boston Globe and USA Today, were obtained from regulators investigating Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of the Credit Suisse Group. 
 In a July 1999 proposal to Virata, a software company interested in selling shares to the public, Credit Suisse boasted that it "stands by its clients" and offered as proof a 1998 stock offering by Pilot Network Services. Credit Suisse analysts ranked Pilot's shares a strong buy immediately after the company's initial offering, according to the documents. 
A prime selling point in the proposal, known in Wall Street parlance as a pitch book, was the fact that Credit Suisse continued to recommend Pilot shares aggressively to the public even after the company reported quarterly results that were far below analysts' expectations and its stock had fallen. Other evidence that Credit Suisse stood by its corporate clients was the fact that it kept a strong buy rating on Pilot stock even after the two other firms that had helped Pilot sell shares to the public in 1998 cut their ratings. Credit Suisse also pointed out in the pitch book that it traded more Pilot Network shares after the initial offering than any other brokerage firm.
The pitch book may have won the business for Credit Suisse; the firm helped Virata raise money in two public offerings, one in November 1999 at $14 a share and another in July 2000 at $71 each. Credit Suisse started coverage on the company with a buy rating.
"They are sending an unmistakable message that they are willing to cook the books to make it look like your stock will still do O.K. even if the news justifies something else," said William F. Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, whose office is investigating Credit Suisse. "The message is obvious, and it was not disclosed to consumers. Consumers were not told that Credit Suisse is biased toward its investment banking clients."
Like the stocks of many nascent technology companies, Virata's shares reached a peak in March 2000, of almost $100, but fell when the stock bubble burst. The company was acquired last December by Globespan, a semiconductor maker, for about $6.50 a share in stock. Shares of GlobespanVirata closed yesterday at $1.67.
Mr. Galvin said the pitch book indicated the need to sever completely the research operations of Wall Street firms from their investment banking business. "We need to find a new way to pay for analysts and research activity so that they are truly independent," he said. Mr. Galvin has said that he will submit the evidence compiled by his staff to the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, for his review. 
In a statement, Credit Suisse said: "We welcome the participation by Mr. Galvin in the new coalition of state and federal regulators who are trying to move these issues forward toward constructive resolution to restore investor confidence. We are very confident that after examining the facts, the New York attorney general will determine that a criminal proceeding is not warranted against the firm nor any of its employees."
In dealings with another company, internal Credit Suisse e-mail messages appear to show that the firm withheld analyst coverage on Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry wireless communications devices, until the company paid $1.8 million in fees it owed from a stock offering Credit Suisse helped to sell a few months earlier. 
In an e-mail message dated March 8, 2001, Chris Legg, an investment banker at Credit Suisse, wrote to Frank Quattrone, head of the firm's technology investment banking group, and Marc Cabi, an analyst in the firm's San Francisco office, that Research in Motion had paid what it owed and that coverage of the company should resume. "Now that the fee issue is behind us," Mr. Legg wrote, "I would ask that we return them to 'most favored nation' status." Such a status refers to countries with normal trade relations. 
At the time, Research in Motion shares were trading at about $46. A new analyst began covering Research in Motion the next month, but the stock soon began a swoon from which it never recovered. Shares of Research in Motion closed at $8.42 yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse said that Mr. Cabi and Mr. Legg were no longer employed by the firm. Mr. Quattrone, however, remains a managing director.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Push Bills To Benefit Small Investors 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the House began a push today to help investors by allowing them to write off more of their stock market losses and giving them more flexibility to manage their retirement savings.
 The move reflected growing concern among Republicans that the stock market's steep decline could have political repercussions in the weeks leading up to Election Day, and was part of a broader effort by the party to ensure that it is not judged by voters to be out of touch with economic anxieties even as Washington is focused on a possible confrontation with Iraq. 
 Democrats said the legislation was a belated acknowledgment that the economy had grown worse on President Bush's watch. But they said it was too narrowly focused on investors and left unaddressed the needs of the unemployed and people without health insurance. 
Still, with the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 18 percent over the summer and stock prices falling again today, the plan seemed attractive to enough Democrats that it could pass the House with substantial bipartisan support. The legislation -- actually two bills being considered together -- was taken up tonight by the House Ways and Means Committee and was expected to go to the House floor as soon as Thursday or Friday.
The measure, said Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is the committee's chairman, would help "innocent investors salvage some of their losses," and would "assist workers caught in or headed toward tough times due to the market, especially those who are at or near the age of retirement."
The legislation is unlikely to get anywhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate before Election Day, though its backers said they hoped that a bipartisan vote in the House might force Senate action, especially if the stock market remains weak. 
The Democratic majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, had intended to focus on the economy and corporate malfeasance this fall by bringing up a different bill offering more protection to participants in 401(k) plans. But Mr. Daschle has been unable to do so as the Senate debates legislation creating a homeland security department and a resolution authorizing President Bush to use force against Iraq.
The first of the two bills taken up tonight would raise the maximum deduction for capital losses over and above capital gains to $8,250 from $3,000. It was introduced in April by Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. Mr. Bush floated a similar plan this summer, but never followed up with a legislative proposal.
Economists have been divided over the wisdom of increasing the deductibility of capital losses. Some said it would encourage more investors to realize their losses by selling stock, driving the market down further. Others said it would encourage more investment by providing some assurance that losses could be offset. 
The second bill would seek to help people with their retirement savings, an issue both parties are convinced will be on the minds of many voters. 
The bill would accelerate the current schedule under which the contribution limits for 401(k) and individual retirement accounts would increase. It would set the maximum tax deductible contribution by workers into their 401(k) plans at $15,000 as of next year, instead of gradually increasing it to that level by 2006 from its current level of $11,000.
The bill would raise the contribution limit to individual retirement accounts to $5,000 as of next year, rather than gradually increase the limit from its current level of $3,000 by 2008, as is now called for.
The legislation would also raise, to 75 from 70 1/2, the age at which retirees must begin withdrawing money from their 401(k) and individual retirement accounts. The effect would be to give retirees more control over when they cash in their investments.
The retirement savings provisions were first proposed in a bill introduced last week by Representatives Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. Economists said they would help encourage more saving in the long run, but would be unlikely to have much effect in the short run.
The two bills would reduce federal revenues by $24 billion over the next five years, according to Congress's joint committee on taxation.
Republican leaders in the House decided several weeks ago not to press ahead this year with any big tax plan. They decided last week to move ahead with this smaller package after it became clear that investors had suffered sharp losses over the summer and might be mad about the situation in the elections, Republican aides said.
But the proposal gave Democrats an opportunity to contrast the problems faced by people with money to invest and by those who do not have jobs or health care.
"The Republicans are in the midst of an election year conversion where they finally realize that the bad economy and dramatic decline in pension values matter to voters," Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said today in a statement. "But the political bills they are offering do nothing for most people."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS; 
Arab Leaders Glumly Brace for Inevitable War, With an Eye to Anger in the Streets

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
America's allies in the Arab world are positioning themselves to go along with a United States-led war against Iraq, driven by their need for American strategic and economic assistance, officials and diplomats in the region said. 
 Each country is maneuvering to signal enough acquiescence to allow them to preserve good relations with Washington but at the same time not provoke new levels of anger in the streets, they said. 
 In the important Persian Gulf nations where American forces are based -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- officials acknowledge that their facilities would be used for a war against Iraq.
In recent days, some of those leaders have warned their citizens that the Arab world is too weak to do anything to support the Iraqi people. 
"We must not deceive ourselves or the Iraqis or the Palestinians about the joint Arab capabilities to support them or to defend them," said the king of Bahrain, Sheik Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, whose country is host to the United States Fifth Fleet.
Generally, the leaders have given the cold shoulder to the Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, when he has visited Arab capitals in the past two weeks to rally support. In public and private, the Arab leaders have told him that Iraq must abide by even the most stringent United Nations resolutions on inspections.
The support for the United States is not enthusiastic, and is based on any American military action having the backing of a United Nations resolution. Rivalries among the Arab leaders and the Bush administration goal of removing Saddam Hussein, a fellow leader even if a despised one, will make the kind of Arab unity shown during the Persian Gulf war impossible, officials said. 
But the Arab leaders, who have been visiting one another in the last 10 days to take their temperatures, are making individual calculations about how to handle what they all see as an all but certain conflict, they said. Many leaders are politically weak at home, and count on American strategic and financial help to maintain power.
A senior American diplomat in the region said, "They are figuring out how to give a level of support that doesn't leave them crossway with the United States." The involvement of the United Nations, where a new resolution on Iraq is currently being worked out, brought a "huge sigh of relief" about Washington's plans, the diplomat said. There is more concern about any war's aftermath -- seen as involving either uncontrollable chaos or American dominance of Iraq -- rather than the war itself, the officials said.
Some Arab countries have concluded that the war could be relatively short, and at the very least is unlikely to involve attacks by Iraq with chemical or biological weapons against them. 
In Jordan, the decision to come down on the side of the United States is the most public in the region, and preparations for protecting the national interest in the event of war the most obvious. The borders with the Palestinian territories on the West Bank and with Iraq have been fortified with troops to prevent huge movements of people into Jordan. New government posters in the Jordanian capital, Amman, say "Jordan First," as a way of telling the people that the survival of their country comes before solidarity with the Iraqi people.
"If it comes down to war, we are not going to allow our strategic friendship with the United States to be jeopardized," the foreign minister, Marwan Muasher, told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington two weeks ago.
In return for this pledge, diplomats said, the Bush administration is not asking Jordan for permission to deploy American troops from Jordanian territory, a move that could severely destabilize the position of King Abdullah.
In the largest Arab country, Egypt, where relations with the United States are at a low point and the public mood is sour, officials described President Hosni Mubarak as being in the most difficult situation.
Egypt, with a faltering economy, receives about $2 billion in annual assistance from the United States, far more than any other Arab country. It is second only to Israel as a recipient of American foreign aid.
Mr. Mubarak has repeatedly warned about the chaos that a war against Iraq would unleash. But at the heart of Mr. Mubarak's problem is the antagonism among the Egyptian public toward what is perceived as the Bush administration's unstinting support of Israel and the Egyptian government's failure to influence Washington on the matter, officials said. Those feelings have spilled into anger against an eventual American-led war in Iraq. 
In response to questions about whether Egypt would allow Washington to use its West Cairo airport for the transit of American troops and for refueling of aircraft -- all activities that took place during the 1991 gulf war -- Egyptian officials refused to give a direct answer.
"What the Americans don't understand is -- we can't deviate much from our public opinion," said one of Mr. Mubarak's close aides, suggesting that the use of the facilities for the war was of extreme sensitivity.
The Egyptian facilities would be used as staging points rather than for direct strikes, American officials said. 
"Mubarak would have to be a very courageous man" to allow the use of the bases for Iraq, said Ahmed Abdel Halim, a retired Egyptian Army general.
The chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Egyptian Parliament, Dr. Mustafa al-Feqi, said that if the United Nations Security Council ended up giving its blessing to a war against Iraq, then Egypt could consider the use of its facilities.
"If it's the Security Council, it is negotiable," Mr. Feqi said. "If it's not the Security Council, it is impossible to discuss it."
The Arab countries are maneuvering to go along with the war in part because they have largely concluded they have little sway over Saddam Hussein.
Last month, the foreign minister of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, met with Mr. Hussein in Baghdad, and tried to convince him to go into exile, according to press reports that are given credibility by Arab diplomats.
At that point in the conversation, Mr. Hussein dismissed the foreign minister and had him driven to the airport, the accounts said.
A senior Arab official said Washington had not shared any of its ideas on who might rule Iraq if Mr. Hussein is ousted by force. "Everyone is asking, 'Where is the Karzai for Iraq?' " he said, referring to Hamid Karzai, the American-backed leader of Afghanistan.
"But what is Karzai?" the official said. "He's a U.S. stooge. No one wants a U.S. stooge in the region."

HEADLINE: A Nation Wary of War 

 BODY:
Not quite four decades ago, Lyndon Johnson learned to his and the nation's sorrow that taking a reluctant country to war can severely damage the body politic. President Bush must be mindful of that danger as he draws the United States ever closer to military conflict with Iraq. Americans are worried about Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction, but are also concerned about the anemic state of the nation's economy, and seem uncertain how best to deal with Iraq. A New York Times/CBS News poll published yesterday, and other surveys, support the sense of many around the country that Mr. Bush still has work to do if he hopes to persuade Americans of the need to use military force to disarm Iraq. 
 With Congress heading toward a vote on a war resolution, Mr. Bush marshaled his arguments once again last night. Speaking in Cincinnati, he was forceful in outlining the threat presented by Iraq. He laid out the ways in which the Iraqi dictator has brazenly defied United Nations orders to destroy his unconventional weapons, making Iraq, in the president's view, unique in its ability to threaten the world. He was less convincing in addressing the potentially costly consequences of a war against that country. 
 Thirteen months after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Americans well understand that the United States must counter threats to national security in new, more aggressive ways and that the failures of our intelligence agencies and leaders to protect us must not be repeated. Yet that has not translated into support for an American invasion of Iraq absent the endorsement of the U.N. Security Council. Most Americans fear that such a move could lead to more terror and a wider war in the Middle East.
That is why they favor, as do we, an effort to exhaust all forms of coercive diplomacy, including approval by the Security Council of a tough new resolution, before Mr. Bush brings the nation to the brink of combat.
Given the cautionary mood of the country, it is puzzling that most members of Congress seem fearful of challenging the hawkish approach to Iraq. Many Democrats have somehow convinced themselves that their party will falter in next month's elections if they fail to show sufficient enthusiasm for going to war. Many Americans -- a majority, according to the Times/CBS poll -- say members of the Bush administration are trying to use the Iraq conflict to political advantage. 
Congress is likely to grant the president the power to use force that he seeks. But that does not mean the debate should lack seriousness or tough questioning or that it should amount to a blank check. Mr. Bush himself acknowledged last night that many fair questions had been raised about the need for a military showdown with Iraq. He addressed some of them, but not all his answers were persuasive. 
Referring to the coming war vote in Congress, Mr. Bush said, "Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable." The country should hold him to that.

HEADLINE: Bush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
President Bush took the first step yesterday toward seeking an injunction that would end the shutdown of 29 West Coast ports, acting just hours after negotiations between port operators and the longshoremen's union had broken off. 
 With many businesses urging the president to get the ports reopened, the White House created a three-member board of inquiry that is to report to him today about the economic damage resulting from the shutdown. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, appointment of the board was required before the administration could ask a federal court for the injunction, which would mandate an 80-day cooling-off period. 
 A request for such an injunction, which the courts have almost routinely granted in the past, could have political repercussions for Mr. Bush. Labor unions vigorously oppose the idea, and so an injunction could invigorate organized labor, an important Democratic constituency, right before November's elections. But business leaders have warned that unless the president moves, economic damage to the nation could snowball, hurting the Republicans' chances. 
If Mr. Bush goes to the courts, he will be the first president in a quarter-century to seek a cooling-off period under Taft-Hartley, which covers industries other than railroads and the airlines. 
"The country has been patient," Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said at a news conference in Washington. "We have been patient. But now ordinary Americans are being seriously harmed by this dispute. Factory workers are being laid off because they can't get vital parts delivered. These layoffs will only increase if the ports do not reopen this week."
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the president had not yet decided whether to seek the injunction, but several industry officials said they expected him to do so this week. 
The ports that have been closed, by a lockout in California, Oregon and Washington State, handle $300 billion in cargo a year, about half the nation's annual imports and exports. In recent days, manufacturers, retailers and farmers have increasingly called for a cooling-off period, warning that the shutdown has caused factories to close and produce to rot.
In addition, administration officials say they fear that the shutdown could hinder the deployment of American troops, because commercial shipping lines are used to send military supplies overseas.
Leaders of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the Teamsters and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have denounced the idea of a cooling-off period, saying it would amount to unwarranted governmental meddling in negotiations and throw the administration's weight behind management.
"If every employer thinks the federal government will step in, why should the employers even negotiate?" Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, said yesterday. "The administration's move today is nothing short of an attack on American workers."
The Pacific Maritime Association, a group of port operators and shipping lines, closed the ports on Sept. 29, indefinitely locking out the West Coast's 10,500 longshoremen and saying the move was in response to a job slowdown. Union officials said the longshoremen were working more slowly because of safety concerns.
The board of inquiry created yesterday is headed by former Senator William E. Brock of Tennessee, a Republican who was labor secretary in the Reagan administration. The other members are Patrick Hardin, a University of Tennessee law professor and former official of the National Labor Relations Board, and Dennis Nolan, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who is vice president of the National Academy of Arbitrators.
Once the board reports back to the president, he can direct the attorney general to seek the court injunction. Taft-Hartley requires the administration to convince the court that "the national health or safety" is being imperiled. Since the law was adopted in 1947, administrations have sought such injunctions 31 times, and the courts have granted them 29 times.
The major issue in the current dispute is management's demand to introduce new technologies to speed cargo handling. The longshoremen say they will not accept the new technology unless their union is granted jurisdiction over all new jobs resulting from it.
Negotiations broke down early yesterday in San Francisco, and each side blamed the other. Management said the union had turned down its offer for a 90-day contract extension, while the union said the employers had rejected its offer for a seven-day extension.

Transcript: Confronting Iraq Threat 'Is Crucial to Winning War on Terror'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's speech last night about the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times:
 Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions, its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. 
 Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. 
The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On Sept. 11, 2001, America felt its vulnerability even to threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then and we are resolved today to confront every threat from any source that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America.
Members of Congress of both political parties and members of the United Nations Security Council agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons.
Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is how best can we achieve it. Many Americans have raised legitimate questions about the nature of the threat, about the urgency of action. Why be concerned now? About the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And tonight I want to share those discussions with you.
First, I'm asked why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. The same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States.
By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, the fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime itself. Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction.
Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today, and we do, does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?
In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for and is capable of killing millions.
We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He's ordered chemical attacks on Iran and on more than 40 villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of Sept. 11.
And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Yet Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions, U.N. demands and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles, far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey and other nations in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work.
We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these U.A.V.'s for missions targeting the United States.
And of course, sophisticated delivery systems are required for a chemical or biological attack. All that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. 
And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy: the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some Al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior Al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after Sept. 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America.
Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliances with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.
Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror.
When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction, and he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them or provide them to a terror network. Terrorist cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both and the United States military is capable of confronting both.
Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we don't know exactly and that's the problem. Before the Gulf War the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was 8 to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer. The regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. 
Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that, despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.
The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his nuclear mujahedeen, his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of his nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted the purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.
If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America and Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists.
Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now. And there's a reason. We have experienced the horror of Sept. 11. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact they would be eager, to use biological or chemical or a nuclear weapons. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.
As President Kennedy said in October of 1962: Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world, he said, where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril.
Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and the deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring.
Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.
The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. 
Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass 12 square miles with hundreds of structures both above and below the ground where sensitive materials could be hidden.
The world has also tried economic sanctions, and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people.
The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, only to see them openly rebuilt while the regime again denies they even exist.
The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people, and in the last year alone the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750 times.
After 11 years during which we've tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.
Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough immediate requirements. 
Among those requirements, the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy under U.N. supervision all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country. And these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site at any time without preclearance, without delay, without exceptions.
The time for denying, deceiving and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein must disarm himself or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.
Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that's why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council seriously. And these resolutions are very clear. 
In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program. It must release or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American pilot whose fate is still unknown.
By taking these steps and only by taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. These steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that's why two administrations, mine and President Clinton's, have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great danger to our nation. 
I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side and we will prevail.
There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait, and that's an option. In my view it's the riskiest of all options because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become.
We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I'm convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As Americans we want peace, we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator.
I'm not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam Hussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time. And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear. That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This nation in world war and in cold war has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom and help others to find freedom of their own.
Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse for world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. 
The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control within his own cabinet, within his own army and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured.
America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery, prosperity to squalor, self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women and children. The oppression of Kurds, of Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will be lifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end and an era of new hope will begin. 
Iraq is a land rich in culture and resources and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors.
Later this week the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands.
Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations and all nations that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something.
Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq that his only chance -- his only choice -- is full compliance. And the time remaining for that choice is limited.
Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I'm confident they will fully consider the facts and their duties.
The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of Al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined and whose consequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice, and there is no refuge from our responsibilities. 
We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve we will give strength to others. By our courage we will give hope to others. And by our actions we will secure the peace and lead the world to a better day. May God bless America.

Stern Tones, Direct Appeal

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
In stern but subdued tones, President Bush declared tonight that war with Iraq was neither desirable nor inevitable. Yet he left no doubt that if Saddam Hussein did not disarm, the United States would strike against him.
 The long list of demands that the president laid out in a purposeful speech set a very tough standard for avoiding war. Mr. Bush acknowledged that meeting such demands would "change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself." 
 Appealing directly to the American public, the one audience above all whose support he must keep to succeed if war comes, Mr. Bush said that only by complying with a raft of United Nations resolutions on disarmament, terrorism, the persecution of civilians and other measures flowing from the 1991 truce in the Persian Gulf war can Iraq avoid a resumption of hostilities. 
A year to the day after the start of the military campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban and weeks before the midterm elections, Mr. Bush also appealed to Congress, where he wants an overwhelming vote authorizing force in Iraq, and to the United Nations, which he hopes will offer at least nominal backing.
But the president's paramount focus this evening was the people, and he spoke not from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue but from Ohio, a swing state vital to his own electoral prospects two years from now. There he addressed civic groups in a campaign-style setting, using simple metaphors and concrete examples in a fatherly reminder of a president's ability to rise above elite diplomatic debates -- and of the people's final judgment of a president's fate.
"There is no easy or risk-free course of action," Mr. Bush told an invited audience in a Cincinnati musuem that sometimes interrupted his methodical brief with strong applause. "Some have argued we should wait -- and that is an option. In my view, it is the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam Hussein does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I am convinced that is a hope against all evidence."
Mr. Bush did not so much offer up new evidence against Iraq as weave together known facts in a new and plain-spoken effort to persuade the public that, as he put it, "Iraq is unique." He cited satellite photographs and testimony from defectors to portray Mr. Hussein as a "student of Stalin," a torturer of women and children and, in the words of a former United Nations weapons inspector, "a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."
Mr. Bush cast the threat in unadorned language, arguing that if the "Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year." 
He sketched the promise of a post-Saddam Iraq by invoking this nation's founding creed "that all people are entitled to hope and human rights -- to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity."
Achieving all that, and maintaining public support if the going gets tough, is a huge and subtle challenge, one that is just beginning. Polls show strong public support for the president and for military action against Saddam Hussein. But they also find that there is deep patience to let other options play out and broad concern that Mr. Bush -- and local candidates -- should pay more attention to the economy.
"I travel a lot, and the word out there is 'ambivalence,' " former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, a Republican, said of the public's views on Iraq. "It's not hostility. It's not 'What is this crazy cowboy up to?' That may be the shrieking cry of the left, but it's not what the people are thinking. Democrats and Republicans alike are saying, 'If we have to pack Saddam's lunch, we want to know it's on the up and up, and we want to weigh in.' " 
Much of the public is still grappling to come to terms with the Iraq question, which has dominated discussion in Washington for weeks, if not months. Presidential aides said that Mr. Bush chose to deliver the speech outside of Washington because his intention was to summarize his existing arguments, not create expectations of a declaration of war. He did not ask to pre-empt regular programming, and only one of the four broadcast networks, Fox, carried his speech live.
"For better or worse, Bush has changed the whole discussion," said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. "The agenda just months ago was, of course, something so different. It was corporate corruption, economic slowdown, and now all of a sudden, it's all Iraq all the time."
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush has already guaranteed bipartisan support for action against Iraq. Tonight, his goal was to run up the score when the voting begins this week. 
But a handful of cautionary voices in Congress warned that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq would be outside the American tradition. In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, urged Mr. Bush to exercise the same restraint that President John F. Kennedy did in blockading, but not attacking, Cuba during the missile crisis 40 Octobers ago.
At the United Nations, such sentiment is widespread and accentuated by the eagerness of Mr. Bush's most hawkish aides to suggest the futility of further weapons inspections in Iraq -- and by some of Mr. Bush's own hotter past oratory.
So tonight, Mr. Bush took some care to emphasize that passage of the Congressional resolution authorizing force "does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable." Instead, he invoked the spirit of John Kennedy's resolve in the missile crisis, when the young president warned that "we no longer live in a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril."

Bush Takes Steps to End Lockout at Western Ports
President Bush has taken the first steps toward reopening West Coast ports, creating a board of inquiry that will report on the economic damage resulting from the shutdown. The move came after negotiations broke off between dockworkers and terminal operators.
 A federal mediator said it was likely that Mr. Bush would reopen the ports by ordering an 80-day cooling-off period, a move that could have political repercussions right before November's elections. Page A20.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From Debate on Senate Floor on Use of Force Against Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate yesterday on the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. The speakers included Senators Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania; Max Cleland, Democrat of Georgia; Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska.

Senator Specter
 I discount the argument of those who say that regime change of Saddam Hussein is motivated by the failure to finish the job in 1991 or Saddam's efforts to assassinate President Bush the elder. While it is true that Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Powell were principal participants, as secretary of defense and as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the decision not to march to Baghdad in 1991, their experience benefits the United States in this current situation. 
 I further discount the argument that President George W. Bush seeks to correct any mistakes of his father or that it is a personal matter, as some have argued, from his comment that the guy tried to kill my dad. I'm not unaware of the psychologists' contentions that motives are frequently mixed and hard to sort out. But I do think our nation is fortunate to have the leadership of President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Secretary Powell at this perilous time.
I've been briefed by administration officials on a number of occasions and I am looking forward to another briefing tomorrow by national security counselor Condoleezza Rice and C.I.A. Director George Tenet. There is substantial information about the weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein has available, but I am interested in knowing with greater precision, to the extent that the administration can release it, the situation with Saddam's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
In evaluating the time when pre-emptive action may be used, Secretary of State Daniel Webster, in dealing with the so-called Caroline Incident in 1837 when British troops attacked and sank an American ship, the then Secretary of State Webster made a point that an intrusion into the territory of another state can be justified as an act of self-defense only in those "cases in which the necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming and leaves no choice of means and no moment of deliberation." It is very relevant on an evaluation of meeting that goal as to just where Iraq stands on the weapons of mass destruction. 
In previous briefings I have sought the administration plan as to what will be done after Saddam Hussein is toppled. And I think that is an area where a great deal more thought needs to be given. The situation in Iraq will obviously be contentious, with disputes between the Sunnis and the Shiites, with the interest of the Kurds in an independent state, and it means a very long term commitment by the United States. We know the problems we have in Afghanistan. There will be resources that Iraq has to defray some of the costs, but what happens after Saddam Hussein is toppled has yet to be answered in real detail. 
On the issue of a battle plan, perhaps that is too much for the administration to say and tell the Congress, but as a senator representing 12 million Pennsylvanians and as a United States senator with a country of 280 million Americans, I think that we ought to have some idea as to how we're going to proceed and what the casualties may be. 
All of this is to say, Madame President, that there are many questions and many issues to be considered. The predictions are numerous that the Congress of the United States will pass a resolution authorizing the use of force by an overwhelming majority. And I'm not prepared to disagree with that. And on a proper showing of the imminence of problems with Saddam Hussein and on a proper showing that this is the last recourse, my vote may well be cast with the administration as well. 
But I'm interested in hearing debate on the floor of the United States Senate as to the relative merits of requiring U.N. multilateral action as a condition for the use of force contrasted with United States unilateral action. If we require U.N. multilateral action, we do put ourselves subject to the veto of France, China and Russia, which is undesirable. And if we authorize the use of force unilaterally by the president, then we may well be setting a precedent which could come back to haunt us with nations like China going after Taiwan or a nation like India or Pakistan going after the other. 

Senator Cleland
What about the cost for our economy? The mere threat of war has sent all prices upward and caused shudders on Wall Street. What will a full-blown war do? 
Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed? And after the intervention, how will the situation likely evolve? And what will the consequences be? These two are closely related, that in my view the long-term consequences have been the least discussed part of the equation thus far.
If, as some believe, the consequence of a U.S. invasion of Iraq will be a united, democratic Iraq which can serve as a "role model for the rest of the Arab world," maybe so. Maybe. But such an outcome would not only fly in the face of Iraq's entire history since being created out of a British mandate at the end of the First World War, but would appear to be contrary to much of what we've seen in the aftermath of other recent U.S. interventions, including most recently in Afghanistan. 
Perhaps most importantly, we need to make absolutely certain that whatever we do in Iraq does not, and underscore that, does not distract or detract from the war we authorized 12 months ago, the war on terrorism, against Osama bin Laden and his terrorist cadre, which remains, in my view, Madame President, job No. 1, mission No. 1, objective No. 1 for our national security. . . . 
And I believe most senators share the views that diplomacy is far and away preferential to the use of force. And that proceeding with the input and support of the entire international community, including the United Nations, is far better and more effective than going it alone.
I'll be supporting the resolution backed by the president and opposing the alternatives because I believe it's imperative that we now speak with one voice to Saddam Hussein, to the entire international community and, most importantly, to our servicemen and women. A strong bipartisan vote for the pending resolution will strengthen the president's hand in his efforts to get the international community to step up to the plate and deal effectively with the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and give the diplomats one last chance to secure Saddam Hussein's final unconditional surrender of those weapons as he pledged in 1991.
The objective of our policy against Saddam Hussein should be a regime of unfettered inspections leading to full disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. If diplomacy fails, the military objective must be the complete destruction of such weapons. Regime change may come because of the large cost and massive uncertainties this will inevitably produce, though, Madame President, this should be the last resort, not the first resort. 
We must not repeat the most disturbing display of partisanship with respect to national security to have occurred in the time I've served in the Congress. I'm referring to the extremely disturbing spectacle of disunity and irresolution displayed by the House of Representatives on April 28, 1999, when, with American servicemen and women already in combat against Milosevic and Serbia, the House cast a series of votes that, one, prohibited the deployment of ground forces, which the president had never asked for; two, defeated an attempt to remove U.S. forces; and three, most dismaying of all, on a tie vote of 213-213 defeated the Senate-passed resolution authorizing the very air operations and missile strikes which were then under way. What kind of message was that to send to our armed forces personnel or our NATO allies or Milosevic?
I implore the Senate to pull together behind the one resolution endorsed by the president, by the bipartisan House leadership and by a bipartisan group of senators. That resolution affirms the importance of working in concert with other nations, gives preference to a diplomatic over military solution, focuses attention where it should be -- on disarming Saddam Hussein -- seeks to ensure that we not be diverted from fighting the war on terrorism, and provides for the ongoing and constitutional role of the Congress as events unfold in our policy toward Iraq. I urge a strong and bipartisan vote in favor of the resolution.

Senator Stevens
Madame President, there are few of us still around who lived through the events which led to World War II. I was in high school in California, as a matter of fact, and I studied Hitler's actions month after month in a history class. I vividly remember watching the world appease Hitler while he pursued an aggressive military policy aimed at dominating the world. 
The current situation reminds me of the agreements we studied in high school which were made after World War I. Hitler just waved them away. When Hitler flouted the terms of the Versailles peace treaty, France and Britain did nothing to enforce it. When Hitler occupied the Rhineland and the Anschluss in Austria, no nation tried to stop him. Instead, the world repeatedly gave in to an obnoxious, aggressive leader to avoid war. 
When I was a senior in high school, many of my friends left school to go to enlist. I left Oregon State College in December of 1942. Only seven of us in the Senate today served during World War II. But as one who fought in China, which I call the forgotten war, I see the next Hitler in Saddam Hussein. 

Senator Nelson
President Bush and his advisers have determined that Saddam Hussein's quest for weapons of mass destruction must end now. The president said in a speech before the U.N. that Saddam poses an immediate, unchecked threat to our nation and our allies and unless we act now his arsenal will only grow. 
Any resolution on action involving Iraq that the United States Congress would approve must focus on the imperative of disarmament of Iraq. By disarming Saddam and removing the nuclear, biological and chemical capability, he will pose little or no threat -- no strategic threat at least -- to the United States or to our allies. Saddam would be contained. 
If, in order to disarm Iraq, we need to use military force that results in the removal of the current regime, then we should do so. Saddam Hussein must know that the United States will support President Bush's use of force to remove him if he does not comply with orders to disarm and destroy all weapons of mass destruction. 
The president has suggested that regime change may be the only way that Iraq will comply with 16 existing U.N. resolutions. However, a resolution whose primary focus is regime change does not address the fact that the next regime in Iraq, even if it is more friendly to the United States, would inherit all weapons systems and programs that the United States did not destroy.
Additionally, if we pursue regime change as an objective, we'll severely limit our ability to form a multinational coalition of support as President Bush's father did so successfully during the gulf war. 
Our allies, worldwide, have expressed support for disarming Saddam but little enthusiasm for regime change. 
Alone among President Bush's advisers, Secretary of State Colin Powell has suggested that putting weapons inspectors back in and making sure they can do their job is the proper avenue to pursue. The heart of this resolution should outline precisely what access weapons inspectors should be afforded as they inspect the Iraqi military capabilities. It should demand complete transparency of Saddam's military inventory and unrestricted and unfettered access to all of Iraq by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the presidential palaces. 
In concert with a focus on disarmament, a Congressional resolution should also strongly urge the president to exhaust all diplomatic efforts within and outside the United Nations. Total disarmament of Iraq should be a multinational effort. 
Nevertheless, we must reserve the right, and give the president the authority, to act unilaterally provided the presence of an immediate and grave threat to the United States. This Congressional resolution should not give the president an immediate and unconditional pass to wage war but should place an emphasis on his diplomatic effort to resolve the issue of disarmament without the loss of life. 
If Saddam's defiance leads to war, we must also focus on what we will need to do to accomplish, after the war, in order to ensure the stability of the region. More thought must be given to the effort that will be required to maintain peace and provide for the Iraqi people in the event that Saddam fails to resolve this issue peacefully. We seek no quarrel with the people of Iraq and the international community must be prepared to assist them.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; 
Bush Sees 'Urgent Duty' to Pre-empt Attack by Iraq

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush declared tonight that Saddam Hussein could attack the United States or its allies "on any given day" with chemical or biological weapons. In a forceful argument for disarming Iraq or going to war with that country, he argued that "we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring."
 Mr. Bush, in a half-hour indictment of Mr. Hussein delivered before an audience of 400 here and millions around the country and the world, insisted that leading a campaign to disarm the Iraqi leader would not detract from the war against terrorism. "To the contrary," he said, "confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror." Transcript, Page A12. 
 The president likened the threat the country faces today from Iraq to the Cuban missile crisis, which unfolded exactly 40 years ago this month. The comparison was intended, his aides acknowledged, to give the confrontation a sense of urgency and to explain why the United States could wait only weeks or months to disarm the Iraqi leader. 
Building his case, the president charged for the first time that Iraq's fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles was ultimately intended to deliver chemical and biological weapons to cities in the United States. The president also built a lengthy, if circumstantial, case that Mr. Hussein had extensive ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist organization and that Iraq trained members of the terrorist group in "bomb-making, poisons and deadly gases." Although other members of his administration had cited evidence tying Al Qaeda to Iraq, Mr. Bush spoke about this in detail for the first time tonight.
He called Mr. Hussein a dictator, "a student of Stalin" and a murderer, and most important described no solution other than Mr. Hussein's permanent removal from office that would end the confrontation.
"I hope that this will not require military action, but it may," he said, warning America that Mr. Hussein could attempt "cruel and desperate measures" in response. He warned Iraq's generals to ignore any orders to use weapons of mass destruction or be treated as war criminals.
Mr. Bush did not declare war tonight, but he was clearly preparing the country for the likelihood that war would be the only course left if Iraq refused to disarm. He insisted that doing nothing "is the riskiest of all options," and quoted John F. Kennedy's words during the missile crisis at length to underscore his point that it would be foolish to wait for a determined American enemy to strike first.
"Facing clear evidence or peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud." He continued, "Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring."
Tonight, after Mr. Bush spoke, the White House released spy satellite photographs showing how extensively a crucial Iraqi nuclear facility had been rebuilt since the United States bombed it in 1998. The pictures were reminiscent of President Kennedy's decision to show photographs of Soviet missiles in Cuba, though Mr. Bush's pictures revealed only buildings, not weapons.
The White House carefully chose the site of tonight's speech: the restored Union Terminal here. The hall was filled with a cheering crowd that interrupted Mr. Bush twice, and the president described the decisions ahead in the stark terms of the terminal's heyday in World War II.
While the arguments he offered tonight were largely familiar, he gathered those arguments into one speech, seeking to answer those who argue that the threat is not that urgent and that a war now will destabilize the Middle East and distract from the war on terrorism. Methodically, he rejected those contentions. But the heart of his argument was that "the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place."
He spoke at a critical moment in the national debate over Iraq, just as Congress is poised to vote this week on a resolution authorizing military action, and as the United Nations Security Council is entering the final throes of an intense internal struggle over how to confront Baghdad. Once again Mr. Bush described this as a struggle for the true identity of the United Nations, and made it clear that if it failed to disarm Iraq, he would, with the help of a coalition of nations that he never named.
Mr. Bush said, as he has often in recent times, that his argument is with Mr. Hussein and his supporters, but not with the Iraqi people. "America is a friend to the people of Iraq," he said. "Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us." He drew a picture of a free Iraq, in which "the oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shiites Sunnis and others will be lifted."
He never described how long the United States would be willing to occupy Iraq or hold together a country that has long been divided by rival tribes and rival religions, and where the riches will go to those who sit atop Iraq's oilfields. But he spoke of maintaining a "unified Iraq," and said "if military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty."
In what appeared to be an effort to end the debate over the administration's real goals of disarming Iraq or removing Mr. Hussein from power, Mr. Bush said one could not come without the other. And he answered critics who believe, he said, that removing Mr. Hussein could "make the situation worse."
"The situation could hardly get worse," he said simply.
In some respects, the speech was notable for what it did not say. There was no warning to Israel to stay out of the conflict with Iraq, even if it is attacked. There was no explanation of why Mr. Hussein has not used his biological and chemical weapons against the United States or its allies, even though it has possessed them for years. There were no comparisons to the other nations Mr. Bush has called members of an "axis of evil," North Korea and Iran, both of which are believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons programs.
He also added a new demand to Iraq, one he never mentioned in his speech to the United Nations on Sept. 12. In addition to inspections and disarmament, he said, Mr. Hussein must allow "witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside of the country," and to take their families with them, so that Mr. Hussein cannot hold them hostage.
He argued that it was impossible to know with any certainty how close Mr. Hussein was to developing a nuclear weapon. But it did not matter, he said, because American intelligence shows that Mr. Hussein is reconstituting his nuclear weapons program with "a group he calls his nuclear mujahideen, his nuclear holy warriors." He said that a softball-sized amount of fissile material would be sufficient to make Iraq a nuclear power in less than a year, and "if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed."
Mr. Bush's speech caps a week-long effort to sell his case against Saddam Hussein. His first audience, Congress, requires the least persuasion. Both houses of Congress are expected to give the president discretion to attack Iraq when they vote, probably by the end of the week.
Over the weekend, even the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, an early skeptic of granting Mr. Bush so much latitude to decide when and how to commit the military, conceded that Mr. Bush would get the broad authority he has sought.
Just a month ago, it seemed highly doubtful Mr. Bush would get that kind of backing. In August the critics of committing the military to disarming and dislodging Mr. Hussein seemed to dominate the debate, led by prominent Republicans and generals who conducted the war in the Persian Gulf. But starting with his speech to the United Nations on Sept. 12, Mr. Bush began to win converts, and the White House quite skillfully used a 1998 Congressional vote calling for regime change in Iraq to make the case that Mr. Hussein has only grown more threatening.
"The strategy," one White House official said in recent days, "is to use the Congress as leverage, leverage to bring around the public, and leverage to make it clear to the U.N. that it's not only George Bush who is prepared to draw a line in the sand, it's the whole country."
His second audience, the American public, has been more problematic. A New York Times/CBS News poll published today showed strong support for confronting Iraq. But Americans indicated that they wanted allies and wanted the United Nations inspection process to proceed before military action was taken.

Unexpected Outcomes Creating More Interest

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Years ago, when revenue sharing was only a dream of the poorer teams, one of them being Calvin Griffith's Minnesota Twins, George Steinbrenner had a favorite line when anyone asked him about the topic.
 "If Calvin Griffith lets me help him run his team," Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, would say, "I'll share my revenue with him." 
 Griffith never did ask Steinbrenner to help him, and neither has Carl Pohlad, who bought the Twins from Griffith. But the Twins are getting some of Steinbrenner's money. So are the Anaheim Angels. 
In 1993, when the owners met in Kohler, Wis., to discuss revenue sharing seriously for the first time, Jackie Autry, the wife of Gene, then the owner of the Angels, puzzled onlookers by participating in the caucus of small-market teams. The Angels a small-market team?
More correctly, it was a caucus of low-revenue teams, and the Angels had been operated into low-revenue status. Under the new labor agreement, based on last year's local revenue, the Yankees will contribute $45.5 million to baseball's welfare plan next season. The Twins will receive $23 million, second most among subsidized teams, the Angels $13 million. 
The Twins and the Angels begin play tonight in the American League Championship Series. The Yankees have dispersed for the year. The teams that will play in the National League Championship Series beginning tomorrow night, St. Louis and San Francisco, live on the wealthier side. They are givers, not takers. 
But rich or poor, the teams that remain in the running for the World Series are happy to be here. 
The Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks are unhappy because they had looked forward to a return trip to the World Series, with or without each other. The Oakland Athletics may be even more unhappy.
For two years in a row, the Athletics made the playoffs and had the misfortune of playing the Yankees in the first round. They lost both times in five games. 
The Athletics made the playoffs again this year, but this time they didn't have to play the Yankees. The Angels had to play the Yankees. The Athletics got to play the Minnesota Twins. But the Twins beat the A's, and the Angels beat the team the A's couldn't beat the previous two years.
By knocking off the A's, the Twins undercut the prevailing view that the West is the American League's dominant division, a view that the Angels helped strengthen. And a victory over the Angels would make the Twins a double-edged sword for the National League winner to contend with. 
The N.L.C.S. had to wait until last night to learn the identity of the Cardinals' opponent. President Bush's nationwide address on Iraq made the wait a little longer because the start of the game was delayed to make room for the president's remarks.
The Cardinals identified themselves as one team by completing a sweep of Arizona on Saturday night. They needed to know if they would be playing the Atlanta Braves or the Giants to know whether they would start the series in Atlanta or at home. They had to wait until after midnight Eastern time, but they learned they didn't have to fly to Atlanta today.
The prolonged Braves-Giants series gave the Cardinals one advantage. The Cardinals' pitchers will be well rested for the coming series. The Giants will have to shuffle their rotation.
These playoffs have certainly been played in an aura of uncertainty. The Yankees and the Athletics had been considered unbeatable, and the Diamondbacks, though hampered by the loss to injury of Luis Gonzalez and Craig Counsell, had been expected to beat the Cardinals behind Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling.
"It's been a remarkable week," Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday. Perhaps part of their remarkable nature is that in the three series that were decided before last night, the team with the lower payroll won.
The unexpected outcomes have created greater interest in the playoffs, at least initially, and have perhaps helped support Selig's desire.
"I want to get the focus back on the field," Selig said.
The focus tonight will be on what the Twins and the Angels do on the field, but their appearance for the next four to seven games will only create more talk about their economic status. Selig's presence at one of the games in Minnesota will evoke comments about contraction.
Besides being unlikely survivors, the Twins and the Angels have something in common besides their presence in the championship series.
Both are for sale, and a Birmingham, Ala., businessman, Donald Watkins, has explored buying each one -- first the Twins, then the Angels. If Watkins were to buy one of the teams, he would become the first black principal owner, but developments indicate that no transaction will be forthcoming.
Watkins, who was very visible when he launched his pursuit last winter, has not been heard from in months. He has not returned calls in recent months -- including one yesterday -- seeking comment on the status of his interest. His secretary said yesterday that he was traveling.
Failing to find a buyer for the Twins, Pohlad had continued to hope for contraction until the new labor agreement ruled it out for the next four seasons. 
Meanwhile, the Twins will face the Angels in what could be called the Competitive Balance Bowl.

Cantonese Old-Timer Changes Boroughs, Not Bean Sauce

BYLINE:  By Sam Sifton

 BODY:
FOR 30 years or more, Sun Lok Kee sat at the bottom of Mott Street, near the Bowery, serving fine and inexpensive Cantonese meals late into the night. For at least the last 15 of those years, the restaurant was no more than a squalid, fluorescent-lighted hole, with worn linoleum and surfaces stained to the color of sesame oil, nicotine or Scotch.
 But the black-bean sauce was forever superb, the fried spring chicken exquisite and the flounder prepared as if screaming French perfectionists were at work in the kitchen. Always. You could have had that same flounder at 2 in the afternoon or while watching the night sky of Manhattan turn into a twitchy dawn. 
 But fire destroyed Sun Lok Kee early this summer, its ashes falling on a neighborhood hard hit by the attacks on the World Trade Center and the sluggish economy. In the aftermath, some in the downtown restaurant game said that Sun Lok Kee would not reopen.
But as Chinatown in Manhattan struggles, the one in Flushing, Queens, continues its rise. And less than two weeks ago, a new Sun Lok Kee, called New Lok Kee, opened on Main Street there, a short walk from the last stop on the No. 7 train. Its menu is the same (down to the Mott Street address on the cover), and so, it seems, is the kitchen staff. The waiters, to a man, are old, familiar faces. Only the dining room, now a clean and open space decorated with mirrors, orchids and fish tanks, is truly new.
Appetizer, entree, dessert? Just order a mess of food and then, if hungry, some more. Clams with black-bean sauce ($8.95) is a good place to start, a dozen or so hard shells dripping with the thick, salty, fermented excellence that is a proper black-bean sauce cooked in an extremely hot wok. Others may prefer the same sauce poured over meaty and flavorful razor clams ($11.95) or atop tiny periwinkle snails ($7.95), served with toothpicks for prying the chewy bits of meat from the shells.
An order of crabs in the Cantonese style ($8.95) is also an excellent getting-to-know-you beginner, the split carcasses and claws served amid flashes of scrambled egg and bits of ground pork, with a salty dipping rub on the side. Or butterflied, flash-fried salt-and-pepper shrimp ($11.95) that speaks to a sure hand at the restaurant's deepest wok, with its delicate, crunchy batter atop sweet and greaseless flesh.
Pan-fried flounder ($14.95), served on the bone in a terrifically delicate sauce that's most redolent of ginger and garlic, is the Cantonese equivalent of sole a la meuniere and a real showstopper. Off the bone, that same fresh fish shows up in a dish called lun lee kow ($12.95), in which the fish is gently fried and served with Chinese okra in a soft white sauce.
The food comes fast and furious now: try a delicious fried duck under a coating of chopped almonds called wor shu opp ($6.95). Or a plate of pork chops in the Peking style ($7.50), pan-fried with an almost effervescent batter of flour, corn starch and baking soda and served under a tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. There's a Hong Kong specialty of crispy-fried scallops with mayonnaise sauce and sweet candied walnuts ($12.95) that's worth braving despite any hesitation at the description. It pairs well with a fried half spring chicken ($7.95), served with lemons and salt-and-pepper dip. And with a fabulous casserole of white eel flavored with pork belly ($16.95) that's not on the menu but is readily available all the same.
Meanwhile, don't forget your vegetables: a glorious mound of flowering chives ($9.95) bright with garlic and ginger, or a heap of steamed baby bok choy ($6.95). Does a huge tangle of lo mein ($3.50) with ginger and scallions count? Let's hope so.
New Lok Kee is a triumphant return to form for a fixture of old New York. It will take some time to acquire the sticky patina of history that marked its Mott Street home. In the meantime, its tradition of informal excellence is cooked into every meal.

New Lok Kee

HEADLINE: Ottawa to Ease Effect of U.S. Lumber Tariff 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Canada announced an aid package today valued at 247 million Canadian dollars ($155 million) to help part of the nation's lumber industry and small sawmill communities overcome the effect of punitive duties on Canadian lumber that the United States imposed in May.
 The measures -- which affect softwood lumber and include incentives for early retirement, retraining and job sharing -- produced a mixed response from employers and unions, with some calling for more generous assistance. 
 But others voiced concern that the package amounted to yet another round in a cycle of government intervention on both sides of the border that has worsened a slump in the North American lumber market by allowing inefficient mills to remain in business, and even increase production. 
Sam Magid, an analyst at Salman Partners in Vancouver, said the American duties, totaling 27.9 percent, had "done the exact opposite of what they were intended to do."
The Bush administration imposed the tariffs mainly to offset the benefits of what it says are subsidies to Canadian sawmills, in the form of low "stumpage" fees paid to cut down trees in government-owned forests. Part of the tariffs are in the form of an anti-dumping duty to counter artificially low export prices.
Mr. Magid said the duties encouraged Canadian lumber producers to lower their costs to maintain their competitiveness in the United States.
Canadian softwood lumber -- mostly spruce, pine and fir, and used mainly in housing -- accounts for roughly a third of the United States market. Exports to the United States are valued around $6 billion a year.
In spite of strong home construction, the price of basic-grade two-by-four lumber has dropped to about $195 per 1,000 board feet from $253 when the duties were first imposed.
Jeff Redd, of Random Lengths, a trade publication in Eugene, Ore., said supplies from mills in the United States, Canada and overseas had all increased. Some Canadian mills, Mr. Redd said, have instituted a third daily shift as a way of lowering unit, and ultimately overall costs, and thus avoiding accusations that they are dumping in the United States.
The Canadian government in Ottawa has challenged the duties at the World Trade Organization and through the North American Free Trade Agreement.
While both sides have said they would prefer a negotiated solution, progress has been slow. A spokesman for the United States trade representative said today that "we are continuing to have consultations with the federal government in Canada and the provinces on various reform programs and on ideas that some provinces are considering."
In announcing the aid package today -- the precise figure is 246.5 million Canadian dollars -- the natural resources minister, Herb Dhaliwal, said "we have to make sure that the industry remains viable while we press our case against the United States."
As part of the package, the government will set up an adjustment fund to help lumber communities diversify their economies, and will expand a publicity and lobbying effort in the United States. 
The Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers union of Canada estimated that about 6,000 industry jobs had been lost so far this year. David Haggard, the union's president, said the government should be trying to preserve lumber industry jobs, rather than encouraging workers to leave the sector.
The aid package does not include government loan guarantees, something that had been proposed by some financially troubled companies to help them pay the American duties.

HEADLINE: Korean Stocks Feel Pinch From Troubles in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Korea's stock index, until recently the star of Asian markets, has gone so sharply downhill that corporations and the firms that invest in them wonder if another bubble is bursting.
 A volatile mix of America's shipping shutdown and stock slide and what is perceived as excessive consumer spending here has sent the Korea Stock Exchange index from more than 900 in April to the low 600's this week. Hardly any company is immune, from corporate leaders like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor to banks that had seemed to be little affected. 
 "You could say what's happening is the popping of the domestic market bubble," Herman Chang, head of equities at ING Barings Securities here, said today. "One of the key reasons why the market is down is what's happening in the rest of the world." 
Mr. Chang was not encouraged by today's rise of 1.2 percent on Korea's exchange, which closed at 634.84. "Today was a dead cat's bounce," he said, "a technical correction."
One of the more disturbing indicators is a decline, for two consecutive months, in foreign direct investment.
The ministry of commerce, industry and energy said today that foreign interests invested only $589 million in Korea last month, down 44 percent in a year. 
Most analysts cited America's troubles as the major problem. "Our stock market and economic situation depend mainly on the U.S. economic situation," said Um Sang Pil, director of overseas market research for the Korea Trade Promotion Agency. "Our problem is outside threats to the economy."
The threat has hit hard at Samsung Electronics, a pillar of Korean industry. From a high of 432,000 won ($350.17) on April 24, its shares have fallen to 300,000.
"The Korean stock price heavily depends on the United States market," said James Chang, a company spokesman. He acknowledged that with Samsung's heavily promoting a wide range of products in mounting competition with Sony and others, it is hard to predict where the share price is going.
Many Korean companies have been hit hard by the shipping lockout and port shutdown in the United States. While the impact may be temporary, analysts said, it could affect the economy for the rest of the year.
"We have 1,200 Hyundai cars waiting to be unloaded" in Portland, Ore., said Jake Jang, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor, Korea's dominant carmaker. "And we have another 500 Kia cars also waiting," he said, Hyundai bought Kia Motor four years ago.
If one sector did not seem likely to be affected by America's problems, it was banking. Almost all Korean banks have become profitable the last two years. But they, too, have suffered as a result of mounting credit card and household mortgage debt -- and rising defaults.
The Bank of Korea said today that household debt had risen $4.9 billion last month, the biggest increase in five months.
Among the institutions most affected was the Kookmin Bank, by far Korea's largest commercial institution, whose shares closed today at 39,200 won ($31.77), down from a peak in July of 63,100.
"Concerns over household loans and card loans are increasing," said Kim Jae Bum, a manager in the foreign investor relations department. But Jang Ha Sung, a finance professor at Korea University and a frequent critic of corporate spending habits, said consumer spending may also be a good sign.
"We are not like Japan, which failed to build up domestic demand," he said, calling the drop in bank shares "an early warning."

HEADLINE: Korea's Real Rage for Virtual Games 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: PUSAN, South Korea, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Throughout the year they have been dating, Jang Min Ji and Jung Tae Kyun have met almost every afternoon at online video game clubs, where they while away the hours zapping bad guys, dodging flame-breathing monsters or playing cards against anonymous strangers.
 The action is so fast and furious at the RA PC Zone, their favorite meeting spot among the thousands of game rooms here, that they have almost no time to talk. Ensconced side by side in their gamers' loveseats, the college couple murmur and coo mostly news of their latest electronic triumphs and defeats, their words barely audible over the hail of gunfire, the grunts and screams of combatants and generalized whirring and clanging. 
 Only when they finally emerge from the pall of smoke and cathode ray blues and reds of the club lights will they finally chat. So what do they talk about? "Mostly about games," said Ms. Jang, a slightly guilty smile playing on her face as her puppy, Urami, strained in her lap, where it had spent the afternoon in confinement. Mr. Jung never broke his gaze on the screen. 
With the largest high-speed Internet market penetration in the world, South Korea has seen the broadband future that has stalled in so many other places.
More than half of all Korean households have high-speed Internet connections -- compared with fewer than 10 percent in the United States -- and the exploding Web culture has driven economic growth and spawned civic movements that have powerfully affected everything from politics to consumer culture.
But more and more these days, people are emphasizing a darker side to this technological success story.
Broadband's killer application -- the one activity that dwarfs all others -- is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
"Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore," said Kim Hyun Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with Internet game addiction. "Young people are losing the ability to relate to others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to violence, even when they are not playing. 
"They clash in the games, and then they meet later and fight face to face."
Far more than the United States, South Korea is a group-oriented society, where socializing in bunches is the preferred form of interaction, and Western-style individualism is frowned upon. Critics say this has been the secret to the tidal wave of online gaming, and the psychiatrist says it is the key to understanding its profound impact.
"Very few of our customers come alone," said Kim Gi Beum, the 29-year-old owner of the RA PC Zone, reputedly the largest of Pusan's thousands of game rooms, or PC bangs, as they are known here. "Of course they could play at home, but it is more exciting to be surrounded by other gamers, especially if they are your friends." 
Mr. Kim started his business three years ago, during the the fallout from the Asian economic crisis, with a $50,000 investment. He had worked a variety of jobs through college to save money for this dream. Now, he said, he pulls 1,200 players a day into this shop, where gamers pay $10 an hour to beat online strangers and wipe out aliens. With similar numbers of players flocking to the other 13 PC bangs in his expanding empire, nowadays he is plowing his profits into trying to start his own online game, which he has evocatively named History of Chaos.
"What feeds our business is that most parents don't allow their children to do PC gaming at home -- they are supposed to be studying," Mr. Kim said briskly. "So what lots of kids will do is pop in after school and spend three or four hours playing. If their parents ask, they'll tell them they were somewhere else."
Sure enough, sitting at row after row of computer screens were dozens of school-age boys, their mouths agape, their desktops cluttered with cellphones, greasy fast-food snacks and bucket-sized sodas. As they teamed up, using separate consoles to take on the forces of evil in popular shoot-em games like Strike Force, Starcraft and Mu, some of them could be said to be engaging in group activity, but just barely. Utterances like "quick, shoot!," or "look out," or especially, "attack!" seemed about the extent of it.
The young women who came to the club with their girlfriends seemed every bit as locked into a parallel universe as the young men, albeit an entirely different universe. Although there is no enforced gender separation at the PC bangs, girls who were not on dates tended to gravitate toward the banks of computers equipped with small cameras atop the monitors. 
For hours, many of them practiced shooting pictures of themselves in playful, smiley poses, composing them with flowers and slogans and clip art and sending them off as digital postcards to real, imagined or would-be friends.
Although there was little sign of it on this day, some parents' groups have complained that the PC bangs are turning into pickup joints, where teenagers swap pictures electronically and decide whether or not to meet. Reversing the usual pattern in a male-dominated society, the girls are reportedly in charge in this game, tipping desired suitors as to the club and even the seat where they can be found. 
Rather than communing, meanwhile, many of those who have arrived on dates have devised ways of setting up invisible walls. 
Back Myung Hee, a 24-year-old insurance company employee, appeared to be perfectly alone as she browsed through catalogs online, looking at fall outfits and makeup, which she insisted was cheaper and more convenient than going to the mall.
Asked why she had come alone, she arched her eyebrows and swiveled her chair nearly 180 degrees and repeated, "Alone? I'm with him," pointing to a man in the next chair who was close to oblivious, so locked was he into his online struggle between good and evil. "I want him to enjoy himself, so I don't talk when he's gaming."

HEADLINE: Aguacate Journal; 
Cuba's Bittersweet Move to Trim Its Sugar Crop

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: AGUACATE, Cuba, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
The steam whistle that summoned generations of workers to the cavernous and bustling Ruben Martinez Villenas sugar mill is silent. Inside, amid a tangle of rusted pipes and man-size gears, the damp aroma of molasses has given way to the electric odor of sparks as welders dismantle the mill that long sustained not only this town, but a sizable slice of Cuba's economy. 
 Faced with plummeting commodity prices and a glut of sugar on top of the disappearance of its Soviet subsidies, the Cuban government has closed about half of its sugar mills. 
 For the hardy field hands who endured months in the sun swinging machetes or moved nimbly in the roaring mills, this is no mere downsizing. It is the sad end of an era that was as much a part of Cuban history and culture as it was a linchpin of the economy. 
The peals from a bell at the Manzanillo plantation heralded the call to arms against Spain in 1868, while the zafra, or sugar harvest, has inspired poets, singers and painters. But tourism is now Cuba's primary source of foreign exchange -- bringing in some $2 billion a year, compared with about $440 million for sugar; and so, even Cuba's change-resistant authorities are bowing to the need to adapt. 
"The circumstances oblige us," said Oscar Almazan, the president of Cuba's Association of Sugar Technicians. "You cannot remain in a position which is truly obsolete. We are talking about a globalized, computerized world, and you have to be prepared for this changing world. If not, you are a Jurassic Park. We are de-Jurassicizing ourselves." 
Officials envision closing some 70 mills, and converting cane fields into vegetable farms or cattle ranches, while reassigning 100,000 workers to the remaining mills, other farm jobs or retraining for food processing factories. 
Jorge Robert Egdhill, a welder and mechanic, has only ever worked in the mills. Now, he cuts through pipes piled outside the Aguacate mill. "It is as if a child died," he said. "To see the source of life slipping from your hands is hard. In the end, you have to do what the government says you must do. But is difficult to take apart machines you once repaired." 
Like some 50 other mills across the country, the one in Aguacate had been idle for several years. National output had hovered at a shade under 4 million tons a year, about half what it was during the 1970's and 1980's when the Cubans sold sugar to the Soviet Union. (Before the 1959 revolution, similarly favorable trade with the United States fed Cuba's sugar industry.) 
The deal with the Soviets meant there was no attempt to diversify crops or industrialize more fervently. Thus, when the Soviet patron collapsed in 1991 and its largess vanished, Cuba was plunged into the economic hardship euphemistically dubbed "the special period." 
"The terrible thing is not that it disappeared, but that it went away at once, without any time to prepare ourselves for it," Mr. Almazan said. 
As sugar mills were shuttered, officials said they began to explore restructuring and to focus on those that could burn the milled cane stalks to power electric turbines. They also studied soil to ensure that only the most fertile plantations would continue to be cultivated. 
This summer, officials announced that about 60 percent of existing sugar fields would be given over to other agricultural production and that former mills would be converted to food processing plants. 
Since many sugar workers have only a ninth-grade education, officials said the government is building new schools to allow them to receive a salary while studying for their high-school diplomas. Classes will include computer training, as well as vocational skills for the emerging industries, they said. 
Whether there will be jobs for everyone, and whether the restructuring of the sugar industry will suffice to ease Cuba's economic problems are both uncertain, said Antonio Jorge, a professor of economics at Florida International University. 
Cuba imports about twice as much as it exports, and has high debt, including loans from Russia that have yet to be renegotiated, while European companies have suspended commercial credit for nonpayment, Professor Jorge said. 
"Cuba's economy is at a very crucial moment," the professor said. "It doesn't possess the capability to keep on importing and that means major crisis." 
Despite official reassurances, the families residing in the batey, or mill village, nestled in the shadow of Aguacate's smokestacks are worried. There are no other jobs in the area, they said, and they are too worried about making ends meet even to think about learning a new skill. 
"People older than 40 going to study, what can they do with that kind of head?" said Carmen Prieto, who lives with her husband, a tractor driver, in a narrow home that reeks of a crude oil stove. "Can you study if there is nothing to eat?" 
But Noel Ibanez, a lanky man with stubbly gray bristles, insisted that even at 58 he was not worried. He knows enough about history and sugar that he just might end up teaching in the new schools. 
"The important thing is to know why we have to do this," he said. "I am not without hope. I have the guarantee of working or studying. I have the right not to be unemployed. In other parts of the world, that does not happen." 
He cast his gaze upon the gigantic mill with its arched windows, broken panes and faded revolutionary slogans, and allowed himself a moment of nostalgia. 
"The smell of molasses is what I'll miss," he said. "Remember, we are talking about something historic in our country."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Prices Rise on Hopes of West Coast Dockworkers' Peace

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Hopes for an end to a West Coast labor standoff soothed investors yesterday, prompting them to buy stocks and give the market its first advance in five sessions. 
 Analysts said investors were looking for a reason to buy stocks after driving down prices for six consecutive weeks and during the previous four sessions in particular. But investors were also wary of committing to the market, given uncertainties over earnings, the economy and the possibility of war with Iraq. 
 The wide-ranging emotions of investors were evident in the fluctuations of stocks throughout the day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 199 points in afternoon trading, after having dropped as much as 91 points earlier. 
"People are looking for a rally after stocks have been knocked down so relentlessly," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "The market is looking for that to turn around, and that just hasn't happened yet." 
The Dow closed up 78.65 points, or 1.1 percent, at 7,501.49. It was the Dow's first higher close in five sessions, on the heels of a four-day loss of 515.95 points. 
The market's broader indicators were also higher after four consecutive days of selling. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.82 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,129.22, but was still trading at closing levels last seen in August and September 1996. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.27 points, or 1.7 percent, to 798.55. 
Analysts attributed the gains largely to optimism that the standoff between West Coast longshoremen and shipping firms would end. Late yesterday afternoon, President Bush said he had directed government lawyers to seek an injunction to end the labor dispute, which has cost the economy as much as $2 billion a day. The dockworkers' union had agreed to go back to work today under a 30-day contract extension. 
"Traders are responding positively to the fact that the West Coast port dispute, which has been costly, may in fact be near a resolution," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock & Company. 
All three indexes have suffered six weeks of declines on worries about Iraq and about third-quarter earnings, which companies will be reporting over the next few weeks. 
Amid a spate of profit warnings, analysts' third-quarter growth estimates for companies have fallen to 5.4 percent from earlier forecasts of 16.6 percent, according to Thomson First Call.
"That is a much more significant downward revision than we usually see in a quarter," said Ken Perkins, research analyst at Thomson First Call, adding that quarterly estimates are typically lowered by about 3 percent. 
The market also was mindful of developments concerning Iraq. The House and Senate debated resolutions yesterday to authorize the president to declare war on Iraq and are expected to vote tomorrow. 
Among yesterday's winners, PepsiCo rose $5.32, or nearly 15 percent, to $41.10, on third-quarter earnings that were a penny a share higher than estimates and on an optimistic outlook for yearly profits. The company said its annual income should be at the high end of expectations. 
A positive outlook also helped CVS, up $1.89, at $25.89. The drug store operator said third-quarter results would come in at the high end of its forecast, largely because sales at stores open at least a year rose 8.3 percent in September.
Sara Lee advanced 47 cents, to $19.90, on an upgrade from Lehman Brothers. And General Electric, which will report earnings results on Friday, rose 40 cents, to $23.35. 
But Ford fell 75 cents, to $7.75, on a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston.
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as gains in stocks slowed demand.
The price on the 10-year note finished at 106 3/32, down 6/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 3.63 percent from 3.62 percent on Monday. The price on a 30-year note increased 6/32, to 110 18/32. The yield fell to 4.70 percent from 4.71 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Supreme Court Seems Skeptical Of F.C.C. Position on Next Wave

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court gave a skeptical hearing today to the Federal Communications Commission's contention that it acted within its rights in 1998 when it confiscated more than 200 valuable wireless communications licenses from NextWave Telecom, which had won them at auction but fell behind in its payments and filed for bankruptcy protection.
 Under federal bankruptcy law, which is aimed at giving troubled companies a chance to reorganize and return to financial health, the government may not revoke a license "solely because" the holder has sought protection from its creditors. The federal appeals court here ruled last year that the F.C.C. violated this law by seizing the licenses for which NextWave had promised to pay more than $4 billion. Catching the telecommunications roller coaster at a high point, the commission then reauctioned the licenses to Verizon Wireless and other major companies for $16 billion. But the licenses have never been released because of the legal battle. A victory for NextWave would allow the company to use the licenses to finish building its wireless network or sell them to another company. 
 The intersection of bankruptcy and telecommunications law might not sound calculated to draw crowds to the Supreme Court on an October morning, but the long row of Lincoln Town Cars idling on Maryland Avenue outside the court indicated otherwise. With billions of dollars at stake, some star legal talent on display and implications for other regulated industries, the case drew an overflow crowd to the section of the courtroom reserved for members of the Supreme Court bar. With barely elbow room to move, many of the lawyers scribbled notes during the hourlong argument.
The government's main argument, presented by Paul D. Clement, a deputy solicitor general, was that the bankruptcy law's prohibition against revoking licenses did not apply to the F.C.C.'s action against NextWave because the commission was acting not as a creditor but as a regulator. As a regulator, Mr. Clement said, the F.C.C. properly regarded NextWave's failure to make its payments "as a proxy for determining that continued possession of the licenses was not in the public interest." NextWave's insolvency was therefore not the "sole" reason for the confiscation, he said.
This provoked a long discussion about the meaning of "solely," with some justices expressing skepticism about the government's motivation. "You say it was a public-interest determination, but there is an economic correlation," Justice David H. Souter told Mr. Clement. He noted that the value of NextWave's licenses dropped sharply after the original auction and said: "When the value dropped, you said we want our whole $4 billion, and then when it went up, you said we want to reauction and get the increase in value. That's an economic decision, not regulation."
Justice Antonin Scalia was even less sympathetic. "You're just making up a regulatory purpose," he said. "This is a classic case that the bankruptcy code is directed to."
The only justice who appeared at all receptive to the government's position was Stephen G. Breyer, who suggested that a ruling for NextWave might put the F.C.C. at a disadvantage to other creditors. When NextWave's lawyer, Donald B. Verrilli, argued that the law placed the F.C.C. in the same position as any other lender to a bankrupt borrower, Justice Breyer said: "If you're right, I see no way in which the government as creditor can collect money it is owed." For the spectrum auction in which NextWave participated, the F.C.C. required a 10 percent down payment, with the remainder to be paid over 10 years; NextWave was never able to make payments beyond the initial down payment.
Mr. Verrilli told Justice Breyer the purpose of the disputed section of the bankruptcy code was "to protect the right to reorganize." If federal license owners could not keep their licenses while trying to emerge from bankruptcy, "they'd have to liquidate," he said, adding, "The government can get paid to the same extent as any other creditor, but they can't take the license back."
Professor Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School argued on behalf of NextWave's private creditors, which lent the company hundreds of millions of dollars and have a big stake in its viability. A license is "the lifeline without which this entire edifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware," he said. "The agency can't simply take all the value for itself." Noting that the F.C.C. relied on free-market principles for its license auctions, he said, "The whole market system depends on the rule of law."
The status of the licenses at issue in Federal Communications Commission v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc., No. 01-653, will be complex no matter how the court rules. With the sharp decline of the telecommunications industry, the licenses that Verizon Wireless, a partnership between Verizon Communications and the Vodafone Group, and other big companies won in the second auction are now worth much less. The F.C.C. has given partial refunds of the down payments and announced last month that it was considering whether to let the winning bidders withdraw their applications.

PERSON: Anthony Mazzocchi 

HEADLINE: Anthony Mazzocchi, 76, Dies; Union Officer and Party Father 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Anthony Mazzocchi, a longtime union official who was a pioneer in the occupational safety movement and the founder of the six-year-old Labor Party, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 76.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, Labor Party officials said. 
 In his years with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, Mr. Mazzocchi was widely viewed as one of the greatest innovators and mavericks in the labor movement. In the 1960's, he become one of the first union leaders to develop strong ties with the environmental and antiwar movements. He fought nuclear testing, and he bucked the labor establishment by criticizing its strong ties with the Democratic Party. 
In that same period, Mr. Mazzocchi became convinced that workers were being hurt by chemicals on the job, so, as the union's legislative director, he held a series of town meetings for union members and environmentalists around the nation that helped accelerate the occupational safety movement. In 1970, when President Richard M. Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Mr. Mazzocchi was credited with being a principal force behind the legislation.
In the 1970's, he began working with Karen Silkwood, a technician at a Kerr-McGee plant in Oklahoma that processed nuclear fuel rods. She told him that the company was falsifying records about the rods' safety, something Kerr-McGee always denied.
In 1974, Mr. Mazzocchi arranged for Ms. Silkwood to meet a reporter for The New York Times to detail her accusations, but she died in a car accident while driving to meet the reporter. She was later made famous in a film starring Meryl Streep.
After retiring from the union in 1991, Mr. Mazzocchi focused on building the Labor Party because he was convinced that the two major parties were beholden to business. His slogan was: "The bosses have two parties. We need one of our own." 
In 1996 in Cleveland, he presided over the founding convention of the Labor Party, which supports universal health insurance paid for by the federal government, free college tuition for all and laws making it easier for workers to unionize. The party has grown far more slowly than he hoped, he acknowledged in an interview last month.
"Breaking the two-party system is not an easy goal," he said. "Looking at the experience of the Social Democratic parties in Europe, they didn't grow overnight."
Anthony Mazzocchi was born in Brooklyn on June 13, 1926, to a family so poor that the children slept three to a bed. His father, Joseph, was a garment worker; his mother, Angelina Lamardo, died of cancer when he was 6. Mr. Mazzocchi said his father lost the family home because of his mother's hospital expenses.
At 16 he dropped out of high school and joined the Army to fight in Europe during World War II. He served in the Battle of the Bulge, and he said he obtained his education reading paperbacks on the back of a truck carrying an antiaircraft gun.
After the war, he was a steelworker in Brooklyn and an auto worker in New Jersey. In 1950, he took a job at a Helena Rubenstein factory in Roslyn, N.Y., and two years later he was elected president of the union local there.
He was one of the first labor leaders to obtain dental coverage for his workers, and he negotiated equal pay for women at the plant. 
Soon he became one of Long Island's most prominent labor leaders, campaigning for Adlai E. Stevenson for president and working with scientists to fight nuclear testing. He collected baby teeth from the children of union members to show that human bodies were collecting the radioactive isotope strontium 90 because of nuclear testing.
From the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, he lived in Washington, working as legislative director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, which merged with the paper workers' union in 1999 and was renamed the Paper Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union.
In 1977 he became vice president of the chemical workers, and in 1979 and 1981 he narrowly lost races to become the union's president. From 1988 until 1991, he was the union's secretary-treasurer.
His marriages to Rose Alfonso and Susan Lynn Kleinwaks ended in divorce. He is survived by his partner, Katherine Isaac of Washington; a son, Anthony, of Brooklyn; five daughters, Geraldine Amitin of Atlanta, Carol Irish of Rochester, Linda Nagle of Houston, Elizabeth Mazzocchi of Boston, and Kristina Mazzocchi of Washington; and five grandchildren. 
As founder and national organizer of the Labor Party, he said his goal was not to elect candidates, but to force important issues, like nationalized health care, onto center stage. As a model, he pointed to grass-roots groups in decades past that pressed the government to establish Social Security and unemployment insurance.
Noting that a Republican, President Nixon, signed the labor-friendly occupational safety bill, he said, "When you build a big movement from down below, regardless of who's in the White House, you can bring about change."

HEADLINE: Many Fear Mideast Unrest Could Force Up Oil Prices 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Jacques Torres, host of the "Watch Chocolate" TV show on the Food Network, does not seem to have the type of job that would lead him to worry about a war in Iraq. After all, he is consumed by creating chocolates. 
 But Mr. Torres, who owns a chocolate factory and store on Water Street in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, says the prospect of instability in the Middle East leading to higher oil prices has been on his mind lately. 
 "I did not know this until I started my own business and went crazy with the numbers," he said one recent afternoon while surrounded by 45-foot-long ovens in the chocolate factory that carries his name. "I pay more for operation costs than for food costs. I cannot afford to see the price of oil rise much."
Mr. Torres is among thousands of business owners and residents in the New York region who are carefully watching oil prices as winter approaches. The Northeast is the nation's biggest consumer of Middle Eastern oil primarily because of the combination of a large, dense population and the fact that it is a place where natural gas is less commonly used. 
Oil prices have also been traditionally higher in the Northeast than in much of the rest of the country, because of a high demand and a sparse number of large refineries. Crude oil -- most of it pumped from the ground in the Middle East, Nigeria or Venezuela -- is refined in places with a glut of refineries like the Gulf Coast states. Then it is shipped north through pipelines and distributed locally in tractor trailers, barges and other expensive forms of transportation. 
"The Northeast is the largest heating oil consumer in the country, and historically it has not had access to natural gas," said Aaron Brady, a senior oil analyst at Energy Security Analysis, a research firm that forecasts the markets for petroleum, natural gas and power.
All of this means that a spike in crude oil prices worldwide could have a fast and furious impact, causing costs to rise more sharply in the Northeast than in other parts of the country.
This alarms people like Mr. Torres, who say it is time to brace for higher prices. Some like Mr. Torres fear a repeat of 2000, when high crude oil prices sent the cost of petroleum products -- from jet fuel and gasoline to home heating oil and petroleum-based plastic bags -- skyrocketing. 
This time, worries are not just based on the potential for harsh winter weather or the so-called war premium that could raise oil costs if the United States invades Iraq. The concerns also stem from a decision in January by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to slow down production because of a weakened economy and a drop in jet fuel purchases after Americans and Europeans stopped flying as frequently.
"This could be awfully bad for bakeries, factories and other food-related businesses," said Mr. Torres, who is also the dean of the French Culinary Institute of New York.
Business leaders say that while they dread the possibility of a war in Iraq, they are hopeful it would not happen before late January, when prices typically begin to drop.
Mr. Brady, the oil analyst, said that the United States does not need Iraqi oil, but that the real concern is "that Saddam Hussein lobs a couple of missiles at some Gulf states."
But some energy experts said that if a war in Iraq happened soon it might be a blessing in disguise for the Northeast energy markets -- particularly if it is over quickly.
The uncertain climate worries people like Tracy Coddington, a secretary at Hudson Valley Oil Supply in Lake Katrine, N.Y., an Ulster County town about 100 miles north of Manhattan.
Normally, customers call the oil company for repairs to their home heating systems at this time of year. But the normal routine has changed, Ms. Coddington said last week, because of the situation in Iraq. Now, more than a month ahead of normal, many people are calling to get their home oil tanks filled.
"I know a lot of people are calling, and they are worried about it," she said. "So they are trying to fill their tanks as quick as possible or get their tanks topped off. The last couple of weeks have been a little bit more crazy than usual."
Mr. Brady said "saber rattling" has already driven wholesale prices up. Home heating oil prices in New York, for example, rose 1 percent in September, to $1.29 per gallon. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has asked the Bush administration to take steps, including tapping into America's reserve supply of oil, to ensure that crude oil prices do not rise even more in the event of a war against Iraq.
Still, some people, like Steve Hiscox, are not that worried. Mr. Hiscox uses a wood stove to warm his home in Oneonta, N.Y., a rural town of 11,000 residents a little more than 40 miles northwest of Catskill Park. Mr. Hiscox, who runs a fence-building company from his home office, says he keeps the wood stove burning all day from December to March and uses his oil furnace only when it gets extremely cold.
"Up this way, there is a lot of firewood -- a lot of people burn it," Mr. Hiscox said. "I don't get real excited about the price of oil. I would rather put my energy into worrying about other things."
Crude oil inventories from the summer were high because it was so unseasonably warm, and most experts thought the market would be flooded come winter, said Thomas Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodities. But the OPEC reductions have kept growth flat and left the Northeast with just about enough heating oil for an average winter. 
Besides any supply problems that could be caused by a war in the Middle East, Mr. Bentz said, a particularly tough winter could almost equally ensure shortages.
"If the weather turns cold very early in the season we could end up drawing the inventories down early, and we could have much higher prices in the country," he said.
Ms. Coddington, of Hudson Oil Supply, said she was not concerned herself until she started to see spikes in the prices her company was getting charged by suppliers. She said she had her home tank filled last week "because I see the prices on slips we get every day from the oil company saying how much they are charging, and it's going up and up and up."

HEADLINE: Congress Limps Toward Home 

 BODY:
Although the majority leader, Tom Daschle, threatens to keep the Senate in business until Election Day, the 107th Congress is running out of time to redeem its thin, disappointing legislative record. Congress approved useful measures on trade, corporate reform and, barring last-minute snags, ballot reform. It failed completely to deliver on its promises for a patients' bill of rights, prescription drug coverage, welfare reform and an innovative energy strategy. Even vital measures directly related to Sept. 11 -- bills providing for homeland security and terrorism insurance -- have stalled over needless ideological bickering. 
 Basic budget problems also remain unresolved. Of 13 appropriations measures, only the defense spending bill is likely to be approved before Congress goes home. A continuing resolution to keep the government afloat will therefore be required. So will a post-election lame duck session to finish the appropriations process. 
 Congress's preoccupation with the prospect of war in Iraq is one reason for its failure to address spending needs in a timely fashion. Politics is another. Even though the difference between the administration's and the Democrats' spending targets for next year is a measly $10 billion, the White House has put heavy pressure on loyal Republicans to vote against popular education, health and environmental programs. For obvious reasons, these are votes that the Republicans would just as soon delay until after the election.
By way of redemption, and also to help the economy, there are several useful things that Congress can do before it leaves town. One is to extend temporary unemployment benefits beyond the Dec. 31 deadline, while continuing assistance to the 1.3 million workers who have exhausted their benefits or will do so shortly. These people badly need help and it will not bankrupt the government to provide it. In the same spirit, Congress should also give serious thought to bipartisan measures aimed at providing quick and temporary fiscal relief for hard-pressed states that are threatening to cut Medicaid and other programs for the poor.
Given everything that hasn't been done, it's hard to believe that the Republicans are using these final hours to press yet another irresponsible tax cut. The bill, approved yesterday by the House Ways and Means Committee, would provide $24 billion over five years in new write-offs for stock market losses. It would mainly help upper-income taxpayers and ignore those most in need. It would also become a permanent drain on a budget that even now is slipping deeper into deficit.

HEADLINE: Behind Door No. 2, Less 9/11 Aid; 
Line Separates Merchant From Others Being Helped

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
The way Alex S. Ferkov sees it, his takeout food shop and cafeteria is being unjustly deprived of money on "nitpicking technicalities." 
 His business is the only one in his building a block from ground zero that does not qualify for the highest level of aid in a major government program, he says. As a result, he figures he is losing $40,000 simply because his door is 75 feet from the line the state has set to define help for the hardest-hit small businesses hurt by the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The way the state agency giving out the money sees it, the line needs to be drawn somewhere and the way it has been permits the most assistance to those most economically hurt by the terrorist attack, a state spokesman said. 
The clashing assessments provide a window into the world of translating government aid programs with broad goals and big pots of money into fair disbursements.
The pot of money in question, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, provides compensation for lost revenue to companies with up to 500 employees that are situated from 14th Street to the Battery. The highest compensation is given to businesses that were in the World Trade Center and have reopened elsewhere in the city, or that are in the neighborhood closest to the attack site. 
That neighborhood, according to the program's boundaries, is bounded by Chambers and Rector Streets to the north and south and the Hudson River and Broadway to the west and east.
It is the Broadway boundary that has aroused the ire of Mr. Ferkov, an owner of the Cafe Exchange at 2 Maiden Lane, which is in the Broadway Maiden Lane Building, an 18-story commercial building. The building's main entrance is at 170 Broadway address, but his shop can only be entered at 2 Maiden Lane.
For a business to be in the program's highest compensation zone, its main entrance must be on Broadway. So all the office tenants and other shops in the building are in this zone except the Cafe Exchange.
The unwanted distinction is painful, Mr. Ferkov said. Those in the highest payment zone may receive up to 25 days' worth of lost revenue, which would be close to $60,000 in his case. 
Since his business has been deemed outside the zone, it falls into the same zone as those as far north as Canal Street, three-quarters of a mile away, where the maximum entitlement is only seven days' worth of losses. Thus Cafe Exchange has received $18,000. 
Mr. Ferkov says that, according to his lease, his premises are at 170 Broadway. Two Maiden Lane is not an official address, he says, but the previous operators of the shop used that address as a convenience, so its mail could be delivered directly and not through the 170 Broadway system.
Noting that his building is a block from the trade center site, he argues that his business was also "in the war zone" and should be given the same consideration as the other 170 Broadway tenants. The nearly $40,000 he could not get, he says, "would help tremendously."
Cafe Exchange, he says, was closed for three weeks after the attack, then did "maybe 20 percent" of its previous business in subsequent weeks. Altogether the cafe lost more than $100,000 from Sept. 11 to Dec. 31 last year. His insurance reimbursed him for $13,000 to cover lost revenue, he says, and business is "still 30 percent down," he said as lunchers arrived for salads, sandwiches and dishes like chicken rollatini laid out by his eight workers. 
"Why are they nitpicking over technicalities?" Mr. Ferkov, 51, asks of the program, which has given more than 9,000 businesses nearly $338 million out of its $481 million fund and will continue to take new applications until the end of the year.
Also galling him, he says, is that a Lower Manhattan office of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that runs the program with the city's Economic Development Corporation, had approved him for the higher level of aid, but that the decision was overruled by the agency's main office in Midtown.
Michael Marr, a spokesman for the state agency, said, "You have to draw the boundary somewhere, and the most sensible place was Broadway." He said the major consideration in determining the highest-grant zone was how long business owners were denied access to their premises.
His agency, he said, followed the City Office of Emergency Management's guidelines, which said businesses on Broadway and to the west nearest the destroyed trade center generally went the longest time without access to their buildings, while businesses on side streets, like Maiden Lane, got in sooner after the attacks. 
"We have crafted a plan with the most assistance going to those who were denied access," Mr. Marr said.
About a dozen other merchants appear to be in Mr. Ferkov's position -- on side streets, but in buildings whose main entrances are on the east side of Broadway and thus in the highest-grant zone. One of them is Fowed Saleh, who operates N & N Gourmet, a takeout deli at 69 Liberty Street, in a building whose entrance is around the corner at 150 Broadway.
Unlike Mr. Ferkov, Mr. Saleh said last week that he had received the higher scale of aid money that businesses on the Broadway side of his building did. He said he had been compensated $14,000 for 10 days of losses, and would soon be applying for the 15 more available in the highest-grant zone. He said he had been struggling to survive, since his deli was closed for two weeks after the attack and then "doing very little business" for a long while.
Mr. Marr was asked why Mr. Ferkov's shop was deemed to be outside the highest-aid zone but Mr. Saleh's considered to be inside? The answer is bad news for Mr. Saleh. 
Mr. Marr said his agency had erred in "our earnest attempt to deliver these funds as quickly as possible." In fact, Mr. Marr said, Mr. Saleh was entitled only to seven days' worth of compensation. So not only would he not receive an additional 15 days' worth of losses, but would have to return the extra three days' worth he had already received.
That would be $4,200. Mr. Saleh said he had spent all of his grant money, but added that "if they say they gave too much, we would give it back."
Another unhappy businessman is Jim Boudouvas, an owner of New York Blossoms at 152 Fulton Street. The second-floor tenants in the two-story commercial building come and go through the entrance at 204 Broadway and thus are eligible for the highest grants. Several shops, including the flower store, are on the Fulton Street side, the losing side.
Mr. Boudouvas said he was closed for two and a half months after the Sept. 11 attack and that his business was still down "35, 40 percent." He asserted that he should be considered for aid on the same basis as the office tenants. "What's the difference?" he asked. "We're in the same building."

HEADLINE: Global War Against AIDS Runs Short of Vital Weapon: Donated Condoms 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
Donations of condoms from rich nations to poor ones, already deeply inadequate, have declined over the past decade, just as a few countries have successfully used them to fight the ever-worsening AIDS epidemic.
 The world's poorest countries need between 8 billion and 10 billion condoms a year to help stem the spread of the AIDS virus, which newly infects 14,000 people each day, public health officials say. But they receive less than 1 billion, and donations have slipped to 950 million from 970 million in the last decade, according to the United Nations Population Fund. 
 "We need a lot more condoms," said Dr. Nkandu Luo, a former health minister of Zambia. "We don't have enough." 
The biggest decline in donations was from the United States, which gave the third world 800 million condoms in 1990 and only 360 million in 2000. The United Nations and European aid agencies, notably Britain's, stepped in to try to make up the difference.
Efforts to get affordable AIDS drugs to Africa have recently had more news coverage than condoms, but officials of Population Action International, a family planning group, emphasized that condoms can save more lives for pennies.
Many factors create the condom shortfall: little public discussion of the situation, shifting foreign aid priorities, laws that drive up prices, distribution problems in poor countries and religious opposition.
Mark Rilling, chief of the population commodities division of the United States Agency for International Development, America's foreign aid provider, said no one knows exactly how many condoms the third world needs, "but we know it's a lot more than is being provided at the moment -- as a worldwide donor community, we're not close."
American donations dropped for several reasons, he said. In the 1990's, some major condom recipients, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Zaire, now Congo, became ineligible for foreign aid because of coups, wars, or shifts to other donors.
Also, "buy American" laws meant that the Federal government had to pay about 6 cents per condom, while the price from factories in India, China, Thailand and Malaysia, even with quality testing, is about 3 cents.
However, Mr. Rilling said, the newest contracts negotiated by the agency for international development push the price down close to 4 cents, and the agency has set aside $25 million for countries with the worst AIDS epidemics. If that were all spent on condoms, it would purchase 625 million. 
Even with other nations stepping in, the need is growing. The United Nations Population Fund estimates that poor countries now need 10 billion condoms a year and will need nearly double that many by 2015. Donor countries used to buy about 41 percent of what was needed; now they buy only about 27 percent.
For every $1 million not spent on condoms, the United Nations estimates, there are 360,000 unwanted pregnancies, 150,000 abortions, 800 maternal deaths and 25,000 deaths of children under age 5. 
While lobbying by the religious right has cut Federal budgets for related programs, Mr. Rilling contends that political pressure was "not a factor" in the decline of his agency's condom exports or new efforts to increase them.
Along with billions more condoms, Population Action said, poor countries need another $1.2 billion to help distribute them and teach their use. Illiteracy and unfamiliarity are major barriers to condom use, and even now, two decades into the epidemic, it is difficult in many societies to talk about condoms.
"In my country, it's taboo for a person like me to discuss sex with someone younger," Dr. Luo said.
A recent United Nations study of fears about condoms include widely accepted rumors that most condoms have holes, that the virus is inside them, or that the wrong size can cause the penis to break off.
The chief barrier to open discussion of condom use "is not just its association with sex, but with 'dirty sex,' " said Michael Fox, an AIDS prevention worker for international health agencies. He said he had heard of women in India, Africa and South America charged with prostitution for simply possessing a condom.
The few poor countries that have succeeded in getting new infection rates to level off or even drop -- including Brazil, Uganda, Senegal and Thailand -- "all broke the condom barrier," he said.
Often, that includes a public effort to make condoms sound sexy or funny instead of merely clinical. In Thailand, an advocacy group opened a restaurant called Cabbages and Condoms in which all the table flowers and wall decor were made of condoms. 
"In Brazil, the sexiest male and female soap stars came on TV holding condoms," Mr. Fox said. "They'd look at the camera and say 'Yes, you probably would like to go to bed with me. But you don't have a chance if you don't use this.' "
In Senegal and Uganda, health workers persuaded both imams and ministers to endorse condoms from their pulpits.
"Social marketers" have had some success by repackaging free condoms to sell at low prices. Surveys find that men often value items they pay for more than those they get for free. They are also more likely to seek out condoms if they have names like King or Safari and are in envelopes featuring entwined lovers rather than plain white packs with public health messages. Famous soccer players have been recruited for endorsements.
But such advertising campaigns can inflame other passions. Religious leaders in Indonesia and Russia recently shut down two "social marketing" efforts, Mr. Fox said.
Public health officials favor condoms because they are cheap, generally reliable and prevent both AIDS and pregnancies as well as the venereal diseases that create sores that open the path for the AIDS virus. A study by the University of California at Berkeley estimated that counseling prostitutes in poor countries and giving them condoms costs about $3.50 per life saved. Even the cheapest generic antiretroviral regimens in Africa cost 100 times as much.
Estimating how many condoms an ideal world would have is an inexact science based on a mix of census figures and surveys of people's bedroom activities. The United Nations' estimate of 10 billion and Population Action's 8 billion are both based on a 2000 study by The Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, which used population figures for men ages 15 to 59 and "coital frequency surveys" from many sources, including anthropologists, aid agencies and a condom company.
The goal is to have condoms as widely distributed as other goods found in the smallest village shop in Africa or Asia, like Coca-Cola, soap and matches. Because condoms deteriorate in hot storerooms and expire after long storage, there are distribution problems, but they hardly rival those for other perishables like beer and sugar.
"Cigarettes can get to the most remote corners of the world," said Terri Bartlett, Population Action International's vice president. "So should condoms."

HEADLINE: Taking On Iraq: The President Makes His Case 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A less expensive, less perilous, less testosterone-filled yet more effective response to Iraq would be to lift the sanctions and welcome Iraq into the community of nations we trade with, regardless of the repressive nature of its government ("Bush Sees 'Urgent Duty' to Pre-empt Attack by Iraq," front page, Oct. 8). 
 Iraq would lose any incentive that it might have to attack us, and America could benefit (as some believe is a motive behind this crisis) from the open access to Iraqi oil. 
 After all, since its inception, America has done business with a legion of countries whose governments were repressive; it still does.

Re "Public Says Bush Needs to Pay Heed to Weak Economy" (front page, Oct. 7): 
The majority of Americans are opposed to a unilateral war against Iraq. 
 A major new poll by CBS News and The New York Times reports that the majority of Americans want to give the United Nations more time to try to send weapons inspectors into Iraq. Americans are also afraid that a war against Iraq would worsen terrorism instead of reducing it. 
 This is a case of the silent majority's not being heard.
Why are the politicians, including Democratic senators and representatives, ignoring the desires of the American people?

HEADLINE: As Teachers Back Pataki, McCall Questions Motives 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
As Gov. George E. Pataki picked up the endorsement of the teachers' union in Yonkers -- and with the New York City teachers' union expected to follow suit imminently -- H. Carl McCall joined several educators yesterday to denounce the governor's education record.
 Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate for governor who has sought to make education one of his signature issues, appeared outside the O. Henry School at 333 West 17th Street, in an attempt to stop the governor's momentum on the issue. Mr. McCall's supporters praised him for his stands on education and criticized Mr. Pataki for what they considered his insufficient financing of it. They also suggested Mr. Pataki's union backing, particularly among teachers, was not deep. 
 "Politically, it's a miscalculation," said Michael Krasner, a professor at Queens College. "I think you're going to see rank-and-file teachers breaking rank with the leadership."
The expected endorsement by the city's teachers' union would be the latest in a series by unions that have traditionally supported Democrats. Mr. McCall has characterized the support as paybacks for handouts from the governor.
In Yonkers, Steve Frey, the president of the Yonkers Federation of Teachers, in announcing the union's backing, noted Mr. Pataki's financial bailouts of the school district, including $5.5 million designated in August to avert the layoff of 158 teachers.
The Yonkers teachers' union was the first affiliate of the state union, which is staying neutral in the race, to endorse the governor, his campaign aides said.
Mr. McCall and his supporters have repeatedly said that union members would not follow the recommendations of their leaders. But on Monday, members of the 55,000-member Public Employees Federation voted down a resolution to overturn the executive committee's endorsement of Mr. Pataki.
Union officials had said they decided to endorse the governor after he promised to restore three lost sick days to union members. Yesterday, the sponsors of the resolution and the union president said that members feared that switching to Mr. McCall would compromise the union's credibility. "Hundreds of people who were wearing McCall stickers voted not to overturn the endorsement," said Dan Steen, one of the resolution's sponsors.
Roger Benson, the public employees union president, issued a statement saying that members "understood that switching our endorsement would have eroded our ability to protect and enhance our members' rights and benefits."
Asked if he would call for an investigation into whether union votes were exchanged for favors, Mr. McCall said yesterday, "Maybe we should do that."
After his news conference in Yonkers, Mr. Pataki headed for Midtown Manhattan to announce that the state had acquired the two-block, 1.4- million-square-foot James A. Farley Building, which will be converted from a post office into a new Pennsylvania Station. 
The state paid $230 million, using funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city of New York and $85 million in bonds from the Empire State Development Corporation, which expects to recoup its costs through revenues from the retail and commercial parts of the new station.
State officials and the Postal Service signed a memorandum of understanding yesterday, with a final sale expected within the next year, said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the development corporation. 
Mr. Pataki, standing with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who championed the station project, and Rudy Umscheid, vice president of facilities for the post office, called the new station "a world-class, 21st-century landmark gateway to New York."
The economic development announcement was another of a series being made by the governor ahead of the Nov. 5 election, in which he is seeking a third term.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pataki was criticized yesterday for his handling of the state budget by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative organization that has in the past supported his fiscal policies. The institute released a report saying Mr. Pataki would have to return to the hard-nosed, budget-slashing tactics of his first term to weather an estimated $5 billion shortfall next year.
The report, by E. J. McMahon, an institute analyst, said Mr. Pataki had reined in spending in his first four years in office, but had let it increase at twice the rate of inflation in his second term.
Mr. McMahon also said the governor this year spent the $3 billion cushion he had saved in the late 1990's to avoid having to make cuts before an election. To close next year's gap, Mr. McMahon predicted the administration would have to cut 20,000 jobs, freeze state employee salaries in the next round of contracts, stop the growth of Medicaid and sell off some state assets like golf courses and hospitals.
Mr. Pataki said he had not yet read the report and would not comment on it. Asked about the looming budget crisis, he said: "We've gotten through this year, and we're going to do fine next year as well. We are well prepared."

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Makes Shopping a Sport 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Construction of shopping centers has slowed to a crawl in the rest of the country, but not here, where shopping, not gambling, has become the fastest-growing game in town.
 Developers are in the process of adding a million square feet of shopping space along the Strip, to sell everything from T-shirts to $1,000 Hermes riding boots, while planning 500,000 more. And that is on top of the endless corridors of pseudo souks, Venetian alleys and Roman forums built over the last decade. 
 Most of the country's shopping center developers "are not building any new products," said Anthony W. Deering, chief executive of the Rouse Company, which has developed 52 malls across the United States. "We're down to maybe one a year -- right now, that's a lot." 
Yet Rouse is investing grandly in Las Vegas with a $1 billion renovation of the aging Fashion Show Mall. On Nov. 1, Rouse will open the first phase of the mall's expansion, more than doubling the number of square feet, and adding new anchor stores, a high-tech fashion runway and the Strip's latest gimmick -- the Cloud, an enormous wire-mesh sculpture that hangs over the sidewalk and doubles as a laser video screen at night. When completed, the Fashion Show project will have the most anchor stores in the country, eight, compared with five at the Mall of America.
Another shopping haunt, the Forum Shops at Caesars, is increasing its boutique space by more than 40 percent by the end of 2003. Shops at Caesars are now hidden inside -- and shoppers must ride a people-mover to reach them -- but they will be extended to reach the Strip. 
Le Reve, the new project by Stephen A. Wynn, the casino impresario, will add even more space, including the Strip's first auto dealership, selling Maseratis and Ferraris. Mandalay Bay, another new resort, is more than tripling its shopping space, and has signed up Louis Vuitton and Fendi.
For the developers, it is a big gamble; planned expansion will add 1.5 million square feet, or roughly 50 percent more, to the existing retail space on the Strip. Some economists and retail experts worry that Las Vegas is already "overstored," to use the industry's word.
The developers argue that there is still room for more -- Glenn Schaeffer, the president of the Mandalay Resort Group, insists Las Vegas is the only city in the United States that is "under-retailed." Developers in Las Vegas have chosen to ignore the despair felt now in much of the retail industry because, they say, Las Vegas has a special confluence of circumstances, including the fastest-growing population in the country, desert sunshine, low taxes, a low crime rate and -- even though they do not say it -- the gambling.
But gambling, while still by far the biggest money maker here, is no longer where all the action is. The old gamblers' hangouts -- the Sands, the Dunes, the Hacienda, the old Aladdin and the Desert Inn -- where Sammy, Frank and Dino reigned, are gone now, some imploded and replaced by the three million square feet of modern retail space built since the early 1990's: mock palaces with Disneyesque themed "environments" for shopping and dining. 
To lure ever more new shoppers, casino advertisements now play up the boutiques and play down the roulette wheels. A full-page advertisement for Caesars Palace in an airline magazine calls it a place "where you will adorn yourself in the haute couture of Gucci, Escada, Armani and more," then talks about the rooms, the "pool oasis" and the night life. Mentioned last is the casino. Another full-page ad for Caesars in a tourist brochure does not even mention gambling. It promises: "Shoppus 'til you droppus."
Perhaps the surest sign that Las Vegas is changing how it does business is that, in the newer hotel-casinos, shoppers no longer must pass by the slot machines on their way to the glossy boutiques. The shopping promenades at Desert Passage (with its endless Moroccan alleys), the Paris (complete with Eiffel Tower), the Bellagio (with colored fountains) and the Venetian (where singing gondoliers ply artificial canals) all have their own entrances. 
Mr. Wynn, who sold Bellagio and the Mirage to MGM Mirage, is coming back on the site of the old Desert Inn, where he plans to build his new $3 billion hotel and retail project. Le Reve will combine the Maserati-Ferrari dealership with more predictable Italian leather and bespoke tailoring shops. 
Fred Leighton, the high-end Madison Avenue jeweler, says he never would have considered opening a store in Las Vegas -- until Mr. Wynn starting tempting him with the Bellagio, which opened in 1998. Before then, jewelry in Las Vegas often consisted of selling gamblers a horseshoe-shaped pin with mediocre diamonds, for less than $5,000. "Now, they think nothing of buying a half- million-dollar antique emerald necklace," Mr. Leighton said. "And they buy when they win -- and when they lose."
When they lose? 
"They want to show their wives that even though they lost, their lifestyle will remain the same," he said with a laugh. "That way, the wives will let them keep gambling."
According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the average amount each tourist spends on shopping -- $106 -- is still far less than the $607 tourists say they budget for gambling. But the amount people spend on shopping has grown almost 50 percent in the last five years, while the amount spent on gambling has grown only 18 percent.
Executives at the Forum Shops at Caesars, owned by Park Place Entertainment, say their Roman theme mall, an exhaustingly-long corridor of Gap-to-Gucci boutiques with a Trevi Fountain look-alike at its core, just surpassed the Bal Harbour Shops in Bal Harbour, Fla., as the nation's most lucrative retail development: the Forum says it brings in $1,310 in sales per square foot. A spokesman for Bal Harbour said sales there averaged $1,284 per square foot.
Las Vegas's momentum as a shopping destination faltered last fall after the terrorist attacks -- and, at the beginning of this year some developers said they had dropped rents 5 percent to 10 percent to lure some of the most prestigious vendors, but leasing has now regained its pace. A spokesman for the visitors authority said the number of tourists was expected to surpass 34 million by the end of the year, and developers said their rents were back to where they were a year ago. 
Mr. Schaeffer, president of Mandalay Resort, said his company was going ahead with plans to triple the retail space at Mandalay Bay. He said he still thought there was not enough shopping space, especially on the south end of the Strip near his three hotels -- Mandalay Bay, Excalibur and Luxor.
Mr. Schaeffer said that, besides his properties, there were four other south-end hotels -- the Monte Carlo, New York New York, MGM Grand and the Tropicana -- that, all together, total 23,600 rooms. "There is virtually no destination retail -- none -- at the south end," he said, using a trade term that means middle- and high-end tourist-oriented shopping. "Stuff they won't find in Des Moines and Indianapolis." 
The shoppers are no longer all tourists: the population of the metropolitan area, known as Las Vegas Valley, has doubled since 1989 to 1.4 million people, making it the fastest-growing region in the country.
Four thousand people move to Las Vegas every month and demographers predict the population may double again in the next 25 years.
Yet even in this paradise of sun and shopping, not every new mall is a big winner. 
Desert Passage, the mall adjacent to the new Aladdin, is generally considered a disappointment, although its developers contend it brings in $535 a square foot, well above the national average of $336. Some local residents blame a bad design -- its developers blame the bankruptcy of the Aladdin itself.
Despite the tourists and new residents, a few retail analysts and clothing executives wonder aloud whether, even now, the Strip has too many retail boutiques. 
Betsy McLaughlin, chief executive of the Hot Topic chain of clothing stores, which are oriented toward teenagers, decided against locating one of her 409 branches on the Strip itself. "The street is overstored," she said.
But to the shoppers standing around the Fashion Show waiting for the shops to open at 10 on a Wednesday morning, the Strip is exactly the place to be.
Clifford and Diana Arntz, from Massillon, Ohio, flew to Las Vegas for part of their 40th wedding anniversary celebration. To Mrs. Arntz, there can never be too many stores. 
"I came here shopping three years ago with my daughter, Natasha," Mrs. Arntz said. "And now it's even bigger." 
Mr. Arntz, who said the couple did not gamble, added, "I'm just here to carry Diana's shopping bags." 
A few shops away, Anne Halvorsen, 31, and Nicole Casci, 32, had just flown in from Reno, Nev. "In Reno, we don't have one-hundredth the number of shops," Ms. Halvorsen said. "We don't have the Pottery Barn, we don't have Abercrombie's or a Banana Republic or a Crate and Barrel or a Bebe -- nothing. 
"We try to have sort of an agenda," added Ms. Halvorsen, swaying slightly, eager to get shopping. "This time, our goal is work clothes: slacks, sweaters, tall boots, suede jackets -- they're very in this year." 
She paused for breath. "But it never works out that way," she said. "We just buy anything we like."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: REACTION ABROAD; 
Unwarlike Phrase Pleases Many Abroad

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Whether President Bush intended it or not, much of the world praised his speech on Iraq on Monday not for its toughness but for its suppleness, lighting upon the idea that he might not be fixated on going to war after all.
 A number of foreign officials and commentators chose to ignore the spy satellite photos said to show how an Iraqi nuclear plant had been rebuilt, the new charge that Iraq's unmanned aerial vehicles were intended to pinpoint American cities with biological and chemical weapons and the comparison of the threat from Iraq to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. 
 Instead, they focused on one line of Mr. Bush's half-hour speech: that the pending Congressional resolution giving him the right to use force if necessary "does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable." 
The front-page headline in Wednesday's issue of Le Monde read, "Iraq: Bush's War Is No Longer Inevitable."
The foreign ministers of Jordan and Egypt seized on the same statement by Mr. Bush. "We still believe that a military operation isn't imminent and that there's a chance for diplomatic moves to try to avert the dangers of such a war," Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher of Jordan told reporters in Amman.
After a meeting in Cairo between President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain, Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, was asked about Mr. Bush's remark that war was not inevitable. "These are important words," Mr. Maher said.
For several months, many countries have voiced more skepticism than support for Mr. Bush's stated goal of replacing Saddam Hussein as the leader of Iraq, and warned against a solo venture.
In Japan, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's spokeswoman, Misako Kaji, said Tokyo welcomed Mr. Bush's confirmation in the speech that it was important to pursue a United Nations Security Council resolution.
Although it is not clear whether there was a connection to Mr. Bush's speech, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said this evening that his country would support the French approach for a resolution that would not call for the automatic use of force but was "aimed at enhancing the performance of international inspectors in Iraq."
Mr. Ivanov added that it was too early to discuss a specific resolution, and that it was important that weapons inspectors be allowed to return after their four-year absence.
In Italy, the left-leaning daily La Repubblica characterized the speech as "an important concession to European allies." But the moderate daily La Stampa noted that the American economy was not doing well and that voters were concerned about it, implying that the Bush administration had an agenda beyond Mr. Hussein's removal.
The idea that American lust for oil is the overriding motive for war with Iraq has been a persistent theme in global opinion in recent weeks. A cartoon in Le Monde today showed Mr. Bush sending planes into Iraqi oil wells and a telephone to the United Nations with a severed line. "This is my strategy for fighting against terrorism," the cartoon president is saying.
For more than two hours today, the French National Assembly debated about Iraq with passion. Jean-Marc Ayrault, representing the opposition Socialists, charged that the United States "intimidates the international community" and said France should veto any Security Council resolution authorizing force.
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin retorted sharply that it was more important for France to forge a common position in the Security Council. "If France waves this veto, it will deprive us of influence and the capacity to be part of the international game," he said.
Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe, a close ally of President Jacques Chirac, called the United States a "very close friend," but warned: "You won't win alone. Beware messianism!"
With the election in Germany last month rocking German-American relations precisely over Iraq, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who campaigned on an antiwar platform, did not comment directly on Mr. Bush's speech. 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer chose to make only oblique comments, saying it was of "central importance" that the "Security Council forms one view and creates the basis for inspectors to be able to begin their work immediately, and on this basis to prevent a great tragedy."
In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has echoed Mr. Bush's tough line against Iraq, today emphasized the importance of the United Nations.
In China, the government reiterated that it disapproved of unilateral American military action, pressed Iraq to comply with all United Nations resolutions and called for the rapid return of arms inspectors.
In Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government was silent, and senior officials refused to discuss the speech on the record. Mr. Sharon ordered his ministers on Sunday not to speak publicly about Iraq. A senior official said today that any Israeli comment about the speech would only fan Arab claims that Mr. Bush was acting at Israel's behest.
In Baghdad, senior members of the Iraqi Parliament reacted angrily. "Your speech, Bush, is full of lies and full of unreasonable argument," Abdul Aziz Kailani, the head of the religious affairs committee, told Reuters. "You are just like a beast which wants to eat small countries, and while you should help them you want to destroy them."

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Loan Losses Rose Sharply 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Loan losses continue to rise at banks and other institutions, mostly because of faltering telecommunications and cable companies, according to a survey by bank regulators released yesterday.
 The total amount of sour loans rose by more than a third from a year earlier, the survey found, but only 11 percent were at United States banks. There were much greater increases at foreign banks and other lenders. Loans to telecommunications and cable companies accounted for about three-quarters of the total increase. 
 Regulators said they did not see an end in sight to the increase in problem loans. But analysts and investors said that severe losses would probably occur at just a handful of banks because most lenders had already sold the loans or added to their reserves if they expected losses.
Bank stocks have fallen sharply the last three weeks, after several companies announced that third-quarter results would be worse than expected partly because of problem loans.
J. P. Morgan Chase, the nation's largest corporate lender, set off the decline last month when it said that write-offs and additions to its reserve against potential losses on loans to companies would rise to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, up from $302 million in the second quarter. Other banks that have warned of rising loan losses include the Bank of New York, Comerica and Northern Trust .
Bank stocks have tumbled more than 12 percent since J. P. Morgan's announcement, according to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Banks index. Bank stocks rose 4.3 percent yesterday after the regulators released the report.
"We've had a little bit of hysteria here," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, referring to the decline in bank shares. In fact, he said, "most banks will have very modest increases in credit costs."
Shares of Bank of America, for example, have fallen 16 percent since J. P. Morgan's announcement. But analysts said they did not expect the bank to report a large increase in loan losses for the quarter. The bank had $3.7 billion in loans outstanding to telecommunications companies at the end of the second quarter, making it one of the larger lenders to the industry, although it has probably sold or hedged some of these loans in recent months.
The bank's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, told investors last month at a conference sponsored by Merrill Lynch that write-offs would be about the same in the third quarter as they were in the second quarter.
The survey, which is called the Shared National Credit Review, is conducted annually by the primary bank regulators: the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This year, it covered $1.9 trillion in loan commitments, including loans of $20 million or more divided among at least three institutions. Of these loans, the amount of classified loans, on which regulators say banks are likely to have at least some loss, rose $39.4 billion, to $157.1 billion. That represents an increase of 34 percent from last year's report. The review is conducted annually in May and June.
The increase, while steep, was smaller than that reported last year. In the 2001 review, problem loans rose 86 percent, or $54.3 billion.
The three regulators also placed $79 billion in loans in the "special mention" category. These are loans that are "in early stages of deterioration" and bear watching, said David Gibbons, a deputy comptroller for risk in the comptroller's office. The amount of loans in this category increased just 5 percent, after more than doubling the previous year.
"Certainly, the decline in the rate of increase is positive," Mr. Gibbons said. But he said he was not expecting a decline in the number of problem loans for several more months.
"We still have a lot of leverage in the system," he said. The average corporation has debt that is 6.1 times its cash flow, based on an analysis of Federal Reserve data. That is a greater debt burden than corporations carried during the last two recessions, Mr. Gibbons said.
"I don't think anyone could say with confidence that we are at a peak," said Richard Brown, associate director of risk analysis in the division of insurance and research at the F.D.I.C.
Some analysts following bank stocks were encouraged to learn that the rate of growth in problem loans was higher at institutions other than banks, a category that includes hedge funds or special portfolios set up to buy loans. Problem loans increased 68 percent in this group, and 39 percent at foreign banks. In keeping their growth in bad loans at 11 percent, United States banks showed their skill at reducing risk, in part by distributing portions of loans that they make to other institutions.
In addition, "banks have been very proactive about downsizing their loan books, getting borrowers to refinance their debt in the bond market, and extending maturities for the better borrowers," said Steven Wharton, an analyst with Loomis, Sayles & Company.
The problem loans were concentrated in the telecommunications and cable industries, a reflection of the bankruptcies of large companies like WorldCom and Adelphia Communications. Loans to these two industries accounted for about three-quarters of the increase in problem loans this year, the regulators said.
J. P. Morgan said that much of the write-off for the third quarter would be because of troubles in the telecommunications and cable industries. But most large banks have much less exposure in those areas, said Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
Telecommunications loans represent 2 percent or less of total loans at most banks, compared with 4 percent of total loans at J. P. Morgan, she said in a recent research report.

An article in Business Day yesterday about a survey by regulators that showed an increase in problem loans at banks and other institutions worldwide referred incorrectly to an 11 percent figure. That was the amount of the increase in such loans at United States banks -- not the share of soured loans held by American banks.

HEADLINE: Hot Way to Cool Off 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
If President Bush faces any downside to seeking an injunction to end the West Coast port shutdown, it is that he will face the wrath of organized labor.
Administration officials acknowledged yesterday they they were worried about angering -- and perhaps energizing -- labor unions just weeks before the November elections in which control of Congress is up for grabs.
 But administration officials said they had no choice but to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to end the shutdown because the harm it was doing to the economy was growing exponentially. Factories were closing, fruit was rotting and Christmas supplies were stranded in the Pacific. 
 Insisting they were mindful of labor's concerns, administration officials said they had acted with restraint. They noted that in the past, many presidents sought Taft-Hartley injunctions before a strike or lockout began. In the current dispute, the administration waited until 11 days after the port operators closed 29 ports, locking out 10,500 longshoremen. By the time Mr. Bush announced his course of action, the economic toll was painfully clear.
"I suppose one could look at this as all but inevitable," said Darren McKinney, spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers. On Friday, officials from various industries met with White House officials to detail the shutdown's steep cost. 
Ford imports 360 different parts through West Coast ports, while Dell Computer said it had only 10 days' worth of some computer parts left. One California military contractor said a custom piece of Japanese tooling that it needed to build tactical Tomahawk missiles was trapped on a ship off the California coast. 
Even some labor experts sympathetic to labor said they understood Mr. Bush's decision. "Was it prudent? " asked Michael LeRoy, a labor relations professor at the University of Illinois. "Sure. The timing of their intervention does not surprise me. I think the administration exercised restraint." 
For Mr. Bush, the advantages in seeking an injunction clearly seem to outweigh the disadvantages. At a time when opinion polls show that many Americans believe he has not done enough to address the nation's economic problems, his use of Taft-Hartley shows him taking aggressive action to remove a serious threat to the economy. By seeking an 80-day cooling-off period, he will also remove the threat of grave economic damage well before the elections. 
In remarks yesterday, Mr. Bush said: "Americans are working hard every day to bring our economy back from recession. This nation simply cannot afford to have hundreds of billions of dollars a year in potential manufacturing and agricultural trade sitting idle."
If Mr. Bush failed to act, he would have angered many businesses that have supported him. By acting now, instead of waiting several more weeks, Mr. Bush will also help ensure that retailers obtain billions of dollars in imports they need to stock shelves for the holiday season.
While weighing its moves, the administration was clearly worried about the downside of its decision -- angering labor. Those worries help explain why the administration worked so hard yesterday to urge the longshoremen and port operators to agree to a 30-day contract extension. That effort earned some praise from union leaders, and, had it been successful, it would have made Taft-Hartley unnecessary.
Now that the president has acted, labor leaders are saying they are furious. Unions dislike such back-to-work injunctions, viewing them as improper meddling in contract disputes and weakening labor's hand.
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. secretary-treasurer, said unions were so angry about Mr. Bush's move that many union members would consider it in deciding whether to vote Democratic of Republican this November.
"The president's kicking the can down the road past the election makes sense and doesn't make sense," said David Wellman, a labor expert at the University of California at Santa Cruz. "It gets him and the nation's retailers through the Christmas season, but at the same time, it angers labor, including the two unions, the Teamsters and the Carpenters, that the president has been courting."
A repeated problem with Taft-Hartley injunctions is that they do not guarantee a resolution of the labor dispute. When the cooling-off period ends, unions often resume their walkout. In this dispute, Mr. Bush is dealing with a famously militant union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which is known for slowing down work when it is unhappy. Some union officials have suggested that the longshoremen are so unhappy about a Taft-Hartley injunction that they might slow their pace of work when the ports reopen. That could mean more headaches for retailers, factories and Mr. Bush.
"The employers got what they wanted -- the ports will be reopened," said Richard Mead, president of the longshoremen's local in the San Francisco area. "We now have a new dock boss. His name is George W. Bush. Will the workers listen to Boy George? I don't know."

U.S. Assesses Afghans' Needs

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
The secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, arrived here today with a pledge that the United States would not abandon Afghanistan now that the Taliban are gone.
 Speaking to reporters at the heavily fortified American Embassy, Mr. 
Thompson said American support meant not only "forcing out oppressive regimes" but also "helping meet the everyday needs of your people." 
 Mr. Thompson also signed an agreement with the health ministry to help rebuild the country's medical services and improve delivery of health care, and he announced a volunteer program with the Afghan-American Physicians Association and the Afghan Medical Association to allow Afghan-American doctors to provide health care and teach medical courses here. 
None of these programs involve initial commitments of money beyond the $1 million that Mr. Thompson's agency spent here in the past year. The Agency for International Development has provided about $30 million for public health services. 
In an indication of the difficulty of delivering assistance, American officials said, Mr. Thompson's plans to provide as much as $500,000 worth of donated drugs and medical supplies seem to have fallen apart. 
Afghan health officials told the department that many of the items did not meet international standards, were inappropriate for Afghanistan or had expiration dates of less than two years, which Afghan officials said is not enough time for distribution.

HEADLINE: Reopening the Ports 

 BODY:
President Bush rightly intervened yesterday in the labor dispute between shipping companies and dockworkers that has shut down operations at 29 West Coast ports. The disruption of a substantial amount of the nation's trade posed a serious threat to an already ailing economy. 
 Government intervention in collective bargaining is never desirable, but the ports' closure since Sept. 29 is precisely the kind of threat to the national "health or safety" that Congress envisioned when it passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The law allows a president to seek a court-ordered injunction for an 80-day cooling-off period in the event of a strike or lockout. After determining that there was no chance of an imminent resolution to the 10-day-old lockout, President Bush ordered Attorney General John Ashcroft yesterday to seek the injunction. A federal court in San Francisco issued it later in the afternoon, clearing the way for the longshoremen to return to work. 
 Presidents have invoked the Taft-Hartley Act 31 times, though not in the last quarter-century. More recently the federal government has intervened under a different law in various railroad and airline labor disputes. Mr. Bush was fully justified. The present shutdown threatens to be more disruptive to the economy than the grounding of a single airline or industry. Auto plants are already closing for lack of spare parts, perishables have spoiled aboard ships stuck at sea and retailers are worried about deliveries of Christmas goods.
These ports are vital choke points for much of the country's trade. That is one reason the 10,500 longshoremen who operate them are among the nation's highest paid unionized workers. The main issue in their contract talks with the shipping industry is whether new jobs created by new technologies in dock operations should be unionized. 
National labor leaders were angry at Mr. Bush's intervention. Their anger is misplaced. While they are perfectly within their rights to defend their members' bargaining power, they must recognize that thousands of union jobs in other industries are also in the balance, and that most other presidents would have taken similar action under the circumstances. 
The shipping companies, for their part, may have counted on a presidential intervention when they ordered the lockout in reaction to an alleged slowdown after the collective agreement lapsed. They must now engage the union in good-faith negotiations during this 80-day cooling-off period.

HEADLINE: Lautenberg Plays Offense With Attacks On Forrester 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
After months of answering questions about Senator Robert G. Torricelli's ethics and a week fending off legal challenges to prevent Frank R. Lautenberg from replacing him on the ballot, Democrats finally found themselves in a position today to play offense in New Jersey's United States Senate race.
 Mr. Lautenberg clearly relished the opportunity, accusing his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, of using "character assassination" and legal obfuscation to distract voters from his conservative positions on issues like environmental protection, abortion rights and privatization of Social Security. 
 And when Mr. Forrester appeared on a radio program this morning and said that no gun control law could have prevented the random sniper attacks that have killed six and wounded two others in the Washington area in the past week, Mr. Lautenberg wasted little time adding gun control to the list. 
By midafternoon, Mr. Lautenberg was standing on the steps of the New Jersey State House, surrounded by gun control advocates, telling reporters at a hastily arranged news conference that Mr. Forrester was a pawn of the National Rifle Association who was out of step with state voters on the issue of gun violence.
"Doug Forrester doesn't understand New Jersey," Mr. Lautenberg said. "He doesn't understand the value we place on our families and our children."
Mr. Forrester's campaign disputed that characterization and, continuing the aggressive tone he has adopted since Mr. Torricelli withdrew last week, hammered away at Mr. Lautenberg's record on military affairs and defense issues. As Mr. Forrester toured the state, meeting with several veterans' groups, he criticized Mr. Lautenberg for opposing several military pay increases and defense budget increases, and for voting against the gulf war resolution in 1991, which authorized the invasion of Iraq.
"If he had his way, Saddam Hussein would be even more powerful today," Mr. Forrester said of Mr. Lautenberg. "And our families, and our allies, such as Israel, would be in even greater jeopardy than we are this very afternoon."
With Mr. Torricelli out of the race and the court challenges exhausted, today's tug of war over the campaign agenda offered a glimpse at the strategy each candidate is likely to pursue in the 28 days between now and the election on Nov. 5.
New Jersey residents have voted increasingly Democratic in recent years, and many polls show that the majority of voters favor traditional Democratic positions on social issues, the environment and gun control. Unburdened by the ethical baggage that weighed down Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Lautenberg intends to focus on those issues and cite his record as a three-term senator from 1983 until 2001.
Mr. Lautenberg said today that he was proud to have sponsored legislation to limit handgun sales at gun shows, restrict gun sales to one per month and require background checks for all gun purchases. He also warned that Republicans had blocked many similar pieces of legislation and that Mr. Forrester's position on the issue -- that the nation needs to strictly enforce the existing gun laws -- was identical to the National Rifle Association's.
"He believes in doing nothing," Mr. Lautenberg said. "He's in lock step with the N.R.A. Perhaps he thinks these things will cure themselves."
Rather than rebut those charges and dwell on issues that favor Democrats, Mr. Forrester has tried to focus on issues that he believes work to his advantage. Milling about at Mr. Lautenberg's news conference in Trenton was Mr. Forrester's campaign manager, who distributed a recent internal poll that found that the issues of most concern to New Jersey voters are terrorism, the prospect of war with Iraq and the economy.
Mr. Forrester made terrorism and war the centerpiece of his campaign today. He accused Mr. Lautenberg of consistently voting to cut defense and intelligence budgets.
In an effort to saddle Mr. Lautenberg with Mr. Torricelli's high disapproval ratings, Mr. Forrester has repeatedly referred to his opponent as "the Torricelli-Lautenberg machine."
"Basically, we are playing catch-up now in terms of our homeland defense because of the poor choices that were made by Senators Lautenberg and Torricelli," Mr. Forrester said.
At his news conference, Mr. Lautenberg later explained that he voted against the 1991 Persian Gulf war resolution because he agreed with Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that sanctions should be given more time to work before the United States decided to use military force. Once troops were dispatched to the region, Mr. Lautenberg said, he was the first member of Congress to visit them in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Lautenberg also said that he supported giving President Bush authorization to use military force to oust Saddam Hussein.
When a reporter asked Mr. Lautenberg whether the campaign was forcing him to move to the right on defense issues, he shook his head.
"I have always been to the right when it comes to defending this country, from the time I enlisted in the Army when I was 18 years old," he said.
By late afternoon, the Lautenberg campaign was distributing a new news release, titled "Doug Forrester's Record on Foreign Affairs and National Security." The rest of the page was blank.
Mr. Forrester was undeterred, however, and said that a senator needed sound judgment rather than just a long resume.
"The issue having to do with voting is an issue of wisdom, it's an issue of commitment, about what is good for America," Mr. Forrester said. "We have seen the voting record of the Torricelli-Lautenberg machine. We've seen it on all fronts. It's a bad voting record, and the people of New Jersey know that."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From the Debate in the Senate on Using Force Against Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate on Iraq yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times. The speakers included Senators James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont; Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho; Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana; Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut; and John McCain, Republican of Arizona.

Senator Jeffords
 I'm very disturbed that President Bush's determination that a threat from Iraq is so severe and so immediate that we must rush through a military solution. I do not see it that way. 
 I have been briefed several times by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, C.I.A. Director Tenet and other top administration officials. I have discussed this issue with the president. I have heard nothing, nothing, that convinces me that an immediate pre-emptive military strike is necessary or that it would further our interests in the long term.
Saddam Hussein's desire to acquire weapons of mass destruction is of grave concern. Based on the information that has been provided to me by this administration, I believe this threat is best dealt with in the context of the United Nations. The U.N. must aggressively move to ensure unfettered inspections and bolster its efforts to stop the proliferation of materials that can be used in the production of weapons of mass destruction. I urge the U.N. secretary, the Security Council to take immediate and strong action to deal with Iraq and its infractions.
Should Iraq fail to comply with the United Nations resolutions, it is incumbent on the United States to aggressively work with member nations to develop means to bring Iraq into conformance. But at this time I cannot in good conscience authorize any use of military force against Iraq other than in the context of the U.N. Security Council effort. 
If we receive information that the threat is more imminent or if the United Nations' efforts fail, then the president should come back to Congress for consideration of the next step. Providing the president with authorization at this time for unilateral U.S. military action would undercut the U.N. Security Council's efforts to disarm Iraq. We must ensure that any action we take against Iraq does not come at the expense of the health and strength of our nation or the stability of the international order upon which our economic security depends.
I spoke at length on the Senate floor last week about pressing problems that will determine the future strength of our nation -- inadequate, grossly inadequate, funding for education; declining access to affordable health care; degradation of the environment; and erosion of pension security for many hard-working Americans.
Mr. President, Saddam Hussein is as bad a dictator as they come. His past actions speak volumes about his true intentions. But is the only solution to this dilemma a military solution?
Experience tells us otherwise. Ten years of containment through enforcement of two no-fly zones and U.N. economic sanctions have prevented Saddam Hussein from rebuilding his military to any significant extent. With respect especially to our security, his military strength remains significantly weaker than when he moved against Kuwait more than a decade ago. There is much speculation about his weapons of mass destruction, but no evidence that he has developed nuclear capability and less that he could deliver it. 
While there is talk of cooperation with Iraq and Al Qaeda, I don't believe -- I doubt, rather -- that there has been some cooperation. I have not seen any hard evidence of any close cooperation. There is, however, a great deal of evidence of Saddam's paranoia and his distrust of all but his closest inner circle. He has wiped out any viable political opposition and tightly holds onto the reins of control. Even if he were to develop a nuclear capability, which he does not have, I have a hard time believing that Saddam Hussein would turn these weapons over to any organization, particularly a terrorist organization, after he has paid so dearly to acquire them.
Our greatest problem, it seems to me, is that we have very little good intelligence on what is going on inside Iraq. We know that Saddam Hussein's intentions are bad, but we don't have a clear picture of what his capabilities actually are or if they exist. 
Clearly, we need to get United Nations inspectors on the ground immediately. The inspectors must have unfettered access to suspected sites in Iraq. This is proving to be a major challenge for the United Nations. But the United Nations is much more likely to succeed if the United States is squarely behind its efforts, and not standing off at the side, secretly hoping that it will fail.
We should give the United Nations the opportunity to step forward and deal with Iraq and its infractions. In my estimation, the United States stands to gain more, much more, if we can work with the United Nations to deliver a multilateral approach to disarming Iraq, even providing military force, if necessary.

Senator Craig
Make no mistake that the acquiring of weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein is a very clear imminent and present danger to the United States, our allies and to the stability of the Middle East. 
To do nothing in response to this buildup of weapons and this threat would be irresponsible on the part of our nation and this body. We cannot sit back and wait on an aggressive act of terrorism to occur and consequently be forced into a position where we must face our fellow Americans and explain a horrific act that could have been prevented. It would be imprudent and irresponsible as a senator of the United States who is sworn to protect the freedoms of this great nation and to defend our fellow countrymen. In this new century, and in a post-9/11 era, it is clear we face a new threat. Unfortunately, this new threat requires a course of action previously not undertaken in order to deter this menace to our freedoms and to our peace. 
However, we must take this new course to defend our nation and our allies with understanding and with a nation united. 
Remember, this is a regime that ordered the use of chemical weapons against its own people, invaded two neighbors, committed genocide against more than 50,000 northern Iraqis, drove two million refugees into neighboring countries, launched ballistic missiles into different countries, destroyed over 4,000 villages in Iraq and on a daily basis fires at U.S. and coalition aircraft patrolling the United Nations no-fly zones. 
As a matter of fact, Madame President, since the year 2000, Iraq has fired upon U.S. and British aircraft over 1,600 times. This year alone, Iraq has fired on the United States and Great Britain 406 times.
These acts are just a tip of the iceberg of a long list of violations as Saddam Hussein attempts to provoke the United States and our allies. As a result, it is clear and evident we have a moral obligation to the international community to halt further threats and attacks by this dictator. 
Since Sept. 11 of 2001, many in Congress have asked the question why did the events of this day, Sept. 11, 2001, occur? And more importantly, how could these tragedies have been prevented?
Let me say that again. Many senators, and I'm one of them, have asked how Sept. 11 could have been prevented. . . . 
Today we must ask ourselves, in the future do we want, once again, to pose the same question that has now haunted us for over a year? 
When the civilian population of our country becomes the target, instead of our men and women in uniform, then an offensive role of foreign policy is demanded over what I believe is currently a defensive or a reactionary form of foreign policy. 
Since World War II, the United States has been the leader of the international world. We have made decisions, taken calculated risks and engaged ourselves where no other nation would. However, at the end of the day, we have always led and/or brought along our allies.
Once again, it is now evident the time is here for the United States to lead, and it is prudent for our allies to follow. And I believe most of them know that. 
Had we known the events of last year were going to occur, we would have made every effort to stop them, to save the loss of thousands of American lives. I'm certain that the people of this nation and this body would have called for and demanded all types of pre-emptive actions to stop the atrocities instead of just, as we did, helplessly watch them occur. 
But we were locked in what I believe was a post-cold-war mind-set that in part denied the obvious and rested on the false premise that it just simply couldn't happen in this country. 
Like previous warning signs seen throughout history, we are again witnessing the ominous warnings that Saddam Hussein intends to threaten the Middle East region of the country -- of the world -- and the United States. 
In light of this, I cannot sit back in good conscience and wait for Saddam Hussein to improve his weapons of mass destruction before he occupies and threatens foreign countries, or worse, harms Americans and America's interests and America's friends.

Senator Bayh
 Madame President, I ask all of us to consider if this debate had been conducted two years ago and my colleagues and I had laid a resolution upon this desk saying: "There is danger brewing in Afghanistan. It threatens the United States of America. We need to take it seriously and we must act before it's too late." All the arguments that are being made against the current resolution would also have been made at that time. And as we now know, the arguments would have all been mistaken. 
Madame President, they are mistaken today, as well. To those who say the threat is not imminent, as I suggested after 9/11, how long can we afford to wait? To those who say that regime change is not an appropriate reason for acting, I say that weapons of mass destruction and the regime of Saddam Hussein are one and indivisible. To remove weapons of mass destruction, we must remove that regime. To think anything else, I believe, is to delude ourselves. 
For those who believe that United Nations approval is necessary for our action, I say that it is preferential. But we cannot afford to give even that great body a veto power on America's right to defend itself. 
To those who say that we need allied support, I agree. But this is an argument of the chicken and the egg. It is only with American leadership and taking a strong hand in this instance that we will receive the kind of united allied support that we seek. 
To those who ask the question what will we do after our victory, I say, that is a good question. But can the regime in Iraq be worse? I think not. And we could begin to rebuild that country in a way that will provide a positive example to the people of that region about the principles and the ideals upon which America stands. 
Madame President, our eventual victory in the war against terror will be won as much by the values and the principles that we embrace and advocate as by the force of our arms. This gives us an opportunity to put those principles and values into action. 
And to those who say that we must exhaust all of our alternatives before acting, I would simply say that we already have. 
So in conclusion, Madame President, let me summarize by saying this. I and my colleagues support this resolution not because we desire war, but because it is our heartfelt conviction that this is the best and only path to preserve the peace. My colleagues and I support this resolution not because we favor the United States' acting alone, but because we know that by taking a strong stand it gives us the best opportunity to garner United Nations support and to rally our allies to our side. 
And we support this resolution, Madame President, because we believe that the lesson learned very painfully so tragically by our country on Sept. 11 of last year is that we wait in an era of mass terror at our peril.

Senators McCain and Lieberman

SENATOR McCAIN -- I'd ask my friend from Connecticut -- and I appreciate his remarks, its tone and, particularly, the content that really kind of lays out the parameters of this debate -- did the senator have a chance to see the president's address last night to the nation?

SENATOR LIEBERMAN -- I did.

SENATOR McCAIN -- Was it clear to the president -- to the senator -- that the president assured the American people that every option is being explored before a military option is exercised? I ask this question because I hear time and again from many Americans who either are opposed to any military intervention or have not made up their minds that they seem not to have confidence that the president is exercising every option. He's coming here to Congress to get approval from both houses of Congress.
And we will have significant debate. We have had significant debate, and we will have significant debate. We're working at the Security Council level. We're making it absolutely clear that tomorrow Saddam Hussein, if he did away with his weapons of mass destruction, destroyed the laboratories, allowed complete and intrusive and comprehensive inspections, would probably remove the threat that he now undergoes, that it is Saddam Hussein who has continued, for the last 11 years. 
So I guess my question to the senator, again, is do you think that the president's speech last night went some distance in convincing the American people that neither the president nor the senator from Connecticut or I or the senator from Virginia or the senator from Indiana choose the military option? That we are sending young men, American, into harm's way, as successful as this operation may be, we will still lose some brave young American's life. That's the reality of war. That's why we avoid it at all costs. 
So I think we need to talk, as we conduct this debate, about the fact that this is not the preferred option of the president of the United States or any member of this body. This is the last option. We can make the case that it is obvious that Saddam Hussein continues this buildup of weapons of mass destruction and his desire and effort, even up to and including nuclear weapons. But we are not the ones who are forcing this issue. The president of the United States in this resolution is not forcing the issue. It is Saddam Hussein who is forcing this issue. And we will, as we go through this debate and the conversations at the United Nations Security Council, make sure that we have exhausted every possible option. 
And I think this is a critical factor in getting the American people behind this resolution and behind the president of the United States and behind the men and women in the military.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN -- I thank the senator from Arizona for his question, Madame President. And of course I do agree with him that the president of the United States has made quite clear that he is asking us for this authority for us to dispatch our responsibility under the Constitution to give him the power to make war, if necessary. But he hopes, and clearly we hope, that that will not be necessary.
I hope that this is one of those cases where, as someone once said, the best way to achieve peace is to prepare for war. The best way to achieve compliance by Saddam Hussein with the promises he made at the end of the gulf war is to show that finally we are prepared to go to war once again to enforce those promises that he made. 
And I must say to my friend from Arizona -- I know he agrees with me -- this nation has been remarkably patient. The fact is that over the last decade or more we and the United Nations have tried just about every other conceivable way short of war to get the Iraqis under Saddam to keep the promises they made and to disarm.
We've tried sanctions, which have been so difficult, because of the way Saddam has carried them out on the Iraqi people. We have tried inspections. We have tried the oil-for-food program. We have tried limited military action. 
And none of it has worked to convince this brutal dictator to observe the rule of law and to keep the promises he made. So that we're, in one sense we might say that this is the moment of truth for him. And the challenge that the president has given Saddam and that this resolution, bipartisan resolution, which I hope and believe will achieve an overwhelming vote of bipartisan support by our colleagues here, this resolution finally says to Saddam: "Disarm. We don't want to go to war against you. Disarm or face war, because the danger you represent is so great."
And we can only hope and pray that that message will be heard in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT INVOKES TAFT-HARTLEY ACT TO OPEN 29 PORTS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush intervened in the 11-day shutdown of 29 West Coast ports today, successfully seeking a court order today to halt the employers' lockout of 10,500 longshoremen, because the operation of the ports is "vital to our economy and to our military."
 Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary injunction tonight that ordered the ports reopened immediately. 
 In seeking to suspend the shutdown for 80 days, Mr. Bush became the first president to successfully invoke the Taft-Hartley Act emergency provisions since President Richard M. Nixon sought to stop a longshoremen's strike in 1971.
Judge Alsup said he would hold a hearing in a week on whether to grant a full 80-day injunction. If he grants it, the dispute would be pushed past the Nov. 5 election, past the Christmas buying season and, perhaps, past the start of military action against Iraq. 
Mr. Bush said he was worried about the movement of military supplies. The Pentagon often uses commercial shipping lines to send supplies and equipment overseas, and those lines would undoubtedly fill that role from the busy West Coast ports if fighting erupted in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East.
The president sought the court order after Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao was unable to negotiate a 30-day contract extension to reopen the ports. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union agreed to a 30-day extension. But the employers' group acknowledged that it had rejected an extension, saying it feared that the longshoremen would engage in a work slowdown.
Mr. Bush's aides said he was reluctant to act, but feared that a continuation of the shutdown would undermine a sputtering economic recovery. Some economists estimate that it has already cost the economy more than $10 billion. News analysis, Page A24. 
"This dispute between management and labor cannot be allowed to further harm the economy and force thousands of working Americans from their jobs," Mr. Bush said in a hastily called announcement for reporters in the Rose Garden.
On Sept. 29, the Pacific Maritime Association, a group of port operators and shipping lines, shut the ports and locked out the longshoremen, accusing the workers of engaging in a slowdown. Union officials said the workers were merely observing safety precautions, because five longshoremen have died on the job this year. The union said the lockout was a management ploy intended to have the president intervene. Unions traditionally oppose back-to-work orders as government interference in contract disputes.
The major issue in this dispute is management's proposal to introduce new technologies to speed cargo handling. 
The union has said it will not accept the new technology unless all new jobs resulting from it are in union jurisdiction.
For the White House, the decision today was a difficult political calculation. With union leaders opposed to a cooling-off period, some of Mr. Bush's political advisers feared that the move might mobilize union members against Republican candidates less than a month from the midterm elections.
Several unions that Mr. Bush has courted say such injunctions undercut labor's power in contract disputes. 
"We're extremely disappointed," said Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the union that Mr. Bush has wooed most vigorously. "The whole strategy of locking out the workers and urging the president to invoke Taft-Hartley was clearly an employer strategy to get around negotiating a contract with these workers. It's a bad precedent. It gives management the upper hand.' 
Some White House officials argued that labor itself was divided on the issue. 
"With every passing day, as the harm to economy increased, the president leaned more and more in this direction," a senior administration official said. "It buys some time. It gets us past Christmas."
Moreover, there is a chance that Mr. Bush may reap some benefit. Many business groups lobbied for him to seek an injunction, and they have sounded the alarm about the shutdown's potential to damage the economy. 
Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, said: "The President has shown political courage and leadership. He has put national security and the economy first."
Mr. Bush made his announcement one day after appointing a board of inquiry led by former Labor Secretary Bill Brock to report to him about the damage caused by the shutdown of ports that handle $300 billion in cargo each year. The board gave Mr. Bush a report this morning that said, "We have no confidence that the parties will resolve the West Coast ports dispute within a reasonable time."
A New York Times/CBS News poll published on Monday reported that voters were increasingly disenchanted with Mr. Bush's handling of the economy. Although the White House has argued that there is little that a president can do to control the business cycle, discussion in the administration grew over the weekend that inaction would only contribute to concerns that Mr. Bush was too remote from economic worries.
In his brief Rose Garden statement, Mr. Bush said: "The crisis in our Western ports is hurting the economy. It is hurting the security of our country, and the federal government must act. Americans are working hard every day to bring our economy back from recession. This nation simply cannot afford to have hundreds of billions of dollars a year in potential manufacturing and agricultural trade sitting idle." 
Many business leaders praised the president for seeking a cooling-off period, noting that the amount of money separating the two sides, $20 million by some estimates, was infinitesimal compared to the damage the dispute done to the economy.
A spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers, Darren McKinney, said: "While the N.A.M. would have preferred the parties' coming together amicably and resolving the issue before governmental intervention became necessary, they failed in that and all the while the economy was being severely damaged. So we support the president's move."
Administration, management and union officials said the Labor Department solicitor, Eugene Scalia, contacted the heads of the union and the Pacific Maritime Association, the port operators' group, this morning to propose a 30-day contract extension. Several union leaders praised that approach, because it showed that the administration was seeking to heed union concerns and avoid invoking the Taft-Hartley Act.
An official in the talks said that the union agreed to a 30-day extension, but that the companies rejected it. Joseph Miniace, president of the operators' group, based in San Francisco, said in a telephone interview he could not accept such an extension when the longshoremen seemed quite likely to work at a slow pace when they were back on the job.
"A 30-day extension, while we believe it would be a good short-term solution, clearly does not answer the questions of what happens in the long term," Mr. Miniace said. "We have been negotiating for five months without a solution."
But when the maritime association ruled out the extension, administration officials decided that they had no option but to seek an injunction. 
Officials of the union accused the employers' group and the Bush administration of conspiring to order an injunction to weaken the workers' hand, an assertion that the administration and employers denied.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. also denounced the president's move. 
"We're absolutely furious," said Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "The P.M.A. locked the workers out, contrived a phony crisis and then gets rescued by the administration. They're getting their way and have the weight of the government behind them."
He said it was especially infuriating that the companies had rejected the extension proposed by the administration and then still had the administration do what it wanted, seeking an 80-day cooling off period.
The Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, allows presidents to seek injunctions against strikes and lockouts that "imperil the national health or safety." 
The act calls for a 60-day cooling-off period while mediators continue working with the feuding parties. Then the National Labor Relations Board has 15 days to poll employees to see whether they will accept management's final proposal and an an additional five days to tally the votes. If the workers reject the proposal, they can strike.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article yesterday about President Bush's intervention in a lockout that closed West Coast ports omitted part of two sentences in some copies. The passage should have read: "Union officials said the workers were merely observing safety precautions, because five longshoremen have died on the job this year. The union said the lockout was a management ploy intended to have the president intervene."

HEADLINE: Campaign Season; 
Parties Predict Upsets for Governor

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
Nearly all the races for the House and Senate this year promise to be blowouts, but most of the 34 races for governor are competitive. That means upsets are likely. B. J. Thornberry, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, and Kirsten Fedewa, spokeswoman for the Republican Governors Association, were each invited to pick three long shots, races where the conventional wisdom is that their party's candidate is losing but where they are betting their candidate will win.
 Here are their choices and their reasons for picking upsets: 

DEMOCRATIC PICKS
HAWAII -- Linda Lingle, the Republican, has been ahead all year, but she has peaked. Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono won a hard-fought primary and has cut Ms. Lingle's lead in half in a state that usually votes Democratic.

ALASKA -- Lt. Gov. Fran Ulmer, who packs a pistol in her purse, has spent months campaigning from village to village. Her Republican opponent, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, has been stuck in Washington. The top Republican on the Energy Committee, Mr. Murkowski failed to win approval of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.

ARKANSAS -- Voters hold Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican running for re-election, responsible for a $50 million budget shortfall. Jimmie Lou Fisher, the state treasurer for 22 years, has challenged Mr. Huckabee on the economy. Polls show her gaining on Mr. Huckabee daily.

REPUBLICAN PICKS

MICHIGAN -- Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus remains very much alive in his uphill fight against the Democrat, State Attorney General Jennifer Granholm. Mr. Posthumus has narrowed the gap, benefiting from the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and his support for tax cuts.

OREGON -- State Senator Kevin Mannix, a conservative, won the Republican primary against two moderates and has strong backing from business. He has raised large sums in the last two weeks and should be helped by the coattails of Senator Gordon H. Smith. The Democrat, former Justice Ted Kulongoski of the State Supreme Court, is considered too liberal for the state.

NEW MEXICO -- The Democrat, Bill Richardson, a former congressman and Clinton cabinet member, is on the defensive as a director of a software company under investigation by the government. State Representative John Sanchez is young (39) and articulate and has a Horatio Alger resume.

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD; 
A White Elephant Reincarnated

BYLINE:  By GWENDA BLAIR 

DATELINE: HARDWICK, Vt. 

 BODY:
WHEN John Makau called a Vermont real estate broker two years ago, he wasn't thinking trophy house. He simply wanted to build a summer home near Sugarbush. But Mr. Makau, a retired furniture manufacturer, couldn't round up a work crew. Then his wife, Lydia, saw a broker's ad with a small photograph. "There's your house, John," she said.
 Mr. Makau drove to this down-at-the-heels one-stoplight village, an unlikely spot for architectural adventure. But up a steep dirt road he caught sight of a white cagelike structure and fell in love. "Lydia was right," he said. "It was my house. It was in terrible shape and would need a lot of work. But I could see the bones." 
 The geometry of the house, with its stark horizontals and verticals and large expanses of glass, intrigued him. He had never heard of the designer, Peter Eisenman, one of the world's most provocative architects. Mr. Eisenman, best known for his body of architectural theory, has public projects that include the Wexner Center for the Visual Arts in Columbus, Ohio, the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin and a huge Galician cultural center being built in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. With Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl, he is also on a team (one of six) asked to come up with new plans for the World Trade Center site. 
By contrast, Mr. Eisenman's residential work is sparse and has sometimes been criticized as unlivable. In fact the original owners of the Vermont house considered it a disaster.
The house, with an adjacent barn and 110 acres of rolling meadows and woodlands, was on the market for years. When Mr. Makau saw it, priced at $147,000, he made an offer on the spot. The first inkling of what the Makaus had bought came after Ms. Makau's sister looked up Mr. Eisenman on the Internet and found a picture of the 2,800-square-foot house, labeled House II. It was one of a series of 10 designs, of which four were built, and was said to be an important modern building.
The description was an understatement. The four houses were legendary experiments in pure theory rendered on a domestic scale with notoriously mixed results. "This was Eisenman's first free-standing building, and it was a kickoff project," said Joseph Rosa, the Helen Hilton Raiser curator of architecture and design at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. "He was helping architecture rethink itself and become self-critical." 
The Makaus, who immigrated from the Netherlands in 1976 and now spend May through October in Vermont and the rest of the year in Florida, were thrilled over the house's provenance. But they still faced a massive renovation project on a house that had never been satisfactory to its owners.
Consider the couple who commissioned House II, Florence Falk, now a psychologist in Manhattan, and Richard Falk, an emeritus professor of international law at Princeton. The Falks and Peter Eisenman started talking at a Princeton cocktail party in the late 1960's. Mr. Eisenman was then known for contentious, densely written architectural manifestoes. He had completed one project, an addition to an existing Princeton residence, which he called House I.
Mr. Eisenman and Mr. Falk shared an interest in Noam Chomsky's theories of language and mused about what Mr. Eisenman called a Chomskyesque house. "I don't know what it meant," Mr. Falk said in a recent interview, "but it sounded good."
The Falks had purchased an old dairy farm in Hardwick for $22,000; Mr. Eisenman suggested they tear down the house and erect a Chomskyesque successor. "Peter can be very seductive," Ms. Falk said. "We were all dreaming together."
Mr. Eisenman said: "I worked my tail off on this house. I drew and drew and drew."
When the Falks returned from a California sabbatical, they found a catastrophe: a house with a flat roof, impractical in an area renowned for heavy snowfalls, and numerous skylights that leaked. Worse, positioned directly under the skylights were a series of openings through the upper floor, the smallest, 27 inches square, the largest, 27 inches by 12 feet. They created a remarkable sense of openness and light, but also a hazard for the Falks' 1-year-old son, Dimitri.
Then there was the wall thing -- more specifically, the lack of walls.
Between what passed for bedrooms were half-walls, and even in the bathroom there was no privacy. The softest whisper was audible everywhere. "Privacy was not a consideration for Peter," Ms. Falk said. "The house was all about space, the eye moving with nothing to stop it."
The result, Ms. Falk said, was a "wow" house that impressed visitors. "But they didn't have to live there," she said. "That was the difference." 
Still unfinished, the house had already cost far more than the Falks' $45,000 budget. "We couldn't afford to finish it, we couldn't live in it, and we couldn't sell it," Mr. Falk said. "Peter misled me, somewhat deliberately, about the economics."
Mr. Eisenman sees it differently: "I don't design houses with the nuclear family idea because I don't believe in it as a concept. I was interested in doing architecture, not in solving the Falks' privacy problems."
Sitting in his Chelsea studio, the architect, now 70, a barrel-chested figure with thick white hair, said he had shown the Falks plans and models for the house and that cost overruns are an unavoidable risk when embarking on a radical new design. The fact that he has never lived in such a high-concept house (he resides in the John Adams, a Greenwich Village 1950's white-brick co-op) seems to him beside the point.
In his view, he had delivered a house based on Chomsky's linguistic ideas, only to find that the Falks preferred something more conventional. Mr. Eisenman said Ms. Falk had complained to her husband that it wasn't a Heidi house, which Mr. Eisenman took to mean a Swiss chalet.
"If the Falks wanted a Heidi house," Mr. Eisenman said, still bristling after 30 years, "why did they hire me?"
The friendship ended and construction halted. A year later, Ted Zilius, a former toy designer, finished the project for the Falks by extending the half-walls between bedroom areas and around the bathroom, putting grates in the floor openings and filling in a number of skylights. In the mid-1980's, he replaced the remaining skylights and the flat roof with a slightly pitched roof, which reduced the leaks. 
For Richard and Florence Falk, the way light moved through the house helped compensate for the staggering maintenance costs. But living in what amounted to a large sculpture held no allure for Dimitri, now 32. "It would have made sense in Malibu, but in Vermont it was bizarre," he said. "It was like it had fallen out of the sky."
The unconventional look of the house branded him an outsider with local children, and the open structure made playing inside impossible, as his parents needed quiet.
In the mid-80's, the Falks separated and rented the house. Five years later, Ms. Falk put House II on the market. For 10 years it did not move, not even at auction. "When I called to ask about the house," Mr. Makau, now 75, recalled, "the realtor said, 'It's in such bad shape, you wouldn't want it.' "
That was a siren song. At one time, Mr. Makau made a living restoring houses along the canals of Amsterdam. After marrying Lydia, his third wife, in 1976, he began buying and fixing up homes, including a cattle ranch in South Carolina, an apartment in Stowe and an art gallery in Florida. "I can look through rotten things and see what's there," he said. 
Every day during the renovation, Mr. Makau was the first person to start working and the last to stop. "If you restore this type of building, you have to be there right behind the workmen," he said as he led a visitor around House II. "They want to do short cuts. If there's damage, they just want to cover it up." He declined to say how much the work cost, but did say, "sometimes it's cheaper to bulldoze than to renovate."
The first step was removing the paint. The original contractor had covered the external wood with a new silicone paint meant to seal out moisture; instead, it sealed it in, ruining the wood beneath. For six months, a local workman scraped and scraped. Meanwhile, other workers installed air-conditioning, a generator, a new water system and two new furnaces.
Although Mr. Eisenman seemed uninterested in talking when Mr. Makau called him about the house, the new owner took pains to respect Mr. Eisenman's intentions. Restoring his original emphasis on light and openness, Mr. Makau replaced one of Mr. Zilius's exterior walls with glass, and other walls between bedrooms with Plexiglas. They retained three dressers (one attached to a wall), two bookcases and bunk beds that Mr. Zilius designed and built.
Mr. Makau also added a small portico before the front door as a rain shelter, but it echoes the original lines of the house. His most significant departure is the addition of a chemically treated exterior baseboard, which interrupts the flat wall but eliminates the rot caused by placing plywood directly on the concrete foundation.
As if to keep the focus on the dramatic structure of the house, the Makaus have furnished it sparingly with contemporary pieces, including a small black leather couch and a larger beige sofa, a black leather and mahogany armchair and minimalist wood coffee tables Mr. Makau designed; they decorated it with his paintings and prints. 
Aside from a few area rugs, the highly polished wood floors are bare. Tucked in an alcove is Mr. Makau's one concession to comfort, a burgundy leather reclining couch where he and his wife watch television in the evenings. "We bought it to be lazy, not for the aesthetics," he said. 
The Makaus, who have no children underfoot and few visitors, do not mind the way noise carries; sometimes, Ms. Makau, 51, says, she considers it an advantage. "When I'm sitting upstairs at my computer," she said, "I can hear the TV news without having to go down and watch it."
Although the restoration was a nightmare at first, Mr. Makau is more than satisfied with the result. "I kept the whole style not to damage the architecture," he said. "If I sell you one of my paintings, I don't want you to go to another artist and say 'I want the nose a little longer and the ears different.' It's the same for an architect. It's an ethical thing."
And Mr. Eisenman seems, finally, to have gotten his ideal private client. Last New Year's Day, Mr. Eisenman and his wife drove up to look at the house and were impressed. "I was stunned by how beautiful the house looked, how classical," he said. "It was like a vision, like a resurrection. It was a fantastic house, and it still is."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE ART; 
Changing Channels, On the PC

BYLINE:  By David Pogue; E-mail: Pogue@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMONG the members of the Society of Working Americans Resenting Microsoft (Swarm), the chief gripe is that Microsoft has gotten obscenely rich by exploiting the innovations of others. Such people grumble that Microsoft rarely breaks new ground on its own.
 But a funny thing happened on the way to the recession: PC sales began to decline, and Microsoft set out to conquer new realms, like phones, game consoles and home-entertainment systems. Microsoft is hedging its bets -- and doing some interesting new thinking in the process. 
 Just yesterday, the company unveiled a specialized version of Windows bearing the almost endless name Windows XP Media Center Edition. (Maybe the next thing Microsoft should unveil is a new naming department.) 
XPMCE, as nobody will probably call it, is both an operating system and a list of hardware requirements for PC's that will bear its logo. The result is a PC that can also play music CD's and DVD movies, present slide shows of your digital photos, play back video clips from your camcorder, let you watch TV, and even record TV shows without tapes, much like a TiVo recorder.
If you're a hard-core PC user, you're forgiven for splurting your coffee at this description. Innovation? What innovation? With a couple of expansion cards, any modern Mac or PC can do all that. Sony's Vaio GigaPocket models have been performing such stunts for more than a year.
But using those products, you remain in PC-land as you do your television watching, music playing and slide showing. The taskbar and Start menu are always there to remind you that you're still using a PC, and you generally use a different program for each function. 
Microsoft's approach is very different. When you press the Start button on the included remote control (not to be confused with the Start button on the screen), the PC ducks into a phone booth and emerges moments later as Media Machine. The XP desktop is gone. In its place is a single, unified home screen bearing five key buttons: My TV, My Music, My Pictures, My Videos and Play DVD. (Corresponding buttons on the remote also summon these modes.)
At this point, you can do something with a Media Center PC that you can't do with any other PC: walk away from it. Microsoft designed the Media Center software to be viewed from across the room, using very large type against a pretty blue background. Furthermore, you can operate all of the screens using only the remote control, far from the mouse and keyboard. You're no longer watching TV on a PC -- the PC itself is now a TV. 
True, the word "My" in front of the buttons' names makes the whole thing feel vaguely like a joint venture with Fisher-Price. Fortunately, they lead to far more sophisticated realms.
For example, when you're playing music you've copied to your hard drive from CD's, the screen shows both the name of the song playing and a photo of the album cover. As with most software music players, this one offers customized playlists, shuffle mode, and so on. The only disappointment is that you can't copy songs from your CD's to the hard drive within Media Center. You have to duck back into Windows XP and use Windows Media Player to do that. 
Media Center makes a great companion for a digital camera, too. Its My Pictures module lets you organize your shots into folders that become full-screen slide shows at the touch of a button -- with music, if you like. Of course, the world is full of slide-show software. But the Media Center's version is so easy to use that casual, spur-of-the-moment displays of your digital scrapbooks become a realistic proposition for social occasions.
For many people, though, the juiciest feature is sure to be the TV module. Like TiVo, ReplayTV and other digital video recorders, it presents a television listings grid for the next two weeks, which the PC downloads from the Internet in the wee hours each morning (free). You page through it with your remote, clicking on the Record button for each show that looks interesting. (Press it twice if you want every episode instead of just one.) When the time comes, the computer records your shows onto the hard drive, ready to watch (or pause, or rewind, or fast-forward). You can even shrink the Media Center screen to a window in a corner of your screen, the better to "work" while keeping an eye on the game. 
Microsoft's original intention, incidentally, was to trap your shows forever on the PC that recorded them. Recordings wouldn't play back on any other PC or DVD player (you can burn saved shows onto a blank DVD). Once word got out that Microsoft intended to cozy up to Hollywood rather than serve its customers, however, computer fans went ballistic. 
At the eleventh hour, Microsoft reversed itself -- sort of. In the revised, somewhat complicated scheme, you'll be able to play your recorded shows on any other PC using Windows Media Player 9. Even then, though, the DVD's you burn won't work in DVD players. That, Microsoft says, will require new versions of DVD software due "before the end of the year." 
(Microsoft also warns that more and more shows may soon be copy-protected by their creators. Recordings of these shows will indeed remain locked forever on the Media Center PC that recorded them.) 
Windows XP Media Center Edition isn't sold in stores. You can buy it only pre-installed on a new, specially configured PC -- at first, only from Hewlett-Packard or Samsung -- that bears the Media Center logo. 
HP's simply named Media Center PC, for example, goes on sale Oct. 28 in configurations from $1,500 to $2,000 (plus monitor). That's certainly at the high end of PC pricing, but this is a high-end PC if there ever was one. On the top model, for example, the elegant, black plastic front panel offers FireWire inputs for a camcorder, both a CD-DVD burner and a CD-ROM drive, four kinds of slots for digital-camera memory cards, and one of five U.S.B. 2.0 connectors. The specs are also high-end: a 2.66-gigahertz Pentium 4 processor, a 120-gigabyte hard drive, 512 megabytes of memory, a TV input (for antenna, cable or satellite receiver), two video outputs for watching live and recorded shows on a real television, a five-speaker sound system, and even a volume knob -- yes, a real knob -- right on the keyboard. 
It all works smoothly and simply, and you get to bask in the delighted first reactions of your pals. Still, the more you work with a Media Center PC, the more one question haunts you about the whole concept: What kind of nerd would watch television at a desk?
For years, analysts have debated whether or not televisions and PC's will someday converge. The doubters point out that the two activities are fundamentally different. TV-watching is a passive, turn-off-the-brain affair, whereas using a PC requires mental effort. One is a lean-back activity, the other lean-forward.
With its large-type screen design, Microsoft has taken a first major step toward solving that problem. In entertainment mode, a Media Center PC is, indeed, a couch potato's appliance. 
Even so, there's the little problem of placement. A PC usually goes on a desk, with a surface for a mouse and a chair immediately in front of it. It belongs in a work environment. It would look ridiculous in a wall unit.
A television, on the other hand, generally goes into a living environment, with no mousing surface or adjacent chairs. Does anyone really want a bulky plastic computer case, with its rat's nest of cables, as the focal point of the living room? 
Even Microsoft acknowledges that the Media Center isn't for everyone. The company is careful to suggest locations for Media Center PC's like teenagers' bedrooms, dorm rooms and tiny apartments. 
If the placement conundrum doesn't bother you, you'll find the Windows XP Media Center Edition nicely designed and really fun to use. In fact, you may like it so much that you'll trade in your Swarm card for a membership in AGAMOTWCR.: Americans Who Grudgingly Admit That Microsoft Occasionally Takes a Worthwhile Creative Risk.

HEADLINE: HOW IT WORKS; 
Video on Demand Is Ready, but the Market Is Not

BYLINE:  By SUSAN KARLIN 

 BODY:
FOR years, video on demand has been a couch potato's dream. By pushing a few buttons on the remote control, a viewer would be able to order a movie and then sit back and watch as it unfolded immediately on the screen, pausing, rewinding or fast-forwarding at will. Movie-watching would be on the schedule set by the viewer, not the broadcaster or cable company. No need even to get up from the couch to insert a tape or DVD.
 That has been the promise, and the technology to provide video on demand to television sets is well established. But the service is still very much in its infancy, and economic factors are largely to blame. 
 Viewers need better programming -- like recent popular movies -- before they will flock to video on demand. Studios need better security against video piracy before supplying their most popular movies, but quality encryption is costly and raises the price of the electronic components and set-top boxes that viewers need. And cable companies need more viewers to offset the expense of improving the technology for encryption, compression and set-top boxes. 
 "I've seen various business models for V.O.D. and the numbers just don't add up, so no one is doing it in a large-scale way," said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps/Media Technology Strategies, a New York consulting company. 
 There are currently four million cable customers who use video on demand, and another three million are expected to sign up by the end of the year, said Joe Boyle, vice president for corporate communications of InDemand, a company that distributes content to cable operators. But there are about 70 million households with cable television in the United States, and analysts estimate that widespread adoption of video on demand by cable companies will take anywhere from 3 to 10 years. 
 If companies can make it work, the projected market for first-run movies alone is about $640 million by 2006, according to Jupiter Research. So cable companies like AT&T Broadband, Comcast, Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Cablevision Systems are slowly testing or deploying video on demand as part of their digital cable services in some parts of the country. 
 Video on demand makes use of a server computer that contains video files and software to let more than one viewer have access to the video at a time. One model, the n4x made by nCube, a major provider of video-on-demand services, allows up to 53,000 viewers simultaneous access to the same movie or other video content. The video is sent by cable or fiber optic connection from the servers to a set-top box connected to the home television. 
 Video files are compressed to take up less space and transfer faster. Currently, video is compressed according to MPEG-2 standards, although efforts are being made to advance to the MPEG-4 standard, which can be more than 10 times as efficient.
 The Internet is another conduit for video on demand, streaming delivery of television shows, music videos and other programming to home computers. (On-demand delivery to hand-held devices, as well as via satellite or airwaves, is in the more distant future.) There are a number of relatively new video-on-demand sites like Intertainer, CinemaNow and the forthcoming Movielink, an Internet video-on-demand venture from five major movie studios. But analysts say most viewers are unlikely to want to watch full-length movies on their computers or hand-helds. "Consumers are more likely to watch short-form content," said Lydia Loizides, a Jupiter Research senior analyst.
 Instead of streaming, a cheaper and faster option is downloading video files to users' hard drives. But downloading also increases the potential that the file will be copied -- a frightening prospect for movie studios. Video files can be encrypted, but encryption schemes can be overcome. "There is no such thing as hackproof encryption technology," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "The question is which type causes the least amount of damage once it is hacked."
 Whether it is delivered to a television set, a computer or a palmtop, video on demand will depend on the quality of the content -- beyond first-run movies -- to be successful. The way that content is marketed will be important, too.
 "Current fare is what drives traffic, so the question then becomes how to refresh old shows and movies," said T. S. Kelly, an analyst with Nielsen/NetRatings. "You need a middle ground between cable's airing movies in an exclusive window and the Internet's making information available anytime. There has to be significant marketing and promotion to make all this old programming an event. Otherwise it becomes just a dusty old library."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Pizza Not Included"Video on demand, technology that allows viewers to order and immediately watch a movie or television program, is available over the Internet or from cable systems that offer digital services. Internet video on demand works by streaming or downloading video files to a computer. The cable version uses large server computers that can make the same movie available to thousands of viewers simultaneously. 1) Providing contentFilms and television programs are packaged for video-on-demand services by the studios or by independent content aggregators. For a given movie, the package includes the movie itself and images and text for the on-screen menus that viewers use to select movies the electronic equivalent of the box that a VHS or DVD movie comes in. Digital video files are sent by satellite to cable operators around the country. 2) At the cable companyVideo files are received from the satellite by a computer often referred to as the catchers mitt. This is connected to the server computer that is the heart of the video-on-demand operation. The server takes a movie file from the catchers mitt and strips it across the servers many disk drives, loading a small portion of the movie on each one. This way, thousands of viewers can have access to the same film at the same time. If each drive contained the entire movie, the system would be able to accommodate far fewer simultaneous viewers. 3) At homeA two-way set-top box hooked up to the television is the means by which the viewer chooses and orders a movie or program, usually with a remote control. The choice goes back to the head end, where the server instantly begins sending out the video data from the first hard drive. The signal travels through cable usually fiber-optic first, branching into coaxial back to the set-top box. As the viewer watches, the servers software seamlessly switches between hard drives, allowing uninterrupted viewing or pausing, fast-forwarding and rewinding as desired. The server makes the program available for a specific period of time, often a day or two, so that the viewer can stop viewing and resume at a later time. Cable operator head endVideo-on-demand servers are usually scalable, meaning the number of processors and drives can be expanded as the number of subscribers increases. Some servers can handle up to 50,000 viewers watching the same program simultaneously. The server also handles billing data and other information, like the amount of time still available for each viewing. Internet sites use servers to stream video files or upload them to viewers computers. The files travel in packets over the Internets system of nodes. VIDEO-ON-DEMAND SERVERThe server includes many hard drives, each containing a small portion of each of the films offered. The server sends the film to different customers, switching between hard drives as needed. (Source: InDemand, nCube Corporation) Drawing (Gorka Sampedro/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: JetBlue Opens Brash Challenge to Southwest 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
After warily circling each other, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines are finally stepping into the ring, the veteran prizefighter vs. his eager protege.
 Hip JetBlue, just two and a half years old, is starting service today on two new routes from the sleepy airport in Long Beach, Calif., that will compete just about head-on with Southwest, the inspiration for JetBlue and an entire generation of low-cost carriers. 
 In flying those routes -- five daily flights to Las Vegas and one to Salt Lake City -- JetBlue is ramping up its challenge in a California market that Southwest has grown to dominate in the last two decades.
The carriers say that their low fares draw new customers to air travel, and so one's gain may not be the other's loss. Moreover, because Southwest flies not out of Long Beach, but out of the four other airports in the Los Angeles area, JetBlue represents a distinct choice for fliers. 
Still, if the face-off turns into a battle above this land of strip malls and stucco houses for the same pool of passengers, experts say, it poses sharp risks for both Southwest and JetBlue, which have emerged during the industry's steep downturn as the country's two most profitable airlines.
JetBlue, they say, faces the greater danger of a knockout -- like Shuttle by United and others that have taken on Southwest in California -- because it does not have a large enough national operation to cover the losses from a vicious fare war in the West. 
"If JetBlue has any sense, they'll try to avoid Southwest on many of their flights," said Robert Lamb, a professor of management at the Stern School of Business at New York University who has studied the business strategies of airlines.
"At some point, it's a losing battle to compete on price against a discounter," he said. "When you look at Kmart or Wal-Mart or any discounter, where they don't compete, their prices are invariably 5 to 10 percent higher. Where they compete, their prices are identical and have almost no profit margin."
Southwest, though, could end up ceding not just some of its precious West Coast revenue to JetBlue, but some of its image as the trendy alternative airline to fly.
"I think in this particular arena, there is a positive 'new kid on the block' effect that JetBlue will enjoy some advantage from," said John A. Quelch, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School who sits on the board of EasyJet, a British clone of Southwest.
The potentially bruising West Coast rivalry started when JetBlue, based in Kew Gardens, Queens, began flying nine daily flights from Long Beach to Oakland on Sept. 6. It is counting on its fleet of new Airbus A320's with their leather seats and live satellite television to offer a distinct alternative to Southwest's aging, utilitarian Boeing 737's and no-frills service. 
As the two airlines continue to expand, it is inevitable that they begin to compete, experts say, because both need to aim at population-dense areas to support their point-to-point style of flying. 
"The opportunity was too ripe," Alex Wilcox, JetBlue's director at Long Beach International Airport, said of the move into Southern California. "We're a contrarian airline, and we're an opportunistic airline."
David Barger, chief operating officer of JetBlue, said the airline's strategy is to balance out short-haul routes with transcontinental routes. Starting short-hop operations in California seemed natural after the carrier had already established itself on the East Coast, he said.
Till-now-invincible Southwest -- which operates from the Los Angeles International, Burbank, Ontario and Orange County airports -- refuses to acknowledge that JetBlue poses a potential threat, or that the two carriers might be drawn into a bloody bout.
But its press officers often half-jokingly drop lines like, "Don't even mention that other airline." And in July, when JetBlue announced its plans to offer $19 restricted one-way fares on its Long Beach-Las Vegas route, $29 on Long Beach-Oakland and $49 on Long Beach-Salt Lake City, Southwest immediately matched those prices at its own Southern California airports and cut fares on other California routes.
Last quarter, revenue from Southwest's California operations accounted for 24 percent of the carrier's $1.34 billion in total revenue, the most of any region.
"We've got a very, very strong brand that we've built up over the years," said Richard Sweet, senior director of marketing and sales for Southwest. "We've got tremendous loyalty. We provide frequent service, on-time service. There's not a lot of need to differentiate our product from JetBlue or anything else."
There is no need, that is, as long as there are enough budget-conscious travelers to support two major low-cost airlines in the state. It is too soon to tell if JetBlue will cannibalize Southwest's customer base; some industry experts say that Long Beach, a city of about 462,000, might represent a distinct enough market that the two carriers end up serving different customers.
Still, it will be hard for Southwest to ignore JetBlue, which has grown to serve 20 cities since it began operating from 3 cities in February 2000.
JetBlue's founder and chief executive, David Neeleman, started the airline on the premise of one-upsmanship over Southwest. Why not offer travelers the same low fares, he mused, but throw in amenities like assigned seating? Mr. Neeleman worked for the Dallas-based Southwest for five months after it bought Morris Air, a discount airline he co-founded, in 1993.
He has demonstrated the same acumen for marketing as Herb Kelleher, Southwest's former chief executive. Few companies during the recent economic gloom have created the kind of word-of-mouth that has pumped up JetBlue's market valuation to the second highest in the industry -- $1.27 billion versus Southwest's $8.97 billion. Yesterday, shares of JetBlue dropped 16 percent, to $30.15, and Southwest shares dropped 5 percent, to $11.60.
JetBlue's advertising messages try to be hip and knowing, if occasionally obscure. A billboard at Oakland International Airport proclaims "Eight Is Not Enough," a reference to a popular 1970's television sit-com, in promoting the airline's nine daily flights between Oakland and Long Beach.
Those flights serve two purposes, Mr. Wilcox said. One, they have allowed JetBlue to quickly use a third of its 27 slots at Long Beach, staving off demands from American Airlines and Alaska Airlines that the city free up the slots. Two, the flights help generate buzz about JetBlue, which hopes that Californians will eventually fly the airline's more profitable long-haul routes, like Long Beach to John F. Kennedy Airport; a fifth flight is being added to that route today.
"You can look at this as marketing for our transcontinental flights," Mr. Wilcox said.
Of course, JetBlue has to weigh the potential benefits of achieving those goals versus the costs of running the flights.
Mr. Wilcox declined to say whether the Long Beach-Oakland flights were profitable yet, but said the company needed to sell about 65 percent of the seats to break even. On a recent Tuesday morning flight to Long Beach, about a quarter of the 162 seats were filled; a return flight during the evening rush was equally sparse.
"This was very rapid growth for us," Mr. Wilcox said of the recent expansion in California.
On Monday, JetBlue announced that the percentage of seats filled systemwide last month was 75.8 percent, better than Southwest's 56.8 percent or the average 67.6 percent for traditional full-service carriers. Over the last year, the airline has more than doubled its capacity, while most of the full-service carriers have cut back.
Before last month, the closest that the two had come to competing on a nonstop route was the Baltimore-Fort Lauderdale, Fla., flight of Southwest and the Dulles International-Fort Lauderdale run of JetBlue. But those two Washington-area airports are too far apart to serve as weather vanes for what might happen in California. On Sept. 15, Southwest started its first transcontinental route -- Baltimore-Los Angeles -- which could vie with JetBlue's Dulles-Long Beach run.
Youth has its advantages, at least in the airline industry. JetBlue's new planes can be flown often and have relatively low maintenance costs. Its employees have not been unionized, a development that would inevitably drive up the cost of labor. One of its biggest challenges will be maintaining a healthy balance sheet as it ages.
In the meantime, Professor Lamb said, "it's going to give Southwest a run for its money because it has a different demographic, it has a different range, and that differentiation is vital to its potential success."
He added that JetBlue could carve out its own niche by working to woo the many business travelers who are disenchanted with the astronomical fares of the full-service carriers but hesitate to dive into the perceived "cattle car" experience of Southwest.
Eric Henderson, vice president for supplier relations at Rosenbluth International, the country's third-largest corporate travel management company, said more and more clients ask about JetBlue. But fewer than 10 of Rosenbluth's 1,500 clients regularly book seats on the airline through corporate accounts, he said.
For now, at least, fliers tend to be more like Sarah Josephson, a 30-year-old film editor from Berkeley, Calif., who often flies JetBlue out of Oakland.
"JetBlue is consistently cheap, so that's the main pull," Ms. Josephson said. "Having said that, I find that their service is much better than anyone else's. It's clean and it's very efficient and dependable, as opposed to other airlines where you sometimes don't know if your luggage is going to come."
Oh, and she does not mind the free bags of blue potato chips, either.

PERSON: Albert A. Walsh 

HEADLINE: Albert Walsh, Who Created Cheaper Housing, Dies at 74 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Albert A. Walsh, a top New York housing official in the Rockefeller and Lindsay administrations who helped bring public and private interests together to build cheaper housing, died yesterday in Red Bank, N.J. He was 74 and lived in Red Bank.
 The cause was lung cancer, his daughter Nanette Walsh said. 
 In a tumultuous era of change in urban housing, Mr. Walsh fought at the front lines for nearly half a century, helping draft the Mitchell-Lama housing aid legislation when he was a private lawyer and later administering it as both a state and city official. He became a prominent national spokesman on housing. 
In the Rockefeller administration, he oversaw the state's low-rent, middle-income housing and urban renewal programs, among others.
Then, under Mayor John V. Lindsay, he was chairman of the city's Housing Authority at a time when its residents were becoming poorer and public funds scarcer. He helped persuade Washington to subsidize the expenses of public housing for the poor, as well as its construction. He also made social services, like addiction counseling and child care, part of New York's public housing.
He then was chairman of the city's Housing and Development Administration, overseeing the construction of thousands of apartment units for middle- and low-income people.
He was also an advocate of new approaches to help housing at a time the older ones were losing political steam. In 1976, at a conference of 2,000 housing and community activists in Washington, he proposed what he called a national development bank to channel billions of dollars of pension funds into housing.
"He was a major figure, not just in New York State but in the country, in the field of affordable housing," said Richard Ravitch, co-chairman of the Millennial Housing Commission, a group of 22 housing experts that has extensively studied national housing needs. "He was one of the genuine experts," Mr. Ravitch said.
As both a private lawyer and public official, Mr. Walsh did not see private real estate interests as the demon many liberal housing advocates perceived. His forte was bringing builders, advocates, intellectuals and bankers together to further his deepest passion: low-income housing.
From disputes in New York neighborhoods to high-level conclaves of experts, the tall, amiable Mr. Walsh worked easily with low-income housing advocates like Clara Fox, said Louis Winnick, a senior consultant at the Fund for the City of New York.
"When two people were arguing across the table, he'd be the mediator," said Mr. Winnick, who worked with Mr. Walsh in various jobs since 1959.
Mr. Walsh was also capable of taking positions not shared by his fellow Republicans, much less the wealthy developers who were his clients as a lawyer after he left government in 1972.
"He was always committed to the idea of some public ownership of housing, even in recent years when everybody was attacking public housing," Ms. Fox said.
His grand vision was that impoverished areas of the city might again blossom.
"The ultimate goal, yes, is to encourage the middle class of whatever race to come back to the areas they fled from," he said in an interview with The New York Times after his appointment as the city's Administrator of Housing and Development in 1970. But he also warned against too-rapid gentrification.
"You have to be careful that you don't generate a kind of land boom in the area that drives everyone out," he said.
Albert Anthony Walsh was born in Yonkers on Jan. 13, 1928. He attended Cathedral High School in Manhattan and then Charles E. Gorton High School in northern Yonkers. He completed a semester at Fordham College before enlisting in the Navy and served on a submarine in the years immediately after World War II. He returned to graduate from Fordham and Fordham Law School.
He began to practice law and worked on Republican campaigns in Westchester County. After helping Nelson E. Rockefeller win the 1958 election for governor, Rockefeller appointed him assistant counsel in the Division of Housing and Urban Renewal. He rose to counsel and deputy commissioner of the agency.
Mayor Lindsay appointed him chairman of the New York City Housing Authority in 1967, putting him in charge of 157 projects, with 143,000 apartments and more than 533,000 tenants.
In an interview with The New York Post, he said, "The important thing to do is to humanize the program, to sort of make it become the real civic asset it was during the early days in the 30's and 40's."
One of his tangible achievements was to increase the federal cost limit of $3,150 for building each apartment room. He got it raised to $4,200.
Mr. Walsh was then appointed head of the city's new housing agency over objections from Democrats and Liberal Party members who resented his Republican affiliation. Though he personally opposed rent control, he said that it was not the sole reason for keeping owners' income so low that housing decayed.
Mr. Walsh was president of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials in 1971-72. At various times, he was on the boards of the New York City Educational Construction Fund, the United Nations Development Corporation and the Roosevelt Island Development Corporation.
A biography prepared by his law firm, Seward & Kissell, said that Mr. Walsh concentrated on municipal bonds in addition to real estate matters in his private practice.
He is survived by his wife, Nan; his sisters Roslyn Gilligan of Pittsburgh and Marie Albert of Wilmington, Del.; his daughters Maryellen Walsh of Cross River, N.Y., and Nanette Walsh of Manhattan; his son, Mark, of Rye, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.

 BODY:
WOULD you lend a complete stranger $10,000? How would you get your money back?
Trusting people you don't know with large sums may sound like the height of foolishness. But a modern economy depends on exactly such impersonal exchange.
 Every day, people lend not thousands, but millions of dollars, to strangers with every expectation that they'll be repaid. Vendors supply goods and services, trusting that they'll be compensated within a reasonable time. 
 How does it all work?
Traditional economics tends to assume away that basic question. On the blackboard, supply and demand meet without a doubt that supplier will really deliver or that demander will pay.
A lively field of economics with an unfortunately clunky name looks behind the blackboard assumptions.
The new institutional economics studies how people arrange their affairs; how they create institutions, including legal sanctions, social norms and organizational structures, to govern their relationships; how those institutions spur or hinder economic growth; and how those institutions improve through trial and error.
The International Society for the New Institutional Economics (www.isnie.org) recently held its sixth annual meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attracting about 200 economists and other social scientists from 40 countries. Once a heterodox challenge to convention, this field is increasingly part of the mainstream.
It asks deep theoretical questions and ties those questions to pressing empirical realities, most notably how formerly Communist countries can successfully make the transition to markets.
Researchers look at economic activity through what Oliver E. Williamson, a former president of the society, calls the "lens of contract."
"The lens of contract focuses predominantly on gains from trade whereas orthodoxy is focused on resource allocation (prices and output)," writes Professor Williamson, an economist at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.
To the "science of choice" developed by traditional economics, the new institutional economics adds a "science of contract."
To understand how contracts work, it helps to examine problem cases where contract law is underdeveloped or contracts are hard to enforce.
In a paper for the conference, the economic historian Avner Greif of Stanford looks at how merchants in the late Middle Ages developed institutions that allowed a commercial revolution.
"How," he asks, "could a creditor from one corner of Europe, for example, trust a debtor from another corner, about whom he knew little and who could avoid interacting with him in the future, to pay his debt?"
The answer was the community responsibility system, in which every member of a community was liable for every other member's debts. If someone in Community A didn't pay what he owed, Community A had the choice to either cease trading with Community B or compensate it for the damage and seek retribution from the individual.
Because communities wanted to maintain trading relations, they policed their own.
As trade flourished and communities grew, however, the system began to break down. The costs to an individual who cheated shrank, while larger merchants had to bear a high cost for other people's cheating.
Communities abandoned the old system. In 1279, for instance, Florence, Venice, Genoa and other cities agreed not to hold any person or his goods because of someone else's debts. They also agreed to imprison debtors who fled to their towns.
Over time, new forms of enforcement developed, forcing creditors to evaluate borrowers by using indicators of their individual merits. But the community responsibility system provided the institutional scaffolding that made the expansion of trade possible. Even without centralized law, it was possible to make enforceable contracts.
Turning to the present, Guido Friebel of the Stockholm School of Economics and Sergei Guriev of the New Economic School in Moscow offer a provocative argument about an extralegal contract: the payments illegal migrants promise traffickers who arrange long-term, long-distance moves from, say, China to the United States or Europe.
It costs an illegal migrant as much as $35,000 to go from China to the United States and $25,000 to go to Europe. (This research does not apply to short-haul migration like that involving the United States and Mexico.)
But these are mostly poor people who can't possibly pay that much in advance. Instead, they make a down payment and agree to work a certain term -- for Fujian Chinese, the average is 26 months -- to repay the rest.
On arrival, they become temporary slaves or, as they were known when America was settled, indentured servants. But in contrast to colonial times, these days these contracts aren't legally enforceable.
In theory, the immigrants could run away once they were in the country. They don't escape, however, because they fear deportation. Their illegal status acts to enforce their contracts.
(Traffickers generally keep their deals because they face competition in the home country. A bad reputation would cost them future business.)
Tightening immigration enforcement paradoxically supports indentured servitude and, hence, illegal migration. By contrast, Professors Friebel and Guriev argue, making legal immigration easier could actually reduce low-wage migration. Traffickers would have less leverage to collect debts and wouldn't be as likely to finance poor migrants. But more affluent, higher-skilled people would be able to immigrate legally.
These are two small examples of a much larger phenomenon: When the rule of law is absent or imperfect, people find other ways to make contracts workable. But those alternatives may be unstable or inefficient.
"Whatever the rules of the game," Professor Williamson writes, "the lens of contract is also usefully brought to bear on the play of the game."

HEADLINE: Big Hopes for Commuting by Bike 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
For decades the bicycle industry has drawn its inspiration from the racing world. But this year the stars of the industry's annual trade show, the International Bicycle Expo held here this week, were closer in spirit to Volkswagens than Ferraris. 
 Seeking to ignite growth with products appealing to more than the athletic and aggressively outdoorsy, the nation's bicycle makers are exploring the commuter bike. The idea is to provide an inexpensive and comfortable bicycle that comes with all the essentials -- lights, locks, suspension, fenders and even a bell -- necessary for getting to work and back. 
 The $4.2 billion American bicycle industry also senses a market opportunity in the continued sluggish, travel-compromised economy. "People aren't traveling by airplanes and they're staying closer to home, and that's probably good for the bicycle industry," said Marc Sani, publisher of Bicycle Retailer.
Already, bicycles that are designed to be more accessible to non-skilled riders are the industry's fastest-growing category. These so-called "comfort" bicycles grew to 20.8 percent of the estimated 17 million bicycles sold in the United States last year. That was up from 13.6 percent in 2000, according to statistics from the National Bicycle Dealers Association.
Now the industry is hoping that the market is ready for a true everyday transportation or commuting bicycle.
"I think support for this kind of bike is growing," said Mike Sinyard, founder and owner of Specialized, one of the nation's largest bicycle manufacturers. 
Several years ago Specialized tested the commuter-bike idea in the United States with a European-inspired Globe Voyager, a bike that came with a rack, chain guards, lights and fenders -- the sorts of accessories that racing cyclists abhor as encumbrances. Specialized plans to introduce a production-line bike similar in concept to the test model, according to several industry executives. 
Joe Breeze, one of the inventors of the recreational mountain bike during the 1970's that is now the industry's most popular product, demonstrated a new line of bikes, the Breezer, at this year's show. The response, he said, is an indication the bicycle industry is reawakening to cycling as basic transportation. 
"It feels similar to the way the mountain bike was received 20 years ago," he said. The Breezer is produced by the SimpliCity Cycle Company, based in Fairfax, Calif., which Mr. Breeze co-founded in an effort to help cycling gain the kind of acceptance it has long had in Europe and Asia, but not in the automobile-oriented United States. 
"The bike has been more like a recreational thing in the United States and not tied to daily life," he said. 
Mr. Breeze said Americans were still far from the European view of the bicycle as basic transportation. But he said he was optimistic because the bicycle industry has begun to act more effectively as a lobbying force. 
Much of the industry lobbying focus is on the renewal of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21, which is expected to come up for a vote next year. The industry's wish list includes financing for bike routes and for roadway renovations to make commuting by bicycle more practical. 
Although Republican administrations have not traditionally supported bicycle activists, the industry advocates point out that President Bush is friendly with Lance Armstrong, the star American cyclist who has won the Tour de France four consecutive times. 
Yet, even with federal support, bicycling would require more accessible bikes if wider segments of the public are to embrace them. 
"It's a chicken-and-egg thing," said Ray Keener, a bicycle industry consultant who works with Bikes Belong, an industry lobbying group. "Until now the advocacy groups have been frustrated that the industry hasn't been ready." 
The industry has been slow to recognize the commuter market because many of today's executive decision makers and designers are former racers, according to Felix Magowan, president of Inside Communications, which publishes VeloNews, a cycling newspaper. "Racing bikes and mountain bikes are great," he said. "But it's like using your downhill skis to go to work."
That is why start-ups like Mr. Breeze's are noteworthy. So is the new interest in adult-friendly bikes by large makers like Giant Bicycles, a Taiwanese manufacturer. 
Giant coined the term sport utility bicycle, or SUB, last year to describe a new line of bikes that went beyond the comfort category, which had previously been aimed at baby boomers who shied away from mountain bikes and racing cycles. Now the category is expanding to those who consider themselves youthful at heart, if not necessarily young of seat.
At the expo, Giant introduced the Revive, a bicycle that features an adjustable wheelbase and a back support, and is a kindred spirit to the increasingly popular recumbent bicycles that the industry has been making in growing numbers in recent years. 
"A lot of baby boomers want the ultimate in comfort if they're going to get back on a bicycle," said Dean Bradley, a Giant product manager. 
"People tell us, 'My back hurts, my neck hurts, I'm too tall, or I don't like swinging my leg over the bar,' " he said. "We're trying to take away all the excuses."

HEADLINE: Brickbats (And Praise) For Budget In Nassau 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Nassau County legislators heard sharply contrasting reactions today to the county's proposed new budget: a Wall Street bond-rating company praised it, but the county's chief assessor said that it had illegal provisions. 
 The legislators were scrutinizing the 2003 budget in hearings that summoned county administrators to testify all day and into the night. 
 The county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, made an unscheduled afternoon appearance to announce that the Fitch bond-rating company had raised its outlook on the budget to positive from stable, which could be a prelude to an eventual upgrading in the county's credit rating. 
"This is great news," said Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 1 with a promise to solve Nassau's fiscal crisis. Its dire economic state is reflected in a bond rating that has been lowered to barely above junk status. 
Although Nassau has many hurdles ahead, the bond-rating company said, Mr. Suozzi's first budget is "substantially in compliance" with the state law that imposed special fiscal oversight over the county two years ago. The Fitch company said that its revised outlook on the county "reflects clear improvement in the quality of financial management." 
But the budget came under sharp attack from the elected chairman of the County Board of Assessors, Charles O'Shea, a Republican. He said the budget drastically cut his department's request and improperly shifted assessing functions and employees to the Assessment Review Commission, a separate agency that Mr. Suozzi appoints.
"I was lied to and deceived" by Mr. Suozzi's budget aides, Mr. O'Shea said. 
As proposed, the budget would jeopardize the countywide reassessment process now nearing completion and the annual updates required under a court order for the next six years, he said. 
"I was absolutely shocked" about the transfer of functions, Mr. O'Shea testified. "Not only is this an outrage and completely unacceptable, it violates the county charter and New York State law." 
He added, "I was neither informed by anyone of this takeover, nor was it done with my consent."
Mr. O'Shea quoted from a critique issued last week by the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, a state-appointed oversight board. It questioned whether the budget provided enough money for the assessment and said that some changes might have been improper and that Mr. O'Shea had not been consulted. 
Three aides to Mr. Suozzi spoke in rebuttal. They said that enough money was being provided in the budget for assessment. They denied any illegality in the revamping of functions and said the changes should not have surprised Mr. O'Shea because they were outlined in a plan released in April. 
They also said they had had meetings with Mr. O'Shea about the budget but conceded that the talks had broken down in disagreement.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From House Debate on the Use of Military Force Against Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the House debate yesterday on the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. Speakers included Representatives Pete Stark, Democrat of California; Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware; Silvestre Reyes, Democrat of Texas; Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota; Gerald D. Kleczka, Democrat of Wisconsin; John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire; and Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia.

Representative Stark
 I rise in opposition to this resolution. I'm deeply troubled that lives may be lost without a meaningful attempt to bring Iraq into compliance with U.N. resolutions through careful and cautious diplomacy. 
 The bottom line is I don't trust the president and his advisers. Make no mistake, we are voting on a resolution that grants total authority to a president who wants to invade a sovereign nation without any specific act of provocation. This would authorize the United States to act as the aggressor for the first time in our history and it sets a precedent for our nation or any nation to exercise brute force anywhere in the world without regard to international law or international consensus. Congress must not walk in lock step behind a president who has been so callous to proceed without reservation as if the war was of no real consequence.
You know, three years ago, in December, Molly Ivins, an observer of Texas politics wrote, I quote, "For an upper-class white boy, Bush comes on way too hard, at a guess to make up for being an upper-class white boy." Somebody, she wrote, should be worrying about how all this could affect his handling of future encounters with some Saddam Hussein. Pretty prophetic, Ms. Ivins.
Let's not forget that our president, our commander in chief, has no experience with or knowledge of war. In fact, he admits that he was at best ambivalent about the Vietnam War, he skirted his own military service and then failed to serve out his time in the National Guard. And he reported years later that at the height of the conflict in 1968 he didn't notice "any heavy stuff going on."
So we have a president who thinks foreign territory is the opponent's dugout and Kashmir is a sweater. 
What is most unconscionably is that there's not a shred of evidence to justify the certain loss of life. Do the generalized threats and half-truths of this administration give any one of us in Congress the confidence to tell a mother or father or family that the loss of their child or loved one was in the name of a just cause? Is the president's need for revenge for the threat once posed to his father enough to justify the death of any American? I submit the answer to these questions is no.
Aside from the wisdom of going to war as Bush wants, I am troubled by who pays for his capricious adventure into world domination. The administration admits to a cost of around $200 billion. Now, wealthy individuals won't pay; they've got big tax cuts already. Corporations won't pay; they'll just continue to cook the books and move overseas, and send their contributions to the Republicans. Rich kids won't pay; their daddies will get them deferments as Big George did for George W. 
Well, then who will pay? School kids will pay; there'll be no money to keep them from being left behind -- way behind. Seniors will pay, they'll pay big-time as the Republicans privatize Social Security and continue to rob the trust fund to pay for this capricious war. Medicare will be curtailed and drugs will be more unaffordable and there won't be any money for a drug benefit because Bush will spend it all on a war.
Working folks will pay through loss of jobs, job security and bargaining rights. And our grandchildren will pay through the degradation of our air and water quality. And the entire nation will pay as Bush continues to destroy civil rights, women's rights and religious freedom in a rush to phony patriotism and to courting the messianic Pharisees of the religious right.

Representative Castle
For the past several months I have participated in intelligence hearings on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and studied the hatred some nations and groups have toward America. Saddam Hussein is encouraging and promoting this hatred by openly praising the attacks on the United States. The director of central intelligence recently published an unclassified summary of the evidence against Saddam Hussein and it is substantial.
We know that Iraq has continued buildings weapons of mass destruction, energized its missile program and is investing in biological weapons. Saddam Hussein is determined to get weapons-grade material to develop nuclear weapons. Its biological weapons program is larger and more advanced that before the Gulf War. Iraq also is attempting to build unmanned vehicles, U.A.V.'s, to possibly deliver biological warfare agents. All of this has been done in flagrant violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
Some may react to this evidence saying that in the past other countries have had similar arsenals and the United States did not get involved. But as President Bush has told us and as Secretary Rumsfeld reiterated yesterday in a meeting, Saddam Hussein's Iraq is different. This is a ruthless dictator whose record is despicable. He has waged war against his neighbors and on his own people. He has brutalized and tortured his own citizens, harbored terrorist networks, engaged in terrorist acts, violated international commitments, lied, cheated and defied the will of the international community. I have examined this information in some of the more specific classified reports. The bottom line is we don't want to be caught off guard. We must take all precautions to prevent a catastrophic event similar to Sept. 11.
In recent meetings the national security adviser, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, rightly called this coercive diplomacy. It is my hope that through forceful diplomacy, backed by clear resolve, we can avoid war. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein's history of deception makes a new attempt to disarm him difficult. Additionally, our goal to disarm him must also be connected to a plan to end his regime, should he refuse to disarm.
For all these reasons, I would encourage all of us to support this resolution.

Representative Reyes
Thirty-five years ago I found myself half a world away in a place called Vietnam. I can tell you war is hell.
There are a lot of us here today that have had that same experience but are taking different positions on this resolution. Some of my colleagues have asked when they hear my friend and colleague Duke Cunningham talk about his experience and his favoring and support of the resolution, and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues that I intend to vote against this resolution. 
I intend to do so because in meetings I have held in the district mothers and fathers and veterans come to me and tell me, please don't let us get back into a war without exhausting all other venues. I think every one of us in this House brings our own experiences as we represent our constituents. Every one of us here wrestles with a very tough decision as to whether or not to go forward with the resolution on war. 
Every one of us understands that we are a nation of laws, that we lead the world by example, that we have a great respect for process and to protect the rights of everyone. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly today rise in opposition against this resolution, because I think that the president has not made a case as to why Iraq and why attack Saddam Hussein.
As a member of the Intelligence Committee I have asked consistently the questions to those that have come before us with information, I've said -- I've asked the question of what is the connection between 9/11 and Iraq and Saddam Hussein? None. What is the connection between Iraq and Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda? Very little, if any.

Representative Pomeroy
Mr. Speaker, when it comes to Iraq it's time for the United States of America to state forcefully and without equivocation enough is enough. Either Saddam Hussein yields to the resolutions of the United Nations, providing for completely unrestricted inspection and disarmament, or the United States and other nations will use military force against his government to enforce his compliance. This is terribly, terribly serious business, potentially one of life and death for those that will be involved in prosecuting this action. Therefore I, like so many others have expressed, view this vote as one of the most important votes that I'll ever cast in this chamber on behalf of the people of North Dakota.
I reached the conclusion that the resolution authorizing the president to use force should pass and I do that based upon the following undeniable and uncontroverted facts. First, Saddam Hussein is a uniquely evil and threatening leader. His past is absolutely replete with nonstop belligerence and aggression as well as atrocities.
Two, he has been determined to have developed weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical. He continues to seek nuclear capacity and is believed to be within mere months of having that capacity in the event he could get his hands on the requisite materials.
Three, he now continues to produce weapons of mass destruction having effectively completely thwarted the inspection and disarmament requirements of the United Nations. And has made it increasingly difficult to detect his production facilities even as he continues to add to his arsenals.
Four, he is harboring and has well-developed relationships with terrorists including senior Al Qaeda operatives.
And five, he certainly has demonstrated that he is not above using weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, he's used them on his own people.
Now, under these terrible circumstances I have concluded that doing nothing is simply not acceptable for the United States of America. We need to act and determining exactly how to act is the question before this chamber. I believe that we should support the president as he builds an international consensus to reinstitute completely unfettered inspection or to use force in the event it is not forthcoming.

Representative Kleczka
Although we all know this war resolution will pass, I nevertheless must question the wisdom and morality of an unprovoked attack on another foreign nation. The guiding principle of our foreign policy for over 50 years has been one of containment and deterrence. This is the same strategy that kept the former Soviet Union in check, a power whose possession of weapons of mass destruction had been proven and not speculated, and in fact led to its downfall.
The administration asserts that this time-tested policy is not sufficient to deal with this, yes, a dangerous, but small economically weakened Middle Eastern nation. Instead they support a new policy of a unilateral preemptive attack against Iraq citing the unproven possibility that Saddam Hussein might be a risk to the security of the United States.
The long-term effects of this go-it-alone, shoot-first policy will be to lose the high moral ground we have exercised in the past to deter other nations from attacking military when they felt their security was at stake. The next time Pakistani and Indian troops amass at their borders, with both nations' finger on nuclear triggers, what moral authority will we have to prevent a potential catastrophe? They would justifiably ignore our pleas for diplomatic or negotiated approaches and instead simply follow our lead.
The administration continues to assert that Iraq is an urgent threat to our national security and that we are at risk of an Iraqi surprise attack. But the resolution before us offers no substantiation of these allegations, speaking only of hunches, probabilities and suspicions. That is not sufficient justification to start a war.
Further, there is reference to the 9/11 terrorism we suffered and the assertion that members of Al Qaeda are in Iraq. After extensive investigation, our intelligence community could find no link between the Iraqi regime and the plot to led to last year's deadly terrorist attacks.
Also, it's been reported that Al Qaeda members are in Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Do we attack them next? 
The resolution further asserts, also without any evidence, that there is a great risk that Iraq could launch a surprise attack on the United States with weapons of mass destruction. It is fact that Saddam does not possess a delivery system that has the throw power of 8,000 miles or anything even close. 
And if there is such a great risk that he has and will use biological and chemical weapons against us, why didn't he do so in the Gulf War? The answer is because he knew that our response would be strong, swift and fatal.
Hussein is not a martyr, he's a survivalist. 
Similarly, the evidence is not so that Iraq has any nuclear capabilities. Gen. Wesley Clark, former commander of NATO forces in Europe, contends that, despite all the talk of loose nukes, Saddam doesn't have any or the highly enriched uranium or plutonium to enable him to construct them. Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently concurred, admitting that the consensus is that Saddam Hussein does not have a nuclear weapon, but he wants one.
One of the goals of the president is to force a regime change of Iraq. Who are we to dictate to another country that their leadership must be changed? What would be our reaction if another country demanded or threatened to remove President Bush? All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, and each and every American would be infuriated by such inference and interference, and rise up against them. Changes, my friends, in regimes must come from within.
The result of voting for this resolution will be to give the president a blank check with broad authority to use our armed forces to unilaterally attack Iraq. He merely has to tell us why he believes that continued diplomatic efforts will fail and doesn't have to give that information to Congress until 48 hours after he has begun the war.
The more meaningful provision would be to provide for a two-step process, where after all diplomatic efforts have failed, the president would come back to Congress and make the case that military force is now necessary. Our colleague, Mr. Spratt, has that provision in his alternative and it deserves our careful consideration.

Representative Sununu
I rise today in support of the resolution, a resolution which I believe will send a clear and an unmistakable message or our own citizens, our allies and our enemies, as well, that Congress stands behind our president in defense of America's national security interests.
Mr. Speaker, there's no more serious an issue for Congress to debate than the question of authorizing the use of America's armed forces. We're a peaceful nation, preferring instead to rely on diplomacy in our relations with other countries. In the question of Iraq in particular, the United States and the United Nations have been exceedingly patient, working steadily to integrate Iraq into the community of law-abiding nations, but to date we have failed.
In the decade since Desert Storm, Iraq has chosen a very different path. Iraq has worked to develop weapons of mass destruction including chemical and biological agents. And Saddam Hussein has repeatedly ignored U.N. resolutions demanding that he disarm and he's refused to allow weapons inspectors access to potential sites. Thus the threat of obtaining stocks of these terrible weapons continues to grow.
Most troubling of all, Saddam Hussein has shown, has demonstrated his willingness to use such horrible weapons against other nations and against his own people. Only when military action is imminent does the Iraqi regime begin to discuss allowing inspectors to return, but the restrictions they wish to place on these inspectors would effectively render their mission useless, and instead simply delay action and allow a covert weapons program to begin to bear terrifying results. If we wait until Iraq succeeds in achieving these goals, we will have waited too long.
The resolution we're debating today encourages a diplomatic solution to the threat that Iraq poses to our national security. The president has called on the U.N. to act effectively to enforce Iraq's disarmament and insure full compliance with Security Council resolutions. But if the U.N. cannot act effectively this resolution will provide the president with full support to use all appropriate means.
Mr. Speaker, neither I nor any member of this body want to see a renewed conflict in Iraq. We must be prepared to act, give the president flexibility that he needs to respond to this gathering threat to protect American lives and address the threat to global peace. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and yield back the balance of my time.

Representative Goodlatte
On the eve of potential military action abroad, I'm reminded of President Reagan's speech before the British House of Commons when he said, if history teaches anything it teaches self-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly. Reagan was speaking to a people who knew well the ravages of war and the terrible price of appeasement. 
Churchill called World War II the unnecessary war. He did not mean that it was unnecessary to rise to the occasion and defeat Nazism. He meant that had we taken early notice of Hitler's clearly stated intentions rather than naively drifting through the 1930's, a world war may not have been necessary. Weary of conflict, some of the allies adopted a policy of peace at any price, but no peace that freedom-loving people could tolerate.
While the circumstances are different, there are lessons to be drawn from the annuls of history. Just because we ignore evil does not mean that it ceases to exist. Appeasement invites aggression. Dictators, tyrants and megalomaniacs should not be trusted. 
Saddam Hussein has used weapons of bioterror against his own countrymen. He has committed genocide, killing between 50,000 and 100,000 people in northern Iraq. His regime is responsible for widespread human rights abuses including imprisonment, executions, torture and rape. Just in the past 12 years he has invaded Kuwait, he has launched ballistic missiles at Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, previously at Iran. Following the Gulf War, he arrogantly defied the international community, violating sanctions and continued in the development of weapons of mass destruction while evading international inspectors. His regime has violated 16 U.N. resolutions devoid of consequences. 
Most ominously, in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Saddam has quantifiable links to known terrorists. Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contact stretching back a decade. We know based on intelligence reports and satellite photos that Saddam is acquiring weapons of mass destruction. He poses stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons and he's aggressively seeking nuclear weapons. Every weapons he possesses is a violation of the Gulf War truce, a crazed man in possession of these instruments of death is a frightening prospect indeed. Had Saddam possessed nuclear capabilities at the time of the Gulf War we may not have gone into Kuwait. Should he acquire nuclear capabilities, his aggressions would be virtually unchecked, deterrence can no longer be relied upon.
President Bush was accurate to characterize Saddam as a grave and gathering danger. The president challenged the U.N., calling into question their relevance should they leave unchecked Saddam's blatant disregard for their authority. He consulted Congress and made a case to the American people. The president should continue to push for a U.N. resolution with uncompromising and immediate requirements for the Iraqi regime, thereby rejecting the tried course of empty diplomacy, fruitless inspections and failed containment.
Americans looked on in horror as the events of Sept. 11 unfolded. At the end of the day the skyline of one of our greatest cities was forever changed. The Pentagon, a symbol of America's military might, was still smoldering. And a previously indistinguishable field in western Pennsylvania had suddenly and terribly become an unmarked grave for America's newest heroes. . . . 
Americans have been asking questions, some of which we may never have satisfying answers to. But today we know that a sworn enemy is pursuing weapons of mass destruction. It is incumbent upon the free world, led by the United States, to dismantle these destructive capabilities. 
We have before us a resolution which will authorize, if necessary, the use of America's military to enforce the demands of the U.N. Security Council. There is no greater responsibility for us as elected officials than to provide for the common defense of our fellow countrymen. 
In voting for this resolution we send a message to a tyrant that he should not rest easy, that those who would venture to strike at our nation will encounter consequences. We send a message to the Iraqi people that the world has not forgotten them and their suffering at the hands of a madman. We send a message to the world community that we are unified as a nation, that the president possesses the full faith and backing of this distinguished body, that we are committed to defending the liberties which are the very foundation of our republic, and that we are steadfast in our resolve in the war on terror.

HEADLINE: With Time Now Short, Many Bills Fade 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
With Congress consumed by Iraq and striving to bring its session to a close, much of the legislative agendas of both parties, including security proposals prompted by the Sept. 11 attacks, is falling by the wayside.
 The press of time is claiming causes dear to Democrats, like new health care and worker protection initiatives, while Republicans are seeing their push for increased energy production, religion-based social programs and added tax cuts also drop off the legislative schedule. 
 Combined with the political maneuvering for the November elections, the devotion to the Iraq debate has left little time even to take up proposals that have passed both houses but need to have their differing versions reconciled by conference committees. These proposals include a new energy policy that was once a top White House priority. 
The focus on foreign policy has also provided lawmakers a convenient excuse to put off difficult compromises on issues like bankruptcy overhaul, or to avoid altogether measures like an increase in the minimum wage. Leaders say they hope to break the logjam on some priorities in the coming days, but the outlook is grim.
That logjam has delayed not only the creation of a new Homeland Security Department but other security-related measures as well, including government-subsidized terrorism insurance and safety changes at the nation's seaports and nuclear power plants.
In addition, it appears that lawmakers will not be able to turn to several social policy measures that both parties say they favor, including prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, welfare reform and pension protection. Even the annual spending bills that finance government operations are stalled, meaning that dozens of new programs and projects that lawmakers hope to finance will be put off.
"There's an awful lot left on the table because the Senate has left so many things undone," said the Senate minority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi. "I think that we'll go out with a whimper rather than a bang."
How much progress Congress can make on remaining tasks depends in part on how long the House and the Senate stay in session. Some lawmakers, who had hoped to leave town this Friday, now think members could depart next week.
But the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, has said he will keep his house in session up to the Nov. 5 elections if necessary, a threat he reiterated this week. "We have a lot of work to do," he said, "and I intend to keep the Senate here to do it."
Mr. Daschle also said it was "increasingly likely" that Congress would have to return in November. "If we're not finished with homeland security before the election," he said, "we will certainly have to do it afterwards."
Members of each party blame the other for the predicament. Republicans say the Democratic-led Senate has floundered; Democrats say Republicans have engaged in a stalling campaign, eager to avoid economic issues on which debate could harm them at the polls.
The two sides agree, though, that much of the legislative agenda is teetering.
"There is not a whole lot of time to get stuff done," said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is in negotiations with the House on an energy measure.
That bill has advanced farther than many others: a conference committee has resolved several differences in House and Senate versions. Yet disputes remain, over drilling in the Arctic and changes in the electric power industry, and the legislation's chances are diminishing by the day.
Then there is terror insurance. President Bush, saying it could help spur the economy, had called for negotiators on the insurance bill to make a deal by last Friday. But that deadline passed without agreement, and talks remain snarled over limits on punitive damages sought in civil suits arising from any attacks.
"The antiterrorism reinsurance bill is one that is this close and ought to be brought across the line," said the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas.
Another terrorism-related measure that is stalled in negotiations between the two houses would provide for broad security assessments at the nation's ports and for new personnel screening and security cards for port workers. 
Senate Democrats and House Republicans have clashed over a Senate proposal to finance port-security enhancement, whose cost is estimated at $600 million a year, through a new shipping fee. Republicans oppose the approach as a new tax, and the industry wants the federal government to absorb the costs. 
Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who is a chief advocate of tightened port security, said: "This has come down to whether we are serious about paying for security. It was easy to get lots of money for airports and airlines right after Sept. 11. But seaports, tunnels, railroads are clearly vulnerable, though they have not yet been exploited."
Mr. Lott and other Republicans said that the proposed fee would not pass this year and that Democrats should relent to get the overall measure signed into law. "We can work later on how it is going to be paid for," Mr. Lott said. 
The fate of other legislation is murky as well. Senate Democrats would still like to consider new pension protections. Mr. Daschle had wanted to bring up that initiative after the legislation to create the Homeland Security Department, but the length of the homeland security debate has thwarted his plans.
Senate gridlock is also endangering $6 billion in emergency drought relief for farmers and ranchers, which was included in a spending measure for the Interior Department that has been tied up in a fight over timber policies.
Other initiatives could still survive. Leaders of both houses have said they would like to adopt an overhaul of the bankruptcy process, as well as the election overhaul that has emerged from negotiations. Given the prospect of conflict with Iraq, Congress also wants to pass military-spending and -policy measures before adjournment.

BYLINE:  By Stacy Albin (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
The Asbury Park City Council on Tuesday formally introduced a $1.2 billion waterfront revitalization plan, the day after the city manager, a chief negotiator of the plan, resigned after admitting corruption charges. 
The plan calls for building a hotel, restaurants and about 3,200 condominiums. It is scheduled for a public hearing and vote later this month. The project's chief developer, Asbury Partners, would pay the city $7 million, which would go toward developing low- and middle-income housing, said James Famularo, assistant city manager. The Asbury Park city manager, Terrance D. Weldon, quit after admitting "illegal acts" on his second job as mayor of nearby Ocean Township. Stacy Albin (NYT)

HEADLINE: Wired, Yes, but Drawing the Line 

BYLINE:  By Katie Hafner 

 BODY:
SATJIV CHAHIL stopped traveling with a laptop computer because he didn't want to be part of the teeming masses he sees in airports carrying black cases with Dell on the side.
 Chris Rettstatt rides his bike to work, makes homemade bread and jam, and scribbles out business ideas on pieces of paper taped to his walls rather than using a software program.
 Anu Garg has spent the last six years eliminating electronic gadgets from his life.
 All three spend their days working with technology. Yet when it comes to what they allow into their lives, they are highly selective. 
 They don't just buy a cellphone, a handheld computer or a laptop. They choose and weed, according to how they want electronic objects to shape their lives and according to the personal limage they want to project.
 All are aware, perhaps more than most, that the personal choices they make about technology are a reflection not only of the way they perceive themselves but also of the way they would like to be perceived by others.
 "Information technology is the most distinctive part of contemporary culture," said Albert Borgmann, a philosophy professor at the University of Montana at Missoula who has written extensively about technology's impact on society. To want to appropriate it and define themselves with it, he said, is only natural.
 And surprisingly, perhaps, it is often those who occupy themselves most intensively with technology who have put the most thought into its role in defining who they are.
 Mr. Chahil, 50, has held various high-level marketing positions at Apple, Sony and Palm, where he started as chief marketing officer and now serves as adviser.
 Eleven years spent as a child in a military boarding school in his native northern India helped Mr. Chahil develop an allergy to clutter. He suspects that his attitude toward the technology in his life is related.
 Mr. Chahil, who is on the road frequently, has eliminated the laptop computer from his luggage and now boards planes with no electronic devices except a Palm VII and a cellphone. If he must take a laptop along because it contains a presentation, he checks it with his luggage.
 At home in Los Altos, Calif., Mr. Chahil is working to streamline everything from kitchen appliances to the television. Most audiovisual equipment is being hidden in one clever way or another, and he is starting to use his Palm as a remote control to take the place of four seperate devices. The same will also happen eventually to his garage door opener, his home lighting and his alarm clock.
 Mr. Rettstatt's daily life is dominated by technology. Mr. Rettstatt, 30, is a co-founder of a children's Web site called KidFu, based in Chicago. He spends the better part of his days sending e-mail, composing electronic documents, sending instant messages, monitoring chat rooms and developing Web pages.
 Yet he is acutely aware of the way technology shapes who he is. He doesn't own a laptop, for instance, because "I don't want to be the type of person who works on planes and in hotel rooms," he said.
 "There's something about working with technology that makes people want to become Quakers," Mr. Rettstatt said.
 Juliet B. Schor, a professor of sociology at Boston College and author of "The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need," said such sentiments were not uncommon. "Some people understand that the potential of the technology isn't necessarily how it actually plays out," she said.
 And few people are better situated to understand this than those who spend their days surrounded by the flotsam and jetsam of the computer era. The more some people think about it, the less they want technology encumbering their lives.
 As a consultant with AT&T Labs in the Seattle area, Mr. Garg spends his days preoccupied with the care and feeding of several computer servers, as well as the maintenance of his nine-year-old e-mail service. A Word a Day (www.wordsmith.org), which sends a new word daily to 520,000 subscribers in 210 countries. Yet Mr. Garg, 35, has made a conscious effort to eliminate various bits of technology from his life.
 Six years ago, Mr. Garg was the very prototype of a nerd, complete with a pocket protector containing whatever he could stuff into it.
 The first thing to go was the calculator. "I always had it with me, just in case I needed to do some calculation," he said. Now that it's gone, he does not lament its absence. "I don't miss it, not at all," he said.
 Similarly, he stopped wearing a watch. "The sound of the computer is the sound of the clock," he said "You're always wondering how fast or slow your servers are, how you can squeeze another microsecond out of the program you're writing."
 Mr. Garg continued, 'Gradually I realized I didn't have to let these things infiltrate my outside life."
 A handheld computer never had a chance. "I felt one should make only as many appointments as you can keep in your head," Mr. Garg said.
 "That's how I see myself with technology," he said. "I make a living with it but I don't have to let it take over my whole life."
 Karen Mathews, on the other hand, has latched onto one particular object that seems to understand what she is all about. As vice president and chief financial officer of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., Ms. Mathews is surrounded every day by the computer industry's past - its triumphs and blunders, its flashes in the pan and its more long-lasting achievements.
 Such a working atmosphere has prompted her to contemplate how she got to where she is now in her personal life, technologically speaking.
 Ms. Mathews, 46, is an avid user of the Handspring Treo, which combines a cellphone with a Palm organizer and Web browser. Ms. Mathews sees her Treo as an indispensable communication tool, to be sure, but she loves having information of all kinds accessible at all times. During a recent trip to Italy, the Treo drew admiring comments from Ms. Mathews's fellow travelers as they watched her punch up an Italian-English dictionary and a wine reference.
 "It's just who I am," she said of the information maven in her. "The daughter of a librarian."
 Lev Gonick, chief information officer at Case Western Reserve University at Cleveland, is another case in point. He oversees the computers, data networks and most other matters electronic on the 9,600-student campus. Yet his office, on the third floor of a historic building, is so spare, so devoid of electronics, that he could easily be mistaken for the professor he once was. His subject was international political economy and he taught it by having his students read literature of the developing world.
 In fact, Dr. Gonic, 43, rather likes to be seen in a more low-tech light. After all, he said. there is still very much the liberal arts professor in him.
 "We very much define who we are by the things we surround ourselves with," he said.
 And so he is surrounded by some 2,500 books, dozens of photographs and original prints from Africa, and one very large black serpentine sculpture from Zimbabwe.
 The only technology is sight is on two-and-a-half-pound notebook computer with a wireless connection to the Internet.
 As much as Ms. Mathews links her Treo to a particular way she sees herself, Dr. Gonick Links his technical spareness to his view on the role of technology in the world at large.
 "For me it's a philosophical aspiration - that technology will have its largest impact on our condition when it's invisible," he said.
 And conspicuous objects of questionable usefulness have been bangished from the Gonic kitchen as well.
 The electric can opener is gone, as is the fancy electronic griddle. "And this Thanksgiving we're going to have to have a national summit on whether to replace the electric knife to cut the turkey," Dr. Gonick said. "It hasn't worked properly for three years."
 It is the nomad in Americ Azevedo that led him to embrace one technology - and a sense that he was suppressing his real identity that led him to eliminate another. Mr. Azevedo, 55, who teaches computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, is stuck like glue to his Palm-Kyocera cellphone hybrid. Like the Treo, the Kyocera allows Mr. Azevedo to send and receive e-mail.
 "I like to be able to move around, from one office to another, or from home to a coffee shop, or just walking around," Mr. Azevedo said during an interview from his cellphone as he sat on a bench on the university's main plaza, watching, as he put it, "all manner of students in different states of disarray walk by."
 Ten minutes after the interview, a reporters reached Mr. Azevedo as he sipped a cappuccino at a cafe near the campus. An hour later, he called the reporter to answer a last-minute question.
 At the same time, Mr. Azevedo is banishing excessive e-mail from his life.
 He used to try to respond to each of the 100 or so messages he received every day, but realized he was increasingly miserable at the thought of spending so much time in front of a screen.
 "I realized that that isn't who I am," he said. "I like to be out there feeling the pulse of life."
 Mr. Azevedo now responds to only 15 or so of his messages in a day, ignoring the rest. "I want to see my kids, eat, breathe, have that human bodily experience that shouldn't all be on a screen or even on a headset."

BYLINE:  By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The F.B.I. warned law enforcement authorities today to take "additional prudent steps" to detect and deter potential terrorist attacks. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it did not have "information on a specific time, date or location of an attack" but said the warning was prompted by threats contained in audio tapes of two leaders of Al Qaeda broadcast in recent days. In one of the tapes, broadcast on Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based Arabic language satellite television network, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened attacks on the United States economy. 
 The Associated Press reported from London that the tape of Mr. Zawahiri had probably been made in the last few weeks but could have been made as early as August. On Sunday, Al Jazeera broadcast an audio tape of Mr. bin Laden in which he threatened attacks on American economic interests. The F.B.I. said it could not say when the it was made. 
The F.B.I. said tonight that it could not authenticate the tapes, but American officials decided to issue the warning as a precaution. 
"The content of the statements and the context surrounding these threats reinforces our view that they may signal an attack," the bureau said in a letter to state and local law enforcement agencies. "One senior detainee maintains that Al Qaeda would only release such a statement after approving a specific plan for an attack."
American officials have not been sure whether Mr. Zawahiri survived the attacks on Al Qaeda since last October. The tapes could be an indication that he is still alive. 
Mr. Zawahiri declared in the tape that the United States' campaign in Afghanistan had failed to kill top Qaeda and Taliban leaders.
"Neither America nor its allies have been able to harm the leadership of Al Qaeda and Taliban, including Mullah Muhammad Omar and Sheik Osama bin Laden, may Allah protect them all," Mr. Zawahiri said. "They are both in good health."
Because the F.B.I. could not point to a target or method of attack, the Department of Homeland Security did not raise the threat advisory system beyond code yellow.
On Capitol Hill today, the Congressional committee investigating Sept. 11 postponed by a week testimony by Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.
The committee offered no reason for delaying the testimony by a week, but government officials said the decision was reached after a closed session of the panel in which lawmakers questioned F.B.I. officials about the bureau's handling of a San Diego informer who, a year before the Sept. 11 attacks, rented rooms to two of the hijackers. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about an F.B.I. warning to law enforcement agencies to increase their vigilance against terrorist attacks referred incorrectly in some copies to the cause of the alert. (The error also appeared in the headline, in all copies.) It was an audiotape -- not video -- made in recent weeks by a top leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
For Construction at Trade Center Site, the Future Is Now

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
WHAT does tomorrow hold for the World Trade Center site?
 Not tomorrow in the sense of future decades. But tomorrow in the sense of Friday, Oct. 11. And the days that follow that. 
 Wrangling over long-range master planning -- commercial space, commuter rail links, the memorial itself -- has obscured the reality that the trade center site is being rebuilt now, without town hall meetings, architectural competitions or much public debate. 
It is not an easy debate to have. Just raising the subject shatters a soft-edged communal fiction to the effect that ground zero, hallowed by horror and silent since the last steel column was removed in May, awaits a distant fate.
In fact, it's a construction zone.
Dozens of new steel columns, sprouting like a grove of birch trees, presage a new PATH station. Subway trains already cross the subterranean acreage every few minutes, giving riders an ever-so-brief glimpse of daylight as they pass through. A 13-foot viewing wall of galvanized steel grates, with memorial and historical panels, has opened the site somewhat to onlookers.
Though these efforts are deemed temporary, there is no telling how permanently temporary they may become. In other words, what is being constructed at this moment will be the physical reality experienced for years by hundreds of thousands of visitors and workers in Lower Manhattan.
"If we started to take stock of what's there right now, it's revealing itself," said Michael Fishman, vice president for urban design at the Sam Schwartz Company, transportation and planning consultants. "People are looking for a vision to descend and it's been there all the time."
What concerns Mr. Fishman and Mr. Schwartz is that today's planning decisions are foreclosing possibilities and ignoring the topography of the site, where daylight reaches 70 feet into the earth.
For instance, what if glass-brick walls or skylights had been used along the exposed portion of the 1 and 9 tracks? "To shed light in a subway in Manhattan, that's unheard of," Mr. Schwartz said. (Daylight is now fleetingly visible on the east side of the tracks.)
Yet imagine that same jolt of sunshine from the perspective of a rider who lost a husband or daughter or friend on Sept. 11 and you can understand why officials would just as soon change the subject.
IN any case, no design alternatives were explored in rebuilding the enclosure for the 1 and 9 tracks and the shell of the Cortlandt Street station. "All we planned to put in there was just a subway box," said Mark Groce, spokesman for New York City Transit.
Restoration, necessity, economy and speed are the rubrics under which construction can proceed at all in this political tinderbox. In the case of visible structures, the additional watchword is "temporary," to convey the message that no one is out to make an architectural statement.
Ordinarily, the development of a $224 million, five-track, three-platform station, to be used by 50,000 commuters daily, would call for some bold aesthetic gesture. But the engineering division of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the authority's chief architect, Robert I. Davidson, have taken a diffident tack.
"It's a temporary, minimalist approach," said Carla Bonacci, senior program manager for the World Trade Center PATH terminal. "The idea is to get people to the street, where they need to be; not to dwell in the station."
The most visible part of the station will be a canopy at Fulton and Church Streets to shelter the main stairway from rain and snow. It is shown in renderings as an S-curve airfoil shape, but Ms. Bonacci said this would not be the final design. "The idea," she said, "is to give it a street presence to convey the idea that it's a train station, but to be simple and elegant."
At track level, the Port Authority plans to install vinyl mesh screens that will block views from the trains into the site, Ms. Bonacci said, out of respect for the "memory of what happened" and as a construction safeguard.
Visibility is a deeply sensitive planning issue at the site of something so monstrous.
"Viewing wall" is almost a misnomer for the high fence on Church Street, designed by Port Authority architects working with Voorsanger & Associates, Severud Associates and Pentagram. It stands so far from the edge of the pit that it offers few glimpses below grade, only a more contemplative vista across the site to the World Financial Center.
On the other side of the chasm is the rebuilt Winter Garden. Its new eastern facade of glass invites thoughts of a pedestrian bridge or walkway across the trade center site from Church Street. Neighborhood leaders are even talking -- gingerly -- about the possibility of creating some interim retail space like a farmers' market.
But it may be that the PATH station, subway tunnel and viewing wall are the only things built on the site for the foreseeable future, given the exquisite sensitivities.
Bartholomew Voorsanger, an architect who was involved in the collection of artifacts from the attack and in the design of the viewing wall, likened the site to a griddle on which drops of water almost instantly boil.
"You have no idea how white-hot the intensity of feelings is," he said, "until you start sprinkling ideas on it and it explodes."

HEADLINE: Better Laws to Settle the Port Labor Dispute 

BYLINE:  By William B. Gould IV; William B. Gould IV was chairman of the National Labor Relations Board from 1994 to 1998 and is author of "Labored Relations: Law, Politics and the N.L.R.B."

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
The last time a president tried to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which provides for federal intervention if a strike or lockout threatens "national health or safety," he failed. In 1978, a federal judge rejected President Jimmy Carter's effort to use the act to halt a coal miners' strike.
 President Bush's invocation of the act this week to end the management lockout of the longshore workers' union on the West Coast is likely to be more successful, particularly if the evidence shows that national security is imperiled. The growth of globalization should make the court even more receptive to the president's argument, and courts have been willing to grant injunctions in past port disputes. 
 But while invoking Taft-Hartley may be a smart legal strategy, it is fundamentally flawed as a labor policy. The Taft-Hartley procedures tend to inflame labor-management passions rather than promote the dialogue and compromise that are the necessary elements of collective bargaining. Management's willingness to compromise is dissipated by the knowledge that the federal government can intervene.
The Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, allows the president to seek an injunction against a work stoppage. If the courts grant it, there is an 80-day cooling-off period, during which the two sides may negotiate under the supervision of a federal mediator. If they are still unable to reach an agreement after 80 days, the workers can go on strike or management can lock them out; in effect, the dispute is no further toward resolution.
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents 10,500 workers on the West Coast, has been working without a contract since Sept. 1. On Sept. 29, shippers and port operators shut down 29 West Coast ports, saying the union was engaging in a work slowdown. But the lockout was also meant to produce White House intervention. An injunction would allow companies to begin shipping again and, in the process, diminish their willingness to bargain through January.
Supporters and opponents of Taft-Hartley in Congress make predictable arguments. Union-hostile Republicans and moderate or conservative Democrats are alarmed by the danger to the economy and favor federal intervention. Liberal Democrats are against intervention because it is inconsistent with free and autonomous collective bargaining. There is a third way, however, which is fair to both sides and produces a final and binding settlement: final-offer arbitration.
Such arbitration would encourage the voluntary resolution of differences. It would require the third-party neutral arbitrator to select the final offer of one side or the other -- taking into account practices in other industries, economic considerations and questions of basic fairness. Thus it would create an incentive for each party to be more reasonable in its demands in order to have its position selected. This formula has been successful in public-employee disputes and in baseball salary arbitrations.
There are both practical and political problems with this approach, however. While management generally favors arbitration, the dock workers would be fearful that they would get less from arbitration than from economic pressure. Moreover, organized labor would not have confidence in an arbitration process overseen by the Bush administration, given its intervention in airline negotiations and its bashing of public-sector unions in the debate over the Homeland Security legislation. Yet final-offer arbitration, if it contains new authority for state government leadership, might attract labor support.
It might be difficult to put this procedure in place promptly enough to cope with the current dispute. Therefore labor and management should begin now to get federal legislation that would allow for states to oversee final-offer arbitration in all such future disputes.
It may sound unrealistic. But there are ways to make it work: If the law required the arbitration panel to be appointed by governors of the states most affected by the work stoppage, for instance, labor's objections to federal oversight of the system might be answered. The involvement of state officials would also induce the strong political advocacy at both the federal and state level which is necessary for the bill's success.
Legislation replacing Taft-Hartley's archaic and one-sided injunction process should be introduced without delay. It would be an invaluable tool in resolving future strikes and lockouts -- and the mere prospect of it could help spur meaningful negotiations in the current labor dispute.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE AFTERMATH; 
Rift Over Plan to Impose Rule on Iraq

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is considering plans to create a provisional government for Iraq that could provide a base for opposition to President Saddam Hussein and form the core of a new government if Mr. Hussein is ousted, senior administration officials said. 
 But the proposal, which is being pushed by several Iraqi exile groups has received mixed reaction inside the administration. It has strong support among Pentagon officials, who want to incorporate it into invasion plans. But the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency have been cool to the idea. 
 One proposal calls for American troops to seize and defend territory inside Iraq where exile groups could set up an interim capital before or during an invasion to topple Mr. Hussein. Proponents contend that creating an alternative government on Iraqi soil would encourage military commanders and government officials to break with Mr. Hussein during the initial phases of an attack. That, they argue, could hasten the collapse of the Baghdad government. 
"It's like the role of the French resistance during World War II," said one Iraqi opposition leader. "The United States stood up DeGaulle, gave him a P.R. role, gave him credibility, and helped establish a government the French people could rally around." 
But senior officials in the State Department and C.I.A. argue that the administration should encourage a homegrown leadership, not impose one. A provisional government would give the exile groups a head start in controlling the country's vast oil wealth, causing resentment and perhaps even civil war, they say. 
"The idea of a provisional central government is just a power grab, as far as I can see," said a person involved in State Department planning for a post-Hussein government. 
In his nationally televised speech on Monday, President Bush spoke only in broad terms about how the administration and its coalition partners would deal with a post-Hussein Iraq, a series of plans that White House officials say is still evolving. 
"If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors," Mr. Bush said. 
The differences over a provisional government exemplify a rift on Iraq policy that has bedeviled the Bush administration for months and disrupted planning for reconstructing Iraq if Mr. Hussein is deposed, Iraq experts and exile leaders say. 
Hawks close to the Pentagon blame the disruptions on the State Department, arguing that the agency has been slow to plan for a post-Hussein government because it dislikes the exile groups, particularly the Iraqi National Congress.
"State has been reluctant to think about Iraq after Saddam, in part because that would force them to think about who we are dealing with among the opposition," said Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board, an advisory panel to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. "We should have developed a government in exile long ago." 
But State Department officials contend that it has been difficult to plan for a new regime because it has not been clear -- and is still not clear, they say -- how Mr. Hussein may be deposed. Planning for all those contingencies is complex and has only recently begun, the officials said. 
"In the end, it's not going to be a made-in-Washington blueprint," the senior official said. "Will we parachute in our government-in-exile and say, 'Here are your new rulers.'? Let's be realistic. People who are inside Iraq are going to decide Iraq's future." 
An alternative to the provisional government plan circulating in the State Department calls for creating an interim council representing Iraqis from both inside and outside the country that could help guide reconstruction. But under that plan, the central government -- and particularly the oil industry -- would be administered by the United Nations and the United States military until a democratic government could be created, a process that could take years, officials said. 
"Oil is key to holding the country together," said one person involved in planning for a post-Hussein Iraq.
To encourage planning by the Iraqi opposition, the State Department has begun bringing together Iraqi political leaders and intellectuals to develop position papers on a range of topics, including democratic institutions, the judiciary, the media, water and agriculture, oil, health care, education and public finance. 
But many Iraqi opposition leaders deride the effort as an academic exercise. The United States should be helping to organize and preparing to recognize a provisional government that can take power the moment Baghdad falls, they contend. 
They want the administration to endorse a provisional government before a major conference of opposition groups that may take place in Brussels later this month. That conference is intended to demonstrate that the politically and ethnically diverse groups, who have squabbled frequently in the past, can unite behind a new government. 
Meanwhile, the Pentagon has been developing its own plans for Iraq following an invasion. They include maintaining a large multinational army in Iraq for at least a year to track down and eliminate Iraq's clandestine weapons programs, ensure stability around the country and deal with potential problems in providing assistance to civilians. 
In northern Iraq, military forces would probably protect the oil fields around Kirkuk and Mosul to prevent rival groups from trying to seize them. The largest foreign presence would likely be in the central part of the country around Baghdad, Mr. Hussein's power base. 
In addition to military security forces, thousands of military civil affairs specialists, familiar with the linguistic and cultural differences within Iraq, would probably be deployed throughout the country, officials said. 
Some influential advisers say the post-Hussein planning process is too disjointed, with State Department and Pentagon planning operating on completely separate tracks. Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, oversees the administration's planning. 
The advisers, who include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Mr. Perle, argue that the White House should create a high-level interagency group to coordinate the military and reconstruction planning before an invasion takes place. That sort of powerful council could overcome the bureaucratic and philosophical divisions that have hindered reconstruction planning, the advisers contend. 
"It was a mistake we made in Afghanistan," said Mr. Gingrich, who sits on the Defense Policy Board. "You shouldn't go into a country militarily without having thought through what it should look like afterward."

HEADLINE: Dispute Lingers as Longshoremen Return to Work 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Erik Ragland was among the thousands of longshoremen who returned to work today along the West Coast under a federal court order. His sweaty handshake and the sheet of perspiration seeping from beneath his hard hat were proof enough of that.
 But like many of his fellow union members, Mr. Ragland was steaming about a lot more than a hard day's work in the sun. He was grateful to be on the job for the first time in nearly two weeks, he said while catching his breath during a break from unloading a container ship on the waterfront here. Money has been so tight that earlier this year he moved in with his parents, he said. 
 But do not expect Mr. Ragland, 33, to be happy. In his view, the order to reopen the ports to the longshoremen, issued Tuesday at President Bush's request, was a tactic of the port operators to break the union. Mr. Bush had no business interfering in their contract negotiations, he said, and by doing so, he tipped the balance against the union workers.
"The Pacific Maritime Association has been using devious tactics," Mr. Ragland said of the group that represents the shipping lines and terminal operators. "This is slickery and trickery at work. The plan all along was to get Bush to come in."
The association denies the contention, insisting it had no choice but to close the 29 West Coast ports because longshoremen, working without a contract since June, had engaged in a work slowdown. The union said workers were only observing safety regulations because five longshoremen have died on the job this year. 
"We regret that it came to this, and did everything we could at the bargaining table to avoid it," Joseph Miniace, president of the association, wrote in response to the order. "The union wasn't willing to go along."
Mr. Bush stepped in after the two sides deadlocked in sessions with a federal mediator and his advisers suggested that the mounting toll on the economy was too great. The injunction issued Tuesday night will remain in effect until next week, when a hearing will be held on whether to grant a full 80-day injunction.
Yet if part of the idea behind the required reopening of the ports was to cool tempers, indications among the workers were not encouraging.
As trucks lined up at the Port of Oakland, the longshoremen spoke bitterly of their employers and indicated they had no intention of working faster. About 225 vessels were idled by the lockout, including 30 anchored here and in the San Francisco Bay, and it was unclear how long it might take to cope with the backlog.
"For a lot of people it is tough being out of work; a lot of us don't make the kind of money they say we make," said Ernest Evans, a longshoreman for 35 years. "We want to work, but not under these circumstances."
Mr. Evans said he remembered when President Richard M. Nixon intervened in the last big contract dispute, in 1971. That time, the union was on strike, and after being forced back to work for 80 days under the Taft-Hartley Act, returned to the picket lines for another month or so.
"The employers didn't want to negotiate before we were ordered back to work, and they still didn't want to negotiate after the 80 days," Mr. Evans said. "I see the same thing happening again."
Eusebio Perez, who is scheduled to retire next month, was also pessimistic. Mr. Perez was listening to the radio in his pickup truck after being told there was no equipment to operate. With so many workers returning, the terminal operators were scrambling to decide which ships to load and unload first. The confusion left some people being paid to wait.
During the strike in 1971, Mr. Perez worked odd jobs at night to keep his house. This time, Mr. Perez, 66, is not worried about the money, but he fears for his union friends -- and the union itself.
"From the bottom of my heart I disagree with President Bush," Mr. Perez said. "These companies are not playing fair with us. 
One of the central issues in the dispute involves how to deal with new technology management wants to introduce to speed the movement of cargo. That technology would most directly threaten the marine clerks, union members who deal mostly with paperwork rather than loading and unloading ships. The union fears the loss of those jobs, which are generally higher paying, would be a devastating blow, particularly since many longshoremen aspire to be clerks.
One clerk, Roger K. Alexander, said he had been working despite the lockout since late last week because of an agreement to exempt military supplies from the stoppage. Even with the exemption, though, some commercial vessels carrying military cargo were snarled in the shutdown, leading President Bush and others to worry about its handling.
Mr. Alexander said he sympathized with Mr. Bush's predicament, but he hoped people would try to understand the union's position. After years of fighting to keep jobs, it would be suicide to accept a contract that allowed the new technology jobs to go to nonunion workers, he said.
"We are not union thugs," he said. "We are just trying to keep our share of the pie."

HEADLINE: White House Joins Fight Against Electric Cars 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The Bush administration went to court today to support the automobile industry's effort to eliminate requirements in California that auto manufacturers sell electric cars.
 President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., was the chief lobbyist for General Motors, one of the plaintiffs in the case. Mr. Card was also head of an auto industry trade association when California proposed to require electric vehicles, and has publicly opposed such a requirement. 
 Under California clean air rules, 10 percent of the vehicles sold in the 2003 to 2008 model years must be electric or "zero-emission vehicles." But the state, recognizing that the car companies were not ready to meet that goal, offered to let them sell hybrid vehicles, which run on gasoline and electricity, to satisfy part of the requirement. 
Still, the industry wants to avoid having quotas at all and was not satisfied with that relaxation of the rules. It sued the state, arguing that the hybrid provision violated federal law.
Katherine Kennedy, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the California rule, said that California "attempted to make things more flexible for the car manufacturers, and cheaper, and this lawsuit is what they got as thanks."
In a brief filed today with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, the Bush administration endorsed the industry's argument that this substitution was improper because it would, in effect, regulate fuel economy standards, over which the federal government holds exclusive jurisdiction. The car companies would get credit toward the electric-vehicle quota depending on the fuel economy of the hybrids.
The brief does not appear to raise any new substantive arguments, but it carries some political significance in that it appears to favor Detroit over Los Angeles. Mr. Bush lost Michigan in 2000 to Vice President Al Gore, and while Mr. Bush was defeated in California as well, the vote was far closer in Michigan. Mr. Bush has been reaching out to union voters and is hoping to capture the state in 2004 while the likelihood of California voting for him appears more remote.
"The major issue isn't the substance of the brief but the fact of the brief," said Daniel Becker, director of the global warming and energy program for the Sierra Club. "The fact that the Bush administration, with the former chief lobbyist of G.M. as a chief of staff, is weighing in on the side of G.M. to overturn California's efforts to clean the air that Californians breathe is outrageous."
Scott McLellan, a spokesman for the White House, dismissed the accusation that the administration was siding with General Motors because of Mr. Card's past connection.
"Congress long ago made clear there should be a uniform fuel economy standard," Mr. McLellan said. "The American people would be best served if the leadership of special interest groups worked with us in our efforts to increase fuel efficiency, promote safety and improve air quality."
Congress has long allowed California to set its own emission standards because smog there is so bad. As a result, the state has set emission requirements that have forced car companies to invent new technologies for pollution control.
Since 1990, California has been trying to incubate an electric car industry, putting it on the leading edge of battle between clean-air advocates and the automakers. What California does, states in the Northeast tend to adopt as well, another reason the car companies are trying to block the electric car, which they say is impractical in California and even worse in cold climates.
Environmentalists said that the auto industry initiated contact with the Bush administration to file the brief on the industry's behalf. Jon S. Coifman, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, "It's our understanding that this whole thing is expressly at the behest of auto industry plaintiffs."
The administration brief acknowledges that the hybrid option is one of several ways that the car companies could meet the requirements. But it noted that a lower court found that "these other alternatives are in fact impractical, and that manufacturers seeking to minimize their costs will be forced to produce hybrid vehicles that meet the state's fuel efficiency standard."
It also said that the state cannot list compliance options in matters -- like fuel economy -- where only the federal government is allowed to regulate.
In a statement tonight, Gov. Gray Davis said: "Fuel cell and hybrid technology is a decade ahead of where it would have been in the absence of zero-emission vehicle regulations. I am disappointed that the federal government would intervene with our efforts to protect our air quality."

HEADLINE: Fighting Mayor's Proposed Smoking Ban Not on the Basis of Health, but of Economics 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and smoking opponents will face off with restaurant, nightclub and bar owners today at the first hearing on the mayor's proposal to ban smoking in all public places in New York City, which would be one of the strictest antismoking laws in the country.
 When Mr. Bloomberg first announced his proposal in August as a way to protect the health of restaurant workers, there were few voices of dissent. 
 But in recent weeks, opponents have become more vocal, sending letters to newspapers, peppering City Council members with phone calls and visits and hiring lobbyists. 
"We are not arguing the health issue," said E. Charles Hunt, the executive vice president for the city chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, whose survey of hundreds of members last month said that 65 percent oppose the proposed law. "Because it is pretty hard to argue that. But we have heard from a lot of employees who understand the risks and are fearful that business will decline drastically and they will lose their job. Maybe that is not good judgment on their part, but they certainly have a right to make that decision."
Some restaurant owners and their workers support the bill, which would go beyond the current law banning smoking in restaurants over 35 seats, making all restaurants totally smoke-free, as well as bars, bingo parlors and private clubs. One supporter, Richard Toes, who has tended bar for 22 years, said he is tired of refereeing fights between smokers and nonsmokers at his bar. "I can't tell you how bad it is," he said. "I have seen everything short of fisticuffs over smoking."
But many other restaurants and bars, particularly those in poor neighborhoods and within hotels, staunchly oppose the measure, and argue that a weak economic period presents the worst time to test what the mayor says is irrefutable evidence that establishments will not lose money once they go smoke-free. Hotel owners, for instance, are particularly concerned about international tourists.
"Our members are telling us that cocktail lounges and bars in their hotels host a great number of visitors from Europe, South America and Asia who insist on smoking," said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, in an e-mail message. "They may go elsewhere, causing those cocktail lounges and bars to be less frequented. In that case, the people the legislation is trying to protect may be without jobs."
The New York Nightlife Association says that 21 percent of 1,043 customers surveyed in bars and clubs said they would spend less time and money in those places if smoking were banned. 
Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris Companies, which has laid low in this most recent battle, said "a handful" of trade groups and bars had requested money from the tobacco company to help fight the bill. He said the company was "looking at a broad number of requests." In 1994, when the City Council was pondering the current law, the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association accepted roughly a half million dollars in aid from the company.
On the other side, the American Cancer Society and other advocates for the law have also approached the council. 
People on both sides of the issue have said it has been difficult to take the measure of council members or their speaker, Gifford Miller, who has yet to take a position on the bill and whose decision will ultimately guide the body.
But antismoking opponents have a more attentive audience in the speaker than they might have a year ago, largely because Mr. Miller has been disenchanted with Mr. Bloomberg, who announced his intentions without consulting the speaker, and who spent much of the summer suggesting that anyone who opposed his bill in any form was insensitive.
Further, Mr. Miller is seizing on the smoking bill as leverage for other things he wants from the mayor, such as budget relief in areas that are of key interest to council members, aides say. Several members said they are interested in exploring a less stringent law, one that perhaps leaves bars open to smokers. Mr. Bloomberg and his aides bristle at the notion of a horse trade on this legislation.
The mayor, who plans to testify today, has suggested that he will not sign any legislation that comes short of his vision for a smoke-free city. "The essence of the bill is either you have clean air for people that are working there or you don't,"' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday with Dr. Jeffrey S. Wigand, the antitobacco whistle-blower and founder of the Smoke-Free Kids organization.
But the mayor has said that before about his proposals, then later accepted compromises. And he has toned down his rhetoric in recent weeks, commending Mr. Miller for calling a speedy hearing. He added that it will be his job to persuade the Council when he testifies today.
The mayor's aides are confident that their measure, which has the support of 22 members and needs 26 votes, will pass. "There is a raft of people willing to testify that this is not bad for business and it is good for health," said William Cunningham, Mr. Bloomberg's communications director.

HEADLINE: In Campaigns Nationwide, Plans for Social Security Become a Focus of Ads 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
For years, Republicans have privately fumed over the predictable barrage of election commercials by Democrats on Social Security, while doing little to fend off the blows.
 This year, however, the Republicans are flicking the sand off their faces and fighting back. In a coordinated and calculated strategy, Republicans in the House and Senate are delivering quick and sharp counterpunches to dispute Democrats' contentions that the Republicans plan to pilfer the Social Security checks of the elderly by steering their retirement money into the stock market. 
 A result is a barrage of advertisements about Social Security so large that it is framing the debate on the issue. In race after race, Democrats are seizing on the tumbling stock market to underscore the danger of privatization, the term they use to describe President Bush's plan to funnel part of Social Security proceeds into private investment accounts. Most Republicans, in a turnaround, are distancing themselves from the plan and pledging to protect benefits. 
If there is a common theme among the Republican advertisements, it is in their portrayal of Democrats as a horde of "fright mongers" who are rustling bushes in the dark.
"It's a case of a planned aggressive reaction by Republicans," said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster who works on many Congressional races. "We know the Democrats are going to come after us on Social Security. So let's not get caught napping."
When Alex Sanders, the Democrat who is running for the Senate in South Carolina, ran an advertisement that said Representative Lindsey Graham, the Republican nominee, supported a "risky stock market scheme," Mr. Graham answered with his own commercial.
"Sanders and his Washington handlers run television ads full of distortions to scare seniors, ads that have been called bogus appeals to emotion that are trying to scare us all to death," the narrator in the commercial says as images of Mr. Graham and President Bush flash on the screen. To drive home the point, the commercial ends with the word "Bogus" plastered on the screen.
Elizabeth Dole, who is running to fill the Senate seat in North Carolina, tried to defuse the attacks from her Democratic opponent by looking straight in the camera and saying of her opponent: "Erskine Bowles has distorted my record again. So let's help him get it straight. I will never vote to take one single penny away from seniors on Social Security."
In some cases, Republicans are trying to turn the tables on Democrats with advertisements that say they have violated the Social Security trust by voting to raise taxes on benefits under President Bill Clinton.
"Democrat Tim Holden calls himself a conservative," says an advertisement by the House Republican campaign committee in Pennsylvania. "But what kind of conservative votes against our seniors on Social Security?" 
Representative Holden, a Democrat, is facing Representative George W. Gekas, a Republican, in a redrawn district.
Democrats, who delight in their dominance on Social Security issues, say they have nothing to fear from the counterattacks. The economy is in trouble, the stock market is in the gutter, and many Republicans are on record as supporting Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal. The shift to private accounts, the Democrats argue, would reduce the guaranteed monthly amounts in Social Security checks.
All of that adds up to a delectable year for Democrats to debate the issue, they say.
"Even if the ads fight each other to a draw," a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jenny Backus, said, "people trust Democrats on the issue inherently more."
A spokesman for the Senate Republican campaign committee, Dan Allen, said Democrats had pounced on the word privatize in commercial after commercial to frighten voters into thinking that Republicans want to dismantle Social Security. Republicans avoid the word at all costs.
"Democrats are trying to find their hook for this cycle," Mr. Allen said. "They want to demonize it with one word, privatization."
In Missouri, the issue has led to four television commercials in a month. Former Representative Jim Talent, who is challenging Senator Jean Carnahan, a Democrat, co-sponsored a bill in 1993 that would have allowed individual retirement accounts. The accounts would have been financed by payroll deductions and employer contributions. The legislation could also have imposed penalties for failing to create the accounts.
That point was brought to voters' attentions in an advertisement that the state's Democratic Party paid for and that begins with a picture of men on the stock exchange floor. A voice says: "An unstable economy. Falling financial markets. All that, and Jim Talent would invest Social Security money in the stock market? It's true."
Confronting the charge, the state's Republican Party put out a commercial in which Mr. Talent, looking squarely into the camera, said: "There they go again. Another lie. The liberal groups of Washington can say whatever they want. I am not going to vote to privatize Social Security. Tell Jean Carnahan to stop scaring seniors."
Not all Republicans are taking a defensive approach. Last week, a new group of powerful allies, the Coalition for the Modernization and Protection of America's Social Security, or Compass, started its advertisements in 20 markets, pushing the idea of personal savings accounts to rescue Social Security.
The coalition is financed by the Business Roundtable and the United States Chamber of Commerce, among other groups, and expects to spend $8 million on its campaign, which includes mailings and print advertising. 
A spokesman for the group, Derrick Max, said it was trying to fill a void left by Republicans who had mostly turned their backs on individual accounts. Mrs. Dole is promoting a plan to let workers invest part of their payroll taxes in accounts similar to those in 401(k) plans, but that the government would administer.
"My plan doesn't affect seniors," Mrs. Dole said in an advertisement. "It helps their grandchildren increase their benefits without raising taxes."
For the Compass organization, Mrs. Dole's race is critical. 
"We will be able to point to it," Mr. Max said, "and say you can be in a tough race with a lot of money spent and you can discuss the issue and win. But if she loses . . ."

HEADLINE: Asian Companies Relieved over Reopening of U.S. Ports 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Businesses across East Asia expressed relief today after President Bush won a temporary court order to reopen 29 West Coast ports in the United States, although worries persisted that the underlying labor dispute had not been resolved.
 So far, at least, the 11-day shutdown of the ports does not appear to have lasted long enough to inflict serious damage on big exporters like China, Japan and Taiwan. The possibility that West Coast ports might be closed temporarily has been a top subject of conversation among East Asian business executives for several months, and many companies took precautions that appear to have blunted the initial effects of the port closings. 
 Many businesses, like the Giant Manufacturing Company, which is based in Taiwan and is one of the world's largest bicycle manufacturers, sent huge extra shipments to American warehouses over the summer to ensure that stores would not suffer a disruption of supply. 
Some high-technology companies booked extra shipments in advance on special air freight services like the four chartered jumbo jet freighters a week from East Asia to the United States that Danzas AEI Ltd., a German logistics company, began offering in early September for customers worried about a possible labor dispute.
"We anticipated something like this would happen," said Peter M. Landsiedel, Danzas's vice president for North Pacific operations.
Government officials in the region like Henry Tang, Hong Kong's secretary of commerce, industry and technology, said today that the West Coast port closings did not appear to have inflicted any enduring harm.
Piles of shipping containers have started to accumulate on some docks at Hong Kong's container port, the world's largest, and the Hong Kong government set up a task force today to help manage the distribution of increasingly scarce empty containers to exporters here and in southern China. But orders have not been permanently lost to suppliers elsewhere, Mr. Tang said. "The shipments are only stored up in Hong Kong, and they are not being canceled," he explained.
The shipping problem has come closest to being acute for China, which is the biggest shipper to West Coast ports, having overtaken Japan. Factories in China, often owned by businesses from Taiwan and Hong Kong, also tend to produce a lot of bulky, low-cost goods, from toys to refrigerators, and air shipment is often not financially feasible for them. 
Exports from East Asia surged in late summer as companies prepared for the American labor dispute. Hong Kong's exports, for example, grew at an annual rate of 6 percent in the second quarter, but this surged to 11 percent in July and August as companies stuffed warehouses in the United States with extra shipments.
Giant Manufacturing has nearly a two months' supply of bicycles in storage in the United States, twice the normal inventory, said Jeffrey Sheu, a spokesman. Giant also lined up backup supplies of suspension forks, which it imports from the United States for its best models of bicycles, sold under several brand names including Giant and Trek.
"At present, there is no impact to Giant" from the temporary closing of the ports, Mr. Sheu said.
Clothing companies were less able to stockpile goods in American warehouses because fashion changes faster for garments than for bicycles. Rebecca Wei, the assistant general manager of the Shirley International Company Ltd., a large sportswear company based in Taipei, said that her business's operations in Asia had accumulated huge inventories of unshipped merchandise.
It is typically the garment customer's responsibility to choose the transportation and pay for it, and few buyers have become desperate enough yet to pay for air freight. "So far, we don't see any serious effect," she said, adding that she remained concerned that port operators and longshoremen had not yet resolved their differences.
A federal judge is expected to rule next week whether to impose an 80-day cooling-off period on both sides. But the port operators could lock out the workers again, as happened in the current dispute, at the end of the cooling-off period, or the workers could go on strike.
The businesses most affected by the port closings appear to have been those supplying parts to manufacturers in the United States that operate factories with very lean inventories. Toyota prides itself on keeping scant supplies of parts next to its assembly lines or in nearby warehouses, but that has proved a handicap during the port shutdown.
Toyota said today that it would step up its air shipments of auto parts from its suppliers to the United States while waiting for ports to reopen and backlogs to clear.
China Airlines, the world's eighth-largest hauler of air cargo, announced today that it had scheduled eight extra flights of Boeing 747-400 freighters to Los Angeles and Chicago by the end of next week, increasing its cargo capacity on these routes by 15 percent. To free pilots for the extra trips, the Taipei-based airline canceled several passenger flights.
The airline said that it would schedule additional cargo flights if it found enough customers.
Fred Hu, the chief economist in the Hong Kong office of Goldman, Sachs, said the temporary reopening of the ports would help East Asia but did not address the biggest danger the region faces: the risk that American consumers might someday slow down the buying binge that has kept so many Asian exporters profitable and growing.
"This by itself is not a great cause for celebration," Mr. Hu said of the reopening of the ports. "The central threat to Asia and its trade flows is sluggish demand in the United States."

HEADLINE: Democrats Want Change At the S.E.C. 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The search led by Harvey L. Pitt for a new top accounting regulator turned into a political brawl today as administration officials defended him against prominent Democrats who called for Mr. Pitt to be removed as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 The Democratic leaders of the Senate and House urged President Bush in a letter to oust Mr. Pitt, who has become a lightning rod for renewed criticism of the administration's handling of the economy and what some see as its inability to overcome declining confidence among stock market investors. 
 They said that Mr. Pitt's decision to back away from an earlier commitment to support John H. Biggs, a widely endorsed critic of the accounting profession, to lead a new accounting oversight board "represents the culmination of a pattern of behavior by Mr. Pitt that is steadily eroding the credibility of the S.E.C."
At a news conference on Capitol Hill, the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that Mr. Pitt had "given the accounting industry a veto over who will head the new board."
But the letter from the Democrats seemed only to solidify -- at least for now -- White House support for Mr. Pitt.
"That's an old, tired cry," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, citing what he said was the agency's record number of enforcement actions and its confiscation of corrupt executives' illicitly earned money. "I think it's a political charge that has no merit and substance."
The criticism of Mr. Pitt comes as Democrats try to open a debate on the competence of the administration's economic team. The Democrats have been frustrated as the White House has drowned out their theme of economic mismanagement by focusing on growing concerns over Iraq.
The new corporate fraud law requires the five S.E.C. commissioners to appoint the five new members of the accounting board by Oct. 28, in the week before Election Day, and Democrats have seized on Mr. Pitt's handling of the selection as an illustration of the broader economic policies of the administration.
"At best, Chairman Pitt's repeated insensitivity suggests an arrogant indifference to the appearance of conflicts of interest that can only weaken the confidence the S.E.C. should be working to build," Senator Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader from Missouri, wrote in their letter to the president. "At worst, Chairman Pitt has allowed associations with past clients and the industries he is regulating to influence his judgment and actions in ways that are improper or unethical. In either case, Mr. Pitt is not the right person to head the agency that oversees our financial markets."
Mr. Pitt's handling of corporate scandals and market turmoil has been fodder for criticism for much of the year. His critics include Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who along with Mr. Daschle earlier this year urged Mr. Bush to replace him because they said he could not credibly conduct inquiries and write tough rules for his former clients on Wall Street and in the accounting profession.
Mr. Pitt has denied accusations that he has been too slow to respond to the wave of corporate corruption, saying that the agency has brought a record number of cases. But he has testified that significant provisions of the legislation that was signed by President Bush were unnecessary. And he was attacked for holding private meetings with executives of companies that were former clients and are now under investigation.
He also irritated some White House officials when he went to Congress without their knowledge three months ago and proposed unsuccessfully to have his position elevated to the status of cabinet level, outranking such officials as the director of central intelligence, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and all the civilian heads of the various branches of the armed services.
Mr. Pitt, who left belatedly yesterday for a brief trip to Brussels to meet with European regulators and talk before a group of accountants, could not be reached for comment. Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman at the S.E.C., said that the president "has said nothing but good things about Harvey Pitt's tenure."
Commission officials today described the search as being in turmoil, as some officials were reaching out to political notables with little experience in accounting and corporate governance issues.
Some Republicans on the commission were said to have recently approached William H. Webster, the former director of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., to consider being a candidate to lead the accounting oversight agency. Mr. Webster, who is 78 years old, told the S.E.C. officials that he would think about whether he was interested in taking the job, people involved in the selection process said. Mr. Webster's secretary said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Biggs continues to be the top choice of the two Democrats at the commission, Roel C. Campos and Harvey J. Goldschmid. Friends said today that Mr. Biggs retired early from his post as chairman and chief executive of TIAA-CREF, the large pension system, after Mr. Pitt and other officials suggested last month that he take the step to be available to accept the post as head of the new accounting board.
Mr. Biggs also received a strong public endorsement today from Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. He is the main author of the legislation creating the new oversight board and one of the few top Democrats to refrain from attacking Mr. Pitt.
"I have emphasized to S.E.C. Chairman Harvey Pitt the necessity of having a strong independent board, which is at the very heart of the reform effort," Mr. Sarbanes said. "Regrettably, the process of selecting the board seems to be in disarray."
Mr. Sarbanes joins a growing list of lawmakers and other prominent figures endorsing Mr. Biggs. Others include Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who turned down appointment to the board; Charles A. Bowsher, a former comptroller general and head of an earlier accounting oversight board, and Arthur Levitt, Mr. Pitt's predecessor at the commission.

HEADLINE: House Acts to Speed Medical Devices' Approval 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The House passed a bill today to speed the approval and marketing of a new generation of medical technology that promises better diagnosis and treatment of many illnesses.
In return, the industry -- manufacturers of medical devices -- would, for the first time, pay user fees so the government could hire more people to review the inventions.
Consumer groups worry about conflicts of interest, but the bill has broad support in both houses of Congress. It was approved in the House by a vote of 406 to 3, and supporters said they were confident that the Senate would soon approve it, perhaps with modest changes. 
Representative Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said it was essential to speed the approval of medical devices, like cardiac pacemakers and implantable drug-infusion pumps, because many products had life cycles measured in months, not years.
"In this industry," Mr. Burr said, "the rule is: innovate or die."
Lobbyists for the industry said that the Food and Drug Administration now took an average of 411 days to review and approve a new medical device, and that the legislation would reduce that time by 100 days.
Manufacturers would pay user fees initially set at $139,000 for federal review of each new medical device. Small businesses, with sales of less than $10 million a year, would pay $53,000 for each application.
Under the bill, many companies could hire outside experts to inspect their plants for federal compliance. Private inspectors would be accredited by the government and would report to the F.D.A., which could continue to visit some companies.
Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said they hoped the Senate would pass a similar bill this year. James P. Manley, a Kennedy spokesman, said the senator "has concerns about some provisions of the House bill," including the one authorizing use of private inspectors.
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, also expressed concern about that provision, but voted for the bill, insisting that the private inspectors "must supplement and not supplant" the work of federal employees.
Under the bill, the F.D.A. would retain its current authority to conduct inspections, and it is expected to continue spending on inspections at current levels, adjusted for inflation.
Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said the user fees and the private inspection system created potential conflicts of interest. But he supported the bill. Stephen J. Ubl, executive vice president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, which represents 1,000 companies, hailed passage of the bill. Congress has sharply increased federal spending on biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, Mr. Ubl said, but a bottleneck has developed at the F.D.A. because the agency is not equipped to handle the fruits of that research.
Mr. Burr said people at the agency had been "overwhelmed by the volume of new products that they must review." At the same time, the products are becoming more complex.
The new generation of medical devices includes blood sugar monitors worn like a wrist watch, electronic brain stimulators to reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and wound dressings made of living human skin cells. Researchers have also developed a bionic retina, artificial finger joints and a device that works like an artificial pancreas. Drug-coated wire-mesh stents can be implanted in the chest to keep blood vessels open. Patients can swallow capsules containing tiny video cameras that take pictures as they pass through the digestive tract.

An Increase in Advertising Drives a Rebound at Yahoo
Yahoo posted better-than-expected third-quarter sales and earnings as it gained market share in advertising and job listings from its rivals. Over all, Yahoo posted sales of $248.8 million, $10 million more than analysts expected. The company had earnings of $28.9 million, or 5 cents a share, a penny above forecasts.
 Yahoo's rebound was driven in part by a diversification into fee-based services and a resurgence in advertising sales. The overall Internet advertising market is not growing, and America Online is still suffering declines in its online sales. Yahoo, by contrast said its ad sales increased 22 percent. Page C3.

HEADLINE: City Budget Gap Grows, and Visions of the 70's Grow Vivid 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
New York City's fiscal watchdogs and budget mavens have been known to cry wolf. Year after year, they sound alarms about yawning deficits, heavy debt, draconian cuts just down the road, giant tax increases just around the corner. They invoke the early 1990's, the 1970's. But somehow the city always seems to muddle through.
 But now there is a growing consensus among government officials and fiscal monitors that, this year, the budget wolf may really be at the door. 
 As New York City prepares to try to close its second $5 billion budget gap in two years, the city's fiscal crisis, which many New Yorkers have heard about but not yet felt, is all but certain to take on a more concrete, tangible reality in the coming months. 
The city is struggling to cut up to a billion dollars in spending by next month, including large cutbacks to a Police Department that is laboring to keep crime down while fighting terrorism, a Fire Department that is rebuilding from the losses of Sept. 11 and a new Department of Education that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has staked his mayoralty on improving.
The mayor, who has long been averse to tax increases, is now openly mulling them. And many fiscal experts expect the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is controlled by the state, to raise bus and subway fares.
The balancing act, officials say, is to find ways to slash expenses and raise money without endangering the city's recovery from the attack on the World Trade Center, or resorting to the level of layoffs, service cuts and deferred maintenance triggered by the 1970's fiscal crisis -- service cuts that still haunt the urban imagination. 
But with the streets already getting slightly dirtier by the city's own reckoning, the police force shrinking a bit, some businesses reeling from the recession and others looking to decentralize after Sept. 11, the balancing act is proving difficult, officials said. And the sputtering economy that is driving down city revenues is also driving up some expenses, from a rise in homeless families to rising Medicaid costs.
"How you allocate pain is a difficult exercise, and there are no painless alternatives," Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who helped lead the city through the 1970's, said of the current crisis. "I have a reputation for being a pessimist. You don't have to be a pessimist to be heavily concerned with what one sees."
Elected officials, paving the way for some of the bitter medicine to come, are sounding the alarm. Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, said yesterday that "the city is going into perhaps the most severe fiscal crisis in its history," adding that it was worse than the crisis of the 1970's. Asked later about that remark, Mayor Bloomberg said that it was "probably as good a description as anything." 
Mr. Rohatyn and other fiscal experts said that, in some ways, the 1970's were worse. The city's finances were far more tangled then, and its crushing debt ultimately cost the city its ability to borrow more money.
The magnitude of the gap was worse as well, in a way: Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that the city's shortfall in 1975 was about 19 percent of its spending, while next year's shortfall is running at 15 percent.
In other ways, though, the current crisis is more troubling than that of the 1970's, experts said. Most important, the city was given several years to spread the pain and straighten out its finances back then, while it is now obligated by law to balance its budget each year or risk a takeover of its finances by a state control board. And the experts noted that the state was in much better fiscal health then, and therefore better able to help the city, and that Washington came through with significant aid. 
The current problem is simple to state but difficult to solve: officials expect that tax revenues and state and federal aid will fall roughly $5 billion short of meeting the city's expenses next year. The causes of that shortfall range from the recession, which has eaten away the Wall Street profits that the city depends on, to the Sept. 11 attack, to spending that rose faster than the rate of inflation in the Giuliani administration.
And when it comes to the economy, the city is catching few breaks. 
Wall Street profits, which lead to big bonuses, and therefore taxes for the city, are not doing as well as the city had been expecting, said Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city's Independent Budget Office. She said that while the city was counting on Wall Street profits of $12.8 billion in 2002, the actual number would likely be lower since it was only $5 billion in the first half and preliminary data showed that it was depressed in the last few months.
Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that some tax revenues were coming in below the city's already conservative estimates. "If tax revenues don't pick up a little bit, we'll have to do something near the end of fiscal '03," the mayor said. The city's fiscal year ends June 30.
And if this year's $5 billion gap was closed relatively painlessly, city officials worry that they may have run out of most painless options.
Some agencies are balking at Mayor Bloomberg's request to offer suggestions for cutting their budgets by 7.5 percent -- the amount each agency will need to cut next month for the city is to reach its goal of trimming spending a billion dollars.
The Police Department came back with suggestions to cut less than 40 percent of the roughly $235 million in cuts that it had been asked for, and the Fire Department came back with less than half of its roughly $75 million in requested cuts. Now department officials and administration officials are wrangling over further cuts.
When it comes to the Police Department, there are really only three main areas where significant savings can be made: the number of officers, the number of civilian employees and the amount of overtime budgeted. Cutting any has its drawbacks. 
Cutting police officers is difficult during an economic downturn when it could be harder to keep crime down and when the number assigned to antiterrorism duties has risen to more than 1,000 from fewer than 20. Cutting civilian positions is a little easier politically, but the net effect is often to take police officers from their enforcement duties to give them civilian work.
And the Police Department has come to rely on overtime to get large numbers of officers to patrol big events, or to assign officers to some of the recent big antidrug programs.
Mayor Bloomberg has said that he will not sacrifice public safety, and he has expressed a willingness to spare some agencies from a full 7.5 percent cut. But he has noted again and again that only about $15 billion of the city's $42 billion budget is really discretionary and that the biggest pieces are education and police. 
The city, he said, cannot afford not to cut from the agencies that spend the most. "I think you have to take a look at where the moneys are," he said this week. "There are very small departments where there's not an appreciable amount of money to save even if you close them down, and we have no intention of doing that. But every single department will share."

HEADLINE: Venezuela Braces for a New Round of Antigovernment Protests 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela Thursday, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
With its armed forces deployed in the capital, the government of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela braced for an antigovernment march today that might be the largest since the April 11 demonstration that briefly toppled him. 
 Throughout the week, tanks and troops have been positioned to protect the presidential palace as government loyalists accused protest organizers of plotting to remove the president from power. 
 "They must not think that behind the march they are going to be able to stage a coup," Mr. Chavez said Wednesday in a speech in the capital, Caracas. "The people and the armed forces are on the alert." 
Government forces in recent days have raided the homes of a former foreign minister and military officers who were accused of taking part in a conspiracy against Mr. Chavez, though they have not been charged. The government also said it had proof that leaders of the Democratic Coordinator, an umbrella organization for anti-Chavez organizations, were orchestrating a coup.
The coordinator "has fallen into the hands of rightist extremists who, utilizing the media, propose the return to the old politics and play to the fascist sectors of the country," said Guillermo Garcia Ponce, a member of Mr. Chavez's left-leaning Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement.
Opponents of Mr. Chavez said the government had failed to provide evidence. They also said the raids and the militarization of the city were unnecessary and authoritarian.
"In a dictatorial regime, these procedures form part of the terror machine," said Tal Cual, an influential Caracas newspaper, in the lead editorial on Wednesday. "In a democratic regime, they are absolutely illegitimate."
The government has been on edge since April, when Mr. Chavez was removed from office after an antigovernment march by hundreds of thousands of people ended in violence. A popular uprising returned Mr. Chavez to power two days later, but tensions have grown as efforts to start a dialogue between Mr. Chavez and his opponents have failed.
Opponents describe Mr. Chavez's government as radical and incompetent, and they claim that the president's supporters killed at least 19 unarmed protesters on April 11. Many diplomats and rights groups say that the deaths were caused by both sides in a series of gun battles, and that the opposition has been recalcitrant and impractical.
The turmoil has hobbled the economy, which contracted by 7.1 percent in the first half of the year.
The situation has worried the United States, which is dependent on Venezuelan oil. The Bush administration, which seemed to welcome Mr. Chavez's removal in April, went so far last month as to announce it would oppose any effort to meddle by "illegal and/or violent actions" with the "constitutional and democratically elected government of Venezuela."
"The United States has distanced itself from an opposition that's weak and inept," said Michael Shifter, who tracks Venezuela for the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy analysis group in Washington. "It's not an embrace of Chavez, but they want to have a hands-off, neutral position."
Opposition leaders, though, say that the only solution is for Mr. Chavez to resign or call early elections. The president, whose term ends in 2006, has refused to do so, though he has said he would welcome a referendum on his rule.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From Senate Debate on Iraq Policy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate yesterday on using military force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. The speakers included Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts; Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. 

Senator Kerry
 The reason for going to war, if we must fight, Madame President, is not because Saddam Hussein has failed to deliver gulf war prisoners or Kuwaiti property. As much as we decry the way he's treated his people, regime change alone is not a sufficient reason for going to war, as desirable as it is to change the regime. Regime change has been an American policy under the Clinton administration, and it is the current policy. I support the policy. 
 But regime change, in and of itself, is not sufficient justification for going to war, particularly unilaterally, unless regime change is the only way to disarm Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction pursuant to the United Nations resolution. As bad as he is, Saddam Hussein the dictator is not the cause of war. Saddam Hussein sitting in Baghdad with an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction is a different matter. 
In the wake of Sept. 11, who among us can say with any certainty to anybody that the weapons might not be used against our troops or against allies in the region? Who can say that this master of miscalculation will not develop a weapon of mass destruction even greater, a nuclear weapon, than reinvade Kuwait, push the Kurds out, attack Israel, any number of scenarios to try to further the ambitions to be the pan-Arab leader or simply to confront in the region and once again miscalculate the response, to believe he is stronger because he has those weapons? 
And while the administration has failed to provide any direct link between Iraq and the events of Sept. 11, can we afford to ignore the possibility that Saddam Hussein might accidentally, as well as purposely, allow those weapons to slide off to one group or other in a region where weapons are the currency of trade? 
How do we leave that to chance, Madame President? That is why the enforcement mechanism through the United Nations and the reality of the potential of the use of force is so critical to achieve the protection of the long-term interests, not just of the United States, but of the world, to understand that the dynamic has changed, that we're living in a different status today, that we cannot sit by and be as complacent or even negligent about weapons of mass destruction and proliferation as we have been in the past.
The Iraqi regime's record over the decade leaves little doubt that Saddam Hussein wants to retain his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, and obviously, as we've said, grow it. These weapons represent an unacceptable threat. 
I want to underscore this administration began this debate with a resolution that granted exceedingly broad authority to the president to use force, and I regret that some in the Congress rush so quickly to support it. I would have opposed it. It gave the authority to use force not only to enforce all of the U.N. resolutions as a cause of war, but also to produce regime change in Iraq and to restore international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region. 
It made no mention of the president's efforts at the United Nations or the need to build multilateral support for whatever course of action we ultimately would take. 
I am pleased that our pressure and the questions we have asked and the criticisms that have been raised publicly, that the debate in our democracy has pushed this administration to adopt important changes, both in language, as well as in the promises that they make. The revised White House text which we will vote on limits the grant of authority to the president to the use of force only with respect to Iraq. It does not empower him to use force throughout the Persian Gulf region. 
It authorizes the president to use armed forces to defend the national security of the United States, a power most of us believe he already has under the Constitution as commander in chief. And it empowers him to enforce all relevant Security Council relations related to Iraq. Now none of those resolutions, or for that matter any of the other Security Council resolutions, demand Iraqi compliance with its international obligations and call for a regime change. 
In recent days, the administration has gone further. They are defining what relevant U.N. Council resolutions mean. When Secretary Powell testified before our committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, on Sept. 26, he was asked what specific U.N. Security Council resolutions the United States would go to war to enforce. His response was clear. The resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction and the disarmament of Iraq. 
In fact, when asked about compliance with other U.N. resolutions which do not deal with weapons of mass destruction, the secretary said, "The president has not linked authority to go to war to any of those elements."
When asked why the resolution sent by the president to the Congress requesting authority to enforce all the resolutions with which they had not complied, the secretary told the committee: "That's the way the resolution is currently worded. But we all know that the major problem, the offense, what the president is focused on and the danger to us and the world, are the weapons of mass destruction." 
In his speech on Monday night, President Bush confirmed what Secretary Powell told the committee. In the clearest presentation to date, the president laid out a strong, comprehensive and compelling argument why Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction program is a threat to the United States and the international community.

Senator Snowe
What urgency has interjected itself that would necessitate the actions we contemplate today? Mr. President, my answer begins not by citing a single fact or occurrence, but rather by illustrating a new encroaching threat over the past decade that was foreshadowed by the first attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. 
I believe that that was a seminal moment, when our enemies of today were introduced to the realm of the possible as those who would wish our destruction developed and implemented comprehensive strategies to systematically assault Americans and our interests whenever, wherever and however they could. It also should have been an awakening for America. And that's why I spearheaded investigations into the comings and goings of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the mastermind of that bombing in 1993 who entered and exited this country five times totally unimpeded. 
What I found led me to introduce legislation in 1994 requiring information-sharing among critical government agencies to ensure those on the front lines of securing America would have the resources to keep dangerous aliens from entering the United States. But there were those who didn't take the threat seriously. And those reforms were quietly altered and allowed to fade out of law in 1998 and out of the national consciousness. 
Now, as we peel back the layers through further investigation, we discover the sheik was closely tied to Osama bin Laden and the network we now know as Al Qaeda. The point is over the decade of the 90's and into the fledgling days of 21st century, our consciousness was not attuned to the emerging pattern of attacks. And so the pattern continued. From the Khobar Towers in 1996 to the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in the fall of 2000 and culminating in the horrific attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
That terrible day would finally and forever change the way we assess our security and vulnerability, single-handedly adding the term "homeland security" to our national lexicon. It has changed our conception of what constitutes weapons and warfare and how both may be used against us. To paraphrase Governor Ridge, we are now compelled to come to grips with an enemy who makes no distinction between combatants and noncombatants. The battlefield itself has changed. Today asymmetrical threats accost us in the theater of engagement that includes our own backyard. There is no line of demarcation. 
Before Sept. 11, we underestimated the threat and overestimated our security. That is why the Senate and House have been holding joint intelligence hearings to determine how we can learn from the failures of the past. The lapses were so egregious that it prompted our recent vote to authorize an independent commission to conduct a more far-reaching inquiry into how we could have done better and how we must do better in the future, because there is no longer any question as to the scope of the threat and the ability and the intent of terrorist groups to bring devastation to our soil.
As Secretary Rumsfeld said, and I quote: "We have entered a world in which terrorists' movements and terrorist states are developing the capacity to cause unprecedented destruction. Today, our margin of error is notably different. In the 20th century, we were dealing for the most part with conventional weapons, weapons that could kill hundreds or thousands of people, generally combatants. In the 21st century, we are dealing with weapons of mass destruction that can kill potentially tens of thousands of people, innocent men, women and children." 
It is through this prism of the post-Sept. 11 world, Mr. President, that we must view an ever-emerging convergence of threats over the last 10 years represented on the one hand by transnational terrorism exemplified by Al Qaeda, with cells in more than 30 countries, and on the other by a regime in Iraq that has already developed and deployed horrific weapons of mass destruction. 
Even as far back as 1991, the United Nations was concerned enough about a potential linkage between terrorists and Saddam Hussein to include in Resolution 687 a requirement that Iraq inform the Security Council, and I quote, "that it will not commit or support any act of international terrorism or allow any organization directed toward commission of such acts to operate within its territory." 
Today we know from Secretary Rumsfeld that Al Qaeda is operating in Iraq, that we have accurate and not debatable evidence of reportedly presence of senior members of Al Qaeda in Baghdad and other associations. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abdul Rahman Yasin, one of the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorists, who was a key participant in the first World Trade Center bombing. 
We also know that Saddam Hussein continues to provide $25,000 rewards to the families of suicide bombers in the Middle East, continues to harbor the Abu Nidal organization and continues to harbor the Palestinian Liberation Front. 
And so the question we really need to ask ourselves is this, why is Hussein so single-mindedly and at all costs amassing such huge stores of horrific weapons? We know he has them. We know he has used them before. The question is will he use them again? 
The answer is that we don't know for certain. But from all I have been able to ascertain from high-level briefings, the logical conclusion based on all of the evidence, all of the broken promises, all the obfuscation and now this nexus between Hussein and other terrorist groups and individuals is that we simply can't afford the risk to humanity.

Senator Leahy
There's no dispute that Saddam Hussein is a menace to his people and to Iraq's neighbors. He's a tyrant. The world would be far better off without him. He's made no secret of his hatred of the United States. And should he acquire nuclear weapons and the means to deliver it, he'd pose a grave threat to the lives of all Americans, as well as many of our closest allies. 
The question isn't whether he should be disarmed. It's how imminent is his threat and how do we deal with it. Do we go it alone, as some in the administration are eager to do, because they see Iraq as the first opportunity to apply the president's strategy of pre-emptive military force? Do we do that, potentially jeopardizing the support of those nations we need to combat terrorism? Do we further antagonize Muslim populations who already deeply resent our policies in the Middle East? Or do we work with other nations to disarm Saddam, using force if other options fail? 
The resolution now before the Senate leaves the door open to act alone, even absent an imminent threat. It surrenders to the president authority which the Constitution explicitly, explicitly, reserves for the Congress. As I said two weeks ago, it's premature. I've never believed, nor do I think that any senator believes, that U.S. foreign policy should be hostage to any nation or even to the United Nations. We have to do what is right and necessary to protect our security whenever it's called for. But going to war alone is rarely the answer.
And Monday night, the president spoke about working with the United Nations. And I agreed with so much of what the president said. The status quo is unacceptable. Past U.N. resolutions have not worked. Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials have lied to the world over and over. And the president points out an effort is under way at the U.N. to adopt a strong resolution requiring unconditional unimpeded access. This effort is making steady progress. Successful, it could achieve the goal of disarming Saddam without putting thousands of American and innocent Iraqi lives at risk or spending tens of billions, or actually hundreds of billions, of dollars at a time when the U.S. economy is weakening and the federal deficit is growing. Retirement savings of American senior citizens have been decimated. 
Now, diplomacy is often tedious. It doesn't usually make the headlines or the evening news. We certainly know about past diplomatic failures. But history has shown over and over that diplomatic pressure cannot only protect our national interests, it can also enhance the effectiveness of military force when force becomes necessary. 
Now the negotiations are at a sensitive stage. We authorize use of force today, Congress is saying, irrespective of what the Security Council does, we've already decided to go on our own way. Some say the president's hand will be strengthened by his passiveness.
In 1990, when the United States successfully assembled a broad coalition to fight the gulf war, we passed a resolution only after the U.N. had acted. Now the world knows that President Bush is serious about using force against Iraq. And the votes are here in Congress to declare war if diplomatic efforts fail and war becomes unavailable. But the resolution now before us goes well beyond what the president said on Monday about working through the United Nations. It would permit the administration to take precipitous unilateral action without following through with the U.N. 
Many respected and knowledgeable people, former senior military officers and diplomats have expressed strong reservation about this resolution. They agree that if there were credible evidence that Saddam Hussein was planning to use weapons of mass destruction against the United States or one of our allies, the American people and the Congress would overwhelmingly support the use of American military power to stop it. But they haven't seen that evidence. Madame President, neither have I. We've heard a lot of bellicose rhetoric, but where are the facts?
I'm not asking for 100 percent proof. But the administration is asking Congress to make a decision to go to war based on conflicting statements, angry assertions and assumptions based on speculation. This is not the way a great nation goes to war.

Senator Hagel
We should not mistake our foreign policy priorities for ideology in a rush to proclaim a new doctrine in world affairs. America must understand that it cannot alone win a war against terrorism. It will require allies, friends and partners. 
American leadership in the world will be further defined by our actions in Iraq and the Middle East. What begins in Iraq will not end in Iraq. There will be other Iraqs. There will be continued acts of terrorism, proliferating powers and regional conflicts. If we do it right and lead through the United Nations in concert with our allies, we can set a new standard for American leadership and international cooperation. 
The perception of American power is power. And how our power is perceived can either magnify or diminish our influence in the world. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility and an institutional obligation in this effort. 
Federalist Paper No. 63 specifically notes the responsibilities of the United States Senate in foreign affairs as follows, and I quote: "An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two reasons. The one is that independently of the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable on many and various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of a wise and honorable policy. The second is that in doubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can always be followed. What has not America lost by her want of character with foreign nations? And how many errors and follies would she not have avoided if the justice and propriety of her measures had in every instance been previously tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?" 
Remarkable words.
The resolution before us today should be tried in that same light as The Federalist Papers points out. The original resolution proposed by the Bush administration, S. J. Resolution 45, would have been a setback for this institution. It did not reflect the best democratic traditions of either Congressional executive relations or the conduct of American foreign policy. S. J. Resolution 46, sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Warner, McCain and Bayh, is a far more responsible and accountable document than the one we started with three weeks ago. . . .
S. J. Resolution 46 narrows the authorization for the use of force to all relevant U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq and to defending our national interests against the threats posed by Iraq. It includes support for U.S. diplomatic efforts at the United Nations; a requirement that before taking action, the president formally determines that diplomatic or other peaceful means will not be adequate in meeting our objectives; reference to the war powers resolution requirements in periodic reports to Congress that includes those actions described in the section of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, regarding assistance and support for Iraq upon replacement of Saddam Hussein. 
This resolution recognizes Congress as a co-equal partner in dealing with the threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. If disarmament in Iraq requires the use of force, we need to consider carefully the implications and consequences of our actions.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Software: Microsoft Executive Faults Licensing Plan 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, said yesterday that his company made mistakes when it moved to a new licensing plan this year that angered customers, some of whom had to pay more. "With 20-20 hindsight, I probably wouldn't have made any of these changes when the economy was going to go south," Mr. 
Ballmer said in an interview at a conference sponsored by the market researcher Gartner Inc. in Orlando, Fla. Microsoft switched to the new plan Aug. 1 to try to make its software licensing programs easier to understand and cheaper for some customers. The plan requires clients to buy maintenance contracts, which cost at least 25 percent more than the software alone, or to pay more for upgrades to new programs. Analysts have estimated that most customers will end up paying more, and some clients have said they are looking at competing programs.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "RICHARD AVEDON: PORTRAITS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 5). Just eight years after the last Richard Avedon show, here's a survey of portraits. The fashion analogy is obvious: the repackaged product, a clever campaign to market the same old goods. But the show is gorgeous: a pitch-perfect mix of modest-size, big and unbelievably big prints, each an exquisitely made object. Whatever else the works might be, they are unforgettable. Celebrity only partly accounts for their status. Mr. Avedon brings other factors to bear: a sense of spectacle, clinical precision, energy, movement even in static head shots (the figures often seem so tense they look ready to jump out of the pictures) and an irrepressible attraction to power. His career dovetails with the era of the paparazzi, the tell-all media, the obligatory scandals and secret sufferings of the rich and fashionable. You might say he raised this cultural fixation to a neurotic art. The trade-off with him is always between style and substance. It's the conflict of our culture. No wonder his pictures are so embedded in our imagination. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* JUDY CHICAGO: "THE DINNER PARTY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 9). This exhibition welcomes back Ms. Chicago's extravagant installation banquet of ceramic plates and handmade table runners dedicated to 39 women. A feminist landmark, it is joining the permanent collection 22 years after its first appearance at the museum. It is amazing to see. Made with the help of hundreds of volunteers from 1975 to 1979, "The Dinner Party" sums up the first stage of feminist art, reflects the late 70's rematerialization of the art object and is startlingly prescient of the art of the late 80's and 90's in its ambition to be both aggressively visual and politically charged. Despite being almost as much a part of American culture as Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, W.P.A. murals and the AIDS quilt, it retains much of its original revolutionary fervor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES: REFLECTIONS OF NATURE IN CHINESE PAINTING WITH SELECTIONS FROM THE COLLECTION OF MARIE-HELENE AND GUY WEILL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 9). This show is basically a rotation of the permanent collection, of the kind required to protect light-sensitive silk scrolls and ink-painted album pages. But the Met has a flair for turning necessity into a virtue by reintroducing work along thematic lines and introducing fresh material to lend a sense of event. Such is the case here. At the center of the reinstallation is a group of splendid Ming and Qing dynasty paintings recently given or promised to the museum by the New York collectors Marie-Helene and Guy Weill. They are a genuine attraction in themselves and a logical link in the continuum that this museum's remarkable Chinese holdings span from beginning to end. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).

* "FACING THE MASK" and "RECENT ACQUISITIONS: SELECTIONS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION," Museum for African Art, third floor, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through March 2). The Museum for African Art, formerly of SoHo, makes the leap to a new home in Long Island City, with a very beautiful if surveyish show, "Facing the Mask," which happens to be all about moving. Some of the moving is physical, some psychological and spiritual, and it is embodied in more than 70 stunning masks, no two alike, from across sub-Saharan Africa. Some were used for popular entertainment; others were moral forces incarnate. Their purpose was transport, and they are supplemented by films of masquerades in action. Also on view is a selection of work from the museum's still small but growing permanent collection. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "GAUGUIN IN NEW YORK COLLECTIONS: THE LURE OF THE EXOTIC," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 20). The first major New York exhibition in four decades devoted to Gauguin isn't major-major by Met blockbuster standards: more than half of the 120 pieces are drawings and prints. But these are pretty spectacular, and they are joined by some two dozen paintings, including coral-and-mango-colored visions of a mythical South Pacific that are among the most beautiful images created by any modern artist. Only the Met has the resources to put this kind of material together, though if you want to get a real sense of the not-so-nice artist himself, check out the new critical biography by Nancy Mowll Mathews, "Paul Gauguin: An Erotic Life" (Yale University Press). Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "NOMADIC ART OF THE EASTERN EURASIAN STEPPES: THE EUGENE V. THAW AND OTHER NEW YORK COLLECTIONS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 5). The 200 or so miniature bronze, gold and silver sculptures in this show, most of them in the form of real or fantastic animals, are associated with nomadic peoples who traveled the vast plains from northern China to the Black Sea in the first millennium B.C. Although they transformed every culture they touched, including Classical Greece, Achaemenid Iran and China, little is known about them. Rather than trying to break fresh scholarly ground, the show put the emphasis on aesthetic appeal, and that appeal is powerful. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Dec. 1). The Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the world's oldest surviving art school (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection of works to instruct its students in the discipline of drawing. Those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when Classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Wicked doings in the Bible, sex in mythology, the ordered schematics of French architecture and the pomp and circumstance of the French court are some of the subjects covered in the drawings, which should send any aficionado to the Frick on the run. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $5 (Grace Glueck).

* "THE THAW COLLECTION: MASTER DRAWINGS AND OIL SKETCHES, ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1994," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 (through Jan. 19). This selection of more than 100 European drawings and oil sketches is the latest update on a personal collection that Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, have been depositing at the Morgan in increments since 1975. The last such show in 1994 left everyone a bit light-headed it was so good. This one has a lot going for it, too, including work by Rembrandt, von Ruisdael, Degas and the incomparable Samuel Palmer. A cluster of 19th-century German and Scandinavian works give the proceedings a piney, Romantic air. Nearly half the show is plein-air oil sketches, which the Thaws have recently been acquiring in depth. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "BILL VIOLA: GOING FORTH BY DAY," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). An ambitious meditation on the epic themes of human existence, this frescolike video installation consists of five panels, shot using the latest technology and projected simultaneously on the walls of one huge gallery. Each deals with a specific theme: rebirth, journey through life, disaster, death and resurrection. Inspired by the works of Renaissance painters like Giotto and Luca Signorelli, it relates as much to still painting as it does to the moving images of cinema and television. Except for a few scenes, the action is almost in slow motion, suggesting the stasis of looking at paintings and allowing the viewer to shift attention from panel to panel without losing focus. The liveliest scene is "The Deluge," in which a series of ordinary street events occurs before the facade of a Classical-looking house. They are interrupted by a tumultuous flood pouring out of the building's apertures that sends people running for their lives. The work was mostly shot before the Sept. 11 disaster, but is amazingly prophetic of it. If some of the imagery is corny, it is still a deeply felt and provocative piece of work. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "WINOGRAND 1964," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Dec. 1). In 1964 the photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed America, taking nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. Here are around 150 of them, most of them never shown before. Winogrand was a hit-and-miss artist, and the show could have been edited. But the images add up to a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. A poor skeptic, Winogrand clearly saw the fragility and the preciousness of what binds people together. Many of the pictures seem fragile, too: they're fleeting stories sometimes so provisional as to be barely coherent, irreducible, like life, to a simple message. Winogrand captured how America once again transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

GEORGE BASELITZ, "Paintings and Drawings From the 1960's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 2). Before this German Neo-Expressionist started turning his canvases upside down, he made earthy, saturnine paintings and drawings right side up. His gnarly, muddy pictures from the 60's of people and animals have an evocative, primordial quality and sometimes, as in a small ink portrait of a bare-chested Antonin Artaud, a strange delicacy (Ken Johnson).

MARKUS LUPERTZ, "Semiramis," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Nov. 16). Titled after the Babylonian Queen Semiramis, creator of the legendary Hanging Gardens, Mr. Lupertz's paintings, in which rectangles of florid, clotted Abstract Expressionist painting are set off within internal borders, might be a meditation on beauty and decadence. Superficially, these medium-size canvases by the head of the Dusseldorf Academy of Art resemble the paintings of Howard Hodgkin, but they are animated more by oblique irony than by lyrical hedonism (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

TOLAND GRINNELL, "A Mobile Home and Other Necessities," Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through Oct. 19). This artist goes to even greater lengths than usual to state the obvious, handmaking a 31-piece suite of luggage that has all the comforts of the most luxurious Upper East Side co-op apartment to remind us that we live in an era of material excess. The works have an empty-headed muscle-bound perfection in which message is overwhelmed by medium. But the impeccable pale yellow caning with forest green leather trim should be optioned by Vuitton or Hermes pronto (Smith).

* "THE HEAVENLY TREE GROWS DOWNWARD: SELECTED WORKS BY HARRY SMITH, PHILIP TAAFFE AND FRED TOMASELLI," James Cohan Gallery, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through Oct. 19). Smith (1923-1991) is best known for his archival recording project "Anthology of American Folk Music." But he was also a filmmaker and an inventive painter. Some of his paintings and early films are shown here, and they reflect his many interests, from alchemy and psychoactive drugs to jazz and modernist art. He is joined in this show by two fine contemporary painters, Mr. Taaffe and Mr. Tomaselli, who admire his work and, in different ways, share his sensibility. Mr. Taaffe's contribution adds up to a laboratory of new ideas; Mr. Tomaselli shows some of his best collage-paintings to date (Cotter).

Galleries: Chelsea

WILL COTTON, Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through Oct. 19). With a dry, thin touch, Mr. Cotton continues to paint giant images of supersweet desserts, like flans in a lake of syrup, that are more repulsive than mouth-watering. His project might be a comment on a culture of instantaneous gratification. Now he has added to the mix nubile young women, naked or in underwear. Dusted with sugar, drenched in chocolate or smeared with frosting, these misty dream girls loll about in hypoglycemic dazes (Johnson).

WINKA DUBBELDAM, "From HardWare to SoftForm," Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992 (through Oct. 19). The owner of the firm Archi-tectonics looks into the future and sees -- surprise! -- interactive technology. Here the New York architect offers a transparent screen on which the ghostly bones of a futuristic building morph wildly in response to the viewer's tread on floor switches. In a few years, no doubt, this sort of thing will look quaintly primitive (Johnson).

* FERUS, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111 (through Oct. 19). A tribute to the life, times and art of Ferus, the farsighted gallery that was arguably the point of origin of the Los Angeles art scene but that also reflected its artistic moment -- the fertile decade from 1957 to 1967 -- as fully as any New York gallery. Major works by Ed Ruscha, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Larry Bell and Jay DeFeo and others make the show a museum-caliber treat (Smith).

* CAROL JACKSON / KAZ, Ten in One Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through Oct. 19) Ms. Jackson gets better and better at producing funny, sometimes profound simulations of vernacular signs in embossed and painted leather, with texts like "Flight Is a Weapon Which Bears No Disgrace; Remember to Run." Comic strips by the underground cartoonist Kaz are hilariously filthy and beautifully drawn. His rotund rodent protagonist, Creep Rat, is a drunk, a murderer, a sex pervert and a loser, yet his indomitable optimism is endearing (Johnson).

MICHEL MAJERUS, "Leuchtland," Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467 (through Oct. 19). Giant copies of kitschy magazine covers, Frank Stella-style stripe paintings, distorting mirrors, a huge painting of an orange, green and white United States flag, partially smeared; an imitation de Kooning painting, emblazoned with slick lettering reading "No Style No Points"; and a connecting system of brightly colored panels -- altogether, these create a stridently dissonant environment designed, perhaps, to satirize the society of the spectacle (Johnson).

"THE MICROWAVE," Cristinerose/Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Oct. 19). "Words have become the disease of the information era," announces the oracular publicity release for this intriguing 11-artist group exhibition. Be that as it may, most of the participants play at transforming the textual into the visual. The ghosts of film subtitles haunt Stefana McClure's minimalist color fields; Stephen Sollins whites out words from television schedules; Marco Maggi constructs miniature architectural models by cutting into reams of typing paper; and Jacob El Hanani draws allover fields of eye-strainingly fine abstract calligraphy (Johnson).

CLIFFORD ROSS, "Hurricanes," Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through Nov. 2). When a hurricane hits the coast of Long Island and most reasonable people are indoors safe and dry, Mr. Ross is up to his waist in the ocean shooting the waves. In his large, eerily lucid black-and-white photographs, the thrashing surf appears magically frozen into otherworldly landscapes (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* KAFFE FASSETT, "Pattern as Obsession," Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through Oct. 26) Notwithstanding the exhibition's title, this London artist is less obsessed than delightfully inventive in using the domestic arts of knitting, needlepoint, rug hooking and sewing to produce colorful, optically absorbing essays in patternmaking. A funky, folk-art-like quality is belied by the sophisticated play with harmony and dissonance (Johnson).

* 25TH-ANNIVERSARY BENEFIT SELECTIONS EXHIBITION, the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Oct. 26). Nearly 400 drawings by artists who have previously exhibited at this valuable institution over the last 25 years create an initial impression of wondrous creative fertility. With extended looking, one starts to feel a certain leveling decorousness, but there are intriguing oddities, like Stavit Allweis's picture of a wild-eyed girl in a pool of water, a kind of surrealistic fairy painting (Johnson).

RICHARD WOODS, Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Oct. 19). "Super Tudor," the New York solo debut of this British artist, has a great opening: the gallery exterior tricked out in Olde English half-timber that is optically super, startlingly Tudor and thoroughly surreal. Inside is good, too, but only if you keep your eyes glued to the faux parquet floor, scaled up in shades of blue and black. Otherwise, the promising package holds little more than a pleasant clash of familiarly ironic decor quotations (Smith).

Other Galleries

* "BETWEEN WORD AND IMAGE: MODERN IRANIAN VISUAL CULTURE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Dec. 7). This no-frills exhibition is about the dynamics of cultural borrowing, the inseparability of art and politics, and the interplay of modernism and Islamicism. It begins with painting and sculptures from the 1960's in which Western styles and Iranian themes merge. It continues with riveting photographs documenting the arrival of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And it concludes with art that the revolution produced: political posters inspired by both the Western counterculture and militant Islamic ideology. Depending on the amount of synthetic thinking you're willing to do, the results can seem richly layered, or disjointed and undercooked. But the materials and the ideas on display are fascinating (Cotter).

ALEX GREY, Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 807-0563 (through Jan. 3). Mr. Grey's painting, with its tantric symbolism, medical-illustration finesse and New Age optimism, might be described as psychedelic realism. In it, the human figure is rendered with X-ray, or CAT scan, transparency, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescalin. Mr. Grey's images have been appropriated by a countercultural audience: they have shown up on promotional posters for rave events and on paper used for blotter-style LSD. But they look right at home at Tibet House, where contemporary versions of religious tankas, meant for esoteric instructon and meditation, often hang (Cotter).

"MADE BY NATURE," Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317 (through Oct. 27). Artists selected by the curator Robert S. Mattison collaborate with natural life forms. Jim Toia's ghostly abstractions are produced by spore-spreading mushrooms. In Michele Brody's luminous installation, blades of rye grass grow from small bottles. In a video by Hope Ginsburg, live bees form a swarming beard on the artist's face. Howard Schwartzberg paints with bloodworms, while Emil Lukas uses live, ink-drenched maggots. Monika Kulicka's chlorophyll restoration projects look like abandoned science experiments (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "ARTIST IN THE MARKET PLACE 22," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, Bronx, (718) 681-6000 (through Sunday). The 36 artists in this 22nd annual exhibition hail from Europe, Asia and across the United States. Together they give a fair sense of today's room-for-everyone art world. There's plenty of well-made painting, drawing and sculpture. Work is often politically or psychologically fraught. An incremental aesthetic -- one of piecing together and building up -- prevails. The museum has done its best to help all concerned put a best foot forward by giving the show the full run of the main galleries; the results overall look terrific: airy, serious, museum-quality. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+; free on Wednesdays (Cotter).

* RIDLEY HOWARD, Fredericks Freiser, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555 (through tomorrow). Sweet, day-dreamy and a bit eerie, Mr. Howard's paintings are like a cross between Alex Katz and Edward Gorey. On medium-size canvases, in a finely tuned palette of pale colors, he paints broad, simplified spaces in which he stages suggestive dramas involving small, exactingly drawn people of a certain comfortable class. The image of three elegant people riding in an old-fashioned speedboat across a wide-open sea is oddly exhilarating and enigmatic (Johnson).

* MICHAEL HURSON, Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105 (through tomorrow). At the heart of this show are seven drawings done from a reproduction of Seurat's painting "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." They reiterate the painting's gliding figures and majestic recession of space, while replacing its seamless surface with the quirky, slightly anxious, multitextured intimacy that Mr. Hurson has developed over the years and puts to excellent use here (Smith).

* ROBERT MELEE, "You Me and Her," Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849 (through tomorrow). Picasso had his wives and lovers. William Wegman has his Weimaraners. Mr. Melee has his mother. She is the muse of his current show and, as always, an arresting presence: past middle age, partial to Phyllis Diller wigs, Alice Cooper eyeliner and alcohol, she is the subject of photographs and videos notable for their mingling of affection and aggression. They exist in some transcendently abject universe where inhibitions and animosities fall where they may, where perversity is pleasure and decay a kind of innocence. You may not want to live there, but you won't forget your visit in a hurry (Cotter).

JOAN MITCHELL, HORACE BRISTOL, Robert Miller Gallery, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774 (through tomorrow). Mitchell works from four decades include some fine, sensuously gnarly examples from the late 1950's and early 60's. Bristol, an early Life magazine staff photographer, made photographs for the Navy in the 1940's; they have an odd resonance now in a time of war anxiety and patriotic agitation (Johnson).

* "HELIO OITICICA: QUASI-CINEMAS," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, between Prince and Houston Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sunday). A Brazilian proto-installationist of the 1960's, Oiticica wanted nothing more than to have people kick off their shoes and immerse themselves in the karmic pleasures he devised. This show focuses on his somewhat tangential work of the 70's, when he lived in New York: it consists of rooms slung with hammocks or padded with mattresses or covered with sand and balloons; slides of Jimi Hendrix, Marilyn Monroe and Luis Bunuel flash on the walls to music by Yma Sumac, the Latin diva. This description makes the work sound juvenile or pointless, which it is not. A buoyancy derives partly from the sly humor, self-mocking and pervasive. Art was for Oiticica a state of mind and a condition of the heart -- a university for the soul with an open-admission policy. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"OUT OF SITE: FICTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL SPACE," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sunday). For many young artists, the mingling of art and architecture holds manifold attractions. It's a way to blur categories, explore new technologies, deal with interesting images and social themes. The participants in this savvy group show, organized by Anne Ellegood, do all this in work that treats architecture as virtual structure, a fluid marker of space. Matthew Northridge's cityscape of 3,000 small, various-size handmade blocks of masonite is a standout, along with Sven Pahlsson's hallucinatory video animation "Sprawlville or Life at Highway Exit Ramp," Nina Bovasso's paintings of piled-up cities and Ricci Albenda's optically dynamic wall of words. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, "Space Addiction," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through today). In flat, hard-edged graphics, Mr. Ramirez's zany montage of spurting breasts, delicately hair-fringed orifices, dangling genitalia, targets, polka dots and stripes harmoniously proliferates all over the gallery's walls. It suggests that what underlies holistic fantasies of Modernist design is infantile yearning for the ideal mother. Out in the courtyard, "Outer City, Inner Space" (through Jan. 3) includes an undulating, tubular ceiling by Teresita Fernandez; an internally illuminated, futuristic igloo by Stephen Hendee; and a giant Chinese food takeout bag by Ester Parteg -- all resonating to good effect with Mr. Ramirez's Neo-Pop lunacy (Johnson).

* "SNAPSHOT POETICS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY ALLEN GINSBERG," Howard Greenberg, 120 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-0010 (through tomorrow). Ginsberg, the ur-Beat poet, had only the finest in photography teachers. Berenice Abbott advised him: "Don't be a shutterbug, young man" and "Don't get so close or you'll get a bulging eye or cheek too big." Robert Frank told him to include the hands of people more often in his pictures. But before Abbott and Frank took him under their wings, when Ginsberg was taking pictures "as keepsakes of my own total sacramental, personal interest in intimate friends," he did just fine. His "drugstore prints" of his fellow Beats, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Peter Orlovsky, William S. Burroughs, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso, have a dashing callowness about them, especially those with Ginsberg's precise handwritten captions. This gallery acquired the Ginsberg photographic archive in the spring, and is showing off a bit of its bounty, 68 prints out of more than 1,000 vintage and modern prints. (Sarah Boxer).

HEADLINE: INSIDE ART 

BYLINE:  By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
A Corporate Sale With Personality
 I.B.M. did it; so did Reader's Digest. When the going got tough, these companies auctioned prized selections from their art collections. Now on Nov. 13 Christie's is to auction nine works of postwar and contemporary art owned by the Israel Phoenix Assurance Company. 
 The company is selling because of a change in ownership, as did CBS when it sold 100 works at Sotheby's in 1997 for $3.9 million. Generally, outstanding corporate collections are formed by chief executives so passionate about art that they buy paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures not just for their own living rooms but for the office, too. This collection, one of the few corporate collections in Israel, was formed by Joseph Hackmey, the company's former managing director, who began buying art for the company in the early 1980's. 
Mr. Hackmey put together a rare collection of Israeli art, which the company is keeping. But after he sold his controlling shares in the company to car importers this year, the new owners decided to part with some of the postwar and contemporary art. "Although it is a corporate collection, it's very personal," said Brett Gorvy, head of postwar art for Christie's worldwide.
The nine works being sold are expected to bring $14.2 million to $20 million. They include a group of minimalist pieces by Robert Ryman, Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse and paintings by American postwar masters like Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman, Robert Rauschenberg and Mark Rothko.
Of the group, two are already generating much talk among collectors. One is Johns's "0 Through 9" (1961), a superimposition of the numerals 0 to 9 in a range of grays, estimated at $6 million to $8 million. Over the years it has been in several respected collections, among them those of the publishing magnate S. I. Newhouse Jr. and the architect Graham Gund, based in Cambridge, Mass.
Two others from the same series, in color, have recently landed in museums: the Whitney Museum of American Art bought one this year for a reported $15 million, and in 1999 the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art bought a "0 Through 9" and nine other works for an unreported price from the Fukuoka City Bank in Japan. Still, major early paintings by Johns don't often come on the market.
Rarer still are paintings by Newman. The company is selling "White Fire I" (1954), the first major Newman on the market since Christie's sold "The Word II" (1954) for a record $3 million in 1995. "White Fire I," which was part of the recent Newman retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is at the Tate Modern in London, where the exhibition is currently on view. The painting is to leave the Tate for Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters a week before the sale, and the new buyer will be asked to send it back until the exhibition closes on Jan. 5.
It was once owned by E. J. Powers, a pioneer in the communications industry, who died in 1993 and was a prominent collector of modern art in the postwar years. One of Newman's mature abstractions, it consists of an aqua background punctuated by two zips, as he called them: a wide pale beige band on the left and a bleeding blue stripe on the right. Christie's estimates the painting will bring $4 million to $6 million.
"It's domestic in scale," Mr. Gorvy said of the 47--by-59 3/4-inch painting. "The sheer rarity of seeing a painting like this on the market is already creating extraordinary interest, and timing is perfect, given the recent acclaim accorded to the exhibition."
Like most other top works on the market this fall, the collection attracted considerable competition from other auction houses and galleries, specifically PaceWildenstein, experts close to the negotiations said. And the sellers insisted on financing; in this case, Christie's actually bought the paintings. While executives there won't say how much they paid, experts believe it was around $13 million.

A Gift for San Francisco
A rocky economy may have slowed some big spenders, but the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is still receiving gifts. This week it announced that an anonymous donor had made a partial and promised gift to the museum of an eight-painting suite created by Gerhard Richter in 1999. The news was timed to tomorrow's opening of "Gerhard Richter: 40 Years of Painting," a traveling exhibition that opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in February, then went to the Art Institute of Chicago. (It will be on view in San Francisco through Jan. 14, then it goes to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington from Feb. 20 to May 18.)
The eight paintings, each named "Abstract Picture" and numbered 858-1 through 858-8, are brilliantly colored. Seven are on aluminum panels, and the eighth is on linen. The series was not included in the retrospective in New York or Chicago.
"This is a huge gift for us," said Madeleine Grynsztejn, senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco museum. "With this group we now own 21 works by Richter, ranging from early works in 1966 through all his stylistic periods."

New Public Archive
Art history students and scholars will now have two major archives available to them.
Calvin Tomkins, the New Yorker writer and author of many books on modern art, has donated his research materials to the Museum of Modern Art. The gift includes complete interviews with artists like Robert Rauschenberg and curators like Kirk Varnedoe.
Meanwhile the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, which was given the Duveen Archive by the Metropolitan Museum of Art four years ago, has finished cataloging it and putting it on microfilm. The archive, records of the celebrated dealers who operated from 1869 to 1964 in London, Paris and New York, will be available at the Getty Research Center, and microfilm copies will be given to the Watson Library at the Met, the Witt Library of the Courtauld Institute in London and the Institute of Art History in Paris.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
The DNA Of a Fading Motor Skill: R-1-2-3-4

BYLINE:  By GEORGE BLUMBERG 

 BODY:
MY mother was at the wheel of our blue Chevrolet and my father was next to her, yelling, "More gas, more gas!" It was 1953, and Mom was getting a driving lesson at a time when for most people, driving still required shifting the gears of a manual transmission.
 The sound of grinding gears, the shuddering and bucking that snaps the heads of children in the back seat (like mine, on that memorable day) back and forth, the cries of "clutch in!" and "now shift to second!" -- these once-familiar parts of every new driver's rite of passage have been all but written off as fading bits of Americana. An alarming number of adults no longer share memories like mine. 
 Many perfectly competent drivers now view the ability to drive a manual-shift car as arcane and somewhat exotic, almost a black art. 
But there are still people who want to learn. And there are still parents (and probably spouses) who want to teach. Like tracking tigers in the jungle, weaving rope or starting fires with flint and steel, shifting has historically been taught within families, passed down through the generations. And in some families, it still is.
Driving schools have pretty much dropped out. "We don't have an instruction car to teach manual-transmission driving -- there just isn't enough demand," said Brad Huspek, who has been a driving instructor for 25 years and is a now school administrator for Sears Driving Schools in Lansing, Mich. "It's maybe just a little section in our textbook."
According to Neal Oddes, the manager of product research for J. D. Power & Associates, an auto industry research firm, only about 9 percent of new cars and light trucks have manual transmissions. Another 9 percent have the new manual-automatic hybrids: the driver pushes a button to select a gear, a computer actually makes the shift, and there's no clutch pedal. The great majority, 82 percent, have traditional automatics. Indeed, another term for the manual transmission, standard, has become a misnomer. 
Manual-transmission cars may be cheaper, but not by much. An automatic transmission, financed over the years, adds just a few dollars a month to a car payment, according to Bob VanAlmkerk, a sales manager of Brandfon Honda in Branford, Conn. Manual transmissions, he said, are "more for the performance seeker."
Statistics say he is right. In the premium sports car category, which includes cars like Porsches, the Audi TT and BMW's Z models, manual transmissions are in 61 percent of the new cars sold. Twenty percent are hybrids, and just 19 percent are automatics. For people who want to make use of all the power and versatility of the machine as they drive, controlling the gears is a natural part of the experience.
Whatever cars they drive, proponents of manual shifting talk about practicality -- greater control of the car in slippery conditions, fuel economy. But when pressed, they readily admit that they find shifting fun.
Who wouldn't want to share that with the next generation?
As I grew up, I watched my father's intricate driver's ballet, feet moving from clutch to accelerator to brake and back, hands plying the shift lever in synchronicity. When the day came, I made the transition from passenger to driver. I can imagine my father before me, watching his aunt shift her DeSoto taxi -- she was one of the few women driving cabs in New York City in the 1930's -- or seeing his carpenter father's huge, rough hand stir the big gear lever that sprouted from the floor of his 1936 Pontiac.
Sometimes, children teach parents. "I learned to shift from my son when he was in the fifth grade," said Cindy Willoughby, the communications officer for the Driving School Association of the Americas in Milwaukee and a licensed instructor. "In 1978 my husband blocked my car in the driveway with his new Ford pickup, and he wasn't around to move it." Her son, now 34, told her that he would sit next to her in the pickup and tell her when to shift. "Off we went to the mall," Ms. Willoughby said, laughing at the memory. "It was a little jerky at first, but smooth on the way back." Later Ms. Willoughby taught her two daughters to shift, and now they both drive a car with a five-speed manual transmission.
I taught my own daughter in a Honda Civic Si. Years later, when she picked me up at the Anchorage airport one day in her Toyota four-by-four pickup, I swung myself into the cab and smiled. There in front of me were the five-speed gear lever and the separate transfer case lever to shift into high or low four-wheel drive.
As we drove into the snowstorm, I felt secure. The shifting gene was intact.

Michael Moore's new documentary, "Bowling for Columbine," rapturously greeted at the Cannes Film Festival in May, opens today in New York City and Los Angeles in an atmosphere of intense political polarization. Not that Mr. Moore, a cheerful rabble-rouser and author of the best seller "Stupid White Men," would have it any other way. But in times of political anxiety and global insecurity -- most times, in other words -- arguments have a tendency to turn into shouting matches.
 The most disappointing -- and the most likely -- response to Mr. Moore's disturbing, infuriating and often very funny film would be uncritical support from his ideological friends and summary dismissal from his foes. The slippery logic, tendentious grandstanding and outright demagoguery on display in "Bowling for Columbine" should be enough to give pause to its most ardent partisans, while its disquieting insights into the culture of violence in America should occasion sober reflection from those who would prefer to stop their ears. 
 I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness. Does that sound evasive? I'm sorry if it does, but at the moment, political certainty seems to me to be a cheap and abundant commodity, of much less value than honest ambivalence. 
Mr. Moore, in the good-natured, confrontational style familiar from "Roger and Me" and "TV Nation," his sadly short-lived series on Fox, tracks his subject far and wide: a little too far and a little too wide perhaps. His starting point is the horrific massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Like everyone else, he wonders how such a thing could have happened, and what it says about contemporary American society. 
These questions quickly lead to larger ones: Why do Americans shoot one another so much more often than the citizens of other developed countries? Why do our lives seem to be governed by fear? The recent string of killings around Washington provides a grim reminder that these issues are always timely.
These are hardly simple questions, and Mr. Moore vacillates between acknowledging their complexity and giving in to his own urge to simplify. He dismisses a number of possible answers out of hand. Is violent popular culture to blame? No, because in a country like Japan, with a tiny fraction of our gun deaths, people consume super-brutal movies, video games and comic books with even more voracity than we do. Poverty? No, since Canada and many European nations have much higher unemployment rates and much lower homicide rates. Is it our history of warfare and brutality? Compared with imperial Britain and Nazi Germany, he suggests, we're downright pacific. 
But each of these assertions rides roughshod over some obvious doubts and qualifications. Unemployment, in countries with more extensive welfare states than ours, is not necessarily the same as poverty, and the wholesale brutality of states and empires engaged in wars of conquest is not the same as the retail mayhem of armed individuals.
But though he seems to be hunting for a specific historical cause for events like Columbine, Mr. Moore, when it serves his purposes, is happy to generalize in the absence of empirical evidence and to make much of connections that seem spurious on close examination. Several times he notes that the Columbine shootings occurred on the same day as the heaviest United States bombing of the Kosovo war. The more you think about this coincidence, the less it seems to mean.
He visits a Lockheed Martin plant near Columbine that manufactures missiles and pesters a company flack about the links between the factory's products and the shootings. "I guess I don't see that connection," the man says, standing in front of the company's wares. Mr. Moore and the camera clearly take him for a fool: another stupid white man doing his job. But you don't have to be a big fan of nuclear weapons to think that he might have a point.
This exchange is followed by a montage, accompanied by Louis Armstrong singing "What a Wonderful World," of American foreign policy misdeeds from the 1950's to the present. Their relevance is, again, arguable, but by now it should be clear that Mr. Moore is less interested in argument than in provocation. The last image is of the airplanes smashing into the World Trade Center, accompanied by this text: "Sept. 11, 2001: Osama bin Laden uses his expert C.I.A. training to murder 3,000 people." 
The idiocy of this statement is hardly worth engaging; it is exactly the kind of glib distortion of history that can be taken as a warrant to dismiss everything Mr. Moore has to say. And this is a shame, since much of the movie is worth engaging, and manifests genuine curiosity and a wicked satirical sense along with finger-pointing self-righteousness. While Mr. Moore, as an interviewer, has a tendency to shame his subjects or make them look ridiculous, he can also be a sympathetic, attentive listener. And to his credit, he includes several moments in which he himself is clearly distressed or taken by surprise by what his interlocutors have to say. 
The camera collects quite a few odd, touching and unsettling moments. A home-security consultant, full of matter-of-fact sales talk about deadbolts and fortified safe rooms, breaks down at the mention of Columbine. A visit to James Nichols, whose brother, Terry, helped Timothy McVeigh plan the Oklahoma City bombing, reveals a scared, angry man who lives surrounded by guns on a farm where he grows, of all things, organic soybeans to be made into tofu. And a prosecutor in Michigan, Mr. Moore's home state, explains that guns are a much bigger problem in the white suburbs there than in mostly black urban areas.
"I didn't think that's what you were going to say," Mr. Moore says. "I thought you were going to say it was black kids in the inner city." When he goes against the grain of his own prejudices -- and keeps in check his desire to be the center of attention -- "Bowling for Columbine" is riveting and scary, and its vision of a society racked by fear, riven by inequality and armed to the teeth is neither comforting nor easily wished away.
Mr. Moore's less admirable traits cannot be ignored, even -- and especially -- if you find merit in some of his views. The film seems to reach a natural conclusion when Mr. Moore, accompanied by two boys wounded at Columbine, visits Kmart's corporate headquarters to demand that the company stop selling ammunition. (The high school killers bought their bullets in one of its stores.) But Mr. Moore, unable to forgo another chance to prove his moral superiority, ends the film with a visit to Charlton Heston's house.
You can be repelled by Mr. Heston's actions as president of the National Rifle Association -- he is shown addressing pro-gun rallies that took place in the wake of the school shootings in both Littleton and Flint, Mich. -- and still find Mr. Moore's tactics distasteful. His tendency to scapegoat may satisfy his need for drama, but it makes for lousy politics.
"Bowling for Columbine" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has many scenes of violence, most taken from surveillance videos and the evening news.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Promises To Cooperate With Europe 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, may be under increasing fire in Washington, where Democratic leaders accuse him of having been too soft on corporate wrongdoing. But he won praise from European policy makers here today when he promised to seek their cooperation on a broad range of new accounting standards and regulatory measures.
 Responding to criticism that the United States practices a kind of economic imperialism by requiring some foreign companies to comply with a new corporate oversight law, Mr. Pitt told a gathering of European accounting professionals today, "We seek to usher in a new regulatory regime in concert with you, not impose our solutions on you." 
 Mr. Pitt said he was open to considering waivers in special cases where the new law, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, conflicts with the laws of foreign countries or where foreign regulations can achieve comparable ends by different means. To keep a trans-Atlantic dialogue open on these issues, Mr. Pitt said he was considering having the S.E.C. open an office in Brussels.
But he stopped short of offering the broad exemptions to the law that some Europeans have hoped for. Mr. Pitt said he was obliged "to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act fully for all companies, foreign and domestic," and that "foreign companies can, therefore, expect that many of our new rules will apply to them."
Still, Mr. Pitt's willingness to discuss these issues and consider alternatives was well received at a time when many of the messages Washington sends on economic and regulatory issues are viewed here as one-sided. Frederik Bolkestein, the European Union commissioner for internal markets and taxation, who met privately with Mr. Pitt during his trip to Brussels, said he was encouraged by the new air of collaboration. 
Beyond the corporate governance issues addressed by the Oxley-Sarbanes law, the newly cooperative atmosphere extends to accounting rules, especially for companies wishing to sell stock in countries other than their own. 
Right now, many European companies must prepare their accounts twice under different and sometimes conflicting rules, once for their home country's stock market and regulators and once for Wall Street and the S.E.C. But American and European officials agreed last month to work toward a set of common standards, which in some instances will mean modifying American rules to conform to the international accounting standards generally used in Europe -- an idea that was virtually unthinkable as recently as a year ago.
"Traditionally, the argument from the United States has been that if we want to have an international set of rules, they ought to be U.S. rules, because we have the best system," said Robert H. Herz, the chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, in a recent interview. Referring to the Enron, WorldCom and other corporate scandals, Mr. Herz said, "The recent events have led people to question whether our system is that much superior, and it has increased receptivity toward international accounting standards."
At the same time, the international standards, whose authors sought to combine the best rules from a range of competing national standards, have been gaining momentum abroad. All 15 member nations of the European Union, plus Australia and Russia, have pledged to adopt them by Jan. 1, 2005, increasing pressure on the United States to take them seriously.
"This is the first big move, and it could lead to others," Sir David Tweedie, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board, said of the agreement his board struck last month with its American counterpart, the board led by Mr. Herz.
The two panels will go rule by rule through the two sets of standards over the next few months and vote on which provision is best in each case. That will not always be easy, some experts warned, because they start with different fundamental premises. The international standards tend more toward setting general principles and then requiring accountants to use their own best judgment in following them. By contrast, the American standards set out thousands of specific rules that must be followed.
Critics of the American system say it encourages mindless compliance without considering the broader picture and tramples the spirit of the rules while abiding by their letter. Critics of the international standards say they allow too much room for competing interpretations of the same transactions.
Some of the choices between the rules are expected to be straightforward. For instance, Sir David said he expected the panels to favor the international rules for pension fund accounting, which call for recording fair value of assets at the end of each year. American rules now allow pension funds to use an average value of the assets over five years, which can mask losses, he said.
Other provisions are expected to lead to more debate, like the accounting for research and development costs. The international standards treat development costs like a tangible asset, capitalizing them on the balance sheet and then depreciating them over the life of the product. American rules treat some development costs that way but call for others to be treated as expenses when they are incurred.
The difference can be major for some companies. Nokia, the cellular phone maker, calculated its 2001 net income under both systems, and came up with 2.2 billion euros the European way, but only 1.9 billion euros the American way, in part because it had to treat more of its development costs as expenses.
"The arguments for each rule are pretty evenly matched," said Mary Tokar, a partner at KPMG. "You can't say one is clearly right and the other is clearly wrong."
As a parting word of advice, Mr. Pitt urged international accounting rule makers to keep clear of politics. He apparently was following that rule himself when he refused today to comment on recent calls for his resignation by Congressional Democrats.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Marketers gather to talk of coping with tough times.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
GROWING doubt about the course of the economy has dimmed the mood of consumer marketers as they gather for the first meeting of their trade association in two years.
 The marketers are gathering for the 92nd meeting of the Association of National Advertisers, which began yesterday in Naples, Fla., and continues through Sunday. The uncertainty among members of the association, which canceled its conference last year after the terrorist attacks, is indicated in estimates that attendance will fall to about 400 from almost 500 in 2000. 
 "It's down from previous years, as you might expect, but it's gratifying that we have this many people," John J. Sarsen Jr., president and chief executive of the association, said in an interview before the conference began. 
"Everyone is cautious," Mr. Sarsen added. "Even people who are optimistic are cautious."
Anyone needing additional evidence for that risky outlook found it this week in several places. In a consumer survey by the NPD Group, 89 percent of respondents said they planned to spend the same amount or less during the holiday shopping season than they did in the period a year ago. Also, 98 percent of respondents agreed that buying on sale was just as or more important than it was last year, when the profits of retailers fell after they reduced prices to stimulate demand.
The anxiety in retailing was reflected by an unexpected reshuffling of the senior marketing ranks at Sears, Roebuck & Company only 70 shopping days before Christmas. David Selby, the senior vice president for marketing at Sears -- and a member of the board of the association -- is leaving as of Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Janine Bousquette as executive vice president and chief customer and marketing officer. Word of Mr. Selby's departure came the same day he was named No. 11 on a list of the top 25 "power players" among corporate marketers by the trade publication Advertising Age.
Also, in a report this week on the advertising and marketing services industries, Kevin Sullivan, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said he was concerned about "the impact of the fragile economy" on marketing spending in the fourth quarter and early next year, "as marketers look to protect their bottom lines." As a result, Lehman lowered earnings estimates for Harte-Hanks, the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group.
"These are troubling times for sure, no question about it," said James D. Speros, chief marketing officer for the United States at Ernst & Young in New York, who is the 2001-02 vice chairman of the association.
"The fundamentals for many businesses are still not strong, causing some marketers to pull back and hurting the media and agencies," Mr. Speros said, which is why the conference is being focused on "what advertisers must do to build brands and foster growth in a troubled economy."
Prescriptions to achieve those goals are to be offered this morning by two speakers in the first general session. One is Charles B. Strauss, chairman of Unilever North America in New York and the other is Thomas G. Stemberg, chairman and chief executive at Staples, the office supply retailer.
"The way you survive and prosper in uncertain times in the categories we're in is to innovate on your best brands," Mr. Strauss said. "And that's what we're doing" because "that's where we see real opportunities for growth."
For instance, Mr. Strauss said that in August Unilever began introducing American men to Axe -- a deodorant body spray the company sells in other countries -- with a big, splashy campaign by the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. The budget is large, an estimated $90 million, and "we're very happy with the early results," he added.
"The pressure, the challenge, is to grow the top line," Mr. Strauss said, referring to revenue, "and our marketing spending in the second half and fourth quarter will be significantly higher than what we had a year ago or in the first half."
Mr. Stemberg said Staples also saw advantage in adversity.
"Our basic business is trending positively," Mr. Stemberg said, "and we see a huge opportunity to differentiate ourselves from the many other purveyors of office products."
Staples is introducing this week the first work from its new agency, Martin/Williams in Minneapolis, part of Omnicom. The $70 million campaign is intended to help deliver "high-single-digit revenue growth for the remainder of the year," Mr. Stemberg said, despite the sluggish economy.
At the general session tomorrow, a leading agency executive, Donny Deutsch, will offer suggestions on overcoming tough times. Some of what he plans to say may surprise the audience.
"I think agencies can do better, and clients need to make agencies do better," said Mr. Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at Deutsch in New York, part of the Partnership division of Interpublic. "The harder clients are on agencies, the better agencies become."
"Maybe clients shouldn't stay with agencies 30 years," he added. "What does that mean? Let's make it about accountability. If you don't perform in a year, you should be gone."
The conference is also devoting time to rituals like the election of officers and the presentation of awards.
Mr. Speros of Ernst & Young was elected chairman of the association for 2002-03. He succeeds Dawn Hudson, the chairwoman for 2001-'02; she is the president of Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y., part of PepsiCo.
James R. Stengel, global marketing officer at the Procter & Gamble Company in Cincinnati, was elected vice chairman for 2002-03.
On the awards front, John Hamlin, vice president for the consumer group at the Dell Computer Corporation in Round Rock, Tex., received the Grand Marketer of the Year Award from the trade publication Brandweek, published by VNU, at the dinner last night. Mr. Hamlin was selected from winners of awards in 10 consumer-product categories for his work in helping Dell become the nation's leading brand of personal computers.
Also, Edward A. Faruolo, vice president for corporate marketing at the Cigna Corporation in Philadelphia, will receive today the Robert V. Goldstein Award, named after a former board member of the association and the Advertising Council. Mr. Faruolo is being honored for his work as volunteer director of a pro bono campaign for American for the Arts.

HEADLINE: Ford to Meet Major Investors in an Attempt to Ease Concerns 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 10 

 BODY:
With Ford stock in rapid retreat, senior executives plan to meet with major investors next week to appeal for patience as the company tries a turnaround. But a warm reception from Wall Street seems unlikely, analysts say.
 Investors regard the Ford Motor Company as the weakest among Big Three auto companies, and analysts said they did not sense much urgency in its overhaul efforts. To battle back, the company's critics contend, Ford must send clearer signals about its condition and demonstrate how it intends to deal with a potential recession that might disrupt its plans. 
 "Much of what Ford has already been saying has been totally ignored," said Scott Hill, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein in New York. "The stock is not being crushed because they have not fulfilled their obligations under the restructuring plan. The issue is more immediate." 
Ford stock has fallen 25 percent in the last two weeks, 60 percent since May. It closed at $7.60 today, up 45 cents. The shares have not traded this low since 1991, and analysts have started to question whether Ford could drop below $6 a share, should the company run into more difficulties.
Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., and its chief financial officer, Allan D. Gilmour, will make the company's case at meetings in New York, Boston and San Francisco beginning next Thursday, a day after Ford is expected to announce its third-quarter results. 
David Reuter, a Ford spokesman, said the company did not expect a quick rebound in its stock as a result of the road show, the first by executives since Mr. Ford met with investors in January to promote an offering of preferred stock. He said the executives expected blunt questions.
"I can understand how those on the outside might get the impression we're not moving fast enough," Mr. Reuter said. "The bottom line for us is if investors say, 'Hey, I understand their plan, and it's credible. Let's be patient and let them work through their challenges.' "
Through September, Ford's sales of cars and trucks are down 6.8 percent from a year ago, compared with small increases at General Motors and Chrysler. With almost no new vehicles to roll out until late next year, the decline in sales at Ford are bound to continue, said Michael Luckey, an industry consultant in Kinnelon, N.J.
Surprises, more than weak sales, dismay Steven Girsky, who follows the industry for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
Late last month, for example, Ford unexpectedly projected an operating loss of $200 million this year for Jaguar. Meanwhile, it agreed in talks with the Canadian Auto Workers union to delay the closing of a factory in Oakville, Ontario, that was among the plants to be shut as part of the turnaround plan. Instead of eliminating 1,400 jobs at the plant, Ford will shift 900 jobs to a neighboring factory, and the plant will be mothballed, not permanently closed.
Mr. Girsky said such setbacks justified investors' displeasure. "Is the market going to an excess?" he asked. "Maybe. But the burden is on the company to demonstrate that they are attacking their cost structure."
Company officials insist such work is under way. Ford expects to post a small profit for the third quarter, which would be its first in more than a year. Yesterday, Ford and General Motors said that they would jointly develop a new six-speed, front-wheel-drive transmission, a rare collaboration that will save each company millions of dollars.
Also yesterday, Ford's board voted to keep the dividend of 10 cents a share for the fourth quarter, a sign of its faith in Ford's stability. 
But an estimate by Lehman Brothers that was issued yesterday showed that Ford's higher borrowing costs resulted in about $600 in extra costs per vehicle compared with General Motors.
In their meetings with investors, executives plan to emphasize that Mr. Ford, a great-grandson of the company's founder, is focused on his duties as chief executive -- an attempt analysts said to try to refute any perception that Mr. Ford lacks enthusiasm for the job he assumed a year ago. 
Mr. Hill, the Sanford Bernstein analyst, said Ford's issues were bigger than Mr. Ford himself.
In the same vein, Mr. Girsky said he was not concerned about the effectiveness of Mr. Gilmour, 68, who came out of retirement last summer to take the chief financial officer job. 
Mr. Gilmour has been diligent about returning telephone calls and providing financial information, Mr. Girsky said. But he said he was puzzled that other executives -- notably the chief operating officer, Nicholas V. Scheele, and James J. Padilla, the president of Ford's North American operations -- had not been employed in Ford's confidence-building campaign.
Mr. Reuter said that each executive was playing his appropriate role. 
Mr. Scheele and Mr. Padilla "are experts at getting costs out of products," Mr. Reuter said, noting their roles in overhauling Jaguar and then Ford of Europe over the last several years. "We have them doing their jobs and concentrating on what they are good at," he said.

HEADLINE: A Tempting 13% Yield, but Is It Secure? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
DO these people know what they are doing?
 Confusion and chaos seem to have been the hallmark of management over the last week at TXU, the former Texas Utilities, which first stunned investors with an earnings warning and then bungled questions about its debt situation and liquidity as it held three conference calls with investors. 
 Perhaps the company's message that all is really O.K. finally got through yesterday, as the shares rose $2.90, to $17.55. Now the share price is down only 58 percent in October. 
That is a stunning performance for a company long regarded as a nice, safe electric utility. Its share price rose in 2001, even as Enron was collapsing. "TXU was regarded as one of those few companies that was above the malaise of difficulties," Erle Nye, the chairman and chief executive, told me yesterday.
The immediate cause of TXU's problems was in Britain, where it bought a big utility from the government in 1998. Mr. Nye said managers at Dallas headquarters did not realize just how bad things were getting until about Sept. 18. After a hasty investigation, the company broke the bad news to investors last Friday. "We were clearly the victims of undue optimism," Mr. Nye said.
At that conference call, and the ones that followed on Monday and Wednesday, officials seemed to have trouble sorting out the facts, particularly about the company's debt situation. "We made mistakes," Mr. Nye conceded. There was plenty of confusion over whether a default on British debt would lead to a cross-default on American debt. It would, but for only $500 million. "I asked our treasury people how that got in there," Mr. Nye said of the cross-default clause. "Nobody has been able to give me a reason."
It appears that TXU is still run like the old-fashioned regulated utility it once was -- one where managers took for granted that cash was available when it was needed, and did not pay much attention to liquidity issues. "I think they're in denial about how quickly the credit situation could turn into a crisis, and aren't planning for it," said Carol Levenson of Gimme Credit, a bond analyst.
The way it looks now, the British operations have a questionable future. TXU talks of putting $700 million more into them, but makes no promises. The clear implication is that it might walk away from that subsidiary if things become a lot worse.
There are other issues. Mr. Nye said that the company had hoped to be able to use "structured transactions" to meet earnings goals this year, but that the market for such trades had virtually closed in Britain. He explained that such trades could have moved profits from one period to another, thus improving reported results. In the current atmosphere, such things are not viewed as a positive for a company.
And then there is Mr. Nye's own well-timed trade. On Sept. 10, days before the bad news arrived from Britain, he sold 47,485 shares for $2.2 million -- shares that are now worth $833,362. He said yesterday that the money went toward buying a vacation and retirement home in Carmel, Calif. "Money doesn't go as far there," he explained. He is hurt that anyone might think he had acted improperly. "I had no knowledge of that at the time."
TXU's tumble shows how jittery investors became after Enron fell, and it could turn out to be an overreaction. An important issue is whether TXU's 13.7 percent dividend yield can be maintained. "I believe the dividend is secure," Mr. Nye told me. "I don't know of anything today that would make me think otherwise."
That sounds good. The trouble is that recent events make it clear that there were plenty of things that Mr. Nye and his colleague should have known, but didn't.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fell by 40,000 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Fewer Americans signed up last week for state unemployment benefits, but the job market is still struggling, the Labor Department reported today. 
 First-time jobless claims fell by 40,000, the biggest weekly drop since April, to a seasonally adjusted 384,000 in the week ended Oct. 5, the report said. 
 The less volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims stood at 412,250, a decrease from the previous week, but still well above the 400,000 level that analysts see as an indication of a lackluster labor market. 
Even so, last week's drop in initial claims was much larger than expected. Analysts said they were encouraged by the decline but noted that one week's data was not enough to read as a labor market trend. 
"I have mixed emotions," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief United States economist at ABN Amro. "You need to see one or two more weeks of below-400,000 numbers before you can say things have gotten better or stopped deteriorating." 
The number of workers remaining on unemployment benefits fell by 15,000, to a seasonally adjusted 3.6 million, in the week ended Sept. 28, the most recent week this data was available.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that import prices in September increased by 0.7 percent, reflecting a big rise in petroleum prices. So far this year, total petroleum import costs have risen by more than 60 percent. Excluding petroleum, import prices were up by a more modest 0.2 percent.
The rise in petroleum prices, some analysts say, could help to further erode consumer confidence and spending. The surge in oil costs "has to be taking its toll on consumer spendable income," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers.

HEADLINE: The Economy Is Better Than It Looks 

BYLINE:  By Steven Rattner; Steven Rattner is managing principal at the Quadrangle Group, a private investment firm.

 BODY:
A sense of gloom permeates most conversations about the economy, but our current situation is not as dire as some would have it. We may not be growing at the heady rates of the late 1990's, but we're a long way from a Japan-like bubble economy or even a double-dip recession.
 The news is not all bad. In the second half of this year, the economy is likely to expand at a rate of at least 3 percent, inflation remains subdued and interest rates are near record lows. Most important, productivity has continued to rise, surprisingly, right through the recession. That's particularly important because it means that the efficiency gains of the 90's are intact and building. Only through higher productivity can we achieve higher incomes -- and those are continuing to rise as well. All in all, our economic performance still leads the world. 
 So why are we feeling so sorry for ourselves? Lingering joblessness, the collapse of the stock market, the rash of corporate bankruptcies and the misconduct of some business leaders are distressing, but they have only a limited effect on the overall performance of the economy. The dramatic drop in the stock market, for example, is likely to reduce economic growth this year by only about 0.7 percentage points from what it otherwise would have been.
To be sure, challenges remain, like rebuilding shrunken business investment. Some economic indicators -- September retail sales, for example -- have not been encouraging. A war with Iraq could dramatically alter the outlook, particularly if accompanied by a sharp rise in oil prices.
Even without the prospect of war, some pessimists fear that consumers will stop spending and that buoyant home prices will turn downward. Either is certainly possible. But low interest rates allow consumers the opportunity to refinance their mortgages, the equivalent of a substantial tax cut. Those low rates have doubtless contributed to home prices that may well have risen too quickly. Still, just as this year's 30 percent drop in the stock market hasn't brought down the economy, neither should a softening of housing prices. Others fret about deflation, the specter of relentlessly declining prices. Yet prices in the United States are rising enough to make this unlikely.
We're still feeling the hangover from bad investment decisions in the telecommunications industry and other areas, as well as the stock market foolishness of the 90's. Small fixes like extending unemployment benefits may make sense on economic and humanitarian grounds, but the Bush administration's ill-conceived tax cuts and exuberant spending by Congress have put our budget in a straitjacket. Instead of the surpluses of the late 90's, we now face endless deficits. To provide a meaningful stimulus to today's economy, Washington must concede that we can afford neither tax cuts nor new spending programs, but there's little political appetite to do that.
The only short-term policy tool available to us is a flexible monetary policy. Happily, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates 11 times since January 2001, and the benefits of low rates are still filtering through the economy. Another cut would help the recovery by restoring consumer and investor confidence with little risk of pushing prices up.
 But our principal economic challenges lie not with our immediate troubles but well down the road: a budget deficit unlikely to shrink to acceptable levels because of tax cuts promised in the future and the failure to address the eventual exhaustion of our Social Security reserves. Paying more attention to those long-term issues would be the best medicine for today's less serious ailments.

HEADLINE: Cultural Groups and Charities Are Feeling Each Bump on Wall Street 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The plunging stock market is taking philanthropy and the institutions it supports down with it.
 Shriveling endowments and a new wave of philanthropic thriftiness have compelled many organizations to lay off workers, to leave staff positions unfilled and to tell grant seekers not to bother. Some cultural institutions are debating whether to raise admission and parking fees to offset the loss in donations as donors have quietly reduced their generosity to match their smaller portfolios. 
 "Tack a list of dot-coms, telcos, venture capital firms, financial services companies and tech companies to a wall and throw a dart," one New York City fund-raiser said. "I guarantee you'll find an executive that can't live up to a commitment he made to an institution." 
The fallout has become more apparent in the two weeks since two major philanthropists, Alberto W. Vilar and Ted Turner, disclosed that they would have trouble keeping their charitable commitments, echoing similar revelations by less prominent donors.
The Metropolitan Opera has set up a reserve fund to cover unfulfilled pledges, a practice once limited to more humble organizations like the United Way, and fund-raisers in New York say other white-shoe institutions will follow its lead.
But getting institutions to name names of hard-up donors is virtually impossible. Rumors about Mr. Vilar's defaults, for example, circulated for a year before Lorin Maazel, the new music director of the New York Philharmonic, spoke publicly about them, infuriating some in the philanthropic world, where tact and discretion are everything.
"It was mean and embarrassing," one fund-raiser said. "It kills fund-raising."
Many were shocked when Mr. Maazel, who said Mr. Vilar, a technology investor, had pulled the plug on the Maazel-Vilar Conductors Competition, and Michael Sonnenreich, president of the Washington Opera, confirmed the rumors. Since philanthropists almost always make good on their pledges, many fund-raisers are betting that Mr. Vilar will do so when his investments recover.
"When the economy is good, you see this tremendous rise in philanthropy, but when the going gets tough, it's tough for everybody," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "We have relationships with donors in good times and in bad times. What everyone is overlooking is how generous Mr. Vilar has already been."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Maazel said he had said all he wanted to say about the matter.
Ms. Brooks Hopkins and others said Mr. Vilar's problems were not unique. Tamar C. Podell, vice president for planning and development at Lincoln Center Inc. said: "We've had one or two individuals who have asked to extend their contributions. We're hoping that sort of thing doesn't become a trend, though."
But the challenges facing charities are broad and deep. First the dot-coms cratered, followed by the telecommunications and information technology industries. Media companies are suffering. Venture capitalists have lost their shirts.
The Enron collapse kicked off a chain reaction of corporate scandals that has taken money out of the pockets of chief executives and other senior managers who were paid in stock and options, depleting the philanthropic trough. 
Wall Street, the bedrock of philanthropy for New York City and increasingly for the West Coast, is going through yet another round of layoffs, and even those who keep their jobs will not get bonuses this year.
"This is worse than the recession in the early 1990's, because so many sectors of the economy have been affected," said Peter Hero, president of the Community Foundation Silicon Valley, which saw money flowing into its donor accounts drop 54 percent, to $111 million in the year ended June compared with $243 million the previous year.
Ms. Podell said organizations like hers faced a triple threat.
"The economy is soft, which means reduced earnings, which translates into concerns about corporate giving," she said. "Then there is the stock market decline, which we fear might have a negative effect on year-end giving by individual donors, and finally, the foundation support that we have come to greatly appreciate is most likely going to be reduced."
Relationships with big donors like Mr. Vilar become even more important in hard economic times, further enforcing the code of silence about donors who have difficulty meeting their pledges, fund-raisers said. When portfolios and incomes shrink, major philanthropists tend to cut off marginal institutions but strengthen their commitment to pet causes.
Nonetheless, every time news suggests that a major philanthropist has lost money, chatter on the charity circuit starts.
A year ago, Sid Bass, the Texas investor, had to unload $1.8 billion of Disney stock to cover margin calls, and immediately, phones started ringing with speculation that he would default on his commitments to the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University, the Aspen Institute and a host of other institutions he and his wife, Mercedes, have favored. Mr. Bass's secretary said it was his policy "not to comment on anything like that."
Phones jangled again when word went out that Thomas W. Weisel, founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment and advisory firm that has focused almost exclusively on technology, was selling his vast art collection. But Mr. Weisel is selling only 21 works of abstract expressionism, among them works by Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Franz Kline.
Amanda Duckworth, a spokeswoman for Mr. Weisel, noted that he owned 700 pieces of art and that his interests had shifted to Oceanic art.
"He has given generously to the art world and intends to continue that pattern of contributions," Ms. Duckworth said.
Speculation has also centered on Gary Winnick, the chairman of bankrupt Global Crossing, who pledged $5 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1999, but Rosalie Zalis, director of the Winnick Family Foundation, dismissed it.
"We are on track with all of our MoMA pledges," Ms. Zalis said. "Every commitment Mr. Winnick has made will be honored so long as the grantee meets the terms of our agreement, meaning that they provide a budget, show evidence of other funding or whatever was part of the terms."
Ms. Zalis said that the foundation sold all of its Global Crossing shares on April 4, 2000, and that all its holdings are in cash. According to the foundation's most recent available tax filings, it had $46 million in assets at the end of 2000.
Mr. Turner, however, did not sell out of his stake in AOL Time Warner as quickly as Mr. Winnick sold his shares of Global Crossing. He started complaining that the fall in the stock was putting a crimp in his philanthropy last summer, and his portfolio has gotten even slimmer since then. He talked of extending payment schedules at the time, and last week, the Turner Foundation Inc., one of three charitable vehicles used by Mr. Turner, announced that it would not consider any grant proposals in 2003 and would consider only those proposals it requested in the following year.
"The shares he had to make available for philanthropy don't go as far as they did at previous price levels," said Michael V. Finley, president of the foundation.
Mr. Finley said the philanthropic downsizing has bothered Mr. Turner.
"He feels so frustrated that he doesn't have the ability to give at the levels he gave before," Mr. Finley said.
The foundation is also laying off employees, a trend that is rampant in the foundation world. Just as individual investors have suffered losses, foundations have been equally hit. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which was the benchmark for philanthropy in Silicon Valley, had a $13 billion endowment in 1999 but now has only $3.8 billion, thanks to a risky investment strategy that kept the bulk of its assets in Hewlett-Packard stock.
Last month, the foundation said it would cut its 160-member staff by half and reduce grant-making by 20 percent, to $200 million next year.
The Ford Foundation's endowment has fallen more than 36 percent from its peak of $14.5 billion on Sept. 30, 1999, to $9.2 billion at the end of last month. Susan V. Berresford, the foundation's president, said it planned to eliminate 19 jobs this fiscal year, some through attrition, leaving its staff at 615. Closing Ford's office in the Philippines will cut another 14 positions.
Ford's general reserve fund, which is used for large one-time and capital grants, is likely to fall to $25 million this year, Ms. Berresford said, a 67 percent decrease from last year. The budget for continuing grants will stay at $480 million this year.
"This is in the nature of downsizing and belt-tightening, which is going on everywhere," Ms. Berresford said. "Foundations face pressure from two directions: You have less money to spend, and there's more demand on you and more problems to address."
Seasoned fund-raisers are trying to shrug off the negative portents. Giving more than doubled in the 1990's, rising to $210 billion last year, or a 2.3 percent drop when adjusted for inflation. Charities were braced for worse news then, and so remain hopeful that this year will similarly turn out better than expected.
"There is still a tremendous amount of wealth that is out there and accessible to these nonprofits," said Leo P. Arnoult, president of Arnoult & Associates Inc., a fund-raising advisory firm in Memphis. "At board meetings, I have heard some wealthy, influential people say that the sky is falling and that this may be an unprecedented economic downturn, but that concern can become self-fulfilling."

Ford Appeals for Patience As It Attempts Turnaround
With Ford stock in rapid retreat, senior executives plan to meet with major investors to appeal for patience as the company attempts a turnaround. Ford's shares have fallen 25 percent in the last two weeks and 60 percent since May.
 But Ford should not expect a warm reception from Wall Street; analysts said they did not sense much urgency in Ford's overhaul efforts. To battle back, critics contend, Ford must send clearer signals about its condition and demonstrate how it intends to deal with its potential problems. Page C5.

HEADLINE: Court Rules for Cameroon In Oil Dispute With Nigeria 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The World Court ruled at The Hague today that Cameroon was the rightful owner of an oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea that had long been claimed by Nigeria. 
 The decision in a longstanding dispute could shuffle some of the oil wealth in an area thought to hold huge offshore deposits. 
 Oil experts said nobody knew how much oil the area handed to Cameroon had, since the dispute had limited exploration. But its proximity to other abundant fields holds the promise of deposits of hundreds of millions of barrels, analysts say, a timely boost for Cameroon, whose production has been steadily declining. 
The two countries, which share a 1,000-mile border, have fought for more than a decade over the Bakassi Peninsula, in a part of the world that the Bush administration believes may one day supplant the Mideast as America's primary source of oil.
Industry experts and executives discount that notion, pointing out that most of the world's oil reserves are concentrated in the Middle East. But the decision by the International Court of Justice about the Bakassi Peninsula may advance American plans to foster stability in West Africa, the experts said, if Nigeria accepts the ruling peacefully.
"If you are looking at this from the perspective of the United States government, I don't think it's terribly important whether the peninsula belongs to Cameroon or Nigeria," said James Burkhard, associate director of global oil for Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "What's important," he said, "is that there's a secure operating environment for oil companies. Bakassi has been in dispute for a long, long time."
ExxonMobil, one of the oil companies active in the region, declined to comment on the ruling or its impact, saying it had not had enough time to study the court's decision.
Nonetheless, few industry experts say the Bakassi Peninsula holds enough oil to change the mix of supply from West Africa or to shake up global markets. 
"There's so much activity in Nigeria and Sao Tome that finding a few hundred million barrels of oil will not drastically change reserves and production in West Africa," said Mike Rodgers, senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm. "But it could have a big impact on the local economy of Cameroon."
Still, the decision is a blow to Nigeria, the largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa and the fifth-largest supplier of oil to the United States. Besides potential oil reserves, the disputed area has rich fish stocks and military importance.
"If we lose Bakassi we lose our eastern access to the Atlantic," a Nigerian naval officer told Reuters. "Our naval ships cannot move freely to southern Africa, for instance, without Cameroon's approval."
The legal case dates back to 1994, when Cameroon petitioned the court to decide the matter. The two countries had troops stationed in the area, and clashes were frequent. 
The governments agreed to a cease-fire in 1996, but fighting continued for two more years. Earlier this year, Nigeria warned that tensions were rising again.
Although Nigeria initially disputed the court's jurisdiction, the leaders of the two countries, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Paul Biya of Cameroon, pledged during a meeting in Paris last month to accept whatever decision was handed down.
The Nigerian government said tonight that it was "inappropriate to talk of winners and losers," since both countries would benefit by having the matter settled.
"The judgment will resolve many outstanding matters between the two states and provide a way forward for both in areas which have caused difficulties in the past," Musa Elayo, an official in the Nigerian Justice Ministry, said in a statement released by the presidency.
Still, analysts said Nigeria's independent-minded military might react strongly against the decision, potentially keeping the dispute going.
The case, like most of Africa's border disputes, boiled down to the interpretation of treaties drafted long before the countries attained independence. Colonial overseers carved up Africa in an often haphazard way, leading to chaos throughout the continent.
Eritrea and Ethiopia, which fought a vicious two-year border war from 1998 to 2000, agreed to accept a compromise decision by an arbitration panel at The Hague earlier this year.
In the case of the Bakassi Peninsula, the court ruled that the Anglo-German Agreement of 1913 had given sovereignty over the disputed area to Cameroon, a former German protectorate later divided up by the French and the British. Nigeria, a former British colony, and Cameroon became independent in 1960.
Reaction from Cameroon was not immediately available.
Despite its victory, Cameroon did not get all it was seeking. The court awarded other disputed parcels along the border to Nigeria and ordered each country to pull troops from land handed over to the other. The court rejected Cameroon's requests for compensation from Nigeria for its long occupation of the peninsula, saying that giving the land to Cameroon resolved the matter.

HEADLINE: Suburban Rail Merger Plan Draws Praise and Concern 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
A plan announced on Wednesday to merge the problem-riddled Long Island Rail Road with the relatively civilized Metro-North Railroad has drawn both raised eyebrows and tentative praise.
 No one is sure what the merger planned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will ultimately mean for the hundreds of thousands of riders who use the two systems to commute to and from New York City every day. Authority officials said the move would save money, improve service and eliminate duplication in areas like administrative services and capital planning. 
 "There are good parts of Metro-North and bad parts," said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority. "There are good parts of the Long Island Rail Road and bad parts. Let's bring them all together and take only the good parts." 
But some Metro-North commuters said they were worried that they had more to lose than to gain. 
"I think what commuters are going to be concerned about is, is the quality of the service on Metro-North in any way going to be brought down to the level of what Long Island riders have to endure?" asked Jim Cameron, vice chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North Rail Commuter Council, an advocacy group created by the Connecticut Legislature.
The merger is part of a restructuring plan that Peter S. Kalikow, the chairman of the transportation authority, said would be submitted for approval to the State Legislature this year and phased in over two years. Another part of the plan involves merging Long Island Bus and New York City Transit bus lines under the umbrella of M.T.A. Bus, a development that some have suggested is linked to the seven-week strike by workers for Queens bus companies that ended in August.
An agency called M.T.A. Capital would oversee expansion projects for all divisions of the authority. 
But the merger of the two commuter railroads has quickly become the most talked-about change. "The stabilization and expansion of the region's economy requires a regional approach to the provision of commuter rail services," Mr. Kalikow said in a statement.
Mr. Kelly, the authority spokesman, said the plan had the strong support of Gov. George E. Pataki.
By many accounts, the Long Island Rail Road has improved since the days when the preponderance of broken air-conditioners, delayed trains and surly employees spawned Web sites like www.ihatethelirr.com and nicknames like "Wrong Island Rail Road." In 1999, the average Long Island Rail Road car traveled 28,578 miles without breaking down; on Metro-North, the mean distance between failures was 70,533 miles.
Last year, 1,100 riders surveyed by the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council, a government-appointed panel, graded the service a C-plus, complaining that there were too few seats on trains and too few parking spots in station lots. There were also positive signs, with riders applauding the new double-decker trains.
Metro-North is not subject to similar annual surveys, Mr. Cameron said. But when it comes to figures like on-time performance, Metro-North generally comes out ahead. According to the most recent figures, Mr. Kelly said, its trains are on time 97.8 percent of the time, while Long Island trains are on time only 94.7 percent of the time.
Keith Peterson lives in Hastings-on Hudson, N.Y., and takes Metro-North to and from work in New York City. Friends and co-workers have told him enough stories about Long Island commutes to make him hope that the situation does not change. "I hope Metro-North management stays in control," he said, "because they are much better than L.I.R.R." 
But Peter Haynes, president of the L.I.R.R. Commuters Campaign, an independent group, said he hoped Long Islanders' commutes would improve. "In just about every objective way you can measure performance, they do better than the Long Island Rail Road," he said of Metro-North. "This does present a rare opportunity for optimism among L.I.R.R. commuters, about seeing actual improvements as opposed to just hearing the lip service that they're so used to."
On Long Island, Mike Wilson, 27, of East Northport, said he favored the merger "as long as they don't run the rates up."
It seems clear that some of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 62,000 employees will lose their jobs in the course of the restructuring, but it is not clear which ones. Mr. Kalikow said that he did not expect "a dramatic change in that figure" and that the plan would not unilaterally change the authority's collective bargaining agreements. 
On Long Island, some commuters said they hoped their sprawling train system, for all its problems, would keep its name. "You can't change the name of the Long Island Rail Road," said Tom Krausz, 50, of Stony Brook. "That's history."

HEADLINE: Shoppers Take A Holiday 

BYLINE:  By TRACIEROZHON 

 BODY:
The country's largest retailers reported September sales so dismal that they were only slightly better than sales a year before, when many shoppers stayed away from stores after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 The results reported yesterday further worried an industry looking warily toward a holiday shopping season, with consumers already troubled by a falling stock market, weak job prospects and the possibility of a war with Iraq. 
 "Christmas is looking bleak," said Ben Johnson, the editor of Shopping Center World, a trade newsletter published by Primedia. "Back-to-school was disappointing to say the least, and now the September figures show the darlings like Target and Kohl's are down. They were like the rocks." 
Sales at stores open at least a year were up just 1.2 percent from last September, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite measure. Discounters were up 3.1 percent, while department stores were down 3 percent.
One analyst after another sounded like Scrooge, pointing to evidence that retailers have already begun to expect the worst through the end of the year. Some Christmas decorations are already on sale, for example, and blue jeans, once best sellers, are being marked down in many places, they said.
Worst of all, no runaway toy success is in sight, the kind of must-have product that leads to televised tales of long lines or encourages parents to pay scalpers to to find that perfect gift for their children. "There's no Razor scooter or Furby or Cabbage Patch coming out," said Russell Jones, vice president for retail consulting at Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.
The holiday season, when the toy industry in particular generates a big portion of its sales, is now "a big question mark," said Thomas P. Conley, president of the Toy Industry Association, even though earlier this year the industry had predicted a 4 to 6 percent increase from last year.
More broadly, while many retail experts blamed the softening economy in general, Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research, said a lot of consumers were just plain bored with the merchandise.
"Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said there was no real difference between Store A and Store B," he said. 
One reason for the weak showing at shopping malls is that many consumers may be tapped out from buying big items like cars and houses.
The September results were particularly disappointing because many experts had thought the month would be an easy big score because of the comparison with the dismal results the previous September.
Now, despite an economy that is no longer in recession, many analysts are saying the gains for the holiday shopping season may turn out to be lower than last year's.
Michael Niemira, an economist with the Bank of Toyko Mitsubishi, said the risks for retail -- sales and earnings -- are "all on the downside." He listed two possibilities: "If by some miracle, the war tensions wane, the best you'll do is a 3.75 percent rise over last year," he said; but if a war breaks out in Iraq before the end of the year and there are consequences like higher oil prices, he said, holiday sales figures could be gruesome.
"Given what we've seen in the last two months, it's an absolutely pessimistic picture," Mr. Niemira said. The economist mentioned a particularly alarming survey of retail executives done by the National Retail Federation. "The September numbers make it even worse," he said.
By the 79-store index compiled by Mr. Niemira's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, sales at chain stores in September rose about 1.5 percent -- compared with 0.9 percent a year ago. It was the smallest gain reported since the attacks. The department stores did the worst, with apparel sellers second.
Even some never-fail favorites of shoppers have stumbled. Sales at store opened al least a year at Kohl's, for example, dropped 3.2 percent after a year of double-digit increases.
Similar sales at J. C. Penney, which rose 8.1 percent in September 2001, fell 3.1 percent last month. Target, another success story, fell slightly. Wal-Mart Stores, the country's largest retailer, rose 3.3 percent, but that was well below the company's initial projections, and at the low end of its revised estimates.
There were a handful of sunny stories, but they were rare amid the general gloom. The Limited gained 6 percent, and Neiman Marcus was up 18.7 percent.
Todd D. Slater, who covers the retail industry for Lazard, said long-term averages continued to deteriorate. "Mall traffic is way off," he said.
What of September's hot weather, which several stores blamed for the poor showing of autumn and winter wools?
"Don't blame the weather," said Mr. Slater, who produced charts to show the temperatures from New York to Los Angeles were, on average, only 1 to 3 percent higher than in September 2001.
According to Chuck Hill, director of research for Thomson First Call, 9 of 18 apparel companies have now warned that they will miss their earlier estimates for the third quarter. Many had already been revised downward.
Because of the weak September numbers, some retailers are reconsidering their fourth-quarter projections. Yesterday afternoon, Gap, which has been on a long downward trend, projected that per-share earnings for the fourth quarter would be 2 to 7 cents below earlier expectations, largely because of the extra transportation rerouting expenses and the lost sales connected with the West Coast port shutdown. B. J.'s Wholesale Club also predicted earnings for the fourth quarter would be less than originally expected.
Many of the worst showings were at companies that specialize in apparel for teenagers -- only a while ago the great hope of the clothing business. But yesterday's numbers for Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Wet Seal were dispiriting.
Still, some analysts, pointing to the fact that American Eagle's shares were up yesterday, said the worst might be over for some retailers.
"The fact the stock goes up on bad numbers indicates that we're close to the bottom," Mr. Slater said. "Because the bad news is not as bad as the stock prices."
Lazard is taking a neutral stance on buying retail stocks. Mr. Slater, who predicted yesterday that November "could get pretty ugly," said that then might be the time to buy. "The only time to buy is when you're in the belly, suffering the max pain," he said. 
Despite the dim outlook, a few special items sparked interest among those affluent buyers who have not suffered too much from the decline in stocks.
"We mailed our Christmas catalog in early September," said Bob Friedland, a spokesman for F. A. O. Schwarz. "And some of the things are already sold out."
What's sold out?
"Several one-of-a-kind things," Mr. Friedland said. "Two of our one-of-a-kind Barbies, for $8,000 apiece, have gone."
But that's only two dolls.
"It's really too early to tell," he replied. "We'll know more after Thanksgiving."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ALERT; 
New York Police Step Up Security After Warning by the F.B.I.

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
The New York Police Department said yesterday that it had increased security around bridges, tunnels, financial centers and landmarks in response to an F.B.I. warning that the local authorities should take "additional prudent steps" to detect and deter potential terrorist attacks.
 The F.B.I. said the warning, transmitted to state and local law enforcement agencies, was prompted by threats contained in recently broadcast recorded statements by Osama bin Laden and his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. When the bin Laden statement was taped is not known, but F.B.I. officials said they believed Mr. Zawahiri's tape was made in recent weeks. 
 Police and F.B.I. officials emphasized that they had no specific information regarding a threat in New York or elsewhere.
"Although there is no specific threat to New York City or any other location, the New York City Police Department has increased security at sensitive locations out of an abundance of caution," Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement released yesterday.
A senior New York police official said that the increased uniformed patrols would focus on the Wall Street area in Lower Manhattan and other financial centers, the bridges and tunnels that link Manhattan to the city's other boroughs and to New Jersey, and city landmarks.
The department will also focus its Hercules patrols, a program of heavily armed officers traveling in armored sport utility vehicles, around financial centers and other areas of concern.
The department will also increase harbor patrols, the official said.
Mr. Zawahiri, the Qaeda network's chief strategic planner, threatened new attacks on the United States and its economy in the audiotape. The tape was broadcast on Al Jazeera on Tuesday. On Sunday, Al Jazeera, which is based in Qatar, broadcast an audiotape of Mr. bin Laden in which he refers to focusing on key sectors of the United States economy.
"The coordinated release of these statements, coupled with our knowledge of ongoing plotting by Al Qaeda members and threat information described by detainees, strengthens previous assessments that Al Qaeda continues to plan major attacks against U.S. interests," the F.B.I. warning said.
An F.B.I. official said that agents had played the tapes for a senior Qaeda detainee. The warning said the detainee "maintains that Al Qaeda would only release such a statement after approving a specific plan for an attack."
The recording of Mr. Zawahiri, in which he refers to recent events including a July 1 United States bombing in Afghanistan and speaks about the campaign against Iraq, is the first indication that the fugitive Qaeda operative appears to have survived the military campaign in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Moles At Work 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So here's my theory: Michael Oxley, Harvey Pitt and George W. Bush are all Communist moles who have worked their way into the center of the capitalist system in order to destroy it. How else can you make sense of their actions?
 It's true that in July they grudgingly agreed to a corporate reform bill, which briefly calmed the growing investor panic. That was because it's essential for them to control Congress -- they need maximum leeway to wreck the U.S. economy. But then they found a better answer. Saber-rattling over Iraq does double duty. It distracts the media: on Wednesday the Dow fell 215 points, hitting a nearly five-year low, while consumer confidence fell to levels not seen since 1996, yet neither story was treated as front-page news. And war talk itself helps depress stocks and consumer confidence, and further undermines the economy. 
 The master stroke came last week. Even as evidence mounted that the wheels are coming off our so-called recovery, the conspirators carefully destroyed the credibility of July's corporate reforms. The Financial Times reports that it wasn't just Congressional Republicans and the accounting industry that blocked the appointment of John Biggs to head a crucial new accounting oversight board; the White House was "concerned at labor union backing for Mr. Biggs."
Now that the best candidate has been humiliated and betrayed, nobody of stature will take the post. That means corporate reform is dead in the water. And if the conspirators hold the House and regain the Senate, they can proceed with their wrecking program -- driving the budget even deeper into long-term deficit, scaring small investors and blocking any actions that might pull the economy out of its deepening funk. 
O.K., I'm not quite sure about this theory. There is another theory that might explain what these guys are doing. They may simply be constitutionally incapable (actually, given the presence of John Ashcroft, make that unconstitutionally incapable) of doing what has to be done. 
What we've learned over the past year is the extent to which the modern business game is rigged in favor of insiders. Self-dealing has become pervasive: incredibly generous executive compensation, sweet-deal loans and preferential access to I.P.O.'s were standard practice in many companies that have not yet become targets of S.E.C. investigation. 
And deceptive accounting, which lured the public into buying stock even as insiders were bailing out, must have been very widespread indeed. In the last three years of the bubble reported corporate profits soared, but the overall measure of profits calculated by the U.S. Commerce Department, which is unaffected by the maneuvers companies use to cook their books, hardly grew at all.
In short, the fix was in. If we're to have a real recovery, it's urgent that ordinary investors be reassured that those days are over. Yet it may be hard for our current leaders to understand that urgency: all their lives, the fix has been in on their behalf. 
Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported another piece of the Harken Energy story, one that provides even more evidence of how family connections smoothed Mr. Bush's business career. The key defense against charges that his sale of his Harken stock amounted to insider trading has always been the fact that while that stock's price plunged soon after he sold his shares, it then recovered, albeit temporarily. 
Now we know why it recovered. It wasn't just the mysterious invitation to drill for oil off Bahrain. Harken also pulled a trick that would be emulated on a larger scale by Enron: In effect it borrowed money to pay its bills, while using loopholes in accounting rules to conceal the resulting debt.
What made the trick possible was Harken's guardian angel, a powerful institution controlled by an oil man, Robert Stone, who was a strong political supporter of Mr. Bush's father. This institution acquired a large stake in Harken as soon as Mr. Bush became a board member, and subsequently showed itself willing to do whatever it took to keep the hapless company afloat. This included taking much of the company's debt off its books in return for assets of doubtful value, and giving Harken a share in their partnership almost twice as large as its contribution to the partnership's capital. 
The name of the guardian angel? The Harvard University endowment. Don't be surprised; professors don't run the university's money.

HEADLINE: A Merger Unlikely, What's Next for EchoStar? 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
So what is Charles W. Ergen's Plan B? If Mr. Ergen, the chairman of EchoStar Communications, is unable to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to reverse its rejection of his company's proposed acquisition of Hughes Electronics, he readily acknowledges that he has no backup plan.
 "I haven't given that thought," Mr. Ergen said on Wednesday at an industry conference in Midtown Manhattan. For a moment he allowed himself to think about it, acknowledging that if the deal failed, his company would "go over a cliff." Then he resumed his pep talk: "I'm playing to win. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about losing." 
 The only chance that EchoStar, Hughes and General Motors, which owns Hughes, have of rescuing the proposed merger from almost certain defeat is to significantly change the terms of the deal -- and those chances are diminishing, too.
A possible rescuer may be in Bethpage, N.Y., home of Cablevision Systems, the nation's No. 7 cable television company. In August, Cablevision proposed to the F.C.C. that it require EchoStar to give 17 of its satellite frequencies to Cablevision so that it could start a rival direct-broadcast satellite operation.
But an F.C.C. commissioner expressed skepticism yesterday that even a deal like the one Cablevision is proposing would be enough to clear the merger. "Expecting a new, unformed entity to come in and compete successfully with a merged EchoStar and DirecTV is to dream the impossible dream, especially in light of the capital starvation that continues to stalk this sector," the commissioner, Michael J. Copps, said in a statement. "Were this merger to proceed as presented, the likelihood of another satellite provider entering the market in the near future -- and being able to compete effectively with the huge merged entity applicants seek to create -- would be so tiny as to be almost invisible."
But another commissioner, Kevin J. Martin, suggested that such a development could have a chance of approval. "This idea is interesting, but the applicants have made no such proposal," Mr. Martin said. "If the applicants were to request such a structural remedy, it could merit further review as to its technical and economic feasibility. Failing to fully explore such options could be a missed opportunity to bring more competitive choices to consumers."
For months, Mr. Ergen rejected any notion of giving up frequencies, saying that a combined EchoStar-DirecTV would need all of the two companies' satellite assets to deliver its full menu of planned services, including high-speed Internet access.
By striking a deal with Cablevision, Mr. Ergen could argue that consumers in most of the nation would still have access to three different providers of pay television services -- the local cable company, the combined EchoStar-DirecTV and the new Cablevision service. Charles F. Dolan, Cablevision's chairman, knows that and is ready to capitalize.
Most American homes now have three choices for pay television service: EchoStar's Dish Network, Hughes's DirecTV and the local cable company. The main objection to a merger of DirecTV and EchoStar is that the deal would reduce those choices to two. For homes in rural areas without cable access, the number of choices would fall to one.
But adding another choice could be prohibitively expensive. Cablevision's plans to build a satellite television operation from scratch face widespread skepticism in the communications and media industries because of the financing difficulties. Cablevision recently announced that it would sell its chain of movie theaters and close many of its Wiz electronics stores to bridge a cash deficit of perhaps $600 million that was looming for next year.
To allay the financial concerns, Cablevision, which says it intends to get into the satellite business with or without the EchoStar frequencies, is seeking potential partners who can contribute cash to its venture. 
One of the companies that Cablevision approached, and which rejected the concept, was the News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch. The News Corporation lost to EchoStar last year in the bidding for Hughes. Now that EchoStar's deal is in extreme jeopardy, Mr. Murdoch is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to make another offer for Hughes, according to people close to him. John C. Malone's Liberty Media will probably contribute cash in support of Mr. Murdoch's bid in return for an equity stake in the new venture.
Mr. Murdoch wants to add DirecTV to his global satellite empire, which includes B Sky B in Britain and the Star operations in Asia.
While it is clear that Mr. Murdoch would like to make another attempt to acquire Hughes and DirecTV, he does not need to make any overt moves in coming weeks. He will probably begin to quietly approach bankers to line up any required outside financing, people close to the News Corporation said yesterday, but in general time is on his side.
An acquisition of DirecTV by the News Corporation would face a much less difficult regulatory review than the EchoStar deal, because the News Corporation is not already in the satellite business in the United States. After all the regulatory and antitrust difficulties of the last year, G.M. could welcome such a relatively straightforward deal.
Under their agreement, though, G.M. and Hughes are obligated to fight alongside EchoStar to try to preserve their deal, at least until Jan. 21. On that date, Hughes can call off the deal if it has not received all the required regulatory approvals and force EchoStar to pay a $600 million termination fee.
Until the EchoStar merger agreement is legally terminated, G.M. cannot entertain any competing offers without jeopardizing the $600 million fee from EchoStar. Were G.M. to enter any discussions with the News Corporation before the merger agreement were legally terminated, EchoStar would probably be able to avoid paying the fee.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, Heckled, Presses Smoking Curbs 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
City Council hearings are sometimes important. They are occasionally well attended. But they rarely feature the mayor, a roomful of his hecklers and a man dressed as a giant cigarette.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pleaded his case yesterday to a packed Council chamber for legislation to ban smoking in all indoor public spaces, a measure that, if passed, would make New York City among the toughest places in the nation to be a smoker. 
 "The question before us is straightforward," Mr. Bloomberg said to the standing-room-only crowd gathered for the first City Council hearing on the legislation. "Does your desire to smoke anywhere, at any time, trump the right of others to breathe clean air in the workplace? Common sense and common decency demand the following answer: The need to breathe clean air is more important than the license to pollute it."
But just as Mr. Bloomberg is sure of the righteousness of ridding the city of clouds of smoke, his opponents are equally committed to stopping him, arguing that the legislation would hurt the city's economy. "The mayor is a brilliant businessman," testified Ciaran Staunton, who owns O'Neill's bar in Midtown Manhattan. "But he knows absolutely nothing about the bar business."
The testimony, which lasted nearly eight hours, at times seemed to cut along class lines, with small-bar owners from less affluent areas of the city suggesting that their billionaire mayor was insensitive to the dynamics of the restaurant business. 
"If I had the mayor's net worth," said James McBratney, president of the Staten Island Restaurant and Tavern Association, "I wouldn't be here today."
The mayor was roundly heckled when he suggested that bars would actually make more money if they banned smoking, reasoning that patrons would simply buy more drinks. One opponent of the legislation was removed from the chamber as he screamed to loud applause, "It's a private sin." 
Two hours before the hearing began, a huge crowd gathered in front of City Hall in a display of civic theater not seen since the AIDS protests in the early days of the Giuliani administration. 
Hotel workers traded barbs with bar customers, bartenders interrupted the news conferences of smoking opponents, and a man dressed as a large cigarette bobbed silently among the crowd under a light patter of rain, holding a placard that read "I <heart> secondhand smoke." There were three Grim Reapers cloaked in black shrouds, one of whom was shoved. Some people puffed Benson & Hedges, others shooed them away. Yelling was standard fare. 
The theatrics continued, in a subdued form, inside the Council chamber, where witnesses included restaurant workers, a pregnant bartender and people who sell video games to bars. There were even musicians who played wind instruments, who argued that it was tougher to play in bars with smokers. 
Mr. Bloomberg, who appeared utterly unruffled by the hecklers, has presented the bill, Intro 256, as a measure to improve worker safety. It would go far beyond the current law, passed in 1995, which bans smoking only in restaurants that seat more than 35 people and in office buildings. The new legislation would ban smoking at every bar, restaurant and other indoor public venue, as well as at outdoor cafes. The mayor's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said the new smoking law would be analogous to other worker safety laws that resulted from the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in 1911.
If such a law were passed, New York City would join two states -- California and Delaware -- and scores of municipalities that ban smoking in just about every workplace, including bars and restaurants. On Monday, the Nassau County Legislature became the first in New York to vote to extend its ban on smoking to all bars, restaurants, bowling alleys and bingo halls. Westchester and Suffolk Counties are considering similar laws. 
Any legislation less potent than Nassau's would be a clear loss for the mayor, who has brought the same passion and commitment to this legislation that he did to his crusade to gain control of the public school system during the summer. Ultimately, Mr. Bloomberg must persuade a minimum of 26 council members to see things his way; the majority of the Council usually votes in lock step with its speaker, Gifford Miller, who has been less than outspoken about his stand on the measure. 
"I haven't made up my mind," Mr. Miller said yesterday. 
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would like to see legislation passed by Nov. 21; Mr. Miller declined to commit to a date for a vote, though he said he thought his members would not want the matter to drag on.
The hours of testimony by opponents and proponents of the legislation was not so much a dialectic about health care -- few tried to discredit claims that secondhand smoke was dangerous -- as a debate about personal freedoms and property rights.
Mr. Bloomberg's testimony -- a product of 15 drafts prepared with his senior speechwriter, Bruce Cory -- was a heartfelt defense of workers' rights to breathe clean air. In his remarks, he made it clear that he would not entertain what was quickly becoming the most popular alternative suggestion to his legislation, one that would allow smoking in bars only. 
"Those who want exemptions just need to tell us this," the mayor said: "Which workers have lives that are worth less than yours or mine?"
But equally forceful at times were bar owners, who argued that the livelihoods of their workers would be endangered by a drop in business, and that their neighbors would complain as patrons moved outside to do their puffing.
"How do we keep the night silent if there are droves of people exiting the bar to smoke," said Mr. McBratney, from the restaurant and bar association. (Anticipating this argument, the Bloomberg administration recently announced an initiative to crack down on noisemakers throughout the city, including loud bar patrons milling about the streets.)
Both sides struggled for the moral high ground. Opponents of the bill claimed that civil liberties were being trampled, and that immigrant workers would be unfairly shut out of jobs. The health commissioner and others argued that minorities around the city were disproportionately exposed to smoke in bars through longer work hours, and asserted over and over again that health costs were more important than economic ones. Opponents also pushed for legislation requiring more ventilation rather than smoking restrictions, an alternative rejected by the mayor. A second hearing is expected in a few weeks.

HEADLINE: Miramax Blinks, and a Double DiCaprio Vanishes 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Hollywood executives have made sport since early summer predicting which studio -- Miramax Films or DreamWorks -- would back down and change the Christmas Day release of its blockbuster contender, preventing a duel between films starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
 Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, finally gave way today. 
 "Gangs of New York," the highly anticipated epic about pre-Civil War Manhattan from Martin Scorsese, will reach theaters in early December instead of Dec. 25, when it would have gone head-to-head with "Catch Me if You Can" by the director Steven Spielberg.
Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein, said the company had not decided what day in early December that "Gangs of New York" would be released but added, "This is a competitive film, and we are confident that this and other quality projects will succeed during this season." 
But agreeing to change the release from Christmas Day, a date Mr. Hiltzik maintained adamantly last week that Mr. Weinstein was sticking by, shows just how concerned the studio was about whether "Gangs," which also stars Daniel Day-Lewis, would prevail in the all-important opening day.
For weeks, three people involved in the film said, several executives at Miramax have been urging Mr. Weinstein privately to cede Christmas Day to "Catch Me if You Can," a lighthearted story about a con artist who impersonates people. It also stars Tom Hanks. The decision to change the date, one of these people said, came after a Miramax meeting this week when several executives pleaded with Mr. Weinstein to reconsider.
Even Mr. DiCaprio was not pleased at having two movies released on the same day because he did not want to have to choose which to promote at the expense of the other, his publicist said. And several people involved with the film were concerned that "Gangs," with its violent content, would be hard pressed to attract families on Christmas Day.
"We've been waiting six months for DreamWorks to change the date, and they weren't going to do it," said one person involved in "Gangs." "Everyone talked some sense into Harvey. We said, 'We're not going up against their movie because they will win.' "
Miramax has a lot riding on a profitable Christmas season.
It has three other big movies opening on or near Christmas Day, including "Pinocchio," starring Roberto Benigni; "Chicago," which is based on the Broadway musical; and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," the movie directed by George Clooney about the "Gong Show" creator, Chuck Barris, who claimed to be a spy.
Jeffrey Katzenberg, a DreamWorks founder who is also a friend of Mr. Weinstein, said in an interview today that he had breakfast with Mr. Weinstein last week in New York to discuss their respective movies' release dates and joked that they settled their differences after the two ate waffles, and later "stayed up late telling manly stories."
All kidding aside, he agreed that the decision was based more on economics than breakfast food and bonding. "He and I had many conversations about why releasing the movies on the same day was in none of our interests," Mr. Katzenberg said. "It was an uncomfortable situation as both companies have a big investment in Leo DiCaprio."
Miramax executives are emphasizing that "Gangs" had a 50 percent overall awareness with the audiences it has tested and 64 percent among the much-coveted males older than 18. Such awareness is not surprising given a barrage of international media coverage about the movie.
Some Miramax executives are still stinging from a spate of articles this year chronicling the problems "Gangs" had getting from the script phase to the screen. It has been more than three years since Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Scorsese embarked on the movie, which is based on a 1927 book by Herbert Asbury.
Mr. Weinstein hoped the movie would be released last year in time for the 2001 Academy Awards. At times, Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Weinstein sparred during the film's production over both its length and the time it was taking to make it.
Last Friday, Mr. Scorsese was still tinkering with the movie's sound at a production studio near Times Square. When asked at the studio then about how long it was taking to finish "Gangs," Mr. Scorsese offered with a sigh, "I was saying this morning, 'We need to end this.' "
Any weekend that Miramax chooses to release the film will be a challenge. On Dec. 13, one date that many executives within Miramax favored, "Star Trek: Nemesis" is scheduled to be released. The second installment of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is set for a Dec. 18 release.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
The House Makes Its Decision: 'Let Us Take This Stand Against Terror'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the House debate yesterday on the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. Speakers included the minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri; the majority leader, Dick Armey, Republican of Texas; the Republican whip, Tom DeLay of Texas; and Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.

Representative Gephardt
Let me say to my colleagues and my constituents in Missouri why I've decided to vote for this resolution. 
 First, Sept. 11 has made all the difference. The events of that tragic day jolted us to the enduring reality that terrorists not only seek to attack our interests abroad but also to strike us here at home. 
 We have clear evidence now that they even desire to use weapons of mass destruction against us. Before 9/11 we experienced the terrorist attacks on Khobar Towers, the U.S.S. Cole, on two embassies in Africa. But we didn't believe it would happen here. 
On 9/11 it did happen here. And it can happen again. Sept. 11 was the ultimate wake-up call. We must now do everything in our power to prevent further terrorist attacks and ensure that an attack with a weapon of mass destruction cannot happen. The consequences of such an attack are unimaginable.
We spent 50 years in a cold war and trillions of dollars deterring a weapon of mass destruction attack on the United States by another country. Now we must prevent such an attack by terrorists who, unlike our previous adversaries, are willing to die. In these new circumstances deterrence well may not work. With these new dangers prevention must work. 
If you're worried about terrorists getting weapons of mass destruction or their components from countries, the first candidate you worry about is Iraq. The 12-year history of the U.N. effort to disarm Iraq convinces me that Iraq is a problem that must be dealt with, diplomatically if we can, militarily if we must.
I did not come to this view overnight. It has instead evolved over time as we have learned the facts about the Iraqi regime with clarity. As you know, I opposed the use of force against Iraq in 1991 in favor of giving sanctions more time to work. Others supported force but thought that by dislodging Iraq from Kuwait we would neutralize the threat. In hindsight both of these assessments were wrong.
In 1991, no one knew the extent to which Saddam Hussein would sacrifice the needs of his people in order to sustain his hold on power, deceive the international community in order to preserve his weapons of mass destructions programs or take hostile actions against U.S. interests in the region. 
Saddam Hussein's track record is too compelling to ignore. And we know that he continues to develop weapons of mass destruction including nuclear devices. And he may soon have the ability to have a nuclear weapon against other nations.
I believe we have an obligation to protect the United States by preventing him from getting these weapons and either using them himself or passing them or their components on to terrorists who share his destructive intent.
As I stated in a speech in June, I believe we must confront the threat posed by the current Iraqi regime directly. But given the stakes involved and the potential risks to our security and the region, we must proceed carefully and deliberately.
That's why I felt it was essential to engage in negotiations in order to craft an effective and responsible authorization for the force, if necessary, so we can defend our nation and enforce U.N. resolutions pertaining to Iraq.
At the insistence of many of us, the resolution includes a provision urging President Bush to continue his efforts to get the U.N. to effectively enforce its own resolutions against Iraq. I have told the president directly on numerous occasions that in my view and in the view of a lot of us he must do everything he possibly can to achieve our objectives with the support of the United Nations. His speech to the U.N. on Sept. 12 was an excellent beginning to this effort. 
Exhausting all efforts at the U.N. is essential. But let's remember why. We started the U.N. over 50 years ago. We remain the greatest advocate of the rule of law, both domestically and internationally. We must do everything we can to get the U.N. to succeed. It's in our own self-interest to do that.
In 1945, Harry Truman told the Senate that the creation of the U.N. constituted, in his words, an expression of national necessity. He said the U.N. points down the only road to enduring peace. He said, "Let us not hesitate to start down that road with God's help and with firm resolve that we can and will reach our goal of peace and security for all Americans."
Completely bypassing the U.N. would set a dangerous precedent that would undoubtedly be used by other countries in the future to our and the world's detriment. It's too high a price to pay. I'm glad that the president said in his speech Monday that diplomacy is the first choice for resolving this matter.
This resolution also limits the scope and duration of the president's authority to use force. It requires presidential determinations before our armed forces may be used against Iraq, including assurances to Congress that he has pursued all diplomatic means to address this threat and that any military action will not undermine our ongoing efforts against terrorism.
Finally, the bill provides for regular consultation with and reporting to Congress on the administration's diplomatic and military efforts and, of great importance to all Americans, on the planning for assistance, reconstruction and regional stabilization efforts in a post-conflict Iraq.
The efforts we must undertake in a post-conflict Iraq could be the most enduring challenge we face in this entire endeavor. Which is another reason for doing everything humanly possible to work through the U.N. to reach our goals.

Representative DeLay
Americans have always had to summon courage to disregard the timid counsel of those who would mortgage our security to the false promises of wishful thinking and appeasement.
The perils of complacency were driven home to us in September of last year. We saw in tragic detail that evil is far more than some abstract concept. No longer should America allow dangers to gather and multiply. No longer should we stand idle as terrorists and terrorist states plot to murder our citizens.
As a free society we have to defeat dangers before they ripen. The war on terrorism will be fought here at home unless we summon the will to confront evil before it attacks.
President Bush certainly understands it's imperative for action. The president is demonstrating the strong, the strong moral leadership to find and defeat threats to the United States before they strike.
Because once a madman like Saddam Hussein is able to deliver his arsenal, whether it's chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, there's no telling when an American city will be attacked at his direction or with his support. A nuclear-armed Iraq would soon become the world's largest safe haven and refuge for the world's terrorist organizations.
Waiting to act until after Saddam has nuclear weapons will leave free nations with an awful dilemma. Will they on the one hand risk nuclear annihilation by confronting terrorists in Iraq? Or will they give in to fear by failing to confront these terrorist groups?
And for that reason regime change in Iraq is a central goal of the war on terror. It's vital. Because a war on terrorism that leaves the world's leading purveyor and practitioner of terror in power would be a bald failure.
Now some call Hussein a diversion. But far from being a diversion, confronting Saddam Hussein is a defining measure of whether we still wage the war on terror fully and effectively. It's the difference between aggressive action and misguided passivity.
The question we face today is not whether to go to war, for war was thrust upon us. Our only choice is between victory or defeat. And let's just be clear about it, in the war on terror victory cannot be secured at a bargaining table.
Iraq's vile dictator is a central power of the axis of evil. President Bush and this Congress are committed to removing the threat from Saddam Hussein's terrorist state.
Only regime change in Iraq can accomplish that objective. Only regime change can remove the danger from Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. Only by taking them out of his hands and destroying them can we be certain that terror weapons won't wind up in the hands of the terrorists.
Saddam Hussein is seeking the means to murder millions in just a single moment. He's trying to spread that grip of fear beyond his own borders. And he is consumed with hatred for America.
But I'm not here today to offer that definitive indictment of Iraq's tyrant. That has already been very clearly documented, and it's well established in this debate. In the wicked litany of crimes against humanity Saddam Hussein has composed a scarlet chapter of terror. Our only responsible option is to confront this threat before Americans die. 
Time works to the advantage of our enemies, not ours. Under our Constitution, America speaks through the United States Congress. And our resolution is very, very clear: The enemies of a free and a moral people will find no safe harbor in this world.
Today the free world chooses strength over temporizing and timidity. Terrorists and tyrants will see that the fruits of their evil will be certain destruction by the forces of democracy.
Now, we seek broad support. But I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, fighting this war on terrorism by committee of consensus is a certain prescription for defeat. 
We'll defend our country by defeating terrorists wherever they may flee around the world. And none of us take to the gravity of this vote and its ramifications lightly. But history informs us that the dangers of complacency and inaction far outweigh the calculated risks of confronting evil.
In the fullness of time America will be proud that in our hour of testing we chose the bold path of action, not the hollow comfort of appeasement.
So let us just take this stand today against tyranny. Let us take this stand against terror. Let us take this stand against fear. Let us stand with the president of the United States.
Members of the House, I say to you just trust the cherished principles on which we were founded. Put faith in freedom and raise your voices and send this message to the world: The forces of freedom are on the march, and terrorists will find no safe harbor in this world.

Representative Armey
Is Saddam evil? Who could doubt it? The evils that this man perpetrates . . . strike terror in the heart of the worst we've ever seen before. This man is evil. It's an evil that this world should never have to observe. And that the poor victims, particularly those in Iraq, should not have to live with on a daily basis. The atrocities are beyond belief, beyond tolerance. And those poor people in Iraq live with each day, afraid to leave their home, afraid to speak at their own dinner table, frightened for their children that might be tortured in order to punish the parent's careless moment. Saddam is evil. That's a fact.
Does he have dangerous assets? More so than we thought. More so than we ever wanted to believe. 
And does he have an ongoing, consistent program and plan to acquire, to enhance those evil assets that are described by weapons -- by the term weapons of mass destruction? Beyond what any of us imagined. The acquisition of the weaponry, the resources, the resourcefulness, the ability to put together the device that would destroy hundreds of thousands in a fell swoop has never been even mitigated against by the commitments he made to the U.N. 11 years ago. 
Can he strike our interests, our citizens, our land and our responsibilities with them? Irrefutably, yes. Now. Through the conventional means that we recognize and fear -- things like Scud missiles, yes: American people, American citizens, American resources in his immediate area. Through the insidious means that would be deployed by his ongoing working relationship with a myriad of evil terrorist organization, yes, through simple-looking, innocent-looking little suitcases left in a train depot, a service station, an airport in Chicago, Ill. Yes, he can strike us, our interests and our responsibilities. I knew no other way to put that. 
America is a unique nation ever in the history of the world. We have accepted responsibility for freedom, safety, dignity of people other than ourselves. Those proud nations with those brave people that live as islands of freedom and hope within seas of threat and terror look for, understand they can depend upon the protection of the United States. 
That's who we are. That's who we have been. Our heroes, our parents, they spent their heroism, they spent their life all too often, on foreign distant lands fighting for the freedom of people other than themselves. No other nation has ever done that like we have done. 
And nations such as Israel, not exclusively Israel but right now, in the world, today, at a level of danger that is unparalleled by any other nation of the world, Israel struggles for its freedom, its safety and its dignity and it is in imminent, immediate danger by a strike from Saddam Hussein. And that represents a responsibility we have not only to what role we have played in the world, not only to our heroes who have acted it out in sacrifice, but to the character of this nation that we cherish and protect. 
I've said as clearly as I can, to me an attack on Israel is an attack on America. And it is immediately in danger. 
Will he do so? Who can doubt that? He has a record of having done so that is deplorable in the most evil and insidious ways. The question is when will he do so, not will he do so? 
Why do you violate the will of the -- of your own commitments to the world through the United Nations accord with resolve and consistently acquire these resources if you have no intent to use them? Why do you deny your own citizens the resources for food and shelter and clothing and health care in order to divert that to the expenditure on weapons of mass destruction and instruments of horror if you do not intend to use them? . . . 
Is action against Saddam compliant with the character of our great nation? I struggled with this. It was a hurdle for me for a long time. It all gets involved with this question of pre-emptive strike. First of all, it is not a pre-emptive strike. This is a man who has consistently been in violation of his own commitments to the world for 11 years. As I put it, this snake is out of his hole. We are not striking an innocent here. We are correcting an error of complacency.

Representative Pelosi
I want to call to the attention of my colleagues a statement about Saddam's use of chemical and biological weapons that was just declassified and sent to the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The question is if we initiate an attack and he thought he was an extremist or otherwise what is the likelihood in response to our attack that Saddam Hussein would use chemical and biological weapons? Response, and this is a letter from George Tenet, the head of the C.I.A., to the committee, the response is pretty high if we initiate the attack. 
Force protection is our top priority on the intelligence committee. We must protect our men and women in uniform. They are courageous. They risk their lives for our freedom, for our country. We cannot put them in harm's way unless we take every measure possible to protect them. So another cost is not only the cost on the war on terrorism but the cost in human lives of our young people by making Saddam Hussein the person who determines their fate. 
Another cost is to our economy. The markets do not like war. They do not like the uncertainty of war. Our economy is fragile as it is. The president has spoken. In his speech the other night he talked about rebuilding Iraq's economy after our invasion. We have problems with our economy. We must focus on building our own economy before we worry about Iraq's economy after we invade Iraq. So let's do what is proportionate, what is appropriate. . . . 
There is no political solution on the ground in Iraq. Let's not be fooled by that. So when we go in, the occupation which is now being called liberation could be interminable. And so could the amount of money, unlimited, that it will cost -- 100, 200 billion dollars. We'll pay any price to protect the American people. But is this the right way to go, to jeopardize in a serious way our young people when that can be avoided? We respect the judgments of our military leaders. It is a civilian decision to go to war. But the military leaders present us with options which they know are to be a last resort. 
These costs to the war on terrorism, the loss of life, the cost to our economy, the cost in dollars to our budget, these costs must be answered for. If we go in certainly we can show our power to Saddam Hussein. If we resolve this issue diplomatically we can show our strength as a great country, as a great country. Let us show our greatness. Vote no on this resolution.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From the Senate Debate on Authorizing Use of Force in Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate about the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. The speakers included Senators Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota; Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois; Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas; and John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, 

Senator Daschle
 With this resolution we are giving the president extraordinary authority. How he exercises that authority will determine how successful any action in Iraq might be. In 1991, by the time the president's father sought Congressional support to use force against Iraq, he had secured pledges of military cooperation from nearly 40 nations and statements of support from scores of others. He had already secured the backing of the United Nations, and he had already developed a clear plan of action. In assembling that coalition, the legitimacy of our cause was affirmed. Regional stability was maintained. The risk to our soldiers was lessened. America's burden was reduced. And perhaps most importantly, Iraq was isolated. 
 At this point we have done none of those things. That is why, unlike in 1991, our vote on this resolution should be seen as the beginning of a process, not the end. For our efforts in Iraq to succeed, the president must continue to consult with Congress and work hard to build a global coalition. That is not capitulation. It is leadership. And it is essential. 
In my view there are five other crucial steps, steps the administration must take before any final decision on the use of force in Iraq is made. First and foremost, the president needs to be honest with the American people, not only about the benefits against Iraq, but also about the risks and the costs of such action. We are no longer talking about driving Saddam Hussein back to within his borders. We are talking about driving him from power. That is a much more difficult and complicated goal. 
A story in this past Sunday's Philadelphia Inquirer suggests that top officials in the administration, "have exaggerated the degree of allied support for a war in Iraq." The story goes on to say that others in the administration are "rankled by what they charge is a tendency" by some in the administration to "gloss over the unpleasant realities of a potential war with Iraq." 
A report in yesterday's Washington Post suggests that "an increasing number of intelligence officials, including former and current intelligence agency employees, are concerned the agency is tailoring its public stance to fit the administration's views." 
I do not know whether these reports are accurate. We do know from our own national experience, however, that public support for military action can evaporate quickly if the American people come to believe that they have not been given all of the facts. If that should happen no resolution in Congress might pass that would unify our nation. The American people expect, and success demands, that they be told both the benefits and the risks involved in any action against Iraq. 
Second, we need to make clear to the world that the reason that we would use force in Iraq is to remove Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. I would have preferred this goal had been made explicit in this resolution. However, it is clear from this debate that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction are the principal threat to the United States and the only threat that would justify the use of the United States military force against Iraq. It is the threat that the president cited repeatedly in his speech to the American people Monday night. It may also be the only threat that can rally the world to support our efforts. Therefore, we expect, and success demands, that the administration not lose sight of this essential mission.
Third, we need to prepare for what might happen in Iraq after Saddam Hussein. Regime change is an easy expression for a difficult job. One thing we have learned from our action in Afghanistan is that it is easier to topple illegitimate regimes than it is to build legitimate democracies. We will need to be much better in post-Saddam Iraq than the administration has done so far in post-Taliban Afghanistan. Iraq is riven by religious and ethnic differences and demoralized by a repressive government and crushing poverty. It has no experience with democracy. 
History tells us that it is not enough merely to hope that well-intentioned leaders will rise to fill the void that the departure of Saddam Hussein would leave. We must help create the conditions under which such a leader can arise and govern. Unless we want to risk seeing Iraq go from bad to worse, we must help the Iraq people build their political and economic institutions after Saddam. That could take many years and many billions of dollars, which is another reason we must build a global coalition. The American people expect, and success demands, that we plan for stability and for economic and political progress in Iraq after Saddam.
Fourth, we need to minimize the chances that any action we may take in Iraq will destabilize the region. Throughout the Persian Gulf there are extremists who would like nothing more than to transform a confrontation with Iraq into a wider war between the Arab world and Israel or the Arab world and the West. What happens if by acting in Iraq we undermine the government in Jordan, a critical ally and a strategic buffer between Iraq and Israel. What happens if we destabilize Pakistan and empower Islamic fundamentalists? Unlike Iraq, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. What happens if that arsenal falls into the hands of Al Qaeda or other extremists?
We can tell the Arab world that this is not a fight between their nations and ours, but a far better way to maintain stability in the Gulf is to demonstrate that by building a global coalition to confront Saddam. That is why the administration must make every reasonable effort to secure a U.N. resolution just as we did in 1991. With U.N. support we can count a number of Arab countries as full allies. Without U.N. support we can't even count on their air space. We expect and success demands that any action we take in Iraq make the region more stable not less. 
Fifth and finally, we cannot allow a war in Iraq to jeopardize the war on terrorism. We are fighting terrorist organizations with global networks, and we need partners around the globe. Some, including the chairman of the president's own foreign intelligence advisory board, doubt we can count on this continued cooperation in the war on terror if we go to war against Iraq. I do not know if that is true. I do know, however, that the military, intelligence and political cooperation we receive from nations throughout the world is critical to the war on terrorism.

Senator Durbin
This resolution is historically important because it marks a dramatic departure in the foreign policy of the United States of America. It is not simply a question of our policy toward Iraq or Saddam Hussein. It's a question of our policy toward the world. This resolution still authorizes unilateral, go-it-alone invasion of Iraq. This resolution contains no requirement to build a coalition of allies behind us. It has been said over and over again, isn't it better for the United States to have a coalition behind us than a coalition against us? This resolution does not specify that we are targeting weapons of mass destruction. And this resolution represents a dramatic departure in foreign policy. And that's why I've offered this amendment. 
Senator Levin of Michigan was here earlier speaking about the role of the United Nations. As much as any nation, the United States of America has guided and nurtured the United Nations. We've gone through painful moments, frustrating moments when we disagreed with their actions and frankly, couldn't agree with Security Council decisions. But by and large, we have stood by the United Nations since its creation. 
The United Nations, in the words of Kofi Annan, is "the international community at work for the rule of law." That's as succinct a description of what the United Nations is all about as I have ever read. And we've been with the United Nations through NATO and the cold war, on questions of post-Soviet trans-Atlantic order and a variety of other issues. 
Now comes the president on Sept. 12 this year, visits the United Nations and issues a significant challenge. He says to the United Nations on Sept. 12, if this organization has a backbone it is going to stand up to Saddam Hussein, demand inspections for the weapons of mass destruction and remove or destroy them. And if it does not, the president basically said, the United Nations is irrelevant. It has become the League of Nations. Well, since that occurred, progress has been made. A man who I respect very much, Secretary of State Colin Powell, has been involved in shuttle diplomacy back and forth with the Security Council and leaders around the world to put together United Nations support for just the very approach that the president had asked for. 
And it's the right approach, to really put our inspectors on the ground with no holds barred, nothing off limits, no exemptions for presidential palaces. So that we can go in and discover with the help of our own intelligence community, which will provide information where we think the weapons can be found, and in finding them be able to establish once and for all that Iraq is in violation of U.N. resolutions and destroy the weapons. And if Saddam Hussein and Iraq should resist or stop us, consider the position we're in. We can then turn to the United Nations and say we gave you your opportunity. You know that this man will not comply with your orders. Now stand together in enforcing the United Nations inspection. What a strong position that is, for us to have a coalition of nations through the United Nations working with us rather than the Bush resolution, which says we'll do it by ourselves. 
I think that we've seen progress. But this resolution would brush it all aside. This resolution would say to the United Nations and others around the world, go ahead and finish your debate, engage yourself as much as you like, but in the final analysis this nation, the United States of America will do exactly what it wants to do. 

Senator Gramm
As I listen to these arguments made -- and I would say that they've been made with great eloquence and they've been made very effectively -- but they really boil down, as I hear them, to sort of two simple arguments: 
The first argument is that if we're going to use military power against Saddam Hussein, that we ought to do it within the context of the U.N., and it ought to be part of a multinational effort. 
I reject that. And I reject it because when we're talking about American lives, when we're talking about the security of our nation and the lives of our people, I am not willing to delegate the responsibility of protecting them to the U.N. 
When it comes to life and safety of our people, I'm not willing to leave that up to the U.N. I'm not even willing to leave it up to our allies. It is the responsibility of the United States government. 
And that's why we need this resolution. 
The plain truth is: if nobody else in the world is willing or able to do this job, we are able and we are willing. And that's what this resolution says.
And I think by being able and being willing there will be others who will help. 
The second argument really boils down to sort of an analogy you might make that there's this rattlesnake nesting in your rock garden. And our colleagues are saying, Well, look, if you go in there and you try to find that rattlesnake and try to kill him, he's liable to bite you. And the probability of being bitten is lower if you leave him alone. 
And for a short period of time, they're right. There's no doubt about the fact that if you put on your snake boots and you get rat-shot in your pistol and you go out there with a stick, you start poking around trying to find him, the probability during that period of time that you're going to get bitten does go up. 
But I think most rational people get their pistol and get that stick and go out there because that rattlesnake's going to be out there for a long time. Your dog might go through there and get bitten. Your grandchild might be playing out there. 
And the good thing about going in to find the rattlesnake is you know that he's there, and you're alert to the threat. 
So my view is that we do have the rattlesnake in the rock garden. We have the ability to go in and get him out. And I don't think we ought to wait around because of the threat that it poses to us in doing what we know we need to do. 
I would say, in looking at the vast future, that the threat is greater if we don't act than it is if we do. 
So those are the two arguments I hear. They're in fancier garb. They're better put. But it really boils down to: Let's turn over our security to the U.N. or to our allies. I'm not willing to do that. Let's avoid the risk of this conflict because it will be dangerous while the conflict is going on. It will be a lot safer once the conflict is over. So that's where we are. 
I think we're doing the right thing. I think we're going to have an overwhelming vote. 
It is interesting. I would conclude by saying that we have had great bipartisan success on this force resolution because Saddam Hussein has no organized political support in America. I wish we didn't face organized political support for opposition to homeland security. 

Senator Warner
I want to talk about the president of the United States. 
As I look upon this situation and listen to the debate, I think we're of a mind, all 100, of the seriousness of these weapons of mass destruction. We may have a difference of conscience as to the level of the threat posed, perhaps today, tomorrow and the future. 
But it is there. There is no question. 
And I stopped to think that the United Nations has done nothing for four years. They have not sought to enforce the resolutions, 16 in number. 
It has been this president, President George Bush, that has taken the initiative to go not only to the American people but to the whole world and very carefully and methodically told the world we should be on alert. We cannot do nothing. We should join, as a community of nations, to address it. He said that in the United Nations very brilliantly. I think everyone in this body respects him. 
And now, as we are here debating today, another debate is taking place in the U.N. To the extent this resolution remains strong as it is now is the extent to which we can expect an equally and perhaps even stronger statement of resolve by the United Nations to fulfill its mandate, to fulfill its charter. 
The League of Nations failed to act at a critical time in the history of this nation, and it went into the dustbin of history. 
The United Nations will not go into the dustbin of history. I'm confident that this time they will stand up, that they will devise a 17th resolution. 
And I look upon the action by the Senate today in voting a strong bipartisan vote for this resolution as not an act of war. It is an act to deter war, to put in place the tools for our president, our secretary of state, to get the strongest possible resolution in the United Nations. 
It is an act to see that force is the last -- I repeat, the last -- option, as our president has said ever so clearly time and time again. 
It is an act to deter war, to make the last option the use of force.

HEADLINE: Throngs Again Demand Venezuelan Leader Quit 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Banging pans, blowing whistles and demanding that President Hugo Chavez leave office, hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through this capital today as tensions persisted six months after Mr. Chavez was briefly overthrown in the aftermath of a similar protest.
 Mr. Chavez's left-leaning government responded by deploying the National Guard in riot gear to block access to the presidential palace and other government buildings. 
 The march remained peaceful. But outside Caracas, one person was killed and others were wounded in gunfights between police officers and Chavez supporters who tried to keep opponents from reaching the capital, Venezuelan media reported.
Protest leaders reiterated demands that Mr. Chavez either resign or agree to early elections. Unless he does one or the other by Wednesday, they threatened, he will face a nationwide general strike on Oct. 21. The last such strike led to a week of chaos that brought about his temporary ouster.
"Today's demonstration is enough for President Chavez to see the need to call for elections or to resign," said Carlos Fernandez, a leader in the opposition movement and president of the country's largest business federation. "They're tired," he said of Venezuelans. "They do not want the country to continue to deteriorate."
The government did not immediately respond to the ultimatum. But Mr. Chavez and his ministers have repeatedly refused to contemplate a referendum on his rule until next August, as permitted by the Constitution. Presidential elections are not scheduled until the end of 2006.
"The president will not leave because of the pressure of a few," Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said today. "That is not constitutional." 
Though it was unclear how many took part in the march today, organizers put the number at a million, which would make the protest the largest since the April 11 protest that resulted in the president's removal.
The growing number of anti-Chavez street protests has worried the Organization of American States and the United Nations, which have failed to broker dialogue between the government and the opposition. The United States, which is dependent on Venezuelan oil, has also expressed concern about instability here.
"Our main concern really is not the demonstrations or civil disobedience," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Latin America division of Human Rights Watch. "The problem are those members of the opposition who have no patience, no tolerance anymore for the government, and are looking for extra-constitutional ways to get rid of the government."
The president's supporters, who gathered at key spots in the city today, said they would not let him be forced out. Many of them, poor people who were outcasts for years, see Mr. Chavez as their protector. 
"We're defending President Chavez's revolution," Johnny Franco, 49, said. "He is the only president we have ever had who looked out for all the people."
The throngs of anti-Chavez protesters, though, blamed the president for bringing the country to the brink of ruin. Though rich in oil, Venezuela is in a deep recession.
"There is high unemployment, no safety in the streets, and we are just getting by," said Eusebio Rodriguez, 41, a laid-off mechanic. "Each day is getting harder."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fall 1.2%, With Autos Weak 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Consumers took a break in September as retail sales posted their biggest decline since late last year, the government said today, while a slide in an index of consumer sentiment fueled worries about household spending.
 But financial markets again proved unworried by economic concerns, with stocks adding to Thursday's sharp gains. 
 The Commerce Department said overall retail sales fell 1.2 percent in September, hurt by weak car sales. The fall was the largest since November last year, and came after three consecutive monthly gains averaging more than 1 percent. 
Excluding autos, September sales squeezed out a gain of 0.1 percent.
A separate index of consumer sentiment, maintained by the University of Michigan, fell to a nine-year low in its preliminary reading for October. The index dipped to 80.4 from 86.1 in September, according to people in the markets. A final reading will be released near the end of the month.
While the retail sales numbers were expected to be weak, the softness in the sentiment index was a surprise. Household spending makes up two-thirds of overall economic activity, so the consumer outlook remains critical to a United States economy faced with a fitful stop-and-start recovery from recession.
"The confidence data has done a terrible job of forecasting actual spending, and it has not paid to put too much weight on these survey results over the past year," said Stephen Stanley, an economist with RBS Greenwich Capital Markets.
"However, with auto sales apparently soft in the first part of October and the softer tone of demand at chain stores in September, there is definitely cause for concern," he added.
While spending has been strong in the third quarter, aided by continued gains in income and mortgage refinancings, analysts worry that jitters about a possible United States attack on Iraq, any related spike in oil prices and weeks of declines in stock markets will sap spending strength ahead.
Within the September retail report, gains were concentrated in three areas -- building materials, health and personal care, and sporting goods and bookstores.
The biggest sales decline came in the auto and parts category, which fell by 4.8 percent, the biggest drop since a 9.7 percent decline in November 2001.
Car sales increased by 1.5 percent in August, as automakers felt the effect of the reintroduction of generous financing incentives. But those lures did not appear as effective in September.
While the consumer readings on Friday provided mixed news for Fed policy makers, they were able to take comfort from another tame reading on wholesale-level inflation in September.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent over all in September, excluding food and energy costs. The reading shows that the Fed has a low-inflation environment in which to operate, should it decide to cut short-term interest rates to bolster the economy.
Fed policy makers meet next on Nov. 6, the day after the mid-term Congressional elections.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges All Its Citizens to Leave Ivory Coast 

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The United States is urging the 3,000 American citizens in the Ivory Coast to leave the country, fearing a deterioration in the situation there as a three-week-old uprising intensifies, State Department officials said today. 
 Diplomats at the United States Embassy are contacting the remaining Americans to tell them to leave, the officials said. 
 "Our people are stressing the advisability of departing Cote d'Ivoire now and pointing out the potentially devastating consequences to individuals and families if a meltdown of the political-military situation should occur," one official said. 
About 700 Americans left Ivory Coast after a Sept. 22 State Department warning that urged them to do so, a second official said. On Sept. 24, the department started a program under which nonessential American diplomats and the families of embassy employees were allowed to leave the country at government expense.
The call today for remaining American citizens to leave came as rebellious troops vowed to launch a sweeping offensive against the government, and as the World Food Program warned that the security situation in the Ivory Coast was becoming increasingly volatile.
The rebels have seized half the country since their failed coup attempt on Sept. 19, and outside mediation attempts by Western African and French leaders have failed.
Senegal's foreign minister was to have met today with the insurgents in the hope of preventing all-out civil war, but that meeting was postponed until Saturday.
He is believed to be carrying new peace proposals from Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade, the chairman of the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States.
President Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast, in an address to the nation on Tuesday, said Mr. Wade had come up with a proposal that he had accepted.
But in Korhogo, the main town in the predominantly Muslim north, Messamba Kone, the rebel leader, said the insurgents had ruled out a cease-fire and wanted Mr. Gbagbo to quit to make way for a transitional government.
The rebels haved called for an end to discrimination against Muslims in Ivory Coast, which traditionally has been ruled by Christian southerners.

HEADLINE: Household to Pay Record Fine and ChangeLending Practices 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PROSPECT HEIGHTS, Ill., Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Household International Inc. said today that it would pay a record fine of as much as $484 million to settle allegations that it had misled borrowers in more than a dozen states into paying mortgage rates that in some cases were almost twice what was promised.
 Shares of Household surged for a second day as investors said the agreement removed concerns that had depressed the stock 66 percent since mid-April. 
 The shares closed at $28.20 today, up $1.90. 
Household, the nation's biggest lender to homeowners with a history of unpaid bills, said it would take a third-quarter charge and cut 2003 profit forecasts as it changed lending practices.
Citigroup paid $215 million last month to settle federal charges that a unit used deception to sell home-loan insurance.
The Household fine underscores efforts by regulators and state prosecutors to end practices they say have deceived clients. State officials said their aim was to set new standards for helping protect less sophisticated borrowers.
"It's a huge monkey off their back," said Allen Meyers, who helps manage about $30 billion in assets including Household shares at Fifth Third Investment Advisors in Grand Rapids, Mich. "Now they can get on with their business and put this behind them."
The settlement concerns investigations in several states including Oklahoma, Washington, North Carolina and Michigan.
It will take effect when agreed to by states representing 80 percent of Household's real estate business, the company said.
State officials, including the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said the fine was a record for so-called predatory lending practices. 
Among changes Household has agreed to are limiting fees it charges for home loans to 5 percent, down from the average 7.25 percent it had been charging; appointing an independent monitor; improving disclosure; and limiting fees for refinancing, Household said in a statement.
The North Carolina attorney general, Roy Cooper, said that Household had also agreed to stop "flipping loans," a term for the practice of having loan officers persuade customers to refinance home loans to take advantage of lower rates without advising them about other fees they would have to pay.
Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term credit rating for Household to A- from A after the announcement.
Household said it planned to take a $330 million charge after taxes in the third quarter to cover the fine. The settlement will lower earnings by 10 cents in 2003, 20 cents in 2004 and 30 cents in 2005, the company said.

HEADLINE: Enough Retirement Already: Beverly Sills to Be Met's Chairwoman 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Beverly Sills, the longtime opera diva, director and master money-raiser who stepped down as chairwoman of Lincoln Center last May, is un-retiring at 73 to become chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, which had once spurned her singing.
 When she left her Lincoln Center position six months ago, she said she wanted "to smell the flowers a little bit." 
 "So I smelled the roses and developed an allergy," Ms. Sills said yesterday, describing the latest twist in a nearly 60-year career that includes a decade as general director of the New York City Opera, the Met's Lincoln Center neighbor. 
Ms. Sills's re-emergence could influence the direction of major initiatives on the New York cultural scene: Lincoln Center's often contentious rehabilitation project, now estimated at $1.8 billion, and City Opera's possible move on or off the Lincoln Center campus. The Met, by far the most powerful of the center's constituents, has taken strong positions on both issues. 
Paul M. Montrone, the Met's president and chief executive, said the executive committee agreed on Thursday to recommend Ms. Sills to the directors next month as a successor to James W. Kinnear, 74, the former president and chief executive of Texaco. The Met's chairman since 1993, he will now become honorary chairman.
Ms. Sills has been on the Met's board since 1991. Since May she has also been vice chairman of Lincoln Center, and it was not immediately clear whether she would retain that post, which, like the Met's chairmanship, is unpaid.
Persuading Ms. Sills to lead the board and fund-raising drive at a time of stringent financial need is a particular triumph for Joseph Volpe, the company's general manager. Yesterday he recalled that early in his career, as a carpenter, he had helped build the set for "Thais," the racy Massenet opera she had sung on the Met's stage in 1978 after years of waiting to sing there, despite raves at City Opera. "I made the bed, and she slept in it," he said. 
Mr. Volpe said he was delighted that after years of courting her at lunches and dinners, "my dear friend and colleague" would be taking the post. For her part, Ms. Sills said she particularly looked forward to working with Mr. Volpe "whom I have come to admire enormously." 
During heated disputes over the redevelopment plan last year, Ms. Sills and Mr. Volpe were sometimes at odds, but she came to side with him on some major issues, including arguing against a proposed dome over the plaza and a new home for City Opera in Damrosch Park. Among the divisive questions still ahead is whether City Opera should remain eligible for Lincoln Center money if it moves to a new location. 
Ms. Sills insisted yesterday that the discussions were never acrimonious but simply "challenging."
The new move represents a final vindication for Ms. Sills, ignored by the Met during the autocratic reign of Rudolph Bing, who held her career at the City Opera against her. She finally made her Met debut in 1975 in "The Siege of Corinth," winning an 18-minute ovation. She then sang more than 100 performances there before leaving the opera stage for good in 1980. 
"The world is divided among those who love opera and those who like it a little less, and Ms. Sills will be helpful to Lincoln Center for both," said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, who took over this spring as Ms. Sills was leaving. He called her "an enormously effective chairman of Lincoln Center for eight years."
Coming four months after a former Met president, Bruce Crawford, succeeded Ms. Sills as chairman of Lincoln Center, this pas de deux seemed to add to the Met's already large voice in center politics. 
But if other groups were concerned, none acknowledged it yesterday; some executives warmly applauded the step, and others offered at least measured praise. "The City Opera is pleased to know Beverly Sills is continuing her service to opera," said Paul Kellogg, that company's general and artistic director.
Paul B. Guenther, chairman of the New York Philharmonic, who has clashed at times with Mr. Volpe over the redevelopment plan, said the appointment would be "a huge gain for the Met and Lincoln Center."
It may be a particularly good time to have a top fund-raiser like Ms. Sills leading the board. With an annual budget of $200 million, of which about $75 million has to be raised from benefactors, the Met, the world's largest opera company, is suffering from the economic downturn and the slowdown in tourism, Mr. Volpe and other executives acknowledged. Its endowment of about $225 million has also been affected by the market drop.
Ms. Sills said she savored the chance to return to an opera house instead of worrying about "real estate and fountains" at the center. "I can't tell you how happy I am to have an office in a theater," she said.
In a joint interview Mr. Volpe interrupted, "This is your life, is what it boils down to."
Ms. Sills said she was never secretly biased against the Met in her years with City Opera and Lincoln Center. "Everyone knows what I think," she said. "I don't have the brains to keep my mouth shut."
She said her husband, Peter Greenough, and her daughter, Muffy, nudged her out of retirement. "They felt they had quite enough of me," she said. "I need new mountains to climb, which is why roses don't appeal to me."

HEADLINE: Making My Own Music 

BYLINE:  By Kevin Kelly; Kevin Kelly is editor at large of Wired magazine and author of "New Rules for the New Economy."

DATELINE: PACIFICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Every night before I go to bed I take one of my music CD's and insert it into my computer. While I sleep my computer translates the music into a compressed digital format onto my computer's hard drive. Over the course of the past year I have been steadily building my own personal jukebox from the 300 CD's I own. I can now listen to only my favorite songs on an album, rearrange songs into my preferred order, or move them to a portable player. Besides my own virtual personal radio station, I also have an index and catalog of the music I have bought.
 I am not the only one digitizing music. Without breaking any law, I could just as easily have gone on the Web to download the songs I had bought in the same digital format, thanks to the prior work of many other music lovers. So far music listeners around the world have digitized more than 850,000 albums and 10 million songs of all musical genres. Fans have already converted almost all music ever recorded. 
 This point is essential to the case that was heard Wednesday in the Supreme Court. In Eldred v. Ashcroft, copyright holders argued that it is vital to extend the life of copyright -- even though it has already been extended 11 times in the last four decades. A 1998 law extended the protection of copyright for an additional 20 years: material is now protected for 70 years after the creator's death or for 95 years if the copyright is held by a corporation. Only after the copyright has lapsed does it enter the public domain, meaning that anyone can use the work for whatever purpose -- creative, academic, even commercial.
Owners of an about-to-expire copyright have several favorite arguments for extending it. One is that it spurs creativity by making original works more valuable. But an extension actually restricts creativity by narrowing the shared universe of works artists can build upon. Another is that they need an extension as an incentive to convert old material into new media. As Jack Valenti, the chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, has pointed out, digitizing films is expensive. "Who is going to digitize these public domain movies?" he asks.
I have an answer: movie buffs. Not only have fans moved almost all of music into the digital era, they have been busy moving hundreds of millions of documents onto the Web and are producing millions of pages of daily reporting and news in Weblogs. And without the help of paralyzed publishers, avid readers have already converted nearly 20,000 books in the public domain.
The passion of fans is unstoppable -- and technology will make it only more so. Listeners, readers and watchers now have the means to do chores that companies themselves used to have to do. Yet instead of seeing this new force as a positive development, corporate copyright holders view it as something that must be quashed. While reformatting an old film is more trouble than slipping a CD into a personal computer, as bandwidth and storage continue to drop in price, more movie fans will have the means to convert old films. Given the benefits of digitized films, there is little question that film buffs, powered only by passion, would rush to convert the 500 to 1,000 films that fall out of copyright each year -- if the copyright period is not extended.
All that is keeping fans from this work is the steady erosion of the public domain by corporate copyright holders. Copyright extension serves only to keep everyone -- fans and corporations -- away from old masterpieces. If the Supreme Court upholds the current law, some old works of uncertain ownership, which would normally be allowed to come into the public domain, will now be locked up for another couple of decades. For some films on old stock, this could be their death.
Under the current copyright regime, short-term profit outweighs long-term value. As copyright protection lurches toward perpetuity, America's cultural heritage -- in whatever media -- is increasingly becoming the property of corporate copyright holders. But it belongs to all of us. Technology has given fans the means to enhance and protect this common heritage. The law should give them the right.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
For More, Look on the Web

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
 This is a new 30-second commercial released today by H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor, for statewide broadcast.

PRODUCER: GMMB

ON THE SCREEN: Seated between an American flag and a New York State flag, Mr. McCall addresses the camera while it gently pans back and forth. "Read Carl's plan to get New York moving, www.McCall02.com," the screen says.

THE SCRIPT: Mr. McCall says, "New York is facing tough challenges. Our schools are failing, and we're below the national average in job creation.

"In times like these, you deserve more than empty promises and negative ads. That's why I've offered a detailed plan for the future. To improve education: smaller classes and real accountability. To get our economy moving: help for small businesses and better job training.

"Take a look, let us know what you think, because we need everyone working together to build the future our children deserve."

ACCURACY: What Mr. McCall says about lagging job growth is basically true over the course of Gov. George E. Pataki's tenure. In the last years of the boom, New York was gaining jobs more quickly than the rest of the country, according to federal statistics.

SCORECARD: Don't worry, voters! Mr. McCall has a plan. For upstaters, there is the chapter on the economy, and for downstaters, there's education -- page after page of chewy policy on everything from sopping up unused federal health care dollars to implementing LearnSTAT -- "a powerful new tool to improve accountability by collecting, analyzing and mapping data on student performance and other indicators." You don't have to actually read it, just remember that the state is hurting badly enough to need it. SHAILA K. DEWAN

HEADLINE: Nobel Achievements; 
The Human Element in Economics

 BODY:
If you ask the man or woman on the street, he or she will tell you that economics is more likely to be the study of the behavior of money than the study of the behavior of people. And yet the Nobel in economic science this year has been awarded to two American economists, Daniel Kahneman and Vernon L. Smith, whose work describes the gap between predictions of human behavior according to economic theory and the way humans really act. It turns out, in effect, that money would behave logically, just the way theory predicts, if humans weren't the ones responsible for handling it. 
 Mr. Kahneman and his longtime collaborator, Amos Tversky, who died in 1996, set out to understand the dynamics of the psychology of choice, the kind of choice consumers make, for instance, when deciding whether to pay cash for a new television set or use a credit card when the cash price is lower. As the credit card industry knows full well, a lot depends on whether you describe the difference in price as a cash discount or a credit-card surcharge. That explains why you never see the phrase "credit card surcharge" when shopping. 
 Our economic decisions turn out to depend enormously on how our choices are framed, in part because, as Mr. Kahneman writes, "our perceptual apparatus is attuned to the evaluation of changes or differences rather than to the evaluation of absolute magnitudes." In other words, we do a better job of weighing risks against a narrow reference point than against the total economic outlook. 
As an example he cites this problem, which hinges not on a decision about how much you want to live but on how the decision affects the value of your money. If you're playing Russian roulette, would you pay as much to reduce the number of bullets in the gun from four to three as you would to reduce them from one to zero? Most people would not. But in fact, a bettor can afford to pay more to reduce the number of bullets from four to three because the value of the money placed on that bet is reduced by the probability that he will not live to enjoy it. Even though there are analogous issues in the stock market, most of us don't do a good job of thinking this way because it makes our heads hurt. That's why there will always be work for economists.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: STIRRINGS OF OPPOSITION; 
Seeds of Protest Growing on College Campuses

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Mike McLinn never showed the faintest interest in political protest, but he has plunged headfirst into the effort to prevent an American attack against Iraq.
 On Tuesday night, Mr. McLinn, a senior at Northeastern University, went to a planning meeting for a citywide demonstration on Nov. 3. Wednesday night, he went to the Boston Mobilization office, where two dozen students from Boston University and Boston College talked about the "No War, No Way" Walk for Peace on Oct. 20. Mr. McLinn, a computer studies major, has also been meeting with other campus groups to explore joint actions. 
 "The only thing I ever did on campus was run the outdoors club, which is about having fun," Mr. McLinn said. "But this is about saving lives. We're talking about attacking Iraq, attacking first, which is something this country's never done before. We're turning into an imperialist power. So for the first time, I made the decision to act on my angst." 
As the threat of military action against Iraq looms, students across the country are talking about the possibility of war. The first stirrings of an antiwar movement are emerging, even as a few conservative students who support the president are starting to organize.
"We've made a board with all these pins on it, showing where there have been demonstrations or teach-ins, or where there are things planned, and we have more than 135 campuses in 35 states," said Martha Honey of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, who has been helping organize student protests against military action. "It's growing exponentially, each day."
The movement against an attack on Iraq is still brand new, and most of the student actions have been small, attracting 100 people on one campus, 300 on another. It remains to be seen whether a powerful antiwar movement will emerge in the absence of a draft or, for that matter, a war. 
Then, too, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, many Americans, of every age, support tough action to prevent terrorism. According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll released this week, most Americans under 30 share the rest of the nation's views of the president's policies -- they are generally supportive. But younger Americans are the most opposed to a pre-emptive strike, and most likely to think that a war between the United States and Iraq would spread to other countries in the Middle East.
As recently as two months ago, on many campuses, only a handful of Muslim students and foreign policy professors were thinking about Iraq. But since late September, more than 10,000 faculty members at universities across the country have signed an online letter opposing an invasion, posted on the Web site www.noiraqattack.org. Students from anti-globalization groups and humanitarian groups are now forming antiwar coalitions with peace groups, Muslim student associations and others.
"My group, Stop the War!, is working with Amnesty International, the Greens, the Student Labor Action Coalition, the Muslim students, all kinds of groups," said Josh Healey, a University of Wisconsin freshman who helped organize a teach-in Tuesday and a rally Wednesday. "When I was handing out leaflets, all kinds of people were saying, like: 'Thanks a lot. We don't want to go to war about Iraq, but we didn't know what to do.' "
The speed of the antiwar mobilization has struck some longtime college presidents. "Students are engaging very, very quickly with Iraq," said Nancy Dye, the president of Oberlin College. "This morning I was struck by a very large sign on top of an academic building, saying, 'Say No to War in Iraq.' A new student organization has gotten itself together, and I don't even know if they have a name yet. There wasn't anything like this during the first gulf war, when I was president at Vassar." 
But such activity is not seen everywhere: "So far, people seem to be worrying more about the economy and the sniper," said Stephen Trachtenberg, the president of George Washington University. "You talk to undergrads and they don't have any memory of Vietnam. Activism is something their parents tell them about." 
At many campuses, support for military action against Iraq has been muted or nonexistent. But that, too, may be changing. Late last month, Joe Fairbanks founded the Stanford College Republicans to give conservative students at his mostly liberal campus a place to voice support for the Bush policies. The group, with 200 members, is now planning a teach-in. 
"We knew that military action was likely soon, and wanted to give students who supported it some way to show that to the rest of the students. Military action has become the only way to solve this problem," said Mr. Fairbanks, a sophomore at Stanford University. 
At the University of Texas too, conservatives are planning political actions. 
"The Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice has had a couple of antiwar rallies here, and university campuses always have more antiwar feeling than America in general," said Austin Kinghorn, public affairs director of the Young Conservatives of Texas. "But I think a lot of students here are still unsure. We're going to set up a debate with the coalition people, and I think that will get a huge turnout." 
Last year, the noisiest issue on campus was Israeli-Palestinian relations. That tension remains: At the University of Michigan this weekend, hundreds of students from more than 70 universities are gathering to discuss a campaign for divestment from companies that do business in Israel, a campaign intended to paint Israel in the racist colors of apartheid South Africa. 
On most campuses, the threat of war with Iraq has now become the dominant political issue with teach-ins and protests so common that prominent academics cannot meet the demand for their presence.
"I organized the Monday night forum at UMass-Amherst," said Michael Klare, a professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College and defense correspondent for The Nation. "I did M.I.T. last week. And then over the next two weeks, I'll be speaking at Springfield College, Western New England College and Simon's Rock. I've had to turn down CUNY and Hunter in New York, and Stanford and UC Santa Cruz."
On Monday, rallies were held at dozens of campuses nationwide, including Boston University, where students hung hundreds of paper dolls in Marsh Plaza, each one, they said, to represent 500 Iraqis killed since the Persian Gulf war as a result of either economic sanctions or bombing. 
On Wednesday, a telephone line was set up at Georgetown University in Washington, and activists were stopping students between classes, and asking them to call their representatives in Congress to urge them to vote against allowing the president to go to war.
"I think there's a very strong antiwar feeling on campus," said Shadi Hamid, a Georgetown sophomore. "It wasn't so much an issue when we came back to school in August, but in the last two weeks there's been this new sense of urgency, and the issue has moved beyond the Muslim students."
Building an antiwar movement when students are not threatened by the draft is not easy. It may be particularly difficult in a generation that has little experience with political protest. 
"Campus activism at Penn is a bit frustrating because it seems like most people agree with us," said Dan Fishback, a University of Pennsylvania senior. "I'll talk about the various reasons we shouldn't go to war, and they'll be, like, 'Yeah, I'm totally with you.' But they're not, because they're not involved. They're so used to feeling helpless that it doesn't occur to them to be outraged."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Surge, Ending Streak Of Six Weeks With Losses

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The stock market shot up drastically for a second session yesterday as prices continued to rally from the five-year lows reached on Wednesday. Some fresh economic reports were better than expected, but the rally, which spanned the globe, appeared to be more of a sign that prices had fallen too far than an indication that economic growth was poised to rebound.
 The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 4.2 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.9 percent, but those gains paled next to some in Europe, where markets turned around after the rise in the American markets on Thursday. The main index in Germany rose 7.2 percent, and the leading one in France gained 5.2 percent. Both markets had been at their lowest levels in five years or more earlier in the week. 
 Even in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 had set a 19-year low on Thursday, the index rose 1 percent yesterday.
"The important economic news was that the news was not as bad as people expected," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. He noted that retail sales excluding autos rose 0.1 percent in September, contrary to expectations, and that Thursday's report on new claims for unemployment benefits had shown fewer claims than expected. "It's a weak backdrop, but it does not look like a double-dip" recession, he said.
The explosive nature of the gains was such that the two main averages posted gains of more than 3 percent in two consecutive sessions. That had not happened since Oct. 20 and 21, 1987, in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. 
Steve Leuthold, of Leuthold & Company, a money management firm in Minneapolis, noted that there has been unusually high levels of short selling -- borrowing and selling shares in the expectation they will decline -- in recent weeks, and said he thought that many of the buyers had been covering their positions. 
"I think the market may have hit bottom," he said, adding that if it had not, he thought the bottom would be reached before Thanksgiving.
Stock prices had been extraordinarily weak until the last two days, with the main gauges all hitting multiyear lows on Wednesday. But the gains propelled the indexes to their first weekly gains after six consecutive weeks of losses.
At its low on Wednesday, the S.& P. 500 had fallen to 776.76, a figure that was 49.1 percent below the peak set in the spring of 2000. That made this decline the second-most severe in the history of the S.& P. 500, exceeding the 48.2 percent fall in 1973-75. The largest fall, of 86.2 percent, came in the Depression, from 1929 to 1932.
For those looking for numerical signs, it could be noted that Wednesday's close of the S.& P. 500 was nearly the same as the low of 776.92 set by the Dow when it hit bottom on Aug. 12, 1982, just before the great bull market began. 
Yesterday's buying was widespread, but some of the best gains came among stocks that had fallen the most. I.B.M., which had set a four-year low earlier in the week, rose $6.34, to $63.92, after Dan Niles, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, recommended it, saying that demand was finally rising. J. P. Morgan Chase, which set a seven-year low earlier in the week, rose $1.24, to $17.19.
General Electric, which reported earnings that matched expectations, thanks to a sale of a subsidiary that offset losses in its reinsurance and private investment business, leaped $1.61, to $24.21. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chief executive, said there "continues to be a more difficult economic environment than anticipated."
Retail stocks were strong, with Wal-Mart up $2.19, to $53.83, and Target gaining $2.05, to $29.88. Mr. Leuthold noted that applications for mortgage refinancings had hit record highs and said such refinancings would produce savings for customers when they are completed before the end of the year. "Where is all that money going to go?" he asked. "People are scared to death of the stock market, so why not spend it? I think we're going to have a pretty good Christmas."
The Dow rose 316.34, to 7,850.29, a gain of 4.2 percent for the day and 4.3 percent for the week. But it is still down 21.7 percent this year, a worse performance for the index than during any full year since 1974. Of the 30 Dow stocks, 28 rose yesterday, but only 3 -- Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and 3M -- are higher than they were at the end of last year.
Similarly, the S.& P. 500 rose 31.40, to 835.32, a gain of 3.9 percent for the day and 4.3 percent for the week. More than 80 percent of the stocks in that index rose yesterday, but more than 80 percent of the same stocks are down for the year.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 47.10, to 1,210.47, a gain of 4.1 percent for the day and 6.2 percent for the week. 
It has been very rare for all three major indexes to decline as consistently as they have in recent weeks. Since the Nasdaq index began in 1971, there have been only four previous times when each index managed to fall for at least six consecutive weeks. In each case except the most recent one, the end of such a string preceded a strong market. 
But the last such coordinated decline -- of six weeks that ended on Oct. 13, 2000 -- proved to be merely a precursor to a severe bear market that was just beginning. A year later, all the major indexes were lower, with the Nasdaq composite down by nearly half. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices had their biggest decline since August as a rebound in stocks crimped demand for the safety of government debt.
The benchmark 10-year notes fell for a second week as some investors said a surge in General Electric's third-quarter profit, which spurred the rally in stocks, indicates the economic expansion may be strengthening. Speculation waned that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, dimming the appeal of fixed-rate securities.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 10/32 , to a price of 104 18/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.81 percent from 3.66 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 26/32 , to 108 11/32 . The bond's yield rose to 4.82 percent from 4.72 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Move in Japan to Aid Banks Plagued by Bad Debt

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Japan's central bank moved today to force a much faster clean-up of the country's ailing banking system. It said it would spend $16 billion of its own money in a highly unorthodox plan to buy stocks from threatened banks, and it called on the government to use tax money to absorb much more of the banks' losses on bad loans.
 The central bank also called for stricter review of the banks' loan portfolios, and signaled that it would offer emergency loans to banks that fall under a financial threat. 
 The steps were a clear signal, analysts said, that the independent central bank intends to cooperate with Heizo Takenaka, Japan's newly appointed economy chief, if he follows through on promises to bring about a sharp reduction of the mountain of nonperforming loans that is hobbling Japan's financial system.
The announcements by the Bank of Japan, which has been at loggerheads with the government for years, are a "real step forward toward coordination," Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, said after studying the plans. "The report is saying, 'We're going to do everything we can to help you.' " 
The stock purchase plan, which calls for buying shares in investment-grade-rated companies held by 10 or so banks over the next 12 months and holding them for at least three years, has raised eyebrows at other major central banks, which studiously avoid involving themselves directly in equity markets. But it is seen in Japan as part of a hard-nosed campaign by the central bank to force a hesitant government to bail out the banks. 
Mr. Takenaka said today that he would have a plan to clean up the banking problems and to forestall a recession ready in time for the opening of the new legislative session next Friday. He has already won agreement from his colleagues for several deregulation measures, but hopes are fading that a corporate tax cut will be included.
Mr. Takenaka, who is thought to favor a "hard landing" for failing banks and companies rather than continued financial life support, showed a softer side today in a visit to the headquarters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He denied a remark attributed to him in a magazine interview that no Japanese bank was too big to be allowed to fail.
Allies of Mr. Takenaka have proposed that the government move to cut off the 30 most indebted companies from new credit and allow them to close. But some politicians and economists fear that so forceful a policy would touch off a wave of bankruptcies and plunge the nation deep into recession. Ruling-party politicians have called for stepped-up public spending to counteract that effect and keep Japan's economy, the world's second largest, from sinking.
But Yasuo Fukuda, the government's chief spokesman, said today that the government would not agree to pump more spending into the economy. He said after a cabinet meeting: "The prime minister is not thinking about an extra budget aimed at bolstering the economy. We will not cut corners."
Today, the Bank of Japan ignored pleas from politicians for a further loosening of its monetary policy, already the easiest among major countries, with short-term interest rates effectively at zero. It also rebuffed demands that it set a timetable for reversing deflation, which has plagued Japan for three years.
"It looks like they want to get out of the central bank business and into something else," Christopher Walker, senior economist in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston, said today, after a two-day meeting of the bank's board ended without action on the money supply. "They seem to have given up on using monetary policy as an anti-deflation tool."
But bank officials are believed to want to tie any further steps to action by the government on the bad-loan crisis.
"The Bank of Japan has said very clearly that they will put out all the money necessary, if the government really cleans it up," Mr. Feldman said. 
The commercial banks' capacity to deal with the problem loans themselves has been badly eroded in recent years by the plunging stock market, which has cut trillions of yen in value from their shareholdings. On March 31, the end of the Japanese fiscal year, the country's 11 largest banks held about 24 trillion yen ($196.9 billion) in stocks; Japanese regulations permit stockholdings to count for part of banks' capital requirements. The Nikkei index has fallen 29 percent since then.
Referring to the bad loans, the Bank of Japan said today: "During the past 10 years, Japanese banks have made progress in addressing the problem by disposing of more than 90 trillion yen in nonperforming loans. Nevertheless, they now face a more severe challenge than ever, given the decline in their financial strength and earning power."
The central bank suggested that its policy makers work with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to "pre-emptively seek to prevent a financial crisis from arising." Conservative official estimates put the total face value of nonperforming bank loans at $423 billion; many economists and analysts put the true figure at more than $1 trillion.
A government-sponsored agency, the Resolution and Collection Corporation, has been operating for seven years, buying some $70 billion in bad loans from the banks. But because it is barred by law from reselling the loans at a loss, it has become more of a warehouse than a clearinghouse for the loans.
Ernst & Young estimates that private investors have paid about $30 billion since 1997 for troubled bank loans with a face value of $300 billion. Most of the deals came in the late 1990's, when market prices plunged so low -- as little as 6 cents on the dollar -- that the banks became reluctant to sell.
Today's developments came against a backdrop of economic unraveling. The Finance Ministry reported that new lending by Japanese banks was down yet again in September, by 4.8 percent, making 57 consecutive months of decline. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks in September for the third consecutive month, Finance Ministry figures showed, draining a net $10 billion from Japan's equity markets.
Stocks rose in Tokyo today, with the Nikkei index up 1 percent at 8,529.61, largely because of the rally in New York on Thursday. The index had been riding a roller coaster mostly downward over the two weeks since Mr. Takenaka was given wide economic policy powers in a cabinet reshuffle.
As a reflection of Japan's toughening times, a debt-laden construction company, Kumagai Gumi, said today that it had sold America's Tower, a 47-story office building near Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, for $405 million to an American buyer, a unit of the Paramount Group.
Japanese officials emphasized this week that the Nikkei's slump was part of a global downward trend. "Stock prices in Japan are being influenced by the U.S. stock market as well as by the world economic uncertainty and Japan's economic stagnation," Mr. Koizumi told reporters.
Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan, warned reporters today that further falls in share prices "could destabilize the nation's financial system." 
Elections to fill seven vacant seats in Parliament, set for Oct. 27, will put Mr. Koizumi's economic policy to the political test. Five of the seats were last held by members of his party. "We will aim at winning all the elections," Mr. Koizumi told reporters.

HEADLINE: A Bitter Harvest For the Losers; 
Some Ask Why Compromise Doesn't Protect Their Gardens

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
The agreement to preserve some 500 of the city's community gardens and allow about 150 others to be developed into housing seemed to many a fair solution to a long dispute. 
 But some gardeners who stand to lose out in the deal are still hoping to hold onto the land. 
 For three years, Helen Mason of Brooklyn has been cultivating a garden on Legion Street in Brownsville, where she and 12 neighbors grow banana peppers, lemon thyme and potatoes. There, they teach children the virtues of eating vegetables.
Now, because of last month's agreement between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, the garden will be cleared for the immediate development of two- and three-family housing. 
A few blocks away, on Herzl Street, Ann Thompson, a retired nurse, opened a day care center in 1999 and converted the lot next door into a garden. The city calls it the Herzl Street Block Association Garden, but she renamed it after her day care center, Future Leaders Garden. This plot will also be developed with housing. 
In Manhattan, on East Sixth Street, Nancy Alusick will soon have to give up the 20-year-old Stannard-Diggs Community Garden. The land will be used for housing for the elderly.
More than two decades ago, New York City gave community groups temporary permission to turn vacant city property into gardens. Many were turned into leafy oases, while in other places, gardens failed to take root, leaving litter-strewn eyesores.
With the city's revitalized economy in the 1990's and the increasing housing shortage, some of those garden lots became valuable real estate. Lawsuits, including legal action by the attorney general, kept the city from developing the sites, and many New Yorkers agreed that it was hard to choose sides. The city needs both greenery and housing.
"There's a demand for homeownership in Brooklyn and the Bronx," said Carol Abrams, spokeswoman for the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "What houses do for a neighborhood is anchor a neighborhood in good and bad times."
Even the losing gardeners admit the need. "They do need the old-age housing," Ms. Alusick said. "I cannot speak against that." But this does not make the loss easier. "Finding out that your garden is going to be bulldozed is like finding out someone has cancer," she said.
Many advocates of the gardens counter that green spaces are just as essential as homes. "I look at the kids in this community," Ms. Thompson said. "They're just surviving. Central Park is like California to them. So I said, 'Let me take this garden and make this their Central Park.' "
They also say that they had no voice in the deal made last month. Ms. Thompson and other gardeners and community leaders say they were excluded from the negotiations between the mayor and the attorney general. Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn said he would meet later this month with people from the mayor's and Mr. Spitzer's offices.
"I want them to reconsider the gardens that they're saving," Mr. Barron said. "My concern is that there's been a disproportionate number of gardens closed in Brownsville."
Mr. Spitzer's office declined to discuss why certain neighborhoods were affected or how gardens were chosen for preservation or development.
Ms. Abrams, of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said there were several reasons lots were chosen. Some, like Ms. Thompson's and Ms. Mason's, were reviewed by the city last year and approved for development pending the outcome of Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit. Other lots were requested by nonprofit agencies seeking to build multiple-unit housing for the elderly or for other people who need special services, like those with disabilities.
Generally, the sites chosen for development were selected because they were larger or there were several lots available to build a cluster of new homes, Ms. Abrams said. 
Some gardeners, feeling locked out of the decision-making process, claim the plots they use were chosen over vacant lots. In some cases, gardeners say, other vacant lots offered as replacement gardens are not going to work. "We were offered another site, but it's no good" because hydrants or other water sources are not within easy reach, Cordelia Gilford of the Bronx said.
Ms. Gilford has helped run the Community School 134 garden on Bristow Street in the Bronx since it opened in 1979. The decision to close the garden has left her frustrated, and she said she was trying to persuade Councilwoman Helen Diane Foster to defend the garden in City Hall. But Ms. Gilford held out little hope. 
"Once the city decides," she asked, "what can we do?"
Most gardeners who were interviewed said they were still in shock, since they thought Mr. Spitzer had been defending them. Some said that they were in constant contact with his office during the lawsuit, so they expected their gardens to be protected.
Meanwhile, those whose gardens are being preserved in the agreement are feeling something akin to survivor's guilt.
"I don't feel great," said Carolyn Ratcliffe, whose garden on East Ninth Street in Manhattan was spared. "They love their gardens as much as we love ours."
She disagrees with critics who say these gardens were meant to be only temporary until the city made decisions about development. "You feel like cannon fodder," Ms. Ratcliffe said. "That's what gardeners have been in New York City. The gardeners took vacant lots. They chased out the drugs. They spent thousands of hours of work, thousand of dollars of their money, turning these places into safe havens. And then, 'Oh, yeah, don't get too attached to it.' "
Although her garden has been spared for the moment, she does not feel secure about it. According to the agreement, the city has three years to decide if gardens like hers will be turned over to a public land trust or the Parks Department. The first possibility would require a review of the garden and the second would give the city the option of selling the lot in the future. She said she hoped the garden would one day become a city park.
Harvey Epstein, chairman of Community Board 3 in Lower Manhattan, said that if gardeners have to lose their green spaces, the city had better make sure that low-income housing is really built in their place. During the late 1990's, he said, gardens in his area were taken for commercial developments with rents beyond what poor residents could pay. 
"I think people are more understanding when it goes to affordable housing," Mr. Epstein said. "But when it was going to market-rate development in our neighborhood, it was a real problem." 
According to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the new homes built on old gardens are supposed to be for buyers with incomes of $35,000 to $75,000 a year, and people living in the neighborhoods are to be given preference. This may be little comfort to the people who garden on Legion Street, since the census showed that Brownsville had a median household income of $19,722 in 2000, according to Susan Weber at the Department of Sociology at Queens College.
Ms. Thompson knows the bulldozers could arrive any day. She has been contacting the local community board and council members, hoping to save her garden, which doubles as a gathering spot for neighborhood children. 
"It's not going to hurt me as much as it is those kids," she said. "I'm tough. I can take it. But where are those kids going to go?"

 BODY:
3rd-Quarter Profit at G.E. Increases by Nearly 25%
Shares of General Electric rose more than 7 percent, to $24.21, after the company reported that it earned $4.09 billion, or 41 cents a share, in the third quarter, in line with analysts' expectations. The earnings were almost 25 percent higher than the $3.28 billion, or 33 cents a share, that the company earned in the period a year earlier. Revenue was up 11 percent, to $32.59 billion. G.E. also confirmed its expectations of earning $1.65 a share for the year.
 G.E.'s profit growth stemmed primarily from one-time events like a $75 million tax rebate and a $317 million gain from the sale of GE Global eXchange Services, its electronic commerce unit. Page C2. 

AstraZeneca's Patent Is Upheld
A federal judge has at least partly upheld the patent protection of Prilosec, an ulcer treatment made by AstraZeneca that is one of the strongest-selling prescription drugs. But Judge Barbara S. Jones said in a 277-page opinion that the United States units of Schwarz Pharma did not infringe the Prilosec patents of AstraZeneca in a version of Prilosec made by the companies. C14.

Household to Pay $484 Million Fine
Household International will pay a fine of as much as $484 million to settle charges that it had misled borrowers in dozens of states into paying mortgage rates that in some cases were almost twice what was promised. C4.

Retail Sales Fell 1.2% in September
The Commerce Department said overall retail sales fell 1.2 percent in September, hurt by weak car sales. Excluding autos, September sales actually squeezed out a gain of 0.1 percent. In another report, an index of consumer sentiment maintained by the University of Michigan dropped to a nine-year low in its preliminary reading for October. The Labor Department also reported that the Producer Price Index in September rose 0.1 percent over all, excluding food and energy costs. C2.

PanAmSat Exceeds Expectations
Third-quarter results at PanAmSat exceeded Wall Street's expectations by 3 cents a share. Net income rose to $20.7 million, or 14 cents a share, although revenue decreased to $199.1 million. The figure last year, however, included about $50 million associated with what were essentially one-time sales of satellite capacity, so the company's operating revenue was essentially flat. C2.

China May Ease Currency Trading
China may allow its main currency to be traded by investors outside its borders, if only in a limited way. C3.

Bail Granted for Ex-Tyco Official
Tyco International's former chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, left, who has been charged with helping to loot $600 million from the company, was allowed to remain free after a judge accepted $5 million in bail put up by his parents and other family members. The money was offered after Justice Michael Obus of State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected Mr. Swartz's original bail request, ruling that Mr. Swartz had not proved that the $7 million in Tyco stock he offered had not been "tainted" by criminal activity. C2.

Merger Talks Advance in Britain
Granada and Carlton Communications, the joint owners of Britain's largest commercial television network, have reopened merger talks. The companies have long sought a merger as the best way to consolidate ownership of ITV, the largest of Britain's three commercial networks, and second only to the government-subsidized BBC in terms of viewers.

HEADLINE: Milestone on Iraq: Voices of Caution and Doubt 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "U.S. Has a Plan to Occupy Iraq, Officials Report" (front page, Oct. 11) and "Democracy by Force" (letter, Oct. 10): 
 The letter writer is correct that the United States imposed democracy by force on the Axis powers after World War II. 
But those democracies grew and prospered not because of our use of force but because of the many years and billions of dollars that the United States spent reconstructing Europe and Japan and nurturing their postwar recovery. 
It seems doubtful in today's economic and political climate that the United States would be able to make the same intense effort for Iraqi reconstruction that it did half a century ago in Europe and Japan. 
Failing such a commitment, few knowledgeable observers hold out much hope for a viable democracy in the wake of a war on Iraq, especially if that war is prosecuted solely by the United States.

HEADLINE: Russia Taken Off Money Laundering Blacklist 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Russia was released today from an international blacklist of countries with inadequate monitoring of money laundering, in a move seen in part as a political gesture to President Vladimir V. Putin. 
 The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, an international agency of 31 member natons, including the United States, in a meeting today in Paris, removed Russia from its list of about a dozen countries most likely to be havens for criminals and tax dodgers. 
 Russia had actively sought release from the list, as it pushed ahead in efforts to be accepted as a full-fledged member of the international club of economic and political powers. 
The agency, set up in 1989 by the Group of Seven, the world's major industrial nations, said it had made the decision because "of the implementation of significant reform to its anti-money-laundering system." Russia was also invited to take part in the agency's work as an observer, and may get the chance to become a full-fledged member by June. 
Being on the list had practical consequences. Rating agencies, important in forming investors' opinions of Russia, tended to give Russia lower marks, and international financing, essential for Russia's growing private sector, was more expensive.
While Russia has taken great strides in improving its economy and increasing scrutiny of its financial system, its economic landscape remains relatively opaque. Some experts here tonight interpreted the decision more as gesture of political good will than a completely clean bill of economic health. 
"Russia does have a history of a lot of capital leaving the country, and it has been difficult to tell where that money comes from," said Roland Nash, director of research at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank in Moscow. "There's a link with the economy, but the move is mostly political." 
The Bush administration, which has a political agenda of its own as it presses Mr. Putin to support a new United Nations resolution on Iraq, does not have a deciding vote in the agency. 
Even so, "its opinion commands attention," said a Russian official, who added that American officials in recent meetings in Washington with Finance Minister Aleksei L. Kudrin were "very supportive" of Russia's efforts to be released. 
Russians applauded today's decision, literally. Pictures broadcast on Russian television tonight showed Mr. Kudrin smiling as he announced the decision to a conference table of clapping Russian bankers. 
"We are now a part of the club of countries with developed financial systems, whose financial systems are under a magnifying glass and are protected from dirty money," Mr. Kudrin told the bankers. 
Russia was put on the list in 2000, after the American authorities began investigating charges of illegally obtained Russian money in American banks. The investigation did not end in any prosecutions. 
In an effort to get off the list, Russia passed laws required by the Paris-based task force and set up its own internal monitoring agency for the financial system here. 
But it was not until today that the agency decided to remove it from the list, which includes Ukraine and Nigeria. 
"It's political in the sense that the U.S. would not do it if they didn't want to have a good relationship with Russia," said Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "But they also think highly of what Russia has accomplished."

HEADLINE: THE NOBEL AWARD: REACTION; 
Praise and Blame for Prize to Carter, and Message to Bush

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The Norwegian Nobel Committee assured itself extra publicity and sympathetic headlines across Europe today when, in awarding the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter, it suggested that it was also sending a political message criticizing the Bush administration's policy towards Iraq.
 After the award was announced in Oslo this morning, Gunnar Berge, the chairman of the five-member committee, told reporters that it "must also be seen as criticism of the line the current U.S. administration has taken on Iraq." 
 He added: "I hope it will help strengthen what Carter has to say. He has a more moderate point of view than the sitting administration."
Two other committee members, Inger-Marie Ytterhorn and Hanna Kristine, then challenged this interpretation. 
"There is nothing about that in the citation," Ms. Ytterhorn, a former rightist legislator, told an Oslo radio station. Ms. Kristine, another former legislator, told the Norwegian news agency: "In the committee, we didn't discuss what sort of interpretation of the grounds there should be. It wasn't a topic."
However, while the citation focused on Mr. Carter's long commitment to the promotion of human rights, peace and democracy around the world, it clearly made a connection between the award and growing fears of a new war over Iraq. 
"In a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power," the citation read, "Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international cooperation based on international law, respect for human rights, and economic development."
Even without Mr. Berge's disputed interpretation of the award, it was apparent that the Nobel Committee knowingly stepped into a hot political issue, and not for the first time. 
It deeply angered the Soviet Union in 1975 by awarding the prize to the dissident intellectual Andrei Sakharov, and riled Poland's Communist authorities with a similar award to Lech Walesa in 1983. China was unhappy when the 1989 award went to the Dalai Lama, an implicit criticism of China's occupation of Tibet.
This year, the committee appears to have responded, at least in part, to mounting concern in Europe that the Bush administration is ever more determined to invade Iraq to oust President Saddam Hussein.
Although leading European governments are divided over what to do about Iraq, with Germany refusing to involve itself in any conflict, France still seeking a diplomatic solution and Britain backing the United States, public opinion in all three countries is strongly opposed to a unilateral American attack on Iraq.
In many regions of the world, today's peace prize was also viewed through the prism of Mr. Carter's long years of quiet diplomacy, not only when he helped to seal the Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel while president, but also as an indefatigable promoter of democracy and conflict resolution through the Carter Center at Emory University, Atlanta, during the two decades since he left the White House.
In Israel, a senior official in the office of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said: "If only for his efforts to achieve the peace agreement with Egypt, and the fact that this agreement is still holding, he deserves the peace prize. It is still the basic building block for any future peace agreement between Israel and the Arab world."
Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, called the award well deserved, "Above all," he added, "Carter is a man who has always stood for dialogue and for solving disputes through diplomacy and peaceful means, and not through the guns of war." He recalled Mr. Carter's work as the head of American teams observing elections among Palestinians in 1996. "People here were impressed with his passion," he said.
Mustafa Khalil, Egypt's prime minister and foreign minister during the Camp David process, said Mr. Carter's award was well deserved. "I think without Mr. Carter, it would have been difficult to reach an agreement between Egypt and Israel. Mr. Carter played one of the most important roles in history in that agreement."
President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal singled out Mr. Carter's efforts to find a solution to the conflict in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony. Mr. Carter himself did not monitor the August 1999 elections in which East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia, but he sent a 15-member team from the Carter Center and warned on the eve of elections of the violence, sponsored by the Indonesian military and other government bodies, that was to come.
Foreign Minister Jose Ramos Horta of East Timor, who himself shared the peace prize with Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo in 1996, praised Mr. Carter's selection, and added his own speculation about whether the Nobel committee "is not betting on Jimmy Carter in order to enable him to help calm down the spirit of confrontation that exists now between Iraq and the United States."
Two South African prize-winners, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won in 1984, and former President Nelson Mandela, who won in 1993, also praised Mr. Carter. Since leaving office, Archbishop Tutu said, "he's been a great deal more effective than as president." Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Mandela said of Mr. Carter, "Even now, when President Bush has taken that belligerent attitude, he has condemned him."
Congratulations also came from President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who had been widely mentioned as a possible peace prize winner this year. "I congratulate him, he deserved it better than I," Mr. Karzai told reporters. "It was great for Afghanistan to go to the final list of candidates for the Peace Prize after the 23 years of war and destruction. To be named for peace is really nice and enjoyable, but I believe President Carter deserved it."
Mr. Carter has frequently used his prestige around the world, traveling most notably to Pyongyang in 1994 to ease tensions between North Korea, South Korea and the United States over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. This year he made a trip to Havana, calling for an end to the American embargo but also urging President Fidel Castro to increase political freedom.
Much of the work of the Carter Center, though, has been out of the headlines, notably in monitoring elections in fragile democracies. Probably in no region is he more admired than in Latin America where, as president in the late 1970's, he promoted human rights and democracy in a continent overwhelmingly under military rule.
Robert A. Pastor, who handled Latin America in the National Security Council during the Carter adminstration and worked for 17 years at the Carter Center, said Mr. Carter's greatest success in Latin America was to ensure free elections in Nicaragua in 1990 when the Sandinista government went down to defeat. "Of all of the things he was engaged in, that was a case in which it's clear, had he not gotten involved, that election would not have succeeded," Mr. Pastor said.
In Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez is facing strong pressure to leave office, the minister of information, Nora Uribe, said she hoped the prize awarded to Mr. Carter as an advocate of mediation would prompt opposition groups to reconsider their refusal to negotiate with Mr. Chavez.
"I think this is important because we are talking about the Nobel Prize for Peace, and we are talking not just about any person here," she said. "They have to understand that this prize is an affirmation of his work here in Venezuela."

HEADLINE: Single Girls: Sex but Still No Respect 

BYLINE:  By PHOEBE HOBAN 

 BODY:
Contemporary culture has never lacked for compelling images of the single woman. They've run the gamut from glamorous to Gidget, from the original Cosmo girl to Carrie Bradshaw and company on "Sex and the City." And while such thoroughly modern millies as the singleton Bridget Jones or the sex-addict Samantha are hardly real-life role models, they represent the idea of the single woman as a viable and even enticing entity, one that needs no more justification or documentation, say, than the domestic habits of the dedicated bachelor. But apparently this female demographic still requires a bookshelf all its own.
 It has been nearly 40 years since Betty Friedan attacked the conventional notion of the role of women in marriage in "The Feminine Mystique," ushering in the first wave of feminism. According to the Census Bureau, single women over the age of 15 now represent 48 percent of the female population. But recently the literature seems to have regressed. 
 Consider two books on the subject that have just come out this month that try to validate this lifestyle both historically and anecdotally, as if it were a fringe phenomenon rather than a rapidly growing segment of society: Betsy Israel's "Bachelor Girl: The Secret History of Single Women in the Twentieth Century" (William Morrow) and "Solitaire: The Intimate Lives of Single Women" (Macfarlane Walter & Ross) by Marian Botsford Fraser, a Canadian journalist. Both suggest that single women are still perceived as a special-interest group, although, according to Ms. Israel's book, they number a staggering 1.95 million in New York City alone. (The Census Bureau puts that number at 2,060,000.)
"Single women have always been portrayed and depicted in the mass culture in a negative and nasty way that influenced the lives of many women, and at the same time was competely untrue, and these images, some of them 150 years old, are still being played out and the ideas are just being recycled," says Ms. Israel.
"Bachelor Girl" traces the trajectory of the single woman in America, from the turn of the 20th century to the present, from the spinster -- working immigrant women who literally spun for a living -- to "outspoken and very cool-looking single celebrities" of the 1960's and 1970's like Gloria Steinem. There are thumbnail sketches of poster girls for singlehood like the Bronte sisters, Louisa May Alcott and Florence Nightingale. (Who, despite her status, was not exactly a role model for single living. After revolutionizing military nursing standards during the Crimean War, she took to her bed more or less permanently at the age of 40 with a mysterious malady.) Rife with Dickensian detail, Ms. Israel's book provides a useful (if depressing) history of single working girls and new women of all stripes, from the shopgirl to the Gibson goddess to the swinging single.
Ms. Fraser's book calls single women "a potentially powerful socio-economic group" but one that is "still widely perceived as disadvantaged or insignificant, subordinate or invisible." As evidence she collects oral accounts of 150 women she interviewed across Canada, from a nonagenarian living alone in a trailer on a remote farm to young professionals at work and play in Toronto, to the hospice care of a terminally ill woman by her coterie of friends. The collective voice of these single women is decidedly ambivalent.
"I think it's human nature for there to be ambivalence about stuff like this," Ms. Fraser says. "I think people want the freedom, the autonomy, the independence and in some cases the greater security of being single, but they also want to be in relationships. No matter how well you put your life together, it's still nice to have sex now and then."
It's hard to imagine their male counterparts being subjected to similar treatment, a history of single men, say, or a book about bachelors that didn't celebrate their sexual prowess with Rat-Pack-style martini glasses or a winsome picture of Hugh Grant or some other signifier of this debonair demimonde on the cover, excerpted, perhaps, by Esquire or GQ.
The cover of Ms. Fraser's "Solitaire" is stark, showing a pair of self-clasped workaday female hands. Ms. Israel's book makes a game effort at presenting a positive image, with two broadly grinning flappers on the cover who at least look as if they are having fun. But having shuffled the deck of single-women stereotypes from the old maid to the mistress, she sadly concludes: "If distinct single archetypes seem for the moment to have blurred, the conviction that single women are social outcasts -- odd women who require constant translation -- remains intact. Wherever she is, perhaps in a waiting room or lost in the morass of the Internet, she'll eventually find a story about her uncertain future and her inevitable regret."
"The media refrain has variations," she writes, "but in essence it remains the same: no matter what the single woman says, she can't really be happy. Her life is barren and disappointing."
Carolyn Dinshaw, the director of the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality at New York University, questions the terminology itself. " 'Single women' strikes me as very outdated," she says. "I would suggest the term 'women,' because 'single women' problematizes the single woman as if the standard is the couple, and it seems to me that we have really gone beyond that."
Ann Douglas, a historian at Columbia University and the author of "Terrible Honesty," who has been single for the last 14 years, says that the perception of single women as a group remains out of sync with the reality: "I think the possibilities for sustaining such a life have improved dramatically, but the official culture is not interested in making anything of this trend." She called the extent that advertisers and politicians have ignored this group extraordinary. "This is one of the most important social shifts going on as we live," she added, "and it is going on largely unaddressed except by scare tactics. We still do have books telling us, 'Have your children now.' "
Ms. Douglas was referring to Sylvia Ann Hewlett's book "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children," which recently created a furor by arguing that career women who failed to acknowledge their biological clocks in their 20's and make marriage and children a priority have had to suffer the consequences.
Surprisingly, the book that truly celebrates the single woman was written four decades ago. Helen Gurley Brown's "Sex and the Single Girl," published in 1962, "torpedoes one of the most absurd (if universal) myths of our time: that every girl must be married," its jacket flap proclaims. "(How -- when there are four million too few single adult men to go around. Why -- when it can be so exciting to be single?) In perhaps the first truly honest treatment of the subject, 'Sex and the Single Girl' tells the unmarried girl how to be irresistibly, irrepressibly, confidently, enviably single."
True, much of the dated advice (as well as the politically incorrect title itself) is now amusingly camp, but the potential thrill of being single still saturates each page.
Ms. Brown writes on Page 5 of her book: "The single woman, far from being a creature to be pitied and patronized, is emerging as the newest glamour girl of our times." (But then again, what would you expect from the woman who invented the Cosmo girl?) Contrast that to the same page of "Solitaire." Ms. Fraser writes that the single women she interviewed "spoke frankly about virginity, celibacy, masturbation, money, abuse, secret sex lives and fear of illness and death." Which book would you rather read?
"I think the tenor of the times is a reason for that difference," Ms. Fraser said. "Sadder, older, wiser, what can I say?" (Even Ms. Brown is rewriting history. She is currently researching a foreword to a proposed new edition of her classic. "Single women don't have it made," she said wryly. "Neither do married women, divorced women or widows.")
Ms. Fraser said: "It's a lot easier to justify the life of a single woman now than it was because people have sexual freedom, they have economic freedom, they can get a mortgage and they have high-powered jobs. But I don't think it has yet reached that sort of level of critical mass. I mean it's still not really cool to be single. Maybe 5 or 10 years from now things will have changed to the degree that people would like them to have changed and a totally different kind of book can be written."
And therein lies the problem. In an effort to validate the lives of single women, the accomplished women who have written about them perpetuate the image of their situation as a plight rather than a prerogative, the lack of a lifestyle rather than a lifestyle (and, given the compelling statistics, not even an alternative lifestyle).
Despite their authors' consciousness-raising intentions, these books, in their earnest effort to explain an exploding demographic, to sympathetically explain the who, how and why of single women, do anything but. They treat the subject as an unresolved issue rather than a de facto element of contemporary culture. They continue to argue the case for single women, as if their growing numbers weren't argument enough.
Ms. Israel, for one, hopes to put the negative stereotypes to rest. "I saw this as a book with a mission, she said. "I would love it if it was the last book ever written on the subject."

HEADLINE: It's the War, Stupid 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As soon as President Bush rolled out his new war on Iraq, the Democrats in Washington demanded a debate, and debates they got, all right. There was the debate between Matt Drudge and Barbra Streisand about the provenance of an antiwar quote she recited at a party fund-raiser. There was the debate about whether Jim McDermott, Democratic Congressman from Washington, should have come home from Baghdad before announcing on TV that we can take Saddam Hussein's promises at "face value." There were the debates about why Al Gore took off his wedding ring, why Robert Torricelli took a Rolex, and why Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson took noisy offense at so benign and popular a Hollywood comedy as "Barbershop."
 But as for the promised debate about Iraq, it became heated only after Congressional approval of the president's mission was a foregone conclusion. Though the party's leaders finally stepped up, starting with Mr. Gore, most of them seemed less concerned with the direction of the nation in 2002 than with positioning themselves for the White House in 2004 (or '08). They challenged the administration's arrogant and factually disingenuous way of pursuing its goal, then beat a hasty retreat to sign on to whatever fig-leaf language they could get into the final resolution. (Mr. Gore, after his Sept. 23 Iraq speech, dropped the subject altogether.) 
 Even at their most forceful they failed to state their qualified, Bush-lite case for war with anything like the persistence, eloquence and authority of Chuck Hagel, the Republican Vietnam War hero. Speaking with almost mournful resignation from the floor on Wednesday, the senator was naked in his doubts about what lies ahead. "We should not be seduced by the expectations of 'dancing in the streets' after Saddam's regime has fallen," he said. 
That Democratic leaders added so little to the discussion is attributed to their intimidation by the president's poll numbers, their fear of being branded unpatriotic and their eagerness to clear the decks (whatever the price) to return to the economy, stupid, before Election Day. None of these motives constitute a profile in courage; no wonder George W. Bush was emboldened to present himself as the new John F. Kennedy in his Iraq speech on Monday night. 
Agree with him or not, the president does stand for something. He led, and the Democrats followed. The polls, far from rationalizing the Democrats' timidity, suggest they might have won a real debate had they staged one. Support for an Iraq war is falling, with the dicey 51 percent in favor in the latest CNN/USA Today survey dropping to a Vietnam-like 33 percent support level if there are 5,000 casualties, as there could well be. But even so, the Democratic leaders never united around a substantive alternative vision to the administration's pre-emptive war against the thug of Baghdad. That isn't patriotism, it's abdication. 
Perhaps more than he intended, Tom Daschle summed up the feeble thrust of his party's opposition on "Meet the Press" last weekend when he observed, "The bottom line is . . . we want to move on." Now his wish has come true -- but move on to what? The dirty secret of the Democrats is that they have no more of an economic plan than they had an Iraq plan. 
Nor do they want to dwell on Iraq and the economy in the same breath. No one really knows how many billions are needed to pay for both the war itself and the years to follow of shouldering what James Fallows in The Atlantic calls "The Fifty-first State," post-Saddam Iraq. The Democrats are in lockstep with the president in refusing to say that we will have to sacrifice anything to pay these bills, because that would mean 'fessing up to the unpleasant truth that either domestic spending will have to be cut or taxes will have to be raised. 
The economic rant the Democrats offer instead is the safely generic one they've used in war and peace, regardless of the state of the economy, since the Reagan years. As befits a clownish approach, it is all too fittingly presented this election season in the form of a cartoon -- a now notorious ad in which Mr. Bush is depicted pushing Social Security recipients in wheelchairs to their doom. It's a funny example of its "South Park" genre, and we do get the point: Privatized Social Security accounts could hurt Our Seniors. As indeed they could. 
But such accounts are likely less imminent than a Saddam nuclear attack; even Republican ideologues are running away from them in this economic environment. The real wolves at the door today are rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence, a cratered stock market that may soon be mirrored in the real estate market and . . . well, every Democratic candidate (and most American voters) can recite the litany. But in the words of Fritz Hollings, a Democratic senator so old that, like Robert Byrd, he sometimes commits the political sin of speaking the truth: "Our problem is the Democrats whine and whine. Everybody knows what the trouble is. The question is, 'What's the solution?' "
The solution seems to be the same as that for Iraq -- call for a debate and pray. Here is what Richard Gephardt had to say last week: "I have asked the president for nine months to have a summit on the economy to try to figure out a new economic game plan for this country." On Thursday Mr. Daschle asked for Congress to extend unemployment compensation and help bail out teetering budgets in the states (without saying where the money would come from), floated the whimsy that Mr. Bush might replace all his economic advisers with Clinton administration alumni and, yes, again called for an "economic summit." This kind of visionary leadership and a tin cup will get an unemployed American another presidential economic conclave of fat cats in Waco.
You might think that Mr. Gore, who has much to gain by showing political spine, would seize the moment. But fresh from his Iraq oration, he trotted out an economic address that offered only the familiar recitation of woes, followed by a few boilerplate bullet points largely remaindered from the 2000 campaign (including, of all musty Gore golden oldies, a plea for maximizing Internet bandwidth). 
Like his party's Congressional leaders, he conspicuously avoided suggesting any kind of rollback of the Bush tax cut that now looms over the nation's economic future like the sword of Damocles. Pressed in a subsequent Q/A to take a stand on this fiscal elephant in the room, Mr. Gore said: "This is the time when we ought to be making some tough choices and reassessing what parts of the plan work and don't work." Far be it from him to offer his own reassessment at a time of national crisis. With or without his wedding ring or beard, the current new Al Gore is the same old Al Gore who fudged tough choices on issues like gun control and the death penalty during the 2000 debates.
As if to complete the picture of Democratic bankruptcy on what is supposed to be its signature issue, the party's chairman, Terry McAuliffe, was sitting in the front row for Mr. Gore's talk. No one is a more brazen role model for pseudo-populist hypocrisy at a time when corporate corruption has undermined fundamental American faith in the integrity of capitalism. Forever decrying the crooks of the dot-com bubble, Mr. McAuliffe has made millions (all legally, of course) from his serial insider's status at two telecom companies, Global Crossing and Telergy (where he was a director). While both subsequently went belly up, costing many Americans their jobs, their retirements or both, he was long gone when those non-insiders took the hit, much as Mr. Bush was at Harken.
In Washington, the main question about such Democratic fecklessness is: How will it play on Nov. 5? Is the economy so bad that despite everything, the party might hold onto the Senate and retake the House? I have no idea, and, I suspect, neither does anyone else in a punditocracy that with near unanimity erroneously predicted a G.O.P. sweep during the impeachment midterms of '98. But we're not in the frivolous 90's any more, and as we hurtle into war a better question might be: Do the Democrats stand for anything other than the next election? 
As Congress prepared to sign off on the war resolution Thursday, Mr. Daschle sounded relieved, predicting that Americans would start brooding over the economy "once we get this question of Iraq behind us." Behind us? Given that he just signed on to a policy that by the C.I.A.'s estimation may increase the likelihood that a ruthless foe will attack us with biological and chemical weapons, you have to wonder just what America he is living in.

HEADLINE: Democrats Try to Refocus On a Domestic Agenda 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Democrats in Congress sought to turn public attention from Iraq to the economy today, saying President Bush must work with them to create more jobs, protect retirement savings and guard against corporate fraud.
 Hours after Congress gave Mr. Bush authorization to use military force to confront Saddam Hussein, Democrats said the president and Republicans on Capitol Hill had failed to offer leadership or new ideas to deal with the loss of jobs in many industries, the flagging stock market and the return of federal budget deficits. 
 At an economic forum on Capitol Hill and in news conferences, Democrats hammered away at Mr. Bush's economic record and sought to draw Republicans into a debate over pocketbook issues that polls suggest are at least as much on the minds of voters as foreign policy concerns are.
In their remarks, Democrats repeatedly drew verbal parallels between the economic challenges facing the country and the threats from terrorism and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
"A year ago, Americans were afraid to open their mail because of anthrax," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader. "Now they're scared to open their mail because they don't want to see what the stock market has done to their college funds and their retirement savings."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader in the House, said, "We will never win the war on terrorism if the economy is weak and falling down."
But beyond calling for an extension of unemployment assistance for workers whose benefits are running out, Democrats were not specific about what steps needed to be taken and did not say whether they would support freezing or rolling back the tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law last year.
Republicans immediately counterattacked, saying the Democrats had no plan of their own and had held up action in the Senate on economic legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House. 
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the House would take up legislation next week that would provide tax breaks for investors and extend unemployment benefits for some workers whose assistance would otherwise run out at the end of the year.
Mr. Thomas said the bill would also open the door to additional benefits for workers in the states with the highest levels of unemployment, and put a moratorium on moves by corporations to tax havens.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
But It's Not the Economy, So Far

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, in the campaign for the 1982 midterm elections, Democrats concentrated on the weakness of the economy and President Ronald Reagan's economic policies, and gained 26 seats in the House of Representatives.
 Ten years ago, Democrats again made a sour economy the focus of the campaign -- "the economy, stupid," was their motto -- and Bill Clinton was elected president. 
 This year, Democrats have returned to the economic well, and the latest opinion polls seem to show that this emphasis should have considerable public appeal. But so far, for a variety of reasons, the Democrats seem not to have gained the traction on the issue they enjoyed in the past. 
"The economy has not yet kicked into effect in these races," said Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter and closely follows races for Congress and governor.
"I ask pollsters about this every day," Mr. Rothenberg continued, "and there's no indication that what appears to be an increase in public concern about the economy and Wall Street is taking on a partisan coloration. The public does not yet, and may not ever, blame the president and his party."
If campaigning on the economy is not yet paying dividends for Democrats, it is not for lack of trying, and they believe that all the attention they are giving the issue will still make a difference on Election Day.
Today the Congressional Democratic leaders, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, tried to draw attention to their cause by staging what they called an economic summit here, a morning-long discussion of topics on the Democratic agenda.
Across the country, Democratic candidates from Erskine B. Bowles, running for the Senate in North Carolina, to Representative David Phelps, in a tough race for re-election in Illinois, to Bill McBride, running for governor of Florida, talk daily about how to create more jobs. Republicans who voted for Nafta are being hammered for supposedly sending jobs abroad. Almost every Democrat who can afford television advertisements is running one on how Republican plans to let workers invest some of their Social Security taxes would have proved disastrous this year with the stock market tanking.
The Democrats are energized by the national opinion polls. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken last week, found that 24 percent of those surveyed say the economy and jobs are the most important problem facing the president and Congress, far more than the 14 percent who cite terrorism, the second most commonly mentioned problem.
Forty-six percent of the respondents said they disapproved of President Bush's handling of the economy, as against 41 percent who said they approved, and 69 percent said they wished the president would pay more attention to the economy.
Why, then, has the economy not taken root as the focal issue of the campaign? One reason, of course, is that talk about the economy has been drowned out by discussions of terrorism and the prospect of war with Iraq. But politicians and those who follow politics closely suggest three other reasons.
Perhaps the most important one is that the economy is not all that bad, at least not compared with the situation in 1982 and 1992. "By most standard measures, the economic downturn has not been acute," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard. 
The boom of the 90's is over for sure, but the unemployment rate last month was just 5.6 percent, a far cry from the 10.1 percent rate in September 1982 and the 7.3 percent rate in September 1992. There is no sign of inflation, interest rates are low, and productivity and personal income are high. 
The most visible manifestation of a bad economy is the plunging stock market. Democrats thought their case might pick up steam when people began getting 401(k) statements this month showing how their retirement funds shrank in the third quarter. Between one-fifth and one-quarter of American adults now have such accounts.
But pension experts say most people who have experienced a big loss in their retirement accounts are upper-income investors sophisticated enough to understand that the stock market is not always strong.
Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits Research Institute, which conducts authoritative studies of pensions, calculated that the average 401(k) portfolio probably shrank by only about 10 percent in the third quarter. People with small retirement funds, he said, probably contributed more money to their accounts in the quarter than they lost from the fall in stock prices, meaning that the sticker shock was not all that great.
In addition, low interest rates have allowed housing prices to rise, improving many families' sense of wealth and permitting many homeowners to put money in their pockets by refinancing their mortgages.
Another reason the economy has not caught on as the main issue in the campaign is that many people who are worried about economic weakness do not blame the president or other Republicans. Polls show that the public mostly blames the terrorist attacks last year and the normal business cycle, said Robert M. Teeter, a veteran Republican pollster.
A third reason is that Democrats have not offered much as an alternative to the policies of Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress.
"Democrats have not unified on a common approach to the economy," said Leon E. Panetta, who was budget director and then White House chief of staff in the Clinton administration. "They've beaten up on Bush, but they're afraid to take on his tax cut. They complain about the deficit, but they haven't said how they would pay for the new programs they want."
This is not to say that the economy will not catch on as an issue before Election Day. Three and a half weeks is a long time. 
Sometimes, said Mr. Teeter, the Republican pollster, "you can look back after the election and see that a slight breeze came through in the last couple of weeks before the election, and it was just enough to move some seats one way or another."
Often, Mr. Teeter said, these swings are caused by something that increases voter turnout for one of the parties. John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, suggested that would be the case this year. "Workers are mobilized like never before," he said. "We think you'll see an increased percentage of voters from union households."
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said this year's election felt to him more like the one in 1986 than those of 1982 and 1992. In 1986, Mr. Garin said, there was a considerable anxiety about the economy that did not take hold until shortly before the election. It was a big reason, he said, that Democrats picked up eight seats in the Senate, enough for them to regain control there.

HEADLINE: Nobel Achievements; 
A Lifetime of Public Service

 BODY:
Jimmy Carter well deserves the Nobel Peace Prize awarded him yesterday. In four years as president and more than twenty as the most active and civic-minded ex-president of modern times, he has contributed substantially to peace, democracy and human rights. Not all of Mr. Carter's peacemaking efforts have succeeded, and his activities have often put him at odds with his successors. His own presidency was complicated by economic tribulations, the Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. But the totality of his career has significantly enhanced the cause of peace. 
 Mr. Carter's presidential years brought the pathbreaking Camp David peace agreement in the Middle East and a human rights policy that saved lives and hastened democracy's return in Latin America. Since losing his 1980 re-election bid to Ronald Reagan, he has energetically sponsored election monitoring around the globe and successfully mediated crises in Haiti and North Korea that might otherwise have exploded into armed conflict. 
 Mr. Carter has set an impressively high standard for what former occupants of the world's most powerful office can do if they have the determination and energy to continue in public service. An ex-president retains enormous international prestige without many of the constraints that limit a sitting president. By recognizing his achievements, the Norwegian Nobel committee encourages other veterans of the presidency, including the fiftysomething Bill Clinton, to reflect on their extraordinary opportunity for further good works.
Mr. Carter has been considered for the Nobel Prize before. One reason he was chosen this year was the selection committee's desire to uphold the idea of a peaceful conflict resolution in what it diplomatically referred to as "a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power." That follows a valuable tradition of using the prize to send a contemporary message, exemplified by such past recipients as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela. The point would have been more eloquently made had the committee chairman, Gunnar Berge, refrained from explicitly interpreting the prize as a criticism of America's current presidential administration. Jimmy Carter's achievements are big enough to stand on their own.

HEADLINE: THE NOBEL AWARD: THE LAUREATE; 
Nobel Peace Prize Awarded To Carter, With Jab at Bush

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: PLAINS, Ga., Oct. 11 

 BODY:
For his peacemaking and humanitarian work over the last 25 years, former President Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today, and the Nobel committee used the occasion to send a sharp rebuke to the Bush administration for its aggressive policy toward Iraq.
 "In a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power," the Nobel citation read, "Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international cooperation based on international law, respect for human rights and economic development." 
 Gunnar Berge, the Nobel committee chairman, was even more direct.
The award "should be interpreted as a criticism of the line that the current administration has taken," Mr. Berge said shortly after the award was announced in Oslo. 
The peace prize often carries a political message, but never before has it been so pointed.
Mr. Carter, beaming in the affection of his hometown today, said he did not bring up the subject of Iraq when President Bush called to congratulate him this morning.
"I feel very strongly about it, yes," said Mr. Carter, who has said the administration should not act unilaterally against Iraq. "But I didn't think it was appropriate to mention it. I haven't spent the last 22 years walking around saying what I would or wouldn't do if I were still president."
Administration officials sought to duck any controversy over the Nobel committee chairman's remarks, saying they were proud Mr. Carter won the award.
The Nobel Peace Prize, which carries a stipend of $1 million, recognizes the 39th president for his "vital contribution" to the Camp David Accords in 1978, his "outstanding commitment to human rights," his work fighting tropical diseases like guinea worm and river blindness and his continuing interest in furthering democracy. On Monday, Mr. Carter, 78, is off to Jamaica to monitor elections.
More than any other ex-president, Mr. Carter, a Democrat and former Georgia governor, has stretched the gravitas and star power of the Oval Office to promote democratic values across the world. Unlike his peers, he never joined corporate boards or went on the lecture circuit.
Instead, with seemingly endless energy and his signature toothy grin, he has trudged up mountains to meet with warlords, cajoled dictators into granting more freedoms and found a second career of "waging peace," as he calls it. Everywhere he goes, so does his wife, Rosalynn, his most trusted confidant.
His activism has not always won praise. Sometimes he goes on missions with the support of the United States government; sometimes not. When he intervened in an escalating dispute between North and South Korea in 1994, he was criticized by President Bill Clinton for getting too chummy with North Korea's dictator.
Mr. Carter, who won the presidency in 1976, does not disagree that he has been a better former president than president, having lost a landslide election to Ronald Reagan in 1980. He is an icon in many Third World countries, especially in Latin America. He has been nominated more than 10 times for the peace prize, although not in 1978, the year Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt won it for signing a treaty Mr. Carter wrote. Officials said they received his nomination too late.
Since then, so many nominations have come and gone, Mr. Carter said, he resigned himself to never winning.
"When I got the call this morning at 4 a.m., I thought it was a joke," Mr. Carter said. "I didn't even know this was the day the prize was announced. I usually follow these things, but this year I wasn't paying attention. And then when I talked to the committee, and realized I really won, I was thrilled."
He said he was accepting the prize on behalf of "suffering people around the world." He plans to use the money for an emergency fund for the Carter Center, the private peace-making foundation that Mr. and Mrs. Carter founded 20 years ago.
"I can't tell you how many times I get a call in the middle of the night and some crisis is about to break out," he said. "Now we'll have the funds to get there."
Friends say though Mr. Carter is driven more by his deeply held Christianity than by prizes or compliments, he had always ached for the Nobel Peace Prize.
"This is terrific," said Robert E. Rubin, former treasury secretary and a fishing buddy of Mr. Carter. "This will take someone who already has a great deal of moral stature and give him even greater stature, which will make him even more effective at what he does."
Douglas Brinkley, a historian who wrote, "The Unfinished Presidency" about Mr. Carter, said this prize will transform the former president's legacy, especially his defeat by Mr. Reagan.
"It's the most important moment for him because in one afternoon by being awarded the Nobel he has wiped the word 'loser' off of his chest," Mr. Brinkley said. "Now he is the Nobel Prize winner and that will be the tag that will stay with him for his remaining years."
Mr. Carter is the third United States president to win the award, after Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. 
He is the second Georgian to win. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King won it in 1964. Mr. Carter has said on many occasions that one of the biggest regrets of his life is that he never met Dr. King, a contemporary. As governor of Georgia, Mr. Carter hung Dr. King's portrait in the state Capitol. 
Mr. Carter's stiffest competition this year came from President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and a handful of Chinese dissidents and United States disarmament experts.
Some of Mr. Carter's biggest accomplishments, the Nobel committee said, were the conflicts he prevented. In 1994, with United States warships steaming toward Haiti, Mr. Carter averted a bloody crisis by convincing a military junta to leave.
He also brokered a truce in Bosnia that year and has negotiated at length with warring groups in the Sudan. He made news this spring by visiting Cuba and publicly scolding President Fidel Castro.
"When he was president, he refused to play the insider Washington game and did things on his own," Mr. Brinkley said. "So in a sense this achievement is a result of the very same character traits that doomed him politically."
In Plains, the peanut farm town where Mr. Carter grew up and started his political career, Main Street was shut down today for a ceremony and the residents -- all 637 -- were cordially invited. It was Jimmy Carter's day -- though it's almost always like that here.
There were farmers in straw hats, fanning themselves with Nobel Prize programs. And banners that read "Congratulations Jimmy! We love you!" And lots of hugs and "Way to go, man!"
It did not take long after Mr. Carter received the call from Oslo for word to spread in Plains, where Mr. Carter and his wife live.
Craig Walters, an elementary school teacher here, said his father called him at 8 a.m.
"My daddy was yelling at me 'Get up! Get dressed! Get downtown! Jimmy won a Nobel!' "
Though still busy writing books, hammering houses together with Habitat for Humanity, fund-raising, chairing election-reform meetings, and making chairs (he is a wood-working addict), Mr. Carter is slowing down. A quiet search for a successor is taking place at the Carter Center, which has headquarters in Atlanta and projects in 65 countries.
"I see the end of my active life coming in the next few months or years," Mr. Carter said today.
"But I have to tell you, these years are among some of the most gratifying of my life," he added, his eyes brightening. "I have complete independence. I have access to world leaders. I can go anywhere I want at moment's notice."
And, as a very visible ex-president, he can still create a stir.
Today, when asked his position on Iraq, Mr. Carter said he would not have voted for the resolution passed in the Senate, authorizing the president to use force.
At a media briefing later, White House officials tried to play down the criticism from Mr. Carter and the Nobel chairman. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush began his day with a 7 a.m. phone call congratulating Mr. Carter, and added: "The president thinks this is a great day for Jimmy Carter; that's what he's going to focus on."
At that, the veteran White House correspondent, Helen Thomas, who covered Mr. Carter in office, asked: "Isn't it a great day for the American people? And did Carter express to the president his well-known opposition to a war against Iraq?"
Mr. Fleischer replied: "I can just tell you, Helen, it was friendly call. It was a short call. And the purpose of the call was to congratulate him on the winning of the Nobel Peace Prize."

Since losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Carter has continued to campaign for world peace and human rights worldwide: 1982: In cooperation with Emory University in Atlanta, founds the Carter Center, a research group that seeks to promote peace and human rights, resolve conflicts, foster democracy and fight hunger and disease. 1984: Begins work with Habitat for Humanity, leading a group to the Lower East Side of New York City to help renovate a 6-story building with 19 families in need of affordable shelter. He and his wife, Rosalynn, have volunteered one week of work with Habitat every year since. 1989: Seeks to settle the long civil war between the Ethiopian central government in Addis Ababa and Eritrean rebels. He says at the time: "It would be foolish to be too optimistic. This is an ancient animosity, and there is a great deal of hatred on both sides. But both have their reasons for wanting a settlement, and it surely signifies something that they are both willing to sit down." 1994: Meets with North Korean President Kim Il Sung in an attempt to resolve a crisis over that nation's suspected nuclear weapons program. Reports that North Korea is willing to allow two United Nations inspectors and their equipment to remain at a disputed nuclear site. 1994: Negotiate a four-month cease fire in Sarajevo, Bosnia, between leaders of the Muslim-led Bosnian government and their Bosnian Serb enemies in a civil war in the former Yugoslavia. 1995: Brokers a deal between Sudan and Uganda, neighbors and longtime enemies, that leads to an accord not to support rebel groups working to overthrow each other's governments. The deal was brokered in Kenya by Mr. Carter in 1995. 1997: Goes to Liberia, the African nation founded by freed American slaves, to help monitor what is hoped would be its first free and fair election. Over the years, he also participates in election monitoring in Panama, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Venezuela and East Timor. MAY 2002: Becomes the first sitting or former president to visit Cuba since Fidel Castro took power. In an address to the Cuban people broadcast live on television across the nation, he calls on Mr. Castro to allow a referendum to bring broad reforms in political rights and castigates the socialist system for denying basic freedoms.

HEADLINE: Old or New? Debate Rages Over Transit Downtown 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI and RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
At an exuberant news conference in August overlooking the World Trade Center site, federal, state and city officials announced that $4.55 billion had been set aside for transit in Lower Manhattan -- one of the biggest single sums ever available for city transportation and enough, officials assured, to remake a crucial part of the system.
 But only two months later, a pitched battle over the money is already being waged behind the scenes, fueled by a debate that many say could determine the future of downtown: Should the money be spent only to improve the transit lines already there? Or should it also be used to bring in new train service, for the first time making downtown as accessible to suburban commuters as Midtown has always been? 
 The idea of extending commuter rail service into Lower Manhattan first emerged last winter, championed by a group of powerful downtown landlords, and it was largely viewed as an expensive pipe dream. But the dream has remained very much on the table, gaining political support and becoming a divisive reminder that, in a crowded city with ever-growing transit demands, $4.55 billion does not seem like so much money after all. 
Proponents of new rail service, including the state's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, and Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, say they believe that downtown may recover but that it will not remain one of the world's financial capitals without better connections to the rest of the region and to Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports.
But critics of the plan, including some top state officials and many within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority itself, say that the cost of a new downtown rail line -- estimates range from $1.9 billion to more than $5 billion -- far outweighs its benefits, especially now, when the city is looking for money for several other huge, long-needed transit projects, like the Second Avenue subway and bringing the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal.
So far, the fight has remained largely out of the public view, but there are widespread worries that it is growing and portends the kind of bitter divisions that led to the decade-long fight over Westway, a 1970's plan to submerge a six-lane highway under hundreds of acres of parkland and development along the West Side waterfront. It ultimately failed.
"The danger is that we end up in a traditional New York blood vendetta instead of a rational discussion," said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent urban policy group. "We could end up with nothing if we get bogged down in that kind of warfare."
Ultimately, Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the authority and is a central figure at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, will play the biggest part in settling the debate. But, characteristically, he has avoided the issue, leaving it, for now, in the hands of the transit authority, which has tried to dismiss it but has been unable to make it go away and is now actually involved with landlords in studying the proposal.
"I think it's a great idea," said Peter J. Kalikow, chairman of the transit agency. "But I don't know, in terms of dollars and benefits, whether it's a good thing to do now. When we do a project like that we think about bang for the buck: does it serve enough people to make it something we want to expend scarce capital on?"
Almost immediately after the World Trade Center attack, real estate forces, transit advocates and public officials all understood that a historic moment was at hand to fix many longstanding problems with Lower Manhattan transportation.
Simply rebuilding what had been destroyed -- the 1 and 9 subway line, for example, which reopened last month -- was relatively easy, because insurance money was available for those projects. But moving beyond that, to untangle and rethink the transit system, quickly began to prove much harder.
Over the last few months a long list of proposals was whittled down and a consensus began to build around a few: to create an underground concourse that would ease transfers between subway and PATH lines; to rebuild the PATH terminal and the Fulton Street subway complex, creating a kind of downtown transit hub; to rebuild the antiquated South Ferry subway station and dig a tunnel along Rector Street to connect two subway stations on that street.
But at the same time, huge forces -- the Alliance for Downtown New York and John E. Zuccotti, chairman of Brookfield Financial Properties, the largest downtown landlord -- were building support for a plan to bring the Long Island Rail Road from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan, which would require building an expensive tunnel under the East River or using existing subway tracks.
Lower Manhattan is the third-largest business district in the country, behind Midtown and Chicago. But for decades, businesses have migrated to Midtown, where Grand Central and Pennsylvania Station provided easy access to Westchester County, New Jersey and Long Island.
The only way to stem the trend, says Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance, is to build transit lines to Long Island and the international airports. Mr. Zuccotti, for one, is especially concerned about Merrill Lynch, his largest tenant, whose lease expires in 2008.
"If the goal of Lower Manhattan's revitalization is to secure and enhance its role as a world-class business center," Mr. Weisbrod said, "then commuter rail and airport access must be the highest priority."
Transportation advocates and top transit officials complained that the railroad proposal might benefit 25,000 Long Island executives who work downtown, but it could inconvenience more than 100,000 subway riders.
But Mr. Zuccotti and his allies have persisted, devising a complex plan known as a super shuttle. It involves running a subway train on Long Island Rail Road tracks that stretch between the Atlantic Avenue terminal in downtown Brooklyn and the train station in Jamaica, Queens, which will also have light-rail connections to Kennedy Airport.
The super shuttle would run nonstop into Brooklyn and would switch onto the A and C subway lines before reaching Jay Street, the shuttle's sole stop in Brooklyn. After entering Manhattan, the super shuttle would descend from the A line into a new tunnel that would take it directly to the World Trade Center area.
But this would require rerouting the C line onto the F line in downtown Brooklyn, for the trip into Manhattan. The C would then rejoin its old route after the West Fourth Street station.
Critics say that there is a huge problem with this plan: the cost, which could eat up most or all of the available transportation money.
"There are people downtown for whom this L.I.R.R. issue is so consuming that they could dispense with all the other projects and it would be O.K. with them," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign.
The only way to bring a new rail line downtown, he and others say, is through a new tunnel under the East River. But if there is anything that both sides agree on, it is that there will probably never be enough money to do that.
"If we have to wait to build a tunnel, we'll all be dead by the time it happens," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce.
In just one example of the contentiousness of the debate, Senator Schumer recently came under withering attack from some of his own allies when he took the side of the new-rail proponents. He complained publicly that spending an estimated $700 million on the South Ferry subway station and Rector Street would undermine more ambitious efforts to remake downtown.
"We need what I like to call a grand Grand Central Terminal down there, and part and parcel of that is having all the train lines come there," Mr. Schumer said. "I was worried it would get cannibalized and so I decided to make my point, that we had to think large down there."
The debate continues to build, with widely differing predictions of success. A senior city official said that commuter rail and airport access to downtown are ideas "rising on the charts" politically. "In terms of changing the basic nature of Lower Manhattan," the official said, "there is probably nothing more important."
But some top state officials take a much more jaundiced view. "There's nothing wrong with it," one said. "But when the triage starts, what makes the cut?"

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "World Trade Center Station?"An ambitious plan to improve transportation to the financial district has begun to be seriously discussed. Using a combination of Long Island Rail Road and subway tracks, a "super shuttle" link from Jamaica, in Queens, to the World Trade Center site would aid in keeping the district vital. Elements and the route of this plan are shown below. Because there would not be enough room for all the trains in one subway tunnel, the C train would be rerouted along the F line from the Jay Street-Borough Hall station to the West Fourth Street station. A connecting train tunnel would be created off the subway line near Fulton Street to the World Trade Center area. Underneath Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn, between Atlantic Avenue and Fulton Street, a splice between the subway and the L.I.R.R. commuter line would be built.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: UNITED NATIONS; 
IRAQ BACKS AWAY FROM U.N. DEMAND TO SET ARMS TERMS

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Iraq, ignoring rising global pressure for thorough inspections of its weapons programs, has backed away from agreements reached last week on minimum conditions for the inspectors to carry out their work, diplomats said today.
 In a letter that became public today, Iraq did not meet a specific request to confirm agreements it made last week in Vienna with Hans Blix, the leader of the United Nations weapons inspection team. Instead, Iraq insisted on further discussions of even basic logistical arrangements. 
 Diplomats said the Iraqi rebuff had irritated France and Russia, veto-bearing members of the Security Council that have been resisting Washington's demand for immediate authorization to begin a military attack if the weapons inspections fail. 
While Iraqi diplomats here continued to insist that they were in "100 percent accordance" with the inspections, American officials said the latest Iraqi move showed President Saddam Hussein's reluctance to cooperate with a probing search for his weapons of mass destruction. 
"We are not surprised that once again the Iraqis want to delay and deceive," said Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for John D. Negroponte, the American ambassador to the United Nations. "We've had 16 resolutions and 11 years of playing this game, and it's time the Security Council takes action."
The Iraqi letter gave unexpected help to Washington's campaign for a new resolution to force Iraq to allow aggressive inspections, after Congress gave President Bush the authority to go to war if Iraq does not give up its most lethal weapons to the United Nations. Excerpts from the letter, Page A12. 
Despite sharp differences over the terms of a new resolution, all 15 Council nations are united in wanting in-depth inspections that can turn up any prohibited weapons programs in Iraq. The new resolution is certain to require far more aggressive weapons inspections than current ones, which are still guiding Mr. Blix's work.
Mr. Blix has repeatedly said the Vienna talks were to define practical procedures so there would be no disputes with Iraq once the inspections got under way. The negotiations Iraq proposed in its response appeared to be laying the ground for the kind of squabbles that slowed inspectors in the past, before they were pulled out in 1998, and which Mr. Blix hoped to avoid. Mr. Blix did not respond to requests for comment today.
The Oct. 10 letter, from Amir Hammudi al-Saadi, an adviser to the Iraqi leader, was a reply to a letter two days earlier from Mr. Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which handles nuclear inspections. 
The two directors had laid out in writing what they understood to be the agreements they had reached with Iraqi officials last week, which covered basic terms like the number of inspectors, the conditions for interviews of Iraqi officials and other practical matters. They asked Iraq to confirm the agreements.
Iraq said it was ready to receive an advance team of inspectors on Oct. 19. But it did not provide the confirmation of the letter that Mr. Blix sought, agreeing only to comments he and Mr. ElBaradei made in a news conference after the Vienna talks and to notes Mr. Blix used when he reported to the Security Council on Oct. 3. The Iraqi official said other problems "that might stand in the way of our future work" would be resolved through "consultations."
Iraq also said its offer for full access for the inspectors applied only to United Nations measures "previously in place," meaning that it did not agree to open Mr. Hussein's eight presidential compounds to unannounced inspections, as the United States and Britain have demanded.
Iraq repeated a suggestion it made in Vienna that the United Nations should pay for the security and other services the government will provide to the inspectors, reversing past practice, when Iraq paid the bill. Mr. Saadi said this was not a condition.
In terms that revealed the abyss that has opened between President Hussein and the Security Council, the letter also called for the United Nations to move toward lifting its severe economic sanctions on Iraq. That possibility is so remote at this point that the Council is not discussing it.
Although officials in Washington said the action would shift to the United Nations on Saturday, there was little progress on the draft resolution that the United States and Britain have proposed, as diplomats continued to talk behind scenes looking for compromise.
The United States and Britain want one resolution with rigorous inspections and a trigger for military action if Iraq does not cooperate. France has proposed two stages, leaving the authorization of force to a second Council vote.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also said today that he would not support mentiono of the use of force in a resolution. Mr. Putin spoke in Moscow before Russia's representatives at the United Nations had received the Iraqi letter. 
Before he received his copy, Secretary General Kofi Annan, speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., said he believed the Council was leaning toward the French position.
"I think the member states want a two-stage approach: send in the inspectors. If they get in trouble, come back, and we will pass a second resolution," Mr. Annan said.
In response to a furor raised by his comments, Mr. Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said he was not endorsing any position but only describing the state of play here. He said Mr. Annan was following the intense debate but was keeping a low profile and did not want to become part of it.
"His head is down, but his hand is in," Mr. Eckhard said.
The Iraqi ambassador, Mohammed A. Aldouri, said after meeting with Arab nations here today that the inspectors would be welcomed in Iraq. "We are in 100 percent accordance," he said, referring to what Mr. Blix told the Security Council. He did not mention Mr. Blix's letter.
The Arab nations said they saw no need for any new resolution from the Council.
"I think there is no need to jump to conclusions about the inspections," said Yahia Mahmassani, the Arab League representative, "and into preparation of war that will only engulf the Middle East in violence."

 EXTRAVAGANCE
By Gary Krist.
291 pp. New York:
Broadway Books. $24.
 IN rising stock markets, the world is forever new. The bull has eyes only for the future, where fountains of revenue play in his imagination, and he seeks to enjoy them in the discounted present. In falling markets, there is nothing that hasn't happened before. The bear sees only the past, which imprisons the present in endless cycles of boom and bust and boom again. 
Bulls don't read books. Bears read history. As markets turn down, American and British publishers dust off the old titles on the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the British South Sea Bubble of 1720, the railway speculation of the 1840's, J. K. Galbraith's "Great Crash, 1929" and Charles Mackay's "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" (a book whose excellence, alas, is confined to its title). 
For the bulls, that is so much time wasted. "History," as a character in Gary Krist's "Extravagance" puts it, "is for losers." Krist, like all imaginative writers, is a bear. The novelty of his novel is that it tells an identical financial story in two cities at different epochs. The first is the New York of the dot-com boom of the 1990's, where the marriage of telecommunications and computing has created a new commercial territory in the ether, cut free of the tedious and pettifogging limits of the earth-bound economy. The second is the London of the 1690's, where paper money, public debt and new trading territories in the East and West Indies have combined in a wild euphoria. There is a mania for "projects" (or initial public offerings). A new social class -- the "money'd men" -- draws its wealth and power not from land or inheritance but from money itself. This "financial revolution," as it has been called in Britain, inaugurates two centuries of British hegemony in world trade and the laissez-faire ideologies of both Britain and the United States. 
In both of Krist's stories, William Tobias Merrick, a pleasant and ambitious young man from the country, travels to the metropolis determined to make his fortune not from tangible commodities but from the newfangled money markets. He stays with his uncle, Gilbert Hawking, a traditional businessman who is just becoming aware of the horizons opening around him. Will falls in with Benjamin Fletcher, who is developing a new technique that will transform the way commerce is conducted, and his beautiful and spirited sister, Eliza. He goes to work for Theodore Witherspoon, a broker eager to bring Benjamin Fletcher's idea to the stock market and make his killing. 
Krist's program at first produces some striking literary effects. One sees congruences between Exeter, England, and Bloomington, Ind.; 'Change Alley and Wall Street; Fletcher's new winch for unloading seagoing vessels and his Internet switching system. The two cities and periods alternate like stripes in a shirt. Everything proceeds with great brio and good humor. 
Yet as the story progresses, Krist becomes entangled in the complexities of modern finance. He is obliged to devote more and more space to the intricacies of his Internet I.P.O. The balance is upset. The 17th-century story loses its narrative autonomy. Old London ceases in any way to illuminate or comment on new New York.
The congruences are no longer opportunities but restrictions. The writing becomes slapdash. We come on words and phrases unknown to the 1690's, such as methodology, daily basis, appreciative power, amicable acquisition. People dine at 8 p.m. (instead of in the early afternoon) off mahogany (a Caribbean wood used for furniture in England only in the next generation). They carry umbrellas (in use only from two generations after that) and smoke cigars (two generations later still). 
That may sound like quibbling, but it isn't. Writing historical pastiche is not as difficult as it looks. Like walking a tightrope, it requires concentration and not a single mistake. At times, Krist sails close to abandoning his program, or rather, to going after comic anachronism, in which old-time characters suddenly display modern attributes for a laugh. It is one of the cheapest effects in the locker, best left to the Disney company.
The classic financial novels, like Dickens's "Dombey and Son," Balzac's "Pere Goriot" and Thomas Mann's "Buddenbrooks," attract the reader through the force of their actors' personalities and only then, as it were, go for the money. In the greatest American novel of finance, "The Great Gatsby," the Roaring Twenties sound only intermittently, like the ocean on a distant beach. Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities" set itself firmly on Wall Street but only after constructing some very detailed social milieus. There is something of social value (for New Yorkers, at least) that Wolfe's Masters of the Universe can lose.
Gary Krist apparently realized too late that he had not dealt himself much of a hand of characters. Eliza, in both her 20th- and 17th-century avatars, is as interesting as the character played by Daryl Hannah in the film "Wall Street." That will sound intolerably harsh, but American Eliza really does plan to open a chain of socially responsible restaurants. In their languid peregrinations round Manhattan locations, from Lincoln Center to a snobbish Japanese restaurant and a rave club, William and Eliza strike no sparks. 
English Eliza is quite unhistorical and Krist knows it, but his literary program has tied his hands. At times, he sounds desperate: "Imagine an unmarried woman of family allowing herself to be seen at taverns and eating-houses all about the town. Some would say 'twas sure sign of a wanton nature." Indeed. Meanwhile, both Williams are robbing both Gilbert Hawkings of their money but not one of the four has been equipped with any moral character, so why should the reader care? Anyway, there is nothing worth buying in either Krist's London or his New York. 
The result is that "Extravagance," for all its cleverness and good nature, makes rather a mild impression.

 THE BLANK SLATE
The Modern Denial of Human Nature.
By Steven Pinker.
Illustrated. 509 pp. New York:
Viking. $27.95.
 John Watson, the founder in the 1920's of behavioristic psychology, boasted that if he were given an infant at random, he could train him "to become any type of specialist I might select -- doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations and race of his ancestors." His dismissal of anything inborn but a few raw feelings harked back to the philosophical empiricism of John Locke, who denied that the human mind came equipped with innate ideas; mind was a tabula rasa, a blank slate on which experience of the world would write messages. Watson's kind of behaviorism, amended by B. F. Skinner, dominated American psychology in the first half of the 20th century. The scientific community's reaction to the racism of the Nazis reinforced the doctrine; and events during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam years cautioned even evolutionary biologists about supposing that humans had been subjected to the kinds of forces that mold animal mind and behavior. 
The logic of evolutionary theory, however, seemed inexorable. Humans are, after all, animals. No magic moment occurs when souls rain down on waiting primate bodies to wash away all signs of brute origin. In the 70's, E. O. Wilson developed this logic with the support of a wide range of animal studies and anthropological reports about societies still following traditional ways. On this foundation, he constructed sociobiology, which sought to explain basic human social behaviors and mental traits largely as preprogrammed products of evolutionary history. Mating preferences, emotional patterns, intelligence, even religious convictions became scientifically explicable. 
The counterreaction was swift. The biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin and the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins discovered more right-wing politics than sound science lifting sociobiology to prominence. Wilson became the target of harsh critical scrutiny and personal attack. Nonetheless, studies in the evolutionary understanding of human nature have proliferated, spawning the various theories that form the subdiscipline of evolutionary psychology. Much of the still acrimonious dispute has congealed into this: Is the mind initially blank, only scribbled on after birth by experience? Or does it also contain lessons already written by ancient genes? 
In "The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature," Steven Pinker -- a psychologist at M.I.T. and author of several popular books on cognition and linguistics -- attempts to shatter contemporary versions of the blank slate. To this polemical task he brings an arsenal of scientific research, acute analysis and pugnacious attitude. Bubbling beneath an affable charm, strong passions, apparently simmering since graduate school, give some of his arguments a bitter aftertaste. 
Pinker sees human nature as largely inscribed by indelible genes. He marshals evidence from empirical studies showing, for instance, that individuals living in disparate cultures display the same repertory of emotional expressions. Angry scowls, happy smiles, the arched eyebrow of disbelief, the wrinkled brow of perplexity and scores of other facial signs are universal. They cannot have arisen from a common cultural heritage but must, Pinker argues, stem from the genetic heritage of a small group of humans that left Africa about 100,000 years ago and slowly populated all regions of the world.
Developmental linguistics furnishes him a perspective from which to extend his vision of human nature. Of signal importance is Noam Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, of which the grammars of empirical languages are instances. The theory suggests that this deep grammar lies embedded in genetically determined brain structures, which form our syntactical abilities. The language of young children, for example, reveals grammatical regularities that could not be derived from the speech of parents, but must, it would seem, have been genetically preprogrammed. Pinker proposes that mental categories of this kind shape all of our experience. From birth, the brain begins to organize experience into meaningful patterns whose structures are most easily explained as the results of natural selection having operated on the brains of our Pleistocene ancestors. Experiments, for instance, show that infants as young as 9 months begin reliably to interpret certain behaviors as intentional (e.g., pointing). Of course, those protohumans who failed to become adept at reading the intentions of others were quickly shoved into oblivion. 
Pinker is mindful that environmental infusion is necessary to activate or realize every biological trait. Evolution produces dispositions that expect, as it were, a certain range of experience. From the point of view of modern biology, this principle of gene-environment codependence has a perfectly pedestrian ring. What keeps the sides at war remains: With a given trait, how much can be attributed to genes and how much to environment? And is it even meaningful to attempt to answer this question? Pinker concedes that many experimental studies suggest a surprisingly plastic cerebral cortex, but he short-circuits the implications of this admission by relocating most hard wiring to the midbrain, from which basic emotional patterns stem. Yet one would have thought that the evolutionary acquisitions making us specifically human have a primary locus in the cortex -- high intelligence and language, for instance. 
Many battles of the science wars that Pinker re-enacts were fought over the degree of genetic determination of intelligence. He contends that individual differences in intelligence have a strong genetic component, though he is vague about how strong, citing a wide range of values. He does allow that most intellectual differences among races are probably due to unequal experience, but maintains that cognitive traits distinguishing the sexes well up from the genes. In his discussions of intelligence, two salient questions remain unexplored: Is intelligence a single trait that can be simply measured? And, if we could gauge it reliably, can we sensibly parcel out its genetic and experiential components? Any test calibrated on Newton's genius would surely consign Darwin to the country parsonage he once contemplated. While techniques exist for estimating the heritable component of differences in intelligence, geneticists like Lewontin conclude that only the befuddled would attempt this. Gene-environment interaction is dynamic, and the components only artificially separable. The experience that evoked Darwin's genius would merely have made Newton seasick. Genes count, but differently in different environments. Moreover, the brain's neural construction is far too complex to be genetically preplanned in any detail; so early experience and chance must sculpture the synaptic connections in the developing infant. Recent studies indicate that young children whose mothers constantly talk to them show marked improvements in grammar and vocabulary later on, while children deprived of the experience of language in early years never learn to use it adequately despite any program sealed in their genes. 
Pinker sometimes mentions objections like these, but flicks them away or drowns out their significance in the monotone mantra of the genes. He focuses on "dirty tricks" and political biases of leftish scientists who reject his genetic version of human nature. He charges Lewontin with using a "doctored" quotation from an opponent (careless, inconsequential misquotation, it seems to me) and derides Gould's Marxism -- which most biologists take to be faux Marxism that merely adds rhetorical flourish to serious ideas. He is somewhat less irritated by neoconservatives like Irving Kristol, Leon Kass and Tom Wolfe, since their metaphysics has no sting. 
Pinker's fundamental argument depends on theoretical suppositions that require closer inspection, but he confidently rests on this unstable platform what he considers the prescient conceptions of the likes of Thomas Hobbes, Milton Friedman and Richard Posner. Thus Hobbes believed that cooperative impulses of individuals would succumb to innate aggressiveness and selfishness were not those softer inclinations steeled by the deterrent force of the state. And today free markets have turned private vices into public virtues. Pinker urges that an appreciation of a genetically fixed human nature will serve even in the arts, exposing there the bareness of both the modernist and the postmodern aesthetic. (Yeats, Eliot and Borges, it seems, are missing from reading lists at M.I.T.) With the triumph of evolutionary theory, Pinker sees a new scientific, cultural and political alignment near, one that accepts a more constrained conception of human nature and adopts corresponding social and economic policies, but does not neglect the genetically less endowed -- in short, a compassionate conservatism.

HEADLINE: Sexuality and the City 

BYLINE:  By Maria Russo; Maria Russo is an editor at The New York Observer.

 BODY:
 REREADING SEX
Battles Over Sexual Knowledge and
Suppression in Nineteenth-Century America.
By Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz.
Illustrated. 514 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
 The only misleading element of Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz's fine new study of the debates over sexual knowledge in 19th-century America is its title, "Rereading Sex." Besides making the book sound like the product of an academic panel, it might also give the impression that Horowitz has something new to say about our ancestors' sexual practices. She doesn't. Putting aside the necessarily speculative question of what actually went on in American bedrooms, Horowitz focuses instead on what people wrote and read about sex -- and what they believed other people should be allowed to write and read. Horowitz, a professor of American studies at Smith College, is a curious but sober-minded investigator of the past, and in "Rereading Sex" she presents a careful explication and analysis of evidence gathered from books and periodicals as well as transcripts of court cases.
Horowitz finds that her subjects did not have one unified understanding of human sexuality but rather "contending conversations," the result of a society "split along many lines, economic, religious and ideological." Her book is therefore not only the latest corrective to the notion that there was some monolithic "Victorian sexuality"; it also rejects the approach to studying the history of sexuality established by Michel Foucault, who suggested that what people said about sex had some "seamless" relation to how they practiced it. "I perceive more disjuncture and internal conflict," Horowitz writes. To that end, she has established four "frameworks," within which people could imagine sexuality "from a distinct cultural perspective." These competing frameworks -- a vernacular tradition rooted in oral culture; an evangelical Christianity suspicious of sex; a "reform physiology" committed to spreading accurate information about sexual functioning, including birth control; and a view that "placed sex at the center of life," and whose proponents ranged from Mormons to women's rights leaders -- became the basis of furious debates, scandals, witch hunts and crusades. 
It's telling that the Puritan minister Jonathan Edwards emerges here as one of the more reasonable public figures to have weighed in on the regulation of sexual material. Horowitz recounts an inquiry Edwards made in 1744 into a book called "Aristotle's Master-piece," a guide to reproduction and sexual matters that was a hodgepodge of "scientific" explanations and semi-bawdy verse. The book had made its way into New England homes, and when two young men were accused of mocking young women with knowledge about the female body that had come from the book, Edwards called on the men to testify before the church. But as Horowitz notes, his outrage was not at the impropriety of the book itself but its role in causing disruptive behavior. He never questioned the right of women and physicians to own the book, and he was satisfied with the men's public apology.
Edwards's task was made easier by the fact that he lived before widespread literacy and the easy mass production and distribution of printed matter, which in the 19th century flooded cities with books and periodicals that dealt frankly with sex. A new population of young men living on their own in cities provided a ready audience. Most troubling for many was the appearance of fiction specifically "designed for repeated male sexual arousal," and by the early 19th century the courts had taken over from the churches as the forum for dealing with the problem. The American quest to define, criminalize and punish obscenity had begun.
An obsession with masturbation, Horowitz shows, became a guiding force behind obscenity law. In Europe, scientists had linked masturbation to insanity. Male orgasm itself began to be characterized, in ominous tones, as a fearsome, physically debilitating event. Crackpot theories abounded about the benefits of controlling or, even better, avoiding it altogether, even for married men. 
In New York City, meanwhile, a new "sporting" culture emerged on the streets. Jovial packs of young men wandered the city drinking, taking in cockfights and bare-knuckle prizefights and patronizing the city's hundreds of brothels. Horowitz recounts this phenomenon in fascinating detail by probing the "racy" press that emerged in the early 1840's. These cheap, lively newspapers tried to avoid obscenity laws by winkingly reporting on the doings of prostitutes and abortionists in a tone of moral outrage, and for years they mostly got away with it.
Perhaps the most interesting figures to appear on competing sides of the 19th-century sex wars were Victoria Woodhull and Anthony Comstock, and Horowitz devotes ample space to each of them. The charismatic Woodhull became a presidential candidate and gained celebrity for advocating women's rights along with an unfettered, unsentimental "free love" and sexual independence for both sexes. Comstock, on the other hand, was a religious man with a dislike of all forms of sexual expression, and he made his way through churches and Y.M.C.A. groups. Beginning with a campaign against bookstores that sold "obscene" books, Comstock successfully lobbied Congress for passage of an anti-obscenity bill, with Woodhull as a prime target. His appointment in 1873 to the newly created position of "special agent" of the United States post office kicked off an era in which the "Comstock law" was used to arrest everyone from publishers of erotic literature to doctors who mailed birth control information, as the definition of obscenity broadened to include anything that might "deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort might fall" -- in other words, just about anything with any sexual meaning whatsoever. Horowitz's study ends as Comstock's hamstrung opponents are starting to organize the movement to counter the new legal stranglehold.
Horowitz is a lucid writer but not a stylish one, and there are stretches where "Rereading Sex" is more of a chore than it should be. But my only real disappointment is that Horowitz gives such a sketchy sense of what her research has led her to think about the ways in which these 19th-century culture battles "still reverberate in our ears." Horowitz is a rigorous and supple thinker on inflammatory issues. How does she feel about abortion "gag rules" and parental notification laws, or about feminist calls to prosecute pornographers? Hers would be a welcome voice in these conversations.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, at 89th Street and Riverside Drive; 
A 1902 Memorial to the Fallen of the Civil War

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IT took nearly a decade to build the white marble Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, at 89th Street and Riverside Drive. Locations had been suggested all over Manhattan by those eager to have the monument in their neighborhoods -- and by those who weren't.
 Earlier this year an anonymous donor suggested expanding the monument's formal plaza farther south, replacing old blacktop and benches. The Parks Department liked the idea, but after objections from the New York City Art Commission, the donor withdrew his offer, and the department now says that the proposal will have to wait. 
 New York had no serious plans for a Civil War memorial until 1893, when a Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Association was formed. It proposed a triumphal arch at Grand Army Plaza, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, one of New York's most prominent open spaces. But the Grand Army Plaza site was opposed by the Federation of Fine Arts, an organization representing most of the art groups in the city. It said that the monument would be dwarfed by the growing collection of tall hotels there and proposed instead 72nd Street and Riverside Drive. 
More parochial interests soon came into play. East Side interests vied to have the monument at Grand Army Plaza, while a group of West Siders, eager for the Riverside Drive site, said that the plaza site was unbuildable and that water would be struck in excavating for the foundations. 
More than 20 meetings were held in 1896 and 1897 to try to choose a site, and other solutions were proposed, among them the triangle between 22nd and 23rd Streets and Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Naval officers did not like the Grand Army Plaza idea because it was not within sight of water, a matter of little importance to Army veterans, who preferred the Fifth Avenue location. 
The Monument Association still sought the Fifth Avenue location, while the newly established Art Commission, created to review the design of works of art built on public land, opposed it. 
The Art Commission finally ruled decisively against the site in 1897, and Sherman Square, Abingdon Square, Union Square, the Battery and the northeast corner of Central Park were all proposed. 
Things finally seemed to be moving in 1899 when the Monument Association and the Department of Parks agreed to a site for the memorial atop Mount Tom, a round, rocky outcrop in Riverside Park near 83rd Street. But then developers erected several apartment houses near the corner, an act that The New York Times said would give the monument "an insignificant appearance." There was also a protest against building on top of a natural feature. 
In late 1899 the Monument Association agreed to relocate the memorial farther north, to a modest plateau at 89th Street and Riverside Drive. The architects Stoughton & Stoughton designed a great drum surrounded by 12 Corinthian columns, set on a complex series of plazas connected by terraces and walkways. 
The last obstacle was Elizabeth Clark, owner of the Dakota at 72nd Street and Central Park West and other West Side properties, who was building a grand Beaux-Arts-style mansion at the northeast corner of 89th and Riverside. In 1900, Mrs. Clark -- the widowed daughter-in-law of Edward Clark, the Dakota's builder -- got a temporary injunction against the monument, claiming in court papers that it would "interfere with the flow of light and air and obstruct the view" and that it was "unsightly and inartistic." She lost the case in mid-1900, and work went ahead. 
At that time the plans called for a grand staircase descending to a water gate on the Hudson and, south of the flagpole plaza at 89th Street, a long approach with a battlemented retaining wall along the park. 
It was not until Memorial Day in 1902 that the $250,000 monument was dedicated. Mrs. Clark, the former opponent, patriotically decorated her house with flags and bunting. Mayor Seth Low said at the ceremony, "The memories that hover around it already clothe it with a light that makes it sacred to the eye." 
The stairway to the river was not built, nor was the battlemented wall to the south. Photographs of the period are not completely clear, but it appears that the area south of the plaza was simply paved, or perhaps treated with pebbles. 
PERIOD accounts indicate that the heavily sculptured bronze door at the base of the monument, now kept locked, was open to visitors. The interior was completely finished, with white marble walls and a mosaic floor underneath a dome. 
The biggest change to the monument took place in the 1930's, when the plaza's yellow brick, which contrasted so well with the white marble trim, was replaced with the orange-colored stone common to Parks Department projects of the period. 
The monument is one of New York's best works of the turn-of-the-20th-century City Beautiful movement. But it is marred by the scruffy appearance of the area just south of the stone plaza, which looks as if it might be the parking lot of a factory abandoned years ago. The binder of the plain black asphalt -- which apparently replaced the original paving -- has come out, leaving the approach to the monument an irregular, undulating surface of black gravel, relieved by occasional tree stumps and benches, a fitting complement to the line of parked cars along Riverside Drive that crowd the monument on the east.
Earlier this year the Parks Department, backed by the offer from the anonymous donor, began to seek approvals for rebuilding the plaza at the south. Adrian Benepe, the department's commissioner, said that it had proposed "a modern interpretation of a formal design," replacing the deteriorated asphalt with granite pavers in a pattern echoing the 1902 plaza. 
The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the proposal with some modifications. But Landmark West, a neighborhood preservation group, opposed the design. 
"The design blurs the intentional, sharp distinction between the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and its historically naturalistic setting in Riverside Park," said Kate Wood, the executive director. She said that the expansion of the plaza in formal materials and design would dilute the character of the monument itself. Her group favors the softer, less formal treatment of 1902, although it appears that that choice may have been made purely for economic reasons. 
The Art Commission also objected to the design. Lark Anton, a commission spokeswoman, declined to give the agency's reasons. Although a revised proposal might have been approved, Mr. Benepe said that the donor withdrew his offer in part because of frustration with the criticism. 
"It was a vigorous debate, and many valid opinions were expressed," Mr. Benepe said. "We believe that our design was just as valid."
If another donor comes forward, there is still plenty to do at the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Many of the structure's joints are wide open, and some of the stone flags of the 1902 plaza are displaced because of erosion underneath. One long slab of marble is tipped up and broken in half. 
The many coatings of anti-graffiti paint are perhaps unavoidable, but the ornamental bronze doorway has been damaged by vandals. At some point the richly sculptured bronze flagpole base, which featured ship forms, wreaths and other elements, was removed, and much of the 1930's orange-colored stone is chipped and splitting.
Two large plazas, one at the north end, the other to the south, are closed off with metal fences and chains. Parks officials say they have been temporarily fenced off to discourage certain antisocial activities, but decline to be more specific. 
Mr. Benepe said that no major work is scheduled for the structure, but that in the next few years the department will have it surveyed. He added that he is still seeking a generous New Yorker to pay for the rehabilitation of the plaza to the south, with a different design.
"I don't consider the case closed," he said.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Luxury Hotels Feel Sting Of Fewer Business Guests

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
THE Sept. 11 terrorist attacks brought leisure travel almost to a standstill and worsened the slowdown in business travel, which had been limping along since early that year. Now that leisure travel has been inching up in recent months, midscale and economy hotels are showing slight improvement. Luxury hotels have also begun to show some improvement, at least in number of occupied rooms, though they have had to make sharp discounts.
 Historically, luxury hotels have depended heavily on business travelers and international visitors, especially the formerly free-spending Japanese. But with corporate America reining in travel expenses and Japan's economy in a prolonged slump, such guests are becoming rare. 
 "Luxury hotels usually do O.K. in hard times, because their guests have the money," said Ernest Watari, the chief executive of PKF Hawaii, a Honolulu consulting firm that tracks the performance of hotels and other tourism businesses. "But this time around, the combination of 9/11 and the falling stock market have kept a lot of them away."
The largest number of guests at many luxury hotels these days are likely to be leisure travelers taking advantage of rates that are still down by as much as half.
One result is that through the first six months of this year, the latest period for which results are available, revenue per available room -- a measurement of average occupancy and the average price for a room that is widely known as revpar -- fell an average of 10.2 percent to $96.95 at luxury hotels in the nation's top 25 hotel markets, according to Smith Travel Research, the hotel industry scorekeeper. Luxury, in this case, means being in the top 10 percent of hotels in the area.
Because this figure is derived from occupancy rates and the prices actually being charged, it is widely regarded as an important indicator of hotel health -- and it strongly suggests that the luxury sector is none too well.
The only markets this year where revenue per available room among luxury-class hotels exceeded that of the first six months of 2001 were Norfolk-Virginia Beach (up 11.7 percent to $66.59) and Philadelphia (up 5 percent to $100.32.) 
The Norfolk-Virginia Beach market benefited this year from an increase in tourists from nearby cities and states, and from an influx of military personnel and defense contractors visiting the area's Navy bases.
Philadelphia hotels benefited from the city's $3.6 million campaign, which succeeded in enticing convention delegates as well as tourists within a 300-mile radius of Philadelphia. Guests were offered a two-for-one weekend stay and free parking at any of more than 40 hotels. By the time the five-month promotion ended in March, it had generated more than 280,000 room-nights. 
The biggest losers among luxury hotels were those in the San Francisco area, where revenue per available room plunged 24.4 percent over last year to $111.27, and Boston, where the figure dropped 17.6 percent to $118.27. Other markets that experienced double-digit declines include Miami (15.7 percent to $133.33) and Seattle (15.1 percent to $90.86).
Duane Vinson, a research analyst with Smith Travel Research, said that while the combination of terrorist attacks and curtailed business travel had hurt sales at most luxury hotels in large cities, other factors had also contributed. In the San Francisco area, the demise of dot-com companies took a heavy toll, while Boston's troubles were compounded by the loss of conventions.
By contrast, luxury hotels in New Orleans and San Diego benefited from being within driving distance of vacationers and weekend visitors who did not want to stray far from home. 
Many hotels have been offering an assortment of inducements. On weekends that the Houston Astros baseball team played at home, guests at the Four Seasons Houston could book two rooms and free parking for $255, a $400 value. Guests who stayed two nights in a suite at the fancy Windsor Court in New Orleans during July or August were given the third night free. Through Dec. 30, guests who pay the rack rate at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in Southern California will receive the fifth night free. 
As for Hawaii, the dream destination for many Americans, revenue per available room plummeted 16.1 percent to $122.83 at luxury hotels during the same six months on the island of Oahu, according to Smith Travel Research. But when the islands of Maui, Kauai, Hawaii and Molokai were included, the figure fell somewhat less -- 10 percent, to $210.15, according to PKF Hawaii. "Although the Hawaiian luxury hotel market is hurting somewhat," Mr. Watari of PKF said, "nearly every other resort destination would be ecstatic with those results."

HEADLINE: What Is A European 

BYLINE:  By A. S. Byatt; A.S. Byatt is the author of "A Whistling Woman," a novel that will be published by Knopf in December.

 BODY:
In 1948 at the Congress of Europe, Winston Churchill said, "We hope to see a Europe where men of every country will think of being a European as of belonging to their native land, and . . . wherever they go in this wide domain . . . will truly feel 'Here I am at home."' The exiled diplomat Salvador de Madariaga said: "This Europe must be born. And she will, when Spaniards say 'our Chartres,' Englishmen 'our Cracow,' Italians 'our Copenhagen,' when Germans say 'our Bruges.' . . . Then will Europe live. For then it will be that the spirit that leads history will have uttered the creative words: fiat Europa."
 Now, in 2002, we ask whether it is possible or, indeed, desirable, to turn the European Union into a United States of Europe. Do European people -- inside and outside the nations currently members of the E.U. -- feel that they have a European identity that is as strong as, or stronger than, their current national identities? Americans have become interested in these questions recently, since, to them, what seems to characterize Europeans is their opposition to U.S. policies, especially in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq. But in fact European identity is far more complicated. 
 For the past few months I have asked every European I met if he or she felt European, and what it was to be a European. When I travel in taxis in New York I meet enthusiasts who have recently immigrated to the States from European countries -- Russians and Poles, British Asians. They speak with fervor of "this great country," offering just a little criticism. They are converts. London taxi drivers will tell you that Brussels has designs on you -- "they" want to homogenize everyone into citizens of a federal Europe run by someone else, somewhere else. But practically these drivers are Europeans. One spends his weekends fishing in Holland with a Dutch friend. Another saves to take holidays with five friends in alternate European capitals, which they research thoroughly beforehand, gastronomically and culturally. They understand and admire the tactical superiority of continental European soccer and the superior verbal skills of European soccer players who play in England and can speak with wit and point on our television.
The French, on the whole, make more assertive claims to a European identity. My French publisher said, when asked: "Naturally, I am first a European. And within that, I am French." I live in southern France in the summer. A lady I meet regularly on a mountainside, tending a goat and some chickens, said: "Of course I feel myself European. With all these agreements we now have." When I pressed her on what that meant, she said, "Je suis du type Europeen." She spread her arms toward the four corners of the globe. "You have Africa, and Asia -- and over there you have America -- and here, we are European." It was interesting that she saw Americans as a single -- non-European -- "type." 
Other Europeans tend to feel that the French claim a European identity very easily because they imagine European culture and European priorities as an extension of French culture and priorities. They have been prime movers in the shaping of the European Union. Larry Siedentop, in his perspicacious and very illuminating book "Democracy in Europe," points out that the European bureaucracy is modeled on the French bureaucracy because of French enthusiasm and persistence. He goes on to claim that "the French political class has been far more skillful than that of Germany, or indeed, than that of any other major European nation." The danger he perceives for Europe in this is that any further political unification will be on a French model -- with a centralized government and a dirigiste elite civil service.
In April, Romano Prodi, an Italian and the current president of the European Commission -- the European Union's executive body- criticized the British for defensiveness and timidity with regard to playing their "full part" in Europe, while they behaved (in a comparison he excised before he gave the speech) like the tiny back wheel of a penny-farthing bicycle in the "special relationship" with the States. But I have not detected any strong sense of European identity among Italians I know. One wrote in answer to my question that, after seeing the restored frescoes of Piero della Francesca in Arezzo, she felt culturally European, "even if probably I feel more Italian." "Politically, if the Enlightenment, if liberte, egalite, fraternite, if the ideals of the anti-Fascist and anti-Nazist men and women still were political European feelings (not only cultural issues), well, I could feel politically European, but they're not. I really hate this European fortress, this cold Euro-fortress." 
From another point of view, Italy feels very distant from the centers of European power. I was discussing the increasing split between the north and south of that (in European terms) recently unified country, on a boat crossing from Capri to Naples. I said to the group of Italian journalists and university teachers I was with that perhaps Europe would provide a place in which intense local identities could co-exist more easily than in nation-states. I mentioned British hopes for separate parliaments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, co-existing within a European economy and community. I mentioned the new confidence of the once-oppressed Catalans in Spain. The Italians smiled into the Mediterranean sunlight at my naivete. "The people here know and care nothing about Europe," they said. "They hate the people in the next village. Europe is nothing."
Another young friend, a scholar from Sicily, bears this out in a gentler way. She is, she said, Sicilian first, and then Italian. She feels that when she arrives in Northern Italy she has come from "a very hot, welcoming and colored place" to a "cold, mistrustful and gray one." "That's why I feel that the European Union is a wonderful thing for economics and trade, but that it is not possible to talk of a European sense of belonging. The European states have too many centuries of history behind their shoulders as independent countries, and to delete traditions and differences is not that easy, and it's not wise."
She makes an explicit comparison with the United States. "We'll never have that sense of belonging and national pride typical of the U.S.A. people. The U.S. . . . has just two centuries of history and a lot of ethnic differences inside their federal union, so they need a strong national pride and a theatrical performance to make their union real: stars-and-stripes flags everywhere and the national hymn sung on every occasion. . . . I think that U.E. will be just an economic union, and that this is right because there's no worse thing than to impose a fictional and unreal unity of traditions and lifestyles to people who are happy to be different and to maintain their languages and identities."
At an earlier Italian conference on the European novel, everyone present agreed that Europe began with the Mediterranean, which was the source and center of Western civilization -- apart from me everyone was from Spain, Italy, Greece or Yugoslavia. I noticed in myself a very strong contrary desire to define myself as a Northern European. I thought that I have always loved Scandinavian mythology more than classical myths, that my Yorkshire forebears were Danes. I think this sense of finding a meaningful subgroup within the group is a natural European instinct -- which the French maybe don't have, as much because of their geographical centrality (which will change with the proposed expansion of the E.U. to the East) as because of their strong sense of national cultural identity. 
This summer I went on a book tour in Norway, which is not part of the European Union, and visited Denmark, which despite having voted against the euro is somehow at Europe's center (as I see Europe). I asked Norwegians whether they felt they were Europeans. Their answers varied. No, said some; we are on the geographical edge; we are separate and independent and different. One said passionately that after hearing George Bush's speech -- those who are not with us are against us -- she was sure for the first time that Norway should join the E.U., in order to oppose such dangerous and belligerent ideas. Another said that he had traveled last summer across the battlefields of the First World War, and having seen the devastation knew that Norway should join the union in order to prevent such a horror from ever happening again. All, without exception, said thoughtfully that they did not really feel European but that they did feel Scandinavian. They belonged with other Scandinavians. The Danes said the same -- they felt that the European Union was necessary and useful, but their extended identity was Scandinavian.
I then traveled across Germany asking Germans my European question. But first I asked a Spanish ambassador -- very knowledgeable about English and European literature -- at a diplomatic reception. I assumed he would say of course he was European. But he did not. Like the Scandinavians, he had other loyalties. He said that he worked within the European Community -- but also, and equally, in an organization of Spanish-speaking countries, which included Argentina and Mexico, and that he had equally powerful loyalties there. Language is very important, he told me, echoing both the young Sicilian and those British who feel that their natural affinities are with Anglophone countries.
Germans do not claim European identity in the proud way the French do. They look at you sideways, with an ironic smile, and say, "Do you expect a German to say he likes being a German?" This is a change from what they frequently said 20 years ago, which was that all Germans hate Germans. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is said to have thought that Europe was necessary to save Germans from their own propensity for violence and self-destruction. Germans of my own generation -- and those slightly older than I am, who were alive in the war but too young to fight or know what was happening -- have been made to feel, and have felt, the vicarious sense of shame and impotence that is the subject of "The Reader," by Bernhard Schlink. German culture was contaminated by Nazi enthusiasms -- the British occupying forces after the war tried briefly to ban Grimm's fairy tales (on which I myself grew up), on the grounds of encouraging a propensity to violence. Germans are indeed ironic -- they will also almost always say: "What do you mean by German irony? Everyone knows we have no sense of humor." Younger generations of Germans have turned the idea that they and everyone hate Germans into a more or less good-humored joke, which they make with a grin.
The ironic German par excellence is Hans Magnus Enzensberger, born in 1929 in Bavaria, brought up in Nazi Nuremberg, youthful Marxist, older humanist. I think of him in many ways as my ideal European -- polyglot, polymath, skeptical and humane, with a strong sense of history both good and evil. His poetry, gentle or scathing, is full of double and triple entendres -- when you think you are laughing comfortably with him, you find he is laughing sharply at you; when you think he is being mildly comic, he is diagnosing horror. His "Ach Europa!" (1987) is a wickedly acute account of the oddities of behavior and mentalities of various European countries, unexpected and yet convincing as that difficult thing, a diagnosis of national characteristics. 
I spoke to Enzensberger in Munich and asked him if he felt European or German. He replied that there were no such people as Europeans -- Europeans were far too idiosyncratic, entrenched in their ways and their languages and their histories; it was impossible to generalize. He then thought for a moment and said, "On the other hand . . . if you took me up blindfolded in a balloon and put me down in any European city, I would know it was Europe, and I would know how to find a bar, and the railway station, and a food shop. . . . "
One thing Europeans all have in common -- whether they like it or not -- is a sense of a deep and complicated past. Even students, asked what being European means to them, will say, "Well, we are old, our countries are old, there is all this history." They don't so much mean "heritage," cloisters and frescoes, castles and styles of glass and ceramics, though that is included. They mean things like the sense of identity and antagonism in the Balkans that goes back at least as far as the Ottoman Empire. Another person I used to talk to on my French mountain was a wandering ex-schoolmaster with a black dog. I remember a very civilized discussion about reasons for changing the bloodthirsty words of the "Marseillaise" in the new Europe. "We must be peaceful in these days," he said, and suddenly turned on me, bristling with national pride and observed that "C'est vous en effet, l'ancien ennemi" ("You are our hereditary enemy"). I felt hated, back in the Middle Ages, when the English marched armies across this country, which had never been forgotten.
But the past that does weld modern Europeans together is the recent past that divided them so bitterly. The founders of the European Union were possessed by horror and an idealistic desire to ensure that these events were at an end and could not be repeated. "What is Europe now?" Churchill asked. "It is a rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground of pestilence and hate." The future of Europe, he said earlier, depended on "the resolve of hundreds of millions . . . to do right instead of wrong."
This idealism is still there and is real. In the young it is also romantic in some sense, perhaps inevitably. They visit the battlefields, they look at the terrible photographs, they do not understand how their grandparents could have been so bad and so stupid and so dangerous. They are not the same as young American idealists in the 1960's, who were in revolt against what they saw as the soulless materialism of their parents. They live in the ruins and in the places that have been built where the ruins were. The British remember the Blitz, or look at photos and read reminiscences of it -- and have to learn as they travel what it is or was like to live in countries that are occupied or subjugated or starved.
The relationship between individual memories and history is complex and shifts over time. Immediately after the war there were those who were compelled to bear witness -- most of all about the death camps. But there were all sorts of people who were silent for all sorts of reasons. Men who held office under Vichy France, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany still held office. Ordinary people wanted to rebuild, to live, not to remember. It takes time for memory to become possible and longer for it to be narrated. 
One thing that strikes me about the last few years is how much my own generation has begun to tell its war stories, and its parents' war stories, to one another and to the world. Some of this impulse is I think part of a natural desire, as we go through life, to see that life as a whole and in the context of history. A lot of 50- and 60-year-olds seem to become spontaneously obsessed with genealogy and memoirs.
My own father, when he was dying, lay in his hospital bed and spoke with satisfaction about having lived through an "interesting" period of history -- two world wars and the recovery. He was in the Air Force, was sent to Algeria in the North African landings and came with the British forces through Italy, from Sicily to Naples to Rome. He was at the Nuremberg trials as part of the British legal team, but I never heard him speak of this experience. 
It has been strange to find myself having the conversation with other Europeans about what one's father never said about what he did in the war. I sat under the stars with a group of Italians and, as they said how they had sometimes not been sure whether their parents had been Fascists pretending to be Resistance, or Resistance working undercover as Fascists, I thought fleetingly that their fathers had been my father's enemies, and of how much he had loved Italy. They talked of attempted assassinations, of hidden pistols, discovered and disposed of. I talked to a man in central Germany whose town was bombed by the Americans at the end of the war, when he was 15. He went to and fro on his bicycle, under fire, rescuing property from their abandoned house until, he said to me with a grim and wicked smile, he experienced "the happiest moment of my life. The house was not there. There was a crater. I could not be sent out again." After the war he went to England to learn English and was billeted with a Jewish family in Golders Green. "I knew nothing -- then. But they embraced me and said how wonderful it was to hear the German language and made me wonderful food." He became the secretary of an Israeli-German correspondence society.
An eminent German professor suddenly told me how Russian officers had been billeted on his family during the occupation and were given to shooting neighbors they saw in the orchard -- but the professor, then a boy, had liked one of them, an officer named Sasha, and when they were recalled to Russia, he decided to go with them. "There was I with my little cardboard suitcase, age 8. 'Ich geh mit Sasha' ('I go with Sasha'), I said, to my mother's consternation." 
I have a French friend whose "dead" father was later revealed to have fought for the Germans and to be in hiding in South America. A Danish friend said he had been very happy to find a box of letters under the floor of his Swedish summer house, which confirmed that his father had indeed been an active member of the Resistance. A French friend quite suddenly began to speak about his war, which had been spent on the run in France, with his mother, grandmother, aunt and cousins, on false identity papers. He has written his account of those years, with a beautiful balance between ordinary childish preoccupations and the sense of wrongness of having to lie about one's name for reasons that were clearly terrible but were not explained.
There is also the lady who comes -- on a bicycle she bought in 1945 -- to sell lottery tickets for the Protestant temple in my French village. This year she, too, suddenly described her war. She is from Alsace-Lorraine and was evacuated to Limoges at the beginning of hostilities -- "we lived on the wrong side of the Maginot line, we were indefensible, we were told to get out and allowed 30 kilos per person of belongings. When we got to Limoges many of us spoke the local dialect, which sounds like German, and the locals called us Boches and Nazis." She told of friends who vanished after the Gestapo came with their barred camion. She likes paradoxically to tell us these stories in German, which she speaks fluently because her husband was part of the French military police in occupied Berlin. 
All these stories, and their mixed emotions, are Europe. I think they can now be told because they are somehow defused -- moving, not dangerous. 
Younger Europeans take Europe for granted in a matter-of-fact way. They travel constantly across it on cheap interrail tickets, and they study as exchange students at other European universities. My own daughter in Newcastle -- a far northern English city that sees both England and Scotland as "foreign" -- shared a student house with a Frenchwoman, a West German, an East German and two Belgian hitchhikers, who were picked up in Spain -- by another friend -- and slept on the couch for six months. Young Europeans intermarry and produce bilingual children. Some of them go to McDonald's and some of them join antiglobalization protests and travel in buses to support Jose Bove, the French proponent of local produce, against American imports of beef with hormones. Our local French supermarket is in fact European. The voices you hear speak Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, French and English. The French peaches in the market are labeled with tiny circles to show their color -- "yellow," "gelb," "giallo." In France and in Germany this summer the euro seemed to be an uncomplicated matter of fact -- the currency. By the end of the summer most Europeans were grumbling bitterly that its introduction had been a cloak for price increases. It unifies at a practical level, more than symbolically.
There was only one thing all the Europeans I talked to had in common. They would all say, "When I am in America, I know I am European." In Europe they notice local differences, but seen from the distance of the States, it is suddenly the whole state of being European that grips them. One person said to me, "I thought I knew from books and television what the American way of life was, but when you are in it you realize you don't understand it at all." This feeling isn't necessarily, or even mostly, antagonistic. America has the fascination of the Other. I don't think European perceptions of America are helped by the ubiquitous presence of dubbed American soaps and B movies on European television. American mouths moving in American shapes and producing French sounds in French voices are cultural zombies, and misleading. 
An American recently said to me at a German reception that she hadn't even noticed that she had a "nationality" until she came to Europe. There are two (at least) ways of looking at that. One is that for most Americans the natural way to be is to be American, and they are surprised to find Europeans are different, and have complex ways of looking at their own identities. The other is that in the United States family origins -- Italian, Irish, Jewish, Hispanic -- are subsumed in a deliberately chosen new identity, without being lost. I don't think the Europeans, any of them, even the most enthusiastic for political union, will ever subsume their origins in a new national identity as Americans naturally do. 
Robert Kagan, in a recent article in the American journal Policy Review, on the power divide between the United States and Europe, describes the new European belief in a world governed by a web of international rules and laws as a belief in having "stepped out of the Hobbesian world of anarchy into the Kantian world of perpetual peace." Larry Siedentop also invokes Kant's idea of a just community and suggests it derives from the Christian respect for the individual as an absolute value. Kagan says with force and truth that out there, there is still a Hobbesian world that will be dealt with by American cowboy justice or not at all. He says the European world of moral rule is an ideal formed in weakness. It is nevertheless worthwhile, and is a partial fulfillment of Churchill's hope that millions of people would want to do good rather than evil. 
One important thing about the E.U., for me, is that it gives a voice, and some power, to smaller countries. I have talked to two thinkers from small members of the E.U. -- Toger Seidenfaden, editor of the Danish paper Politiken, and Geert van Istendael, a Belgian writer and poet. Both have a clear vision of European values and identity.
Van Istendael surprised me when we spoke together at a Parisian-European literary festival by asserting that Europe, in order to work, has to become like Belgium. What he means by this, he explained in an e-mail message, is that Belgium has peacefully and successfully resolved what seemed an intractable conflict between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities. This has been done "by democratic (i.e. legislative, parliamentary) means and by pacific means (i.e. marches, speeches, public discussions etc.). . . . Two people were killed, one French-speaking, one Flemish, in 172 years of argument and adjustment. . . . 
"I never pretended that our solutions for the language problem were/are very elegant or highly intellectual or shining monuments of political thought. No, they are certainly not, but obviously, they are workable. That's why South Africans and Palestinians visit Brussels: to study the rather Byzantine labyrinth of our language equilibria. Because the Belgian way of dealing with this type of cultural difference seems to be an antidote against civil war and the wholesale destruction of societal fibers." 
Van Istendael sees pacific, diverse Belgium as a model for a whole Europe of many languages and many roots. I went to meet Toger Seidenfaden at the moment when the French alarmed the E.U. and the world by putting the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, into the final presidential round. Seidenfaden was level-headed about this and said that as an incurably rational man, he believed that it was only an effect of "the unbearable lightness of democracy" and not an indication of a second Weimar Republic. 
I asked him if it was easier for members of smaller countries to feel "European," and he answered that he thought this was so. "Smaller nations have much less difficulty with the 'high politics' aspects of Europe and have less identity bound up with foreign policy, defense and even the currency." He then made what he said was the "basic point." "Being European is a supplementary identity, which does not aspire to be the dominant identity for anybody. This is the whole point and attractiveness of it in a world where identity politics not to mention ethno-politics have done and are doing enormous harm."
He added that "the nature of the Euro-beast is such that at best it creates rational enthusiasts, like myself, and 'Europe' only appeals to the warm emotions at unique moments -- i.e. 1989-91." I myself felt a pull at the "warm emotions" when the Turkish Parliament voted to abolish the death penalty and give linguistic and civil rights to Kurds, in order to conform to the moral requirements of the E.U., which Turkey hopes to join. I felt proud to belong to a community that was collectively against executions.
Europeans were alarmed by George Bush's "either you are with us or . . . " speech, because it carried an echo of the absolutist rhetorics that made such a mess of our continent. I saw a civilized discussion on CNN between that highly rational student of Europe, Timothy Garton Ash, and an American journalist. The American remarked that it was sad that the Europeans had not noticed that the Bush administration's rhetoric had softened. Garton Ash said that if you drew two circles representing American and European ideals and beliefs, they "would overlap by 85 percent," which was a great deal to have in common. That feels right to me -- and 85 percent is a large proportion of common ideals and purposes. But President Bush's recent words and plans have caused further alarm.
During the gulf war, I happened to be in a German monastery with a group of English and German writers and scholars. We divided, not by nationality, but by age. The young were passionately antiwar, as they have been brought up to be. Those who remembered 1945 and its aftermath saw the analogy between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and Hitler, and spoke unhappily of the imperative to avoid appeasement. Just after 9/11, I was in Frankfurt. I found myself defending the coming strike against the Taliban to an angry and idealistic Austrian TV cameraman who had just spent eight weeks with Afghan refugees and believed nothing justified the loss of innocent lives. I do not know a European -- and that includes the British I talk to -- who is in favor of a strike on Iraq. They do not accept the rhetoric of the "axis of evil," or the connection of such a strike to the fight against world terrorism. The old know what war does to people and cities. The young believe that aggression is simply bad. The 85 percent is dwindling, at least at this time.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-13-02; 
Common Talk

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
With an election only three weeks away, there may be no better way to be heard above the din of war preparations than with a populist rallying cry. The United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth in the Western world. In a recent book, "Wealth and Democracy," Kevin Phillips argues that America is now approaching the historic levels of inequality reached before the adoption of the federal income tax in 1913, when the top 1 percent of citizens owned more than half the nation's wealth. (The figure is now 40 percent.) And the 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut passed by the Bush administration will transfer more wealth to the top 1 percent than virtually any act of fiscal policy in history. Yet as we approach the midterm election, inequality is a nonissue. 
 Though Americans have traditionally repudiated the kind of overt class politics common in Europe, whipping up the ordinary voter against the plutocrat is a great American tradition. Almost a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt railed at "the malefactors of great wealth" who controlled the trusts; in 1933, F.D.R. lashed out at the "unscrupulous money-changers" who had manipulated the market. But when Al Gore raised the populist banner in the 2000 presidential campaign -- squaring off against "big oil" and "big tobacco" and even rejuvenating the ancient slogan, "the people versus the powerful" -- many Democratic leaders were horrified. Even his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, recently indulged in a rare public rebuke of Gore, saying that his "economic populism stuff" turned off middle-class voters who "don't see America as 'us versus them."' 
 Lieberman's remark only codified a role reversal that has been building for years. The Democrats have been the party of populism since the age of Andrew Jackson, but since the mid-80's the party has tried to harvest middle-class voters by speaking a consensual language of "opportunity" and "community." Republicans, on the other hand, have seized the mantle of populism in cultural terms, standing up for traditional values against "the liberal elite." It was George W. Bush, an economic royalist if ever there was one, who ran as the populist in 2000, and Bush has continued to profit from his carefully designed reputation as a God-fearing C student from "the heartland."
Why is it that economic populism apparently doesn't work, even if cultural populism does? The obvious answer is mass prosperity. In the 1890's, the Populist Party spoke for farmers and manual laborers at a time when the two groups constituted more than two-thirds of American workers. There was a very large "us" and a very small, and remote, "them." The Populists could run against "Eastern finance" because ordinary voters could very easily feel manipulated by the mysterious doings of Wall Street. The same was plainly true of F.D.R. or the rabble-rousing Huey Long during the Depression. Now, the Democratic pollster Mark Penn says, more people hold stock than jobs. And those voters do not believe that their interests are at odds with those of the rich. Economic populism has thus become politically self-defeating. Perhaps cultural barriers have remained salient even as class ones have lost their force, thus giving Republicans a natural leg up in the populism wars.
Anyway, that's the argument. But is it true? Did Gore really lose because he stopped saying, "Everyone grows together"? Stan Greenberg, a pollster associated with the liberal wing of the party, says that Gore's populism in fact rescued his floundering campaign. And in their new book, "The Emerging Democratic Majority," John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira -- liberals as well -- argue that not only the party's traditional base but also its new constituents in the postindustrial economy are eager to hear a tempered form of populism that takes on entrenched corporate power without playing on archaic class resentments.
The neopopulists would like to recast the "us" and the "them," and even the "versus." The new "us" includes large parts of the middle class as well as the working class and the poor -- not corporate managers or the anti-cosmopolitan cultural conservatives but professionals, like accountants and doctors and engineers, who, at least according to Judis and Teixeira, do not identify with corporations, are skeptical of free-market ideology and have been shifting steadily toward the Democrats with every election.
And who is the new "them"? This has been populism's besetting problem since the days when Tom Watson and Pitchfork Ben Tillman thundered against "Jewish bankers and British gold." Populism discredits itself through the resentments it exploits. But Gore didn't attack individuals, even indirectly; he attacked institutions. And his target was not "the rich," or even "the superrich," as much as the nexus between wealth and political power -- the subordination of politics to money, the cynical use of a free-market ideology as the stalking horse for self-interest. It was a diffused, impersonal form of populism -- a different kind of "versus" -- that had the flavor of the Hubert Humphrey of the 1950's rather than of Huey Long, even if Gore turned out to be no Humphrey.
The basis of a new populism, then, would be not so much inequality itself as the grossly unequal access to power that comes with great inequality -- a growing public perception that fueled the very different candidacies of Ralph Nader, Bill Bradley and John McCain (all of whom were running against bipartisan abuse). And since then we have had Enron, a Bush administration energy policy apparently written by the energy industry itself and an enormous tax cut that favors the very rich and the very largest corporations. Kevin Phillips, himself a former Republican strategist, argues that the United States has once again become a plutocracy, as it was a century ago. Can anybody out there improve on "malefactors of great wealth"?

HEADLINE: On Main Street, Business Is a Bit Lean 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: BERNARDSVILLE 

 BODY:
ON Mine Book Road, the hilly shopping street that rises up from the commuter train station, a few longtime retailers selling orthopedic shoes and dry goods mingle with newcomers selling high-end kitchen gizmos, a sleek Japanese restaurant and a chic ladies' boutique where Palumbo's family pharmacy used to be.
 Yet even here in Somerset County -- surrounded by the stone-walled estates of corporate titans and New Jersey's horsey set -- retailers fear that after a long buying binge, consumers are beginning to pull back. 
 "People are holding on to their bucks," said Sid Sussman, owner of Sussman's Department Store, an independent dry goods and clothing retailer in Bernardsville since 1948. "They've lost money in the stock market. They're worried about their jobs. They're even sending their wives back to work." 
And if this wealthy enclave is feeling the strain, then the question becomes even more urgent: how are the rest of the more than 200 downtown shopping districts throughout the state holding up during this time of uncertainty?
Last year, going into the all-important holiday season, shoppers in New Jersey were still reeling from the terrorism attacks of Sept. 11 and the anthrax scare. Moreover, those traumas were set against a backdrop of rising unemployment and declining stock market prices.
Still, consumers surprised economists with their resilience through much of the past year. Interest rates remained low and housing values continued to climb. Homeowners refinanced mortgages to put more money in their pockets or snap up new cars on zero-interest payment plans.
But now retailers fear the long-awaited slowdown is beginning to take shape, with the possibility of war in Iraq the latest blow to consumer confidence.
"People could deal with Sept. 11," said Pam Schroeder, the owner of Epitome, a women's clothing boutique. "They were starting to heal. They were trying to be positive about the economy when this issue with Iraq came up. I think that is what really started the concern."
She said her sales remained strong this year, at least until the middle of the summer, when plans for the invasion of Iraq began to dominate the headlines.
And as if talk of war and a struggling economy were not enough, the exceptionally warm weather through the summer and early fall has also worked against retailers. "When the weather is hot they're not concentrating on what they should be buying for the winter," said Philip Santangelo, a salesman at J. Mastro shoes in Bernardsville.
Even the calendar is conspiring against storeowners -- who typically make two-thirds of their annual sales and half their profits in the holiday season. This year, Hannukah starts early, on Nov. 29, and the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is shorter than last year.
"With six less shopping days this year, we're a little concerned," said Melanie Willoughby, president of the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association, which represents 3,500 merchants in the state.
Ms. Willoughby said that while low interest rates have encouraged home buying and car shopping for a time, consumers now face the reality that they must live with the payments on those loans. In addition, she said, health care is also taking an increasing share of disposable income.
"Our outlook for the holiday sales season nationally as well as in New Jersey is at best dim," said Kurt Barnard, a national retail consultant based in Upper Montclair. "We'll be lucky if we meet the levels that were achieved a year ago, which were really paltry."
The problem is that shopping is big business in New Jersey. For instance, Ms. Willoughby said that 50,449 stores were scattered throughout this state, the most densely populated in the nation. The retail industry employs 585,000 workers -- the second-largest employment category in the state after services, she said.
Last year alone, total retail sales were put at $105 billion, up from $101.9 billion in 2000. This year, sales are expected to reach $107.1 billion, and grow to $110.9 billion in 2003, according to the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors.
But the council said the increase was not being driven by retail sales along the myriad Main Streets throughout the state, but by new car sales, a healthy real estate market and tourism.

'People Out of Work'
On the down side, payroll employment declined at the annual rate of 0.3 percent in the first half of the year, according to the council -- though even there New Jersey fared better than the nation as a whole, which recorded a 1.2 percent decline in employment. 
"I have a lot of friends who have lost their jobs on Wall Street and in computers and the Internet," said John Zulauf, who owns three stores in Ridgewood. "There are definitely people out of work."
Indeed, some of them had worked for Mr. Zulauf himself. He said he had eliminated seven part-time positions, and was working two or three shifts a week at the register as well as managing his stores.
Last year, Mr. Zulauf's business was up 18 percent before Sept. 11, but ended the year down 15 percent. "That was a huge swing of cash for a small business," he said.
Despite the disturbing signs, he said that in the last few months, some of the volatility had disappeared and that he was planning on a 10 percent increase at his stores, which sell crafts, home furnishings and cards, stationery and albums.
In addition to concerns over the loss of jobs and the increasing uncertainty over Iraq, the summer's corporate scandals eroded confidence in business and drove share prices down even further. As the Council of Economic Advisors said in its mid-year report made public last month: "Falling equity prices combined with widespread stock ownership pose substantial risks to consumer confidence, and spending and are the single-largest threat to the recovery."
A sluggish holiday spending season is expected to weigh on malls as well as Main Street. Already there have been casualties among retail chain stores, including Ames Department Stores, Kmart and The Wiz, which have closed New Jersey stores in the past year.
Malls remain heavily dependent on their department store anchors and apparel retailers, which tend to have high-end prices and have been struggling compared with home furnishings stores.
"We are very heavily malled here in New Jersey," said Mr. Barnard, the retail consultant. "But we are in a period right now of very great caution on the part of the consumer, and people today will go to a store and look at the price tag before they look at the product. In the late 90's you often didn't look at the price tag at all."
Ms. Willoughby said so-called power centers -- anchored by such discounters as Target, Kohl's or Wal-Mart -- were expected to fare better than malls in a downturn, although Wal-Mart surprised retail analysts recently with a more cautious outlook.
To be sure, some businesses -- like home repair centers -- are booming. And last spring, clothing sales were up 6 percent over the same period last year, while home furnishing sales were up almost double that, 11 percent, Mr. Barnard said.
Lyn Sattler, the owner of Absolutely Fabulous Things Amen, a home furnishings shop in Bernardsville, said that she was expecting a good season. She believes that though customers may prune their gift lists this year, they will still spend to create a homey holiday
"People aren't going to be picking up a lot of little nothings," Ms. Sattler said. "But when it comes to family and friends, they are going to want to create a sense of warmth for the people they love."
From Mr. Barnard's vantage point, however, Main Street merchants are the most vulnerable in a sharp spending downturn, particularly because small retailers cannot offer the selection and the bargains of a national discounter, and because they often lack the capital to ride out a prolonged slowdown.
To Elaine Moffett, who has owned three different stores over the past 31 years in Westfield, a prosperous middle-class town in Union County, spending downturns are like hurricanes.
"You just have to hang in there and weather it," said Ms. Moffett. "You have your good years and you have your bad years. This is a tough year, but we've had many good years. That's how the pendulum swings."
Ms. Moffett, who has run Periwinkle Gifts since 1989, said her inventory levels were lean, and she was working harder to find bargains from her own suppliers to pass along to price-sensitive shoppers.

Better Positioned This Time
Brian Ford, a retail analyst at Ernst & Young, said New Jersey's downtowns were better positioned to survive a downturn this year than they were in the early 90's, when store vacancy rates were up and they were confronting new competition from discount centers. 
Since then, Mr. Ford said, shoppers had grown to savor the personalized attention they could get in small-town shopping districts and have become increasingly reluctant to fight the traffic to clogged malls and shopping plazas.
"It is a whole different experience when you go to Main Street," he said. "It's an outing. You get the family together and walk. You have something to eat. You do some shopping. You feel like you had a quality time."
Since 1990, 22 towns have participated in the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs' Main Street New Jersey program, which offers technical assistance to volunteer organizations that want to take a coordinated approach to managing their local business districts.
In those towns, 891 new businesses have been started and 115 have expanded, creating 4,907 jobs. Private investors have spent more than $140.6 million on building rehabilitations. Another $5 million in public money, mostly from county and local governments, has also gone into refurbishing downtown buildings.
Joe Spector, a third-generation owner of The Leader Store, an independent clothing and sporting goods retailer in Westfield, said public improvements and better business coordination have allowed it to blossom since the recession of the early 1990's.
"That was a transitional time not only for Westfield but the whole region," Mr. Spector said. "It was a time when a lot of traditional mom-and- pop retailers were retiring. But the facelift we've had in the last 10 to 12 years has helped to make Westfield a regional shopping destination again."
When many revitalization efforts were completed, towns found they had new restaurants to feed those shoppers whose wallets were swollen with Wall Street profits -- from sushi bars to pastarias to pizza places.
Chris Nadolny and his wife, Ellen, opened Celebrate Food & Cafe seven years ago in Maplewood Village, a picture postcard town in Essex County. Last fall, when diners became anxious about going into Manhattan, business surged. More than a year later, customers are still coming and spending $5 to $6 a ticket over last year, said Mr. Nadolny.
Even if the economy sours, he said, people will still come out to eat.
"I think the difference between the last recession and what is going on now is that people used to see the stock market as a safe place to leave their money," he said. "Now they are pulling it out and putting it into their home and into enjoying life. The consumer is 10 years more intelligent now. They have more of a sense of the ups and downs."
When Peter Matushin was planning to open his luxury high-concept store JetLife in Westfield, he did research into spending during the Depression era.
"Even in the worst economy, women went out and bought a tube of lipstick and men bought shaving cream because they were soothing, minor self-indulgences as opposed to buying a new car or house," Mr. Matushin said. "Buying a high-quality bar of soap is attainable in the worst economy."
Mr. Matushin, and his partner, Donna Pudwill, who were downsized out of their jobs in last August after years in corporate America -- said starting a business in a trying economy was less risky than it might seem.
"Corporate America is no safer than opening up a mom-and-pop shop if after 15 years you can be dropped with a week's notice like a rusty stapler," he said. "We decided to invest in something tangible -- ourselves."
JetLife, housed in a former fur shop, mixes standard retailing with services and event-driven marketing. For instance, the store sells cotton towels, soap and other pampering products. And for their troubles, customers are offered electronic chair massages, an oxygen bar and hydro-aromatherapy. Shoppers can even use all three services at one for a package discount.
Mr. Matushin also wants to develop an art gallery and stage such events as yoga classes or a "nail night" to benefit charity and fill the shop with potential customers.
"A lot of these people in these towns in their younger days lived in Manhattan and went to the same clubs in the 80's," Mr. Matushin said. "Now, they want to return to some of that. I wanted to bring some of that urban-ness into the suburbs."

A New Frontier for Chains
Towns like Westfield have also become the new frontier for national chain retailers usually found in malls. Westfield has a Gap, FootLocker, Victoria's Secret, and a Banana Republic. The Secaucus retailer Children's Place is scheduled to open there as well.
Mr. Spector who fought bitterly against a mall proposed near downtown Westfield 20 years ago, welcomes the chains, which he said lure shoppers to town from well beyond Westfield.
"We have local people who feel the national chains are a negative influence," he said. "My response is that is a misconception. When I was growing up, Westfield was always a regional center for larger stores. The only difference is the names and the nature of the businesses have changed."
When the current caution -- and the tightening of the purse strings -- will ease is difficult to predict. "Some resolution of the situation in Iraq and a sense that the stock market has hit bottom will help people start to regain their confidence," said Barbara Bickart, associate professor of marketing at Rutgers' School of Business in Camden and a specialist in consumer behavior.
The November elections, she said, may begin to provide some resolution.
For his part, Mr. Barnard, who has tracked retailing since the 1950's, said the current cycle was as complex as any he had ever confronted.
"This is an extraordinary cycle because it includes the possibility of war," he said. "That's a loose cannon. Plus, we are still carrying with us the scars of 9/11, and 9/11 has impinged very deep on the fabric of our economy and our psyche, more than anything I can ever recall."
As Professor Bickart said, the wounds from the attacks of Sept. 11 -- especially among New Jerseyans -- were still raw, and emotion may be driving spending patterns along with more rational concerns over unemployment and stock market losses.
"Especially among younger people," she said, "the days of extravagant spending are out. Conspicuous consumption is not so cool anymore."

HEADLINE: EXECUTIVE LIFE; 
His Job: Chasing Wall Street Deadbeats

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH

 BODY:
MICHAEL S. COLOMBO is a debt collector, but not one who goes after small fry -- people who refuse to pay for their magazine subscriptions or for credit-card charges that have gotten out of hand. Instead, he pursues stockbrokers and investors who owe money on loans or margin calls. And he does this through the art of firm persuasion.
Mr. Colombo, 40, is in the business of getting people to pay the money they owe brokerage firms and investment banks. For more than 15 years, he did this work for three companies in-house, starting in 1983 at PaineWebber. 
 A year and a half ago, he opened his own collection shop, the StreetWide Asset Recovery Group in Manhattan, with backing from the Firebrand Financial Group. 
 Mr. Colombo goes after stockbrokers who leave their companies still owing them money and investors who overextend themselves on margin and can't pay up. Given the state of the economy, he is a very busy man these days. He has contracts with 17 financial institutions, including Berry-Shino Securities, InvestPrivate and J. P. Turner & Company, and he oversees some 300 cases at a time. He receives a percentage of what he recovers.
In the past, many firms either wrote off this debt as a lost cause or assigned its collection to a lawyer, who rarely made it a priority. Mr. Colombo, on the other hand, focuses on these obligations like a pit bull.
"This is what I do," he said. "I know the players. I know the system. I know the collection laws." He estimates that in 19 years, he has recovered more than $45 million, once recouping $1 million in one shot. His biggest single collection so far at StreetWide has been $400,000.
Wall Street is taking notice: this year, he was profiled in Registered Rep, a stockbrokers trade magazine.
Brokers may owe money to their former employers because of loans they took out as new hires. Brokerage houses typically forgive these loans in stages over several years, but if the broker leaves before the contract is up, he owes the balance. Not all are eager to pay up.
Mr. Colombo says brokers sometimes argue that they are off the hook because, after all, the company didn't give them everything it promised.
"The bottom line is -- and I tell brokers this all the time -- if you had a problem with the firm you went to, God bless you if you want to go to another one," he said. "But you don't get to keep the money. You signed a promissory note and you promised to pay."
If that doesn't work, the two parties go to arbitration before the National Association of Securities Dealers. Mr. Colombo handles that work until the actual hearing, when a lawyer has to take over. He says that only about one-quarter of the cases go that far.
"Mike's excellent at this," said Edward Rose, director for litigation at Investec Ernst & Company in Manhattan, one of StreetWide's clients. "He has the approach of a collection firm, but he has the business background. If you went to a standard collection firm, I don't think they'd understand the nuances of how these debts are created."
Mr. Colombo tells of a recent case in which, a month before a broker was going to leave his midsize firm owing $80,000, he put his house into his wife's name to shield it from any judgment. Instead of first pursuing the broker, Mr. Colombo subpoenaed the wife. That was enough to make her husband deal with his financial obligation, he says.
SOME targets are far from Wall Street. About a year ago, Mr. Colombo said, one client gave him a case in Alabama involving a customer who had run up margin debt of $17,000. When the customer refused to pay even after losing in arbitration, Mr. Colombo hired an Alabama lawyer to get a court judgment. The man eventually wrote a check for the amount owed plus interest.
Sometimes, the situation is messier. Mr. Colombo recalls a case while he was collecting in-house. A customer told his broker he wanted to sell short 11,000 shares of eBay.
"But the market went against him and we had to buy the position at a loss of $397,000," he said.
The client never paid up, and the fact that the trade was made in the name of a shell company made it difficult to go after him, Mr. Colombo said. But he was eventually able to win back the debt plus interest and legal fees.
"I had a lawyer write me a three-page memo on why it was uncollectable, but I don't really take that very well," Mr. Colombo said.
Karen M. Cullen hired StreetWide when she was general counsel of Prime Charter Ltd., a New York broker-dealer that was absorbed by Fahnestock Viner Holdings of Toronto. The fee was money well spent, Ms. Cullen said.
"Within a couple of months of hiring Mike, he already collected more than we ever had before," she said.
Mr. Colombo is from Brooklyn, but moved to New Jersey in his teens. He got into the business after leaving college and taking a clerk's job in the new collection department at PaineWebber. He rose to divisional vice president and left in 1996 to create a collections department at Gruntal & Company. In 1998, he went to the GKN Securities Corporation, where, he said, he increased collection revenue from $12,000 to $5 million over two years.
Mr. Colombo said that as his reputation grew, and as firms began asking him for advice on collecting their debt, he decided to pursue an old dream of working for himself. Firebrand Financial, which owns GKN, provided initial funds for StreetWide and owns 80 percent of it.
Does he ever feel sorry for the brokers he goes after?
"I'll be the first guy to say that it's tough for brokers right now," he said. Even so, the biggest concession he will make is to work out a payment plan with those who owe his clients money. 
"Of course, the knee-jerk reaction to a collection agency calling up is very guarded, or 'Go take a walk, I'm not paying,' yadda yadda yadda," he said. "I say: 'Listen, I'm not calling to argue with you. This is what you owe.' Sooner or later they'll get the message."

GNIESZKA OSSOLINSKA-JASKOWSKI didn't have work experience in the legal field. She didn't have any important contacts in the legal business. And she didn't yet have a diploma from Montclair State University in New Jersey, where where she was studying to be a paralegal.
 What she did have was fluency in Polish. And that was enough to get her a job at Brand, Brand & Burke, a personal-injury law firm in Manhattan. 
 "I thought I was at a disadvantage because I had been in the United States only for a couple of years at the time," said Mrs. Jaskowski, who is 29. "But my Polish background actually gave me an edge."
Brand, Brand & Burke, in fact, had recently begun a push to win more clients in New York's growing Polish population, and had placed an ad in Nowy Dziennik, the city's biggest-circulation Polish-language newspaper, specifying mastery of Polish as a requirement for a new position as a liaison with Poles.
Mrs. Jaskowski's familiarity with legal issues helped her candidacy, the firm says, but it was her bilingualism that clinched the job.
"A few years ago, the Polish community was underserved by the legal profession, so we decided to hire a few employees who could speak Polish," said Ronald Burke, a partner at the firm. "We were open to hiring a native speaker of English with fluency in Polish, but we preferred an immigrant who would be more sensitive to the needs of other immigrants. Agnes never worked as paralegal before, but we thought that she would rise to the occasion with on-the-job training."
In the current stumbling economy, job seekers are leveraging every qualification they can think of to sway potential employers. And with immigrants continuing to flood into New York, long the city of immigrants, and its suburbs, speaking a second language is a talent that matters in almost any field.
Take nursing. The hiring managers at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York, which employs people from 88 countries, say they consider mastery of a foreign tongue a strong plus. "The closer you get to delivery of care, the more critical is a second language," said G. Thomas Ferguson, senior vice president and chief of human resources. "A nurse who can talk to a patient in a native language is very important."
It helped Merari Sanchez-Vega get her job there three years ago. Ms. Sanchez-Vega, a registered nurse who was born in the United States but whose parents immigrated from Puerto Rico, is the only nurse of 18 on her floor who can speak Spanish. And even though most Hispanics who are admitted speak English, they feel more at ease when she talks to them in Spanish, she says. "It is their primary language, so they naturally prefer to use it rather than English," Ms. Sanchez-Vega said.
In New York, real estate is another field in which it helps to have multilinguists on the payroll, especially at firms active in neighborhoods with large ethnic populations.
"I'm hiring from different language groups because we are serving customers of many nationalities who sometimes can't speak English," said John Mo, president and owner of Century 21 Milestone in Jamaica, Queens. The 62 agents at his firm speak a host of languages that include Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Urdu and Italian, he says. 
Mr. Mo, who himself immigrated from Hong Kong, said many of his customers were newcomers to America who spoke little or no English. About a month ago, a Hispanic couple came to his office, and though they couldn't understand English, kept repeating the phrase, "We want sell home."
"I looked around, but it was late in the day and everyone was in the field," Mr. Mo said. He ended up paging one of his Spanish-speaking agents and summoning him to the office.
In the global economy, American companies increasingly are realizing the benefits of a multilingual work force. Mark Levit, a managing partner at Partners & Levit, a Manhattan advertising agency, says that while the firm has overseas clients and creates ads aimed at specific ethnic groups in the United States, his only requirement for hiring a bookkeeper used to be accounting skills.
Then, one day, his bookkeeper, a Russian woman, told him that in her view a Russian translation that she had seen of a Partners & Levit brochure was better than the original. That and other incidents, he says, convinced him that a familiarity with a foreign tongue would be an asset in any employee. "In the future, we are planning to make a second language a hiring criterion because we realized that it is so useful," Mr. Levit said.
Mrs. Jaskowski, who immigrated to the United States in 1997 and started as a teacher of Polish at a weekend school in New Jersey, got the job at Brand, Brand & Burke two and a half years ago. Her knowledge of the law was increasing but still deficient, she said, and her new employer started her off slowly, letting her pick up her new duties at her own pace.
"They spent a lot of time just showing me how to do things," she said. "At first, my job was sort of like an extension of school."
Early on, the pay was low, but the fact that she was gaining experience at a personal-injury law firm at a time when some of her classmates in the paralegal certification program at Montclair had not yet started looking for a job was more important to her than money.
During the first few months, she acted more as an intermediary for the lawyers in the office and their Polish-speaking clients than a full-fledged paralegal. Her tasks included informing Polish clients about the status of their cases and translating documents. She even went along with some clients to the doctor's office, serving as a translator.
After a year, however, Mrs. Jaskowski's job started gaining new dimensions. Although her main focus remains working with Polish clients, her additional tasks, like making drafts of legal papers, require a greater understanding of the legal system. Mrs. Jaskowski is also responsible for deciding whether a case is good enough for the firm to pursue -- and that means she has to make trips to accident sites. "It takes some patience to do this work when I have a crowd of people staring at me and wondering who I am and why I do it," she said.
There is other work, too. Mrs. Jaskowski arranges advertising in Polish media and attends events sponsored by her firm in Polish neighborhoods. When the residents see her in a business suit, she says, "It makes them rethink the image of a typical Polish nanny and a construction worker."

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK; 
Do Women Lack Drive? Or a Wife?

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FIRST, meet Kate Reddy, a high-powered, ambitious achiever, who is also conflicted, exhausted and stressed. She is the mother of two, and when we first see her she is in the kitchen (at 1:30 a.m.) beating store-bought pastries with a rolling pin to make them look homemade for the school Christmas party.
 Next, meet Dawn Lepore, also high-powered and achieving, but only mildly conflicted about it. She also has two children, and when I last saw her she was dining on glazed chicken prepared by her husband, Ken, who stays home and runs their life. 
 Kate Reddy, I should explain, is a fiction -- she's the heroine of "I Don't Know How She Does It" (Knopf, 2002), the book every working woman is likely to devour within the next few weeks. The novel, by the British writer Allison Pearson, is a sensation in England. It is a hysterical look -- in both the laughing and crying senses of the word -- at the life of Supermom as she tries to be both a mother and a financial whiz.
Dawn Lepore, on the other hand, is very real. She is the vice chairwoman of Charles Schwab in San Francisco, and one of Fortune Magazine's 50 most powerful women. One third of those 50 have husbands who stay home with the children, and Ms. Lepore is a member of that club, too.
It has long been an open secret of the business stratosphere that couples, particularly couples with children, do not get to the top together. Someone -- traditionally the wife -- stays a few supportive steps behind. Against that background, Ms. Pearson's book and Fortune magazine's statistics provide two opposing answers to a central question: Are there so few women at the top because women don't have the drive? Or is it because they don't have wives?
Ms. Pearson suggests that it's often the former. Women are talented and educated enough to run the world, she says, they just aren't willing to give up all that is required to master the universe. Her book was born when she read a survey that found that working mothers were constantly starved for time and felt they were neglecting their husbands, their children and themselves. This makes women different from men mostly because the women care. Successful men don't have time for their families either, Ms. Pearson argues, but for generations that has not really bothered them.
Women, she says, are just programmed differently. "They carry the puzzle of family life in their heads," she says. "When a man is walking into a client meeting, he is not also going to be thinking, 'Did I buy the right gym shoes for the playground? Did I get the lace-up kind or the pull-on kind? And did I take the lasagna out to defrost?' "
"I live with a very evolved man," she says of her husband, the New Yorker writer Anthony Lane, "and it would not occur to him to wonder whether it is time to go buy more paper towels. I don't know where he thinks they come from."
In the end -- warning: I'm giving away the plot line here -- Kate Reddy gives up her job as a fund manager and moves to the country for a simpler life (where she finds a small factory in big economic trouble and can't resist the challenge of turning its finances around). "That might not be the ending that some people might have preferred," she says, "but if I made her live happily ever after while staying in that job, it would have been a fairy tale."
Instead, Ms. Pearson says, the Kate Reddys of the world are doing what her character eventually does -- finding ways to work on their own terms. "Women are rejecting the corporate world and starting their own businesses," she says. "They work just as hard, but if they have to duck out because the hamster dropped down off the back of the couch and they have to sneak home a new one that looks just like the old one, that won't be seen as frivolous."
The Fortune numbers, however, hint that while this may be true of many, or even most, women, it is not true of all, and those who have reversed the equation are beginning to say so aloud. About three years ago, I tried to write about the phenomenon of highly successful women with stay-at-home husbands, and Ms. Lepore was the only person willing to talk for publication. 
Relying on one spouse to look after the home front while the other advances at work is the way men have been doing things for years. And maybe in an ideal world, we decided over her husband's delectable dinner, every partnership would include one who preferred to be home and one who preferred the office, regardless of sex.
Yes, she said, she'd felt pangs of regret, knowing her husband had the luxury of down time with the children whereas she often sandwiched that into a crowded schedule. But, she added, "knowing Ken is home doing what he does makes me comfortable being where I am doing what I'm doing."
In other words, everybody needs a wife.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
With Land Scarce, Million-Dollar Condos Flourish

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
WHEN a rare patch of vacant land appears in Fairfield County's upscale towns or a few parcels seem ripe for cobbling together, usually by knocking down a building or two, it is likely that a new condominium project will soon rise, with units starting at $1 million and selling like ice cream in August.
 Lately, the right elements for high-priced condos have come together in several parts of the county: small scraps of land unsuitable for much of anything else, interest rates at a seductive low, the wealthy older crowd wanting to get the cumbersome mansions off their backs, the two-income couple in Manhattan seeking an impeccable address but unable to afford a multimillion-dollar house. 
 Park Slope, an archetypical high-end 13-unit complex nearing completion on 1.1 acres, was formed from four parcels in New Canaan overlooking the lake in Meade Park. With units listed at $1 million to $1.5 million, it is within a block of the train station and one to three blocks from shopping, restaurants, movies, Town Hall, the library and a post office; and it is a child's bike ride from South Street Elementary School. 
Meade Park is a town-owned bonus for Park Slope residents. Covering 28 acres, it has eight tennis courts, a large baseball field, two lighted Little League fields, a playground, horseshoe pits and a lake with ducks and an occasional blue heron. 
Developed by the Fieber Group, Park Slope is indicative of a trend toward putting such enclaves in downtown neighborhoods of upscale towns, satisfying a demand for urban convenience mixed with suburban haut monde. Five units have sold or are under contract since sales opened in June. One buyer invested an additional $250,000 in customizing, $150,000 of it in media systems that include five plasma television screens (one over the master bathtub). "Buyers," said James Fieber, managing director of the company, "are paying cash. So far there are no mortgage contingencies."
These are hardly the condominiums of 15 years ago, when bare-bones units were a stopover on the way to a house or were considered a hot investment as rental property. When the economy slumped, rose and slumped again, the units often wound up worth less than their mortgages.
"Condos picked up a bad rap," said Barry Rosen, director of new homes and land at Prudential Connecticut, "but they have been strong for more than two years now, with the rate of sales outpacing single family homes. They appreciate like single family homes and that makes them a good investment, but investors are not about to buy a million dollar condo in New Canaan and then rent it out. People who buy them live in them." 
With the high-end market driven by a generation of active or retired older people scaling down from large homes, developers are responding to buyers who choose to stay in the same area, maintaining social and business connections. They still want large, luxurious, conservatively styled homes and quality construction that holds its value. So condos must replicate as much as possible the ambience the buyers are leaving behind.
THE 13 Park Slope units are in five buildings: two free-standing houses, two buildings with three units each and one five-unit building. All units have large center halls with mahogany-railed stairways and archways embellished with detailed wood moldings that offer views into the living and dining rooms, wainscoting throughout the first floor, high ceilings, Italian marble fireplace surrounds and marble master bathrooms, equipped with spa tubs and stall steam showers. (Two additional bedrooms and bath are slightly less luxurious.) 
Each 3,500-square-feet unit also has woodwork details on mantels, a mahogany-paneled library, an enormous walkout family room, a laundry room, mahogany-paneled elevator and a maid's suite with walk-in closet and bath. 
Other desirable characteristics include maintenance-free landscaping; large rooms accommodating lifelong acquisitions of furniture, antiques, books and paintings; an optional home office or exercise room; and a spacious kitchen equipped with prodigious cabinetry, granite countertops and Viking appliances. 
Joanne Carroll, publisher of Connecticut Builder magazine and past president of the Fairfield County Home Builders Association, noted, "Some builders who had not been doing condos for a while are back doing them, because land is at such a premium you can get more housing on less land by doing small lot detached or attached housing, and they are appreciating at a faster rate than single-family homes."
Park Slope is a third generation project of the Fieber Group, a family company founded by Sol Fieber, a general contractor in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens early in the 20th century. Carried on by his son Norman Fieber, who moved the business to Stamford 30 years ago, it is now run by Norman's three sons: James, 48, managing director; Robert, 46; and William, 42.
They are currently developing plans for a 59-unit complex of million dollar-plus condos on Long Ridge Road in Stamford, on a 30-acre tract their father bought 30 years ago. In partnership with Steve Hoffman, who sold the Hoffman family's Stamford fuel business to Chevron, and Clay Fowler, a well-known Stamford developer, the Fiebers will submit their proposal to the city's planning and zoning boards in December or January.
Among several other developers focusing on Fairfield County's high-end condo market, Jerry Effren opened sales on 2,000-square-foot units on Hamilton Avenue in Greenwich in April, and 15 of the 16 units have been sold. Priced from $800,000 to just under $1 million, they have attracted mostly city-oriented commuters who can walk to the train station and downtown Greenwich and who regard the location, tucked into a street lined with modest 1930's two-family homes, as a nonissue. He expects to open a similar 16-unit complex in six buildings on LeGrand Avenue in Greenwich next spring, starting at $875,000. 
Spectrum Skanska of Valhalla, Westchester County, and Sterling Properties of Livingston, N.J., have joined to build a gated community in Westport to be called Terra Nova. The vacant 15-acre property is on Route 1 at the Norwalk border and is "all rock," according to Mitchell C. Hochberg, chief executive of Spectrum Skanska, a unit of Skanska, a Swedish company. 
The project, an attached town house complex of 54 units measuring 1,800 to 3,000 square feet in 16 buildings, will be geared for empty-nesters. With starting prices in the mid-$700,000's, the units will offer ground-floor master suites, lavishly equipped kitchens, two and three bedrooms, two-car garages and walk-out basements, which can be finished at extra cost as home theaters, offices or other uses. Like most of the new developments meant for older adults, each unit will have an elevator. 
Terra Nova will also have a private outdoor pool and cabana. A sales office will open at 190 Main Street in downtown Westport next month.
The Danbury office of the Ginsburg Development Companies of Westchester, whose principal business is creating condominium communities, has been building in Connecticut in the midprice range. Redding Woods is a completed enclave of 23 free-standing condominiums in Redding, and Woodland Hills in Danbury will eventually contain 252 condominium homes of 1,400 to more than 3,000 square feet in 81 buildings. More than 90 units have been sold, with 70 to be occupied this year. Prices range from the high $200,000's to $400,000 without options, and some buyers have been investing up to $40,000 for extras. The company recently received approval for 92 units in Newtown, restricted to households in which one member is 55 or older.
Other Fairfield County towns that would seem appropriate for million dollar condominiums, including Darien and Wilton, have them, but because of zoning restrictions and lack of available land no new projects have been built for at least five years, according to planning and zoning officials.
The concept of million dollar condo complexes was born in Greenwich in 1989, when Johnson Lee, who had been building homes for Fortune 500 executives in Fairfield County for years, sensed a new high-end market for condominiums among Greenwich's wealthy older residents seeking a simpler lifestyle and freedom from home maintenance. He built an elegant project called Waterford overlooking Cos Cob Harbor and astonished the real estate community by charging $1.5 million and more per unit when the market high was about $500,000. He had breached the million dollar mark in the state for the first time. 
There is now a waiting list of potential buyers for Waterford's 24 units. One three-bedroom unit of 3,500 square feet is on the market for $2.695 million.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
In the Scuffed Shoes Of Women Scraping By

BYLINE:  By MARC WEINGARTEN; Marc Weingarten writes about popular culture for Entertainment Weekly and Slate.com.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
THE stage adaptation of "Nickel and Dimed" begins with a frantic whoosh of coffee shop bustle, as uniformed waitresses sprint from table to table, barking out orders and quips.
 At first, this frenetic tableau looks like a remake of the old Linda Lavin sitcom, "Alice." One of the characters even has the temerity to tell a co-worker to "kiss my sticky buns." For those readers who have made Barbara Ehrenreich's book from last year, "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America" (Metropolitan/Holt), a best seller, that light-hearted scene might strike a discordant note. Is this the same "Nickel and Dimed" that turned an empathetic eye and ear to the lives of women on the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder? 
 But the episode is just a sly feint, a diversion before the devastation sets in. What finally emerges from Joan Holden's adaptation of Ms. Ehrenreich's first-person account of the working poor is an examination of the lives of women who were shoe-horned into the labor market in 1998, post-welfare reform -- a number that exceeds four million.
Directed by Bartlett Sher, the artistic head of the Intiman Theater in Seattle, where the play originated, "Nickel and Dimed" is currently playing, through Oct. 26, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, where it has generally received positive reviews. The Los Angeles Times praised Ms. Holden for her faithful adaptation, which "softens the agitprop by taking nonpolitical pleasure in a wide range of human behavior on view," while The Hollywood Reporter found the book's "interplay of irony, humor and desperation" present and accounted for in the play. (A separate production will be presented by the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., from Jan. 31 through March 9.) 
At first blush, the book would seem a poor candidate for theatrical treatment. In 1998 Ms. Ehrenreich, a well-known essayist and social critic who was on assignment for Harper's Magazine, went under cover without middle-class appurtenances -- no cell phone or 401K, just some clothes and a little start-up money -- to see if she could survive as a member of the working poor. She toiled as a waitress in Florida, cleaned houses in Maine and clerked at a Wal-Mart in Minnesota. Along the way, she encountered women living quietly desperate lives as they tried to scrape together enough to eat and provide a roof, any roof, over their own and their children's heads. From her experiences emerged the Harper's article, and the book, which was published in May 2001. 
It is hardly the stuff of a feel-good commercial hit. Even the author was skeptical about a theatrical production. "I don't know much about theater," Ms. Ehrenreich said from her home in Key West, Fla. "It sounded a little flaky to me. I couldn't imagine how anyone would make the book a play."
But Mr. Sher was convinced that "Nickel and Dimed" would resonate with the same theatergoers who made, say, "Mamma Mia!" a blockbuster. His epiphany came one day while driving to work. "I heard Barbara Ehrenreich talking about the book on NPR one morning, and it basically turned my head inside out," Mr. Sher said. "As an artistic director, so much of my time is spent courting wealthy donors, and here was this women telling me that the working poor subsidize our lives. It was a breakout idea for me."
A native of San Francisco, Mr. Sher called Joan Holden, whose original productions for the San Francisco Mime Troupe over 30 years blended fanciful artifice with socially conscious subjects. Ms. Holden, who is also a translator of playful social critics like Dario Fo and Moliere, seemed the ideal writer to transform Ms. Ehrenreich's working-class picaresque into something that would entertain yet still prick the prejudices of middle class audiences. 
Ms. Ehrenreich's caustic narrative voice seemed ideally suited for the stage, and much of the play's dialogue is lifted from the book. The set pieces that make up the three acts are loosely connected by monologues provided by the Ehrenreich character, played by Sharon Lockwood, a Mime Troupe veteran.
But for Ms. Holden and Mr. Sher, having Ms. Ehrenreich comment on the action was not enough. The author had to become engaged, to endure the hardships as she chronicled them. For the Taper production, Ms. Holden took her cue from the Seattle critics. They had felt the play did a poor job of making the Ehrenreich character theatrically dramatic, so she emphasized Ms. Ehrenreich's internal conflict between dispassionate objectivity and moral outrage.
"There is always the problem, in plays and in the movies, of the reporter being a detached observer," Ms. Holden said. "The reporter is essentially a witness, and the motivational drive isn't that compelling. But what I found, in reading the book, is that there are many allusions to Barbara's working-class forebears. She is doing it for her ancestors. Elite education and privilege have not made her blood run thin."
In the play, Ms. Ehrenreich's simmering indignation slowly rises to the surface. During the second act, while toiling for a housecleaning service, she tries to organize a work stoppage when her supervisor, played by Kristin Flanders, injures her foot on the job. By the third act, Ms. Ehrenreich, fatigued and beaten down by her job as a retail clerk, realizes the limits of her good intentions. Homeless and nearly broke, she walks back into her real life just before falling off the precipice of her invented one. 
According to Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, Ms. Ehrenreich's emotional journey is the play's crucial connective tissue. "That was something Joan wanted to work on in Seattle before the play came to L.A., and I encouraged her," Mr. Davidson said. "Barbara's perspective had to be sharpened."
Ms. Ehrenreich's anxious sense of cultural dislocation is mirrored by Mr. Sher's kinetic staging, in which perpetually moving bodies seem to be mortally afraid of what repose might to do their weekly wages. To hear Mr. Sher tell it, his direction of "Nickel and Dimed" was influenced by Pina Bausch and "I Love Lucy," with a dash of Kafka's "Trial" thrown in for good measure. 
Despite the harsh lessons the Ehrenreich character learns about the struggles of the working poor, it is unclear if audiences will care enough to give the play's issues much thought once the house lights are turned on.
"I think most people who see it will not organize living-wage campaigns," Ms. Holden said. "But I can't see how it will not make them stop to consider the working poor. Plus, if it makes people a better tipper and they pay their cleaning ladies more, that's accomplishing something."

HEADLINE: Festival's Highlights Tinged With Unease 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
FOLLOWING on the heels of better-known events in Toronto, Telluride, Colo., and New York, the Hamptons International Film Festival, now in its 10th year, has always had a hard time snagging splashy premieres or grabbing headlines. With the debut in May of the heavily publicized TriBeCa film festival, the competition for intriguing discoveries has become even more intense.
 Unlike the Sundance and TriBeCa festivals, the Hamptons festival does not have a Redford or a DeNiro to give it high visibility. But despite its relatively low profile, the festival, which runs from Wednesday through Sunday, seems to have no trouble attracting audiences, drawing heavily from the East End's population of second-home owners. Last year, 22,000 tickets were sold, said Denise Kasell, the executive director of the festival. 
 Ms. Kasell said that many of the 70 feature films this year had a common thread. "They are serious films that are intellectually challenging," she said. "They deal with issues we might find a little uncomfortable, but they are in no way sensational." 
The festival opens with "Rabbit-Proof Fence," a drama by Philip Noyce about the forced relocation of aboriginal children in Australia. It closes with a German hit, "Nowhere in Africa," that tells the story of a family that emigrates to Kenya to escape the Nazis.
The Films of Conflict and Resolution series also deals with weighty themes, with documentaries about the threat of nuclear war between India and Pakistan, genocide in Rwanda, hunger strikes in Northern Ireland and the role of personal video recorders in exposing human-rights abuses. "Secret Lives: Hidden Children and Their Rescuers," by the Oscar-winning filmmaker Aviva Slesin, focuses on people who risked their lives to shelter Jewish children during the Holocaust.
For those who want a break from such sober subject matter, there will be a lot of other choices. Among the films vying for the annual Golden Starfish award is "Kiss the Bride," a comedy by Vanessa Parise. The View from Long Island category, films by local filmmakers, will feature "You Stupid Man," a romantic comedy directed by Brian Burns and starring Milla Jovovich. Another in that series is "The Real Hamptons," Jeff Dell's response to the recent nationally televised documentary that enraged local residents.
The films were selected by Rajendra Roy, the new programming director, who was previously the manager of the film and media arts program at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. Bringing in Mr. Roy, 30, and adding programs at Southampton College's Avram Theater represent an attempt to broaden the festival's appeal to younger filmgoers, said Stuart Match Suna, the festival chairman and the president of Silvercup Studios in Queens. 
Films will also be shown at the United Artists Theaters in East Hampton, the Sag Harbor Cinema and the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center.
In past years, some festivalgoers have complained that the theaters were too spread out, making it hard to schmooze between films. This year a tent will be set up on Main Street in East Hampton to serve as a gathering point, Mr. Roy said. Eugene Hernandez, editor-in-chief of Indie Wire (www.indiewire.com), an online daily newsletter, will lead a discussion each afternoon.
Begun in 1993 as a memorial to the Time Warner chairman Steven J. Ross, the Hamptons festival has always had two goals: to showcase independent films and to give a post-season lift to local businesses.
"It's very good for our economy," said Marina Van, the executive director of the East Hampton Chamber of Commerce.
Some people in Hollywood dismiss the Hamptons festival as local boosterism that lacks both cachet and artistic merit. But Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, places it in the second tier of festivals, on a par with those in Chicago; Seattle; Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Miami. "If you put your movie there," said Mr. Bernard, "you're going to get name awareness." 
Sony Pictures Classics' "Love Liza," starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, will have its East Coast premiere at the festival on Saturday. "We felt there are a lot of Academy members out there," said Mr. Bernard. "It's a way to kick off an Oscar campaign."
"Love Liza" is one of this year's hot tickets, Ms. Kasell said. Other films that were selling out quickly included "The Safety of Objects," starring Glenn Close; "Roger Dodger," with Campbell Scott and Isabella Rossellini; and "Ripley's Game," based on a novel in a series by Patricia Highsmith.

Office Vacancies Continue in Rise in Parsippany

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: PARSIPPANY 

 BODY:
THE commercial real estate market in New Jersey continues to "reach for new depths," according to Cushman & Wakefield's third-quarter report, and Parsippany is a perfect example of some unfortunate trends. On the other hand, this city -- northern New Jersey's third-largest submarket -- exhibits qualities that experts say position it well for a rebound, including excellent highway access, diverse kinds of commercial space and no overbuilding. 
 Sales of commercial property to investors continued at a good pace, even as vacancy rates continued to rise. The vacancy rate for commercial space went up 22 percent in Parsippany during the third quarter, compared with 19.2 percent one year earlier, C.& W. reported, and for all of northern New Jersey, the vacancy rate rose to 15.8 percent from 12 percent the year before. In central New Jersey vacancies reached 20 percent for the first time since 1995. Statewide, the rate is 17.9 percent, compared with 12.4 percent 12 months ago. 
 The highest vacancy rate by far is in Franklin Township, where AT&T and Merrill Lynch moved out and put large blocks of space on the market. The town's vacancy rate, 42.4 percent, is more than double the rate of 16.9 percent at the same point of 2001.
A plethora of space available for sublease continues to inflate vacancy rates -- in Parsippany, in Franklin and statewide. This is a result of the wave of corporate downsizing and consolidation and also the unprecedented quantities of space that were put on the market after Sept. 11, 2001, to meet an expected heavy demand that never materizalized, market specialists say. 
In Parsippany, 45 percent of the commercial space on the market is sublease space. The Hudson waterfront and Newark real estate submarkets are larger, but Parsippany has the most sublease space available, 1.17 million square feet, C.& W. said.
The two biggest spaces available in Parsippany are the 317,000-square-foot office at 5 Wood Hollow Drive that American Express occupied temporarily after Sept. 11 and 270,000 square feet at Morris Corporate Center IV leased long term to Aventis.
Aventis moved out of Parsippany more than a year ago. The company recently announced it would reoccupy 70,000 square feet at Morris Corporate Center. But the 270,000-square-foot block of space is being kept on the market for sublease.
The Morris Corporate Center has the most available space currently on the market, C.& W. reported, and it noted that new blocks have also opened up at the Mack-Cali Business Park and the Waterview Corporate Center. On the other hand, a total of 900,000 square feet has been leased in Parsippany so far this year.
While the uncertain economic climate has led many companies to hold off on planning to take more space, according to brokers around New Jersey, some deals have been made in Parsippany. Cendant expanded within the Mack-Cali Business Park at 7 Sylvan Way, taking 145,983 additional square feet. VoiceStream leased 106,000 square feet at 4 Sylvan Way to consolidate operations, and EchoStar Satellite took 67,000 square feet at the Montville East Corporate Center. At 1633 Littleton Road, the engineering firm Sardoni Skanska sublet the entire 52,000-square-foot building from ConAgra.
Still, the pace of leasing is far from what it was in the boom times before the current economic slowdown, said C.& W.'s Dennis McDonnell. However, he added, "It is not that far off the one million square feet leased annually in Parsippany during the period 1991-1996.Mr. McDonnell, a senior director who works in the company's Parsippany offices, described conditions in that time period as comparable to this one.
"I believe that the current activity level is a positive sign that the market still has the basic components it needs to survive," Mr. McDonnell said. "I remember in '91," he continued, "the slogan was, 'Survive Till '95.' Now, I guess the question is, 'What are we looking to survive till?' "
DESPITE the high vacancy rates, asking rentals have not declined significantly, he noted. The asking rate per square foot for Class A office space here remains about $30, among the highest in northern New Jersey.
Only one new office building is under construction in Parsippany. Ground was broken in the summer for a new 45,000-square-foot building at the Parsippany Crossroads Office Center. On the Hudson waterfront, by contrast, the vacancy rate nearly tripled in the third quarter because almost 650,000 square feet at newly constructed buildings at the Harborside office complex came on the market.
As for sales of commercial property in Parsippany, the market remains stubbornly healthy, as is generally the case in New Jersey -- particularly for buildings leased for five years or longer.
Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank bought One Campus Drive, the 377,000-square-foot building where Cendant has its headquarters, for $81.1 million, and the 280,000-square-foot Lanidex Plaza office center changed hands for $27.6 million.
Last month, TA Associates acquired a 100,348-square-foot office building at 339 Jefferson Road from Crow Holdings for $15.3 million. 
And earlier this month, Gatehall II, part of the Gatehall Corporate Center complex, was sold for $101.4 million in one of the largest suburban office deals this year. The 404,517-square-foot office building is fully leased, long term, to two stable tenants: the KeyBank Corporation and Gemini Technology Services, a division of Deutsche Bank.
CB Richard Ellis brokered the sale of the building, which had been owned as a joint venture by Morgan Stanley and the Gale Company, to Wells Operating Partnership. Jeffrey Dunne of CB Richard Ellis, who handled the sale, said, "As we weather the storm, going through this period of high vacancy, low demand, most sales that we see will be like this one" -- with long-term and stable tenants.
Mr. Dunne, an executive vice president with CB Richard Ellis, cited a property currently being marketed by C.& W. -- 200 Kimball Avenue in Parsippany -- as another "transaction that will happen." The sale involves a newly constructed building, 90 percent leased to a division of Novartis Pharmaceuticals for 10 years.
Mr. Dunne said those buying commercial property currently expect a lower yield on their investments, 8 to 8.5 percent, as opposed to 9.5 percent a year ago. "That will be true until interest rates go up, and the return on alternative investments goes up," he said.
Like Mr. McDonnell at C.& W., Mr. Dunne said Parsippany's commercial real estate market would endure and eventually recover. "Look at the geography: the superb highway access; the fact it's in Morris County and has lots of inexpensive housing," he said. "It is going to remain a viable office location."
Situated in the heart of an area with numerous shops, restaurants, hotels and other amenities, Parsippany is near the Interstate 80 and 287 convergence. Routes 46, 10 and 22 are easily accessible.
Mr. McDonnell said Parsippany's market also has diversity in the size and class of its commercial buildings. "The market is not driven by one specific industry," he observed, adding, "I'm a big fan of Parsippany in the long term."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
It Must Be Picture Day

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: BEDFORD HILLS 

 BODY:
WENDY CROWELL knelt in front of a small girl with a nimbus of ringlets, gently combed stray tendrils into place, and guided her back into the line of other well-scrubbed, dressed-up children here at the Bedford Hills Elementary School.
 With the girls attired in dresses or matching skirt and sweater-sets and shiny black patent Mary Jane shoes, and many of the boys wearing unfamiliar jackets and ties, it was clearly Picture Day. 
 The photographers from Lifetouch -- part camp counselor, part psychologist, and part child wrangler in their efforts to cajole a smile from a shy child, or contain an overly exuberant one -- shepherded each child through a sitting for an individual portrait and the group class photo. P.T.A. parents like Mrs. Crowell, chairwoman of the school's picture committee, moved through the lines of waiting children, fixing hair with disposable combs and adjusting clothing. 
School pictures, which mark a child's time line as much as the pencil marks scratched to mark his or her height on the kitchen wall, are big business. National companies like the Minneapolis-based Lifetouch are seeking market share from local, family-owned companies like Davis Studio in Mamaroneck, Images School Photography in New Rochelle, or Irvin Simon in Elmont, Queens, which, like Davis, also has an extensive regional business. Other national photography companies include Herff Jones Photography Division of Lewiston, Minn., and Inter-State Studio of Sedalia, Mo.
Steve Miller, president of Irvin Simon Photographers, a 56-year-old business founded by his grandfather, said, "We're big enough to be competitive and nimble enough to care."
A smaller business like Images School Photography, however, finds that "it is hard to compete with the national companies," said Joan McGrath, owner of the company, who mostly works with the schools and athletic leagues of New Rochelle.
Since pricing isn't the main source of competition, those who select the photo studios cite other reasons for choosing a national company over a local one. "They're easier to work with," Mrs. Crowell said. "They seem to keep the children under good control."
School pictures embrace the entire spectrum of the school experience, from nursery school to high school proms, along with athletic teams, band programs and dance studio recitals. The photos are offered in more sizes and shapes now, too. In recent years, as more elementary and middle schools have produced school yearbooks, previously the domain of high schools, the school-photo studios have provided images for use in those publications. Many companies also provide CD-Rom's, bar coded photos for school identification cards and other services to the schools. There are items like photo key chains and refrigerator magnet frames, bookmarks and Christmas ornaments, even giant posters of an entire group.
The increased use of digital photography permits more personalization and customized service, with companies like Lifetouch able to offer class photos with each child's name printed on them. 
Although the peak of the school pictures business traditionally takes place between September and December, with the expansion into other kinds of photo opportunities, many photo companies are now busy year round. 
Given the heightened awareness of any business that comes in contact with children, these companies conduct criminal background checks on their photographers. Lifetouch's photographers, who are full-time employees, not freelancers, undergo training sessions on how photographers should work with the students. 
The school picture market, for grades kindergarten through 12, is about $1.5 billion a year, according to Tom Crawford, director of corporate communications at the Professional School Photographer's Association, which is part of Photo Marketing Association International, the trade group based in Jackson, Mich. According to a recent survey by the Photo Marketing Association International, the average school picture package purchase last year was $29 (the average for high school senior photos was $256).
With school picture packages starting about $20 -- most purchases are $20 to $25 -- and going up to about $60 for the full treatment -- photos enough for two sets of grandparents and the extended family -- the market is lucrative. Even an uncertain economy doesn't appear to have much impact. As Steve Smith, the Newburgh-based Lifetouch representative for Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties who works with 65 schools in Westchester, said, "Everybody loves their children."
School pictures, which are generally arranged by P.T.A., committees, are also fund-raisers. Depending on the size of the school and the participation rate, school pictures can generate anywhere from $1,000 to close to $10,000 for a school. The price of the picture packages usually reflects the 20 to 25 percent that the photo companies return to the P.T.A.'s as a fund-raiser.
While elementary and middle schools usually have a better than 90 percent participation rate by families buying picture packages, not surprisingly, the percentage slacks off by high school to about 50 percent. It picks up again for senior year formal portraits and prom pictures.
To help parents whose budgets are already stretched, the Thomas Edison Elementary School in Port Chester recently developed a sibling picture program. If a family's children are all students at the elementary school, parents can opt to have their children photographed together. 
For the schools, picture day is a worthwhile event, despite the distractions and interruptions. "I set up a schedule, but parents are in charge," said Maureen Zygmont, the principal of the Bedford Hills Elementary School. "We combine picture day with dress-up day, and the children come out of class for a very short period of time, and go right back to class, so it's not a big deal."
Even among "too cool for school" teenagers, the disdain with which many high school students view school pictures may be only a pose. 
"This shows how many years you've been in the school," said Bhumica Patel, a 16-year-old junior at Alexander Hamilton High School in Elmsford. "It's important. You want to look good, and see how different you turned out from when you started."

HEADLINE: Pond Proud 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
THERE is something rather God-like about ordaining a body of water to appear on your land. And in creating an Eden-like garden setting where plants and animals will thrive.
 Whether it is a God complex or just good old home-improvement obsession, the craze over garden ponds in the county continues unabated. The pond industry reports a climb in the numbers of homeowners putting in water gardens, defying logical obstacles like drought, West Nile virus warnings and economic downturns. 
 At Shemin's Nursery in Greenwich, a leading seller of aquatic plants, sales have increased over the last two years, said Josh Scruggs, the customer service manager in Shemin's greenhouse. 
Rob Dietter, a Connecticut pond installer who has many clients in Westchester, said, "We have way more business than we can handle."
Mr. Dietter, who owns Dietter's Water Gardens in North Haven, the largest aquatic nursery in Connecticut, said that his pond business had grown 30 percent over last year in sales, installation and maintenance.
"Interest rates are down and people are improving their homes and investing in their backyards," said Mr. Dietter, who is certified as a master of ponds by the National Pond Society.
A garden pond can enhance a property's value, but not always, said Walter Davis, a real estate broker at the Coldwell Banker office in Bedford.
"If you have an acre or more, a nice pond adds grace and charm, and generally adds value to a home," he said. "But if you have a small plot, it can encroach upon your space. It really depends on the perception of the buyer. Someone with young children might avoid it for fear the children could drown, but others might feel it would amuse the kids."
Even the most basic suburban ornamental pond serves as an aquatic chill-out spot. Robert Hayes, 49, of North Salem, has a Jacuzzi-size pond next to his front door. It is a starter pool, 8 by 11 feet and 18 inches deep. It cost about $5,000 to buy and install. It has a natural-looking waterfall, terraced ledges of boulders and underwater lights. He decorated it with a two-foot tall cement pagoda and some stained-glass pink flamingos. There is also a small bench and three slates on the ground with these words engraved: "Live, Laugh, Dream."
Mr. Hayes built the house 17 years ago when his son was a baby. Now the boy is off to college. Mr. Hayes's wife died three years ago in an automobile accident. They always wanted their own waterfall, and he built it in her memory with the insurance money from her accident. Clearing the spot several years ago, he pulled up an azalea bush that he and his wife had planted. He found her wedding ring, which they had long ago given up for lost.
Just the sound of the pond brings him peace, said Mr. Hayes, who repairs and operates industrial boilers for a living. He spends hours puttering around it and sitting near it. He has named his goldfish. There's Petey (a black eye like Little Rascal's dog), Casper (all white) and Michael Jackson ("He's got amazing moves.").
"All you have to do is feed 'em and you're their best friend," Mr. Hayes said. "It's very peaceful. It's like you're in another world." He adjusts the waterfall to be quiet or noisy by shifting the rocks. 
The pond was built by Pete Woytowich, a local landscaper who runs his own pond business, Premier Ponds. Business has really taken off since he started it three years ago, he said, and his pond supply trailer, with its familiar smiling frog on the side, can be seen careering around the bucolic roads of the Salems as he services clients.
As ponds have gotten more popular, pond owners and creators have gotten more discerning. Michael Mushak, a landscape architect in Norwalk who has many clients in Westchester, has become a self-described pond snob, he said, because homeowners tend to hire their landscaper, "who'd be better off sticking to the lawn mower."
"I'm seeing a lot of water gardens now and I rarely see one that is well executed," he said. "You have untrained people who see an easy way to make a buck, but the ponds are failures in terms of design and ecology. They're plopped down in middle of the backyard like they landed from outer space. You have waterfalls in the middle of a mound in the backyard where you'd never expect to see one. People are getting status symbol fountains, and you can't get tackier than that."

Pond Karma
Tom and Dawn Christopher are no pond-design babes in the woods. Their house and gardens has a Japanese look. The previous owner made a Japanese pond garden out of a dried-up river bed outside the front door. There was a flat, simple wood-beam footbridge and a 40-year-old Japonica cedar about four stories tall.
"The space begged for a pond," Ms. Christopher said. 
Mr. Christopher, a painter, has spent time in Japan and studied design there. He and his wife read books on Japanese gardens and architecture, from which they glean the appropriate place for still water versus moving water, or learn that at a curve in a stream, there are better vibes on the inside of the curve.
In their garden, water now falls down a grade into a long, narrow pond. Fish glide in long laps up and downthe river pond. The waterfall runs west to east, a bad thing in the realm of household karma.
"They say you should never have water running west to east, or it releases the dragon into your home," Mr. Christopher said. "I guess we have to live with that."
There's another problem: the pond has attracted snakes, and they are eating the frogs. Recently, a snake ate one whole, right in front of their two sons. So Mr. Christopher took a garden spade and chopped the snake in half. Now he wonders if that action has brought the subsequent bad luck: his mother injured herself in a fall and he fell victim to debit card fraud.
Frogs are stirring up the lily pads and Ginger, the Australian sheepdog, is zipping around lapping the water. The dog and the children run roughshod around the pond, which keeps things rugged.

The Price of Ponds
A spiffy pond will attract accolades from neighbors and house guests, but it will also attract more kinds of wildlife than most people ever knew roamed the suburbs. There are the predictable visitors, like butterflies, dragonflies, snakes and frogs. But people also must watch out for raccoons, possums, snapping turtles, muskrats and geese. Fish must be given deep enough water to avoid predators, and plants can be protected from getting chomped by putting them in wooden boxes or putting wire around the roots.
A professionally designed and installed pond starts at about $3,000 to $5,000. But a handy gardener can install a pond for as little as $1,000, for an 8-by-12 footer, including pump, plants and starter fish. Stiff plastic basins come in various shapes and sizes. Or just dig a hole and spread out a rubber liner, which costs about $1 per square foot.
After digging the hole, drop in the liner and surround the pond edge with stone, which is called the coping.
An untended pond can pose more than an aesthetic problem. It can contribute to the spread of West Nile virus. Mosquitoes are considered a main carrier of the virus and stagnant water is a prime hatching spot for mosquito eggs. 
County Health Department officials urge homeowners to minimize instances of standing water on their property, from birdbaths to hot tubs to blocked storm drains. 
Dr. Joshua Lipsman, the county's health commissioner, said that the West Nile virus has been diagnosed in two county residents this year and that "the virus remains a threat until the first sustained frost."
"A backyard pond is clearly a thing of beauty," he said. "But if you're not able to tend it, then you should empty it."
County health officials say that there is little concern with ponds with healthy ecosystems because birds, frogs and fish would feed on mosquito eggs.
And owners and maintainers of ponds argue that properly maintained ponds, especially those with recirculated water do not attract mosquitoes.
Matt Horn, who owns Matterhorn Nursery in Spring Valley, the region's largest supplier of pond equipment, plants and fish, says that it is best to keep water moving with an electric recirculating pump, since stagnant water attracts mosquitoes and algae. Aerating the water helps fish and bacteria but is less good for waterlilies, which prefer still water. Direct sunlight breeds algae, so it is best to keep about 60 percent of the water surface shaded with plants.
Mr. Horn dismissed claims that ponds increase the possibility of the spread of the West Nile Virus. Mosquitos need still water, and most ponds have their surface disrupted by a water feed, he said.
People tend to favor "natural" waterfalls to channel the water back into the pond. Some ponds do not need filters, Mr. Horn said, but they are essential for ponds with many fish, to clean waste, and for ponds in sunny spots, which tend to get algae. Successful pond owners say that the properly made pond requires very little maintenance. But there are no shortage of nightmare pond stories, with owners forever scooping frothy scum from their ponds, tinkering with pH values, searching for liner leaks and de-gooping their filters.

Pond Population
Choosing the right combination and quantity of fish and plants is crucial for a successful pond. The most popular aquatic plants are floating lilies and lotus plants, and submerged plants like grasses.
Water irises bloom in the spring and so does floating water hyacinth. Papyrus reeds bloom after summer. The plants come in tubs, which go underwater. Plants can only be grown in shallow water. Plants can range from a few dollars for a basic water lily to $200 for special lotuses.
As for fish, the basic pond fish are simple goldfish or the Japanese imperial koi, the shiny carp that look like large, fancy goldfish. They come in bold colors, often orange, black and white and combinations thereof. Both breeds are hearty fish and they hibernate in the winter at the bottom of the pond.
Regular comet goldfish cost about $5 a fish. Koi can range from $80 for an eight-inch fish to $3,000 for a nice butterfly koi. Exotic collectible koi can cost up to $10,000 and there have been prices for koi for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Mr. Horn, sitting on the edge of the large holding tanks for fish, patted the head of an albino koi with no scales, which is selling for $7,500.

The Perilous Pond
It was a beautiful Sunday morning, but things were going badly for Dick Button at his North Salem home. His three-legged pet pig was lost and he feared she would go into the pond and drown. So he brought his visitors a pot of coffee and set off look to for his beloved beast.
"Today's not my day," Mr. Button, 73, said. Mr. Button, the figure skater and two-time Olympic gold medalist, still has the taut legs and energy of a teenager. But he has a pond problem.
He has two ponds, actually. The good one is a circular pond, about the size of a manhole cover, cut into the thick slate patio. It contains two large koi and a bubbler in the middle. It was a gift from his daughter, and as soon as he installed it, he wanted a larger one. There is no filter, so Mr. Button cleans it as it it were a fish bowl: takes the fish out and changes the water.
Down below on the 50-acre property is a large pond once used to harvest blocks of ice. It's great in the winter. The pond freezes deep black and Mr. Button loves to skate on it. He spent a lot of money building a stone dam for it and has twice stocked it with fish. But it has overflowed during storms, and Mr. Button really has not been able to make it the bucolic nature grove that he envisions.

The Pond in the Woods
The Wardens' estate in Bedford Hills has ponds upon ponds. Behind the house, there is a cluster of three that seem to feed into one another. But that is just an illusion, one cleverly produced by some fancy pump work and camouflage with plants and boulders. A weeping cherry tree presides over the ponds, and there is a lilac tree pruned into a perfect sphere. An atlas cedar droops and a squat Japanese maple holds its own.
"It's a work in progress," said Phyllis Warden, standing with her hands on her hips evaluating the plants. "You've got to keep editing it."
Mrs. Warden, in her khakis, turtleneck and broad straw hat tends the vegetation on her sprawling property full time, along with several workers. Her Pomeranian, Lucky, is never more than a few feet away.
Water is a crucial part of any garden, explained Mrs. Warden, who has seemingly managed to squeeze entire ecosystems into her 12-acre plot. There are arid pine forests and hot, sunny plains of wispy grasses splashed with purple lavender, and there is moist, buggy swampland. The estate is a former apple farm, and the family of artists that lived here kept a small pond, which Mrs. Warden expanded.
Mrs. Warden's husband, John, was the lead trial lawyer for the Microsoft Corporation in its battle against a federal antitrust lawsuit. She can be just as ferocious as her husband when fending off briar and underbrush.
In a small clearing in a woodsy area, a stone's throw from the croquet court, lies another large pond system, formed with huge slabs of rock brought in by tractor. Mrs. Warden estimated the cost between $100,000 and $200,000. Here in the pool she calls Black Pond, she keeps her prize foot-long koi. They have flowery fins that flow behind them like a bride's dress. She has learned the hard way that, if the fish are kept in water too shallow, the raccoons can catch and eat them.
What is it about a pond that relaxes you like a drug? To sit beside a pond fed by water gurgling and trickling down a rocky stream bed -- it all combines to turn the most frantic of minds blessedly blank and succumb to what Keats called "a drowsy numbness."
Anyway, Mrs. Warden's woodsy Walden was working its wonder, inducing relaxation like a narcotic. The watery idyll bestowed a sense of calm like a well-deserved martini.
James and Susan Henry, of the Waccabuc section of Lewisboro, describe themselves as "pathological gardeners." They make wine from their own small vineyard, and honey from their own beehives. 
In the early 1970's, they had a large garden pond put into a low point of their six-acre plot. The pond takes up about a quarter-acre and is fed by several nearby springs and water drainage from the surrounding area.
Mr. Henry was unable to get trout and bass to survive in the lake, but the carp he put in are thriving and keep the water clean enough to maintain without a filter. Mr. Henry, 72, a lawyer who runs a nonprofit organization for lawyers, said that the pond cost about $5,000 to build.
"Best investment I ever made in terms of enjoyment," he said.
The Henrys skate on their pond in winter and watch the deer and birds (wild turkeys, herons, and migrating water birds) that visit the lake.

The Impulsive Pond
There are several common mistakes in pond-building, Mr. Horn said. One is putting in plants too early in the season; another is continuing to feed fish too late, specifically after the water drops below 50 degrees and their metabolism slows down. 
Another mistake is to crowd too many fish and plants into one pond.
"I tell people to build as big a pond as you naturally can afford," he said. "They always wind up wishing for a bigger one, once it's in."
That was the case for Ken Sposato, of White Plains. His pond came about as an impulse purchase at Home Depot. He saw a tub for sale for $65 and he grabbed it. He got a $4 book on garden ponds and he was off. The 6-by-8-foot tub holds about 200 gallons. He spent about $200 on a filter and pump, and another $200 on decorative stones.
He dug a hole in his backyard garden, next to his detached garage and put the pond in. He got a half-dozen 10-cent goldfish from the pet store and tossed them in. Now they're huge. They help keep the pond clean by eating algae and insects.
The next year, he installed a waterfall, and then an electric fence because a raccoon ate his biggest fish.
"It's a perfectly manageable pond that anyone could do," said Mr. Sposato, an antique clock dealer. He showed off his floating iris and spike rush, and his biggest fish surfaced and puckered and blew a bubble and plucked a food pellet off a lily.
Mr. Sposato has not named his fish, he said, as he sat on the patio and talked about the bigger pond he wants to put in next year.
"I'm not that intimate with them yet," he said of his fish. But his wife, Karen, gave him away: "He's out there communing with them every morning," she said.

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
Taking Stock In Hoboken

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN MILLER

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
IT has, at times, seemed as if this city with its row after row of tree-lined streets was being consumed by girders and cranes and dust. That alone makes the bustling city on the Hudson an oddity in a state with more than its share of industrial dinosaurs.
 Stranger still, in an effort to stop a building boom that other cities in the state can only hunger for, Hoboken has gone so far as to sue itself to stop a sustained burst of growth that has left it swollen and uncomfortable -- what one planning board member described as a "free ride for developers." 
 The suit -- seeking to halt construction of a 17-story apartment complex that had won approval under the previous administration -- has become a symbol of the city's excesses. But to Mark Villamar of the Pegasus Group, a company that manages 600 apartments here, the city is acting too rashly. 
"I've been in Hoboken 30 years, and when I first came to town, the city welcomed development any way, anywhere, because people were leaving," said Mr. Villamar. "The pendulum has swung now against development."
That is what the voters asked for last May when David Roberts won a four-year term as mayor. In the year since Mr. Roberts was elected on a platform that called for a slowing of development, he has begun to change the city's planning laws.
In the most significant moves so far, Mr. Roberts has signed into law new restrictions on the height of apartment buildings across much of the city, placed allies on the planning board and the zoning board and reopened the master plan for the 1.3-square-mile city.
"When I moved here, things were a little scruffier" said Augusta Przygoda, a long-time activist who has lived here since 1976, "but it was in many ways an easier place to live. There's less and less places you can see the sun, or the sky, for that matter."
For people like Ms. Przygoda, however, there may be a break in the clouds. The city has joined a suit to try to halt construction of two 17-story towers on the city's less-developed west side. In August, a state Superior Court judge allowed construction to go forward, but the city quickly appealed; so far, there has been no decision.
Though developers were caught off guard by the city's newfound vigor to slow construction, they are now beginning to organize. In November, Mr. Villamar and about 50 other property owners who were concerned about the city's direction formed the Mile Square Taxpayers Association with the goal of "enhancing the quality of life in Hoboken and protecting property owners' rights."
For all of the recent growth in Hoboken -- a magnet for young professionals priced out of the New York housing market -- there are relatively few amenities. As Mayor Roberts and many of his supporters have contended, those living here have little in the way of parks, swimming pools -- or just plain open space.
Still, talk of stopping development sometimes sounds incongruous in a city where new construction sites seem to spring up as quickly as a rubber ball on a trampoline. In the last year alone, said Fred Bado, director of community development, about 750 new apartment units have been approved for construction.
Aside from Hoboken's most obvious asset -- its proximity to Manhattan -- several other factors have helped to lure residents and shed its image as a tough industrial port. For one thing, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School for Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, Hoboken -- which saw its population rise by 5,000, to 38,500, from 1990 to 2000 -- is blessed with an abundance of solid brownstones, and the PATH and two bus lines provide easy access to Manhattan. "A lot of cities would love to have their problem," said Mr. Hughes.
And despite his campaign platform, Mayor Roberts contended that he was not trying to kill the golden goose and then toss it out of the window.
"I don't want to give anyone the impression that we're not for economic development," he said, but insisted that "smart growth" was the way to go.
As an example, he cited a project near the city's train terminal on a tract owned by New Jersey Transit. The state wanted to build about 200 apartment units there, but the mayor said he thought he had persuaded the builders to look at constructing office space instead.
"There's an overabundance of rental apartments that's gone beyond the community's ability to rent those apartments," Mayor Roberts said.
On that point, real estate agents and developers disagree with the mayor, though they concede that the housing market there is not as feverish as it once was.
"We do not have a glut," said Norma DeRuggiero, vice president of Robert DeRuggiero Inc. Realtors.
While Ms. DeRuggiero did not have estimates of vacancy rates, she conceded that prices had dropped. "We used to have buildings that used to be rented in a minute that are taking a little longer now," she said.
That has not stopped developers from looking toward the western edge of the city away from the waterfront, once a heavily industrial area.
"These people waited 30 years to get development to the west side," said one developer, George Vallone. When the city changed its laws and limited buildings to three floors -- down from five -- property values dropped 25 to 30 percent.
But politicians and some resident groups say there is a reasonable explanation for the height restrictions: a project called The Gateway, situated among high-rise housing projects, train tracks, and auto body shops. With the light rail system expected to reach there by next year, the area has leapt from an afterthought to wildly desirable.
"At first everybody really wanted the construction because there were a lot of dead zones and blighted zones," said Elizabeth Markevitch, a Hoboken activist who helped create a group called the Hudson County Alliance, which originated the suit in July that the city later joined.
"It became clear you didn't need to encourage development anymore," Ms. Markevitch said. She and others saw the project as a potential flood hazard and pointed to a consultant's report that suggested the area could be prone to sewage problems.
But Sanford Weiss, president of the Manhattan Building Company of Hoboken, which is putting up The Gateway -- where 17 floors have already gone up on one tower, and 11 on another -- said he was certain that the legal action was a ploy to placate the masses. "It's a total political football that politicians are using to get voter approval," said Mr. Weiss said. "They're using this project as a scapegoat."
But opposition has also been building over a proposed 1,000-unit apartment complex on a 14-acre waterfront site of the former Maxwell House plant. In response, developers sweetened the deal by agreeing to donate a four-acre pier park to the city.
Despite the headaches, lawsuits, drawn-out hearings, and new laws, almost every developer here attests to the strength of the real estate market.
"I'm one hundred percent bullish on Hoboken," said Michael Barry of Applied Companies, the largest landlord in Hoboken.
And in the end, the city could reap an unintended consequence to the skirmishing: developers could speed up their plans to beat any new laws.
"There's always a race to beat the new ordinance deadline," said Mr. Hughes of Rutgers.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: COLUMBUS CIRCLE; 
The Traffic Goes in Circles, But the Plan Marches On

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
Columbus himself would have gotten lost. For 15 years, the city has been trying to unravel the traffic knot that is Columbus Circle, where pedestrians compete with six lanes of traffic around a tight rotary.
 The city unveiled a redesign last month to restore order to the circle, and to allow pedestrians to rediscover the statue of Columbus. But the proposal, which the city's Art Commission is poised to approve on Tuesday, has raised a few questions. 
 The $15 million plan by Olin Partnership, a noted landscape architecture firm, shows a lush circular island ringed by tall trees, fountains and a landscaped berm to muffle traffic noise. The inner circle, which is reached by three walkways, is lined with benches. 
The 13-foot-high marble statue of Columbus, installed in 1892 for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's landing in the New World, remains in the center, atop a 26-foot granite column. 
"This restores Columbus Circle as the great civic space that it was intended to be in 1868, as part of the original Olmsted and Vaux design," said Douglas Woodward, an urban designer with the Department of City Planning, referring to the architects of Central Park, who created the traffic intersections at each of its four corners. "The fountain will add white noise, so you'll have a sense of repose."
The overall design was generally well received by the three community boards that border Columbus Circle, but some members said the proposed trees would obscure the monument. They also asked that the crosswalks be paved in contrasting brick, rather than painted asphalt, to create a more distinguished effect. And they disliked the use of standard-issue lampposts. 
"This great circle deserves more," said Ethel Sheffer, a member of Community Board 7.
In response, the city has agreed to plant yellow buckeyes, which are shorter trees, around the circle. But city officials said the long-overdue project should not be held back by the other concerns. 
"Columbus Circle has been neglected for a very long time," Mr. Woodward said. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Fuel Gauge Is Near 'E' For the Big Three

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
SINCE 9/11, major auto companies have relied heavily on zero percent financing to bolster sales.
 Worried that such methods have hurt profit margins, however, investors have bid down prices of auto company stocks and bonds. Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, has been bearish on the group since the summer. Last week, he discussed his reasons. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. Why are you worried about zero percent financing for cars?

A. Every month, the Federal Reserve publishes consumer credit data that include terms offered at automobile finance companies. This past Monday, the August numbers came out, and they showed that interest rates being charged by the auto finance companies are the lowest in history, that maturities on auto loans are the longest in history and that the loan-to-value ratio is the highest in history.
So, the auto companies are pulling out all the stops to keep consumers at the party. But in August, car sales were 18.5 million, at an annual rate. In the fall of 2001, sales were running at a 21.5 million annual rate. So despite better terms, they are selling fewer cars. And it is costing Detroit more money to prevent the market from eroding even further. The stock market is saying that Detroit is running on fumes.

Q. What other factors trouble you about the auto companies?

A. At the start of the year, expectations for demand were very low, at around 15 million to 15.5 million units. We will probably end the year at around 17 million. But around midyear, gasoline prices started to go up, consumer confidence started to wane and restructuring efforts, which Detroit seemed serious about, slowed down.
All of which leads us to where we are today: the Big Three's competitive position is no stronger and may be weaker than it was a year ago. 
In addition, we estimate there are about 1.1 million to 1.2 million units of foreign capacity that will be added in the United States next year. That is about six points of market share, and every point is about $1 billion in variable profit.

Q. Is the auto market deteriorating elsewhere in the world?

A. European demand is starting to weaken, Latin America could be weakening and Korean demand is weakening. Japan is still stable but at low levels. And the problem is that when demand weakens elsewhere, everybody wants to send their excess production to North America.

Q. Why is there excess capacity in the auto industry?

A. It is expensive to close down plants. Meanwhile, while the costs of closing capacity are going up, various states in the U.S. are throwing incentives to increase capacity. When General Motors and Chrysler responded to their overcapacity problems in the early 1990's, they were in crisis.
Companies are facing some tough decisions about capacity, not just in North America but in Europe and Japan as well. 
As far as the demand-supply situation is concerned, there is demand for about 60 million to 70 million cars globally. There is capacity to make 85 million to 90 million cars. So capacity would have to be cut 20 percent to 25 percent to restore firmness to prices.

Q. What would make you more optimistic about the Big Three?

A. A number of things would make us more positive, including evidence the consumer is getting rejuvenated and that companies are attacking their costs more aggressively. There seems to be a disconnect between what people in Detroit are thinking and what the stock market is seeing.

Q. Ford Motor debt securities are trading as if the company were on the verge of a financial crisis. How bad is the situation?

A. The auto company has plenty of liquidity, at around $10 billion. That is not a problem. The probability of a financial crisis in the next couple of years is relatively low. Worries that this company is going to have a liquidity crisis are unfounded, unless there is a crisis with the consumer.

Q. Which stocks do you favor?

A. We would like DaimlerChrysler if the stock price were lower, and on a valuation basis we would rather be with a company like BMW, which does not trade A.D.R.'s in this country. We do like Honda Motor, which does have A.D.R.'s. They are doing well here and in Japan, are gaining share and have some of the highest margins in the business. That is a name we like.
The suppliers could be a better story, because while they are volume-driven, their fixed-cost structure is generally lower than that of the auto makers. If demand weakens, they are usually cash-flow positive. And they have a diversified customer base. In general, companies like the Lear Corporation or the Magna Corporation are better places to be than the car companies.

HEADLINE: The Ballpark of Memory 

BYLINE:  By DAVID MARGOLICK; David Margolick, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is working on a book about the Joe Louis-Max Schmeling fights.

 BODY:
EVERY month they gather on the Upper West Side, and no matter what the season, the subject is always the same: baseball. 
 It may be the game last night, or the 1941 All-Star Game, or Game 6 of the 1947 World Series. Bouncing as naturally as a friendly hop to short between John J. McGraw and George Steinbrenner, from Casey Stengel to Jerry Lumpe to Derek Jeter, they spout statistics, exchange yarns and disgorge oddities, always in the peculiar Esperanto of the sport, sprinkled with odd abbreviations and obscure names and defunct teams. All speak this language fluently, some from memory, others from lifetimes spent mainlining The Baseball Encyclopedia and the backs of baseball cards. 
 There's nothing like an agenda, but the topics are usually historic; the Yankees' recent demise would surely warrant some comment, but no one would dwell on it. Thus at one recent gathering the topics discussed included how The New York Herald Tribune helped expose the racism on the 1947 St. Louis Cardinals, how much Babe Ruth's bat weighed, and how, while everyone remembers Bill Mazeroski's famous home run that day, few realize that no one struck out in the seventh game of the 1960 World Series. On a loftier level, they pondered the classic conundrum of the true New York baseball fan: What would you do if you had Hitler, Stalin and Walter O'Malley (for the uninitiated, the man who moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles) standing before you, and had only two bullets in your gun? Actually, it's not all that difficult. You save them both for O'Malley. 
Ernie's, at Broadway and 75th Street, is an empty aircraft hangar of a restaurant, at least during a weekday lunchtime when most gainfully employed neighborhood residents are toiling a few subway stops south. But crowded around one table toward the back not long ago were such consummate New York baseball chroniclers as the biographers of Babe Ruth (Robert Creamer) and Lou Gehrig (Ray Robinson). Even in this illustrious company, though, Lawrence S. Ritter stands apart.
Mr. Ritter doesn't hold the career record for triples, as does Wahoo Sam Crawford, who played from 1899 to 1917. Nor did he win 34 games in a season, like Smoky Joe Wood in 1912. He did not drop a fly ball in the World Series that year, like Fred Snodgrass, nor turn an unassisted triple play in the 1920 World Series, like Bill Wambsganss. Nor is he in the Hall of Fame, like Crawford or Goose Goslin or Rube Marquard.
But if historians of the sport were eligible for Cooperstown, Mr. Ritter would be elected unanimously the first time out. More than 40 years ago, determined to do for baseball what John and Alan Lomax did for vernacular American music, he began interviewing ballplayers who'd been active in the early years of the 20th century, including Crawford, Wood, Snodgrass, Wambsganss and 29 others. (Chief Meyers, who played for both the Giants and Dodgers, told him, "I started playing ball when Dewey took Manila," and it was actually true.) 
Five years, 75,000 miles and two hernias later -- the ancient Tandberg reel-to-reel tape recorder he lugged around weighed 27 pounds -- Mr. Ritter turned the interviews into "The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It" (MacMillan, 1966).
The Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees' announcer Red Barber called it the greatest baseball book ever written. The novelist Nelson Algren predicted the book would "be around as long as baseball," and so far, he's right. If you doubt its continued popularity and the astonishing impact it still has on people, just check the reader comments about it on Amazon.com. What makes Mr. Ritter's achievement all the more remarkable is that he was not a sportswriter at all, but a professor of economics and finance at the New York University School of Business, where he taught from 1961 to 1991.
"I didn't think this whole thing would amount to anything," Mr. Ritter, who turned 80 a few months ago, recalled recently in his apartment on West End Avenue. Initially, that was true: every publisher that saw the book spurned it. MacMillan eventually bought it for $3,000, and since then it has sold some 375,000 copies. True, another of Mr. Ritter's 10 books -- "Principles of Money, Banking and Financial Markets" -- has sold more. But for some reason, people never embraced it in quite the same way.
NEW YORKERS love attributing their success to their New Yorkness -- which, they believe, gives them half a step on everyone else. And Mr. Ritter is very much the New Yorker. He grew up in Hollis, Queens, graduated from Boys High School in Brooklyn, and made all of the usual pilgrimages to Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds. He attended his first ballgame with his father, a principal of Public School 139 in Rego Park, Queens, in 1931. The Yankees were playing the Philadelphia Athletics. (Mr. Ritter still swears that Ruth, Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx hit home runs that day, though years later, when he searched the box scores, he could find no such game.)
But he knows that New Yorkers can just as surely put people off, and believes that his ballplayers talked so candidly because his years away from the city -- wartime service in the Navy, plus long spells studying and teaching in places like Bloomington, Ind., and Madison, Wis. -- had obscured his New York origins. "If it had come up, in a number of cases, there would have been a lot less warmth," he recalled. "I was a Midwesterner. They liked that. I wasn't a New York Jewish person, so it was a whole different ballgame." 
His obvious love of the sport also helped, as did his uncanny ability to listen. "These people for 30 years had never talked about this stuff," he said. "Their grandchildren ran away when they saw them coming, because they were afraid of being bombarded by more bull about old-time baseball." In several cases, what began as interviews turned into lifelong friendships.
Reading "The Glory of Their Times" -- a phrase from Ecclesiastes -- is a rite of passage for serious baseball fans. Many, like the broadcaster Bob Costas, who, like other broadcasting celebrities -- Ralph Kiner, Ernie Harwell -- stops by Ernie's periodically for the baseball lunch, first read it as teenagers, and never forgot it.
For Mr. Costas, a St. Louis native whose torrent of anecdotes at one recent lunch helped turn what is generally a two-hour affair into a 15-inning marathon, the book colorized a world that, until then, had existed for him solely in fuzzy, sunless black and white. "It made these guys come to life," he said of the early ballplayers. "It was like hearing baseball's Mount Rushmore, with more than four heads talking. It humanized them and gave them texture, which made them -- from my perspective as a kid -- all the more heroic." 
Mr. Creamer, a veteran Sports Illustrated reporter and the author of books on Ruth, Stengel and Mickey Mantle, agreed. "All these fabulous names that I heard about all my life became people," he said. 
When, two years ago, several hours of Mr. Ritter's original audiotapes, now housed at the Hall of Fame, were released on tape cassettes and compact discs, the book took on new life, and power, and charm. Its stories are even more winning when heard aloud, spun by weathered voices with archaic accents ("Cincinna-tah," "Eye-o-way"), with cars backfiring, chairs creaking, matches igniting, wives scoffing and pop bottles popping in the background.
Men who died decades ago -- the last of Mr. Ritter's subjects, Smoky Joe Wood, passed on in 1985 -- suddenly leap back to life. Few things can summon the dead more quickly than hearing them laugh -- and, discussing the game and their youth, these old men laughed a lot. The charmless, plutocratic superstars of today only enhance the old-timers' appeal. (But if it's any consolation to them, Mr. Ritter's interviewees regarded the ballplayers of the 1960's as pampered crybabies, too.) 
In Mr. Ritter's materials, legends like Walter Johnson, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Cy Young are no longer figures off bronze bas-reliefs and eBay collectibles, but teammates, adversaries, human beings. Mitts and salaries shrink to nothing. Dead balls and emery balls and shine balls and coffee balls and paraffin balls and mud balls fly around once again.
So, too, do spikes, though gashes are treated with chewing tobacco rather than the unguents of roly-poly, obsequious trainers. There is only one umpire on the field, the American League is still an outlaw enterprise, the Yankees are still the Highlanders. And the World Series is still the best of nine.
IT is a rite of reportage: young people interview old people, frantically rescuing their recollections from oblivion, and, if they're lucky, or talented, or durable enough, someone someday will interview them, too. Mr. Ritter is now the age of the ballplayers he interviewed. He speaks with difficulty, a result of a stroke last year. The words are all still in him, but they can be slow to emerge; phrases as hard-wired into his soul as "Pittsburgh Pirates" and "Wahoo Sam Crawford" sometimes take a while to percolate up. But Mr. Ritter's personality, simultaneously astringent and sweet, has survived. While his tongue may no longer be so nimble, it is still tart. "I always said that when I turn 80 I wanted to be shot, but no one's volunteering," he said. 
Mr. Ritter says "The Glory of Their Times" came out of a complex web of desires: to capture voices before they were stilled (Ty Cobb had just died when he began in 1961); to pay homage to his father -- his "Daddy," as he always calls him -- also recently dead; to cleave more closely to his own young son, whom he saw only on weekends, and with whom he shared little but a love of the game. So he hit the road, journeying from Baywood Park, Calif., to Milwaukee to Port Jervis, N.Y., to Bridgeton, N.J., avoiding players who'd been interviewed to death, seeking those good enough to have had long careers but obscure enough to have been largely forgotten.
Heard rather than read, "The Glory of Their Times" is more than a peek into a lost world; it is a clinic for anyone who ever wants to learn anything from anyone else. Mr. Ritter's questions are occasional, succinct, gentle, open-ended. "You saw some mighty good pitching, didn't you?" "What was McGraw like as a manager?" "How'd you get along with Connie Mack?" "What were the parks like in 1903-04-05?" Some weren't questions at all: "You must have seen Joe Jackson play, too." 
Asking no more than he had to, Mr. Ritter listened, even when nothing was being said. He had to banish his then-girlfriend, who can be heard in some of the early interviews, because she was too prone to break the reverie. "It takes a long time and a lot of luck to get somebody to be living in 1912," he said. "So I wanted those silences. But she couldn't overcome her social graces."
His knowledge was deep -- "Where'd you come up with all these things?" Goose Goslin asks him, amazed -- but he did his homework. Still, feigning ignorance worked better than flaunting his smarts.
His manner with the elderly was natural and respectful, neither falsely familiar nor excessively deferential. He treated them like people, not as relics. He could be awed -- listen to him pick up Chief Meyers's 48-ounce bat or punching the pocket of one of Ruth's old mitts -- but he was no groupie. Broaching potentially sensitive matters, like the games in which Goslin hit into four double plays or Snodgrass made his famous flub, he was empathetic. When his subjects embellished or dissembled, he let them be.
Mr. Ritter, who describes himself as an orthodox Keynesian, left New York University 11 years ago, after Reaganomics had taken over the place. "I couldn't stand my students, and I certainly couldn't stand my colleagues," he said. "I started to feel as though, 'Oh, Jesus, I've got to get out of this place.' " Even though there's a room there named for him, he's never been back. 
Besides, by then "The Glory of Their Times" had started him on his literary career. In another of his books, "East Side, West Side," published in 1998, he tracked down many of the vanished landmarks of New York sports. The book, he admits, is weighted toward baseball -- like Washington Park, where the Brooklyn Dodgers played before Ebbets Field -- and boxing (the Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City, Jack Dempsey's restaurant) and gives short shrift to other sports: racing, hockey, basketball. To him, the explanation is simple: his Daddy never took him to see the horses, the Rangers or the Knicks, so they simply don't count.
MR. RITTER was always a bit of a recluse. When his mother pushed him out of the house, he recalled, he invariably got no farther than the front stoop. Now illness has made him still more of a homebody. He has moved to a smaller apartment a few floors below his old place; it doesn't have any of the random clutter that people of normal mobility usually leave in their wake. The shelves look pruned and bare; Mr. Ritter has given away hundreds of baseball books. Nowadays he gets his baseball -- at least one game every day they play -- from television. "I don't like the players, I don't like the umpires, I don't like the owners," he said. "But I love the game."
His principal forays outside are to the sportswriters' lunches, which began about a dozen years ago. At the most recent meeting, one of the regulars, Lee Lowenfish, wore an Orioles T-shirt and a Giants cap. "Ah, a tribute to Foster Castleman," said Marty Appel, another regular and a former publicist for the Yankees, referring to an otherwise forgotten third baseman who'd played for both teams in the 1950's. 
The reference wasn't lost on anyone, including Mr. Ritter, who laughed knowingly. And gratefully: he'd missed several sessions after his stroke. With the help of Evelyn Begley, a baseball maven who helps tend to him, he returned, tentatively but triumphantly, three months later. "Evelyn said they all loved me," he said quietly. "I didn't know that, but she could see in their faces something that I couldn't see."
For all his outwardly curmudgeonliness, Mr. Ritter is a sentimental, generous man. Unlikely as it seems now, at a time when every autograph costs, none of the old ballplayers ever asked him for anything. Even so, for 20 years he split all royalties with them and their survivors; each ended up with about $10,000, no small sum for people without pensions. For Snodgrass, who played center field in the Polo Grounds, Mr. Ritter dug up and sent off some turf shortly before the place was demolished. For Hans Loeber, a one-time Phillies third baseman (and perhaps the first major leaguer ever to bat against Babe Ruth), who was living out his days in a fleabag hotel, he bought a television set so he could watch ballgames.
For 30 years Mr. Ritter hadn't listened to his tapes. "I didn't like myself. I didn't like the nasal sound." But hearing them again four years ago, when they were released commercially, he was pleased. "I thought, 'Wow, what great interviews these are,' and I lost all self-consciousness," he said. "I think all of it is bound up with the love I had for all of the people involved."
One of those people was Jimmy Austin, the Yankee third baseman whose rear end dominates the classic Charles M. Conlon photo of Ty Cobb sliding into third. In his interview with Mr. Ritter, Austin recounted how he'd hit a homer off a half-drunk Rube Waddell one day in 1909 or 1910, and how Waddell fell on his own behind as Austin rounded the bases. "I will never forget it as long as I live," Austin joyously recalled. 
Within a year, Austin was dead. Except, that is, on Larry Ritter's wondrous tapes, where he can still be heard, living, breathing, reminiscing. And laughing.

Waiting for a Big Rebound in Profits? Wait Longer

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
CORPORATE profits season goes into full swing this week, but results for the third quarter -- and the outlook for the fourth -- are not likely to be upbeat.
 Expectations are being lowered by loan problems at banks and the weakness in the foreign earnings of American companies. The dollar, surprisingly, is not helping, either. 
 A few months ago, third-quarter reports from companies like Intel, Charles Schwab, Coca-Cola, Bank One, Bank of America, Caterpillar, Citigroup, General Motors, Johnson & Johnson and Motorola were expected to confirm that a long-awaited rebound in corporate earnings had arrived. Analysts hoped that this earnings surge, coming after five consecutive quarters of profit decline and one of minimal growth, would finally help lift the stock market. 
But earnings expectations for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are now falling for both the third and, more important, the fourth quarter. Taking their toll are a weaker-than-expected economic recovery, problem bank loans, the falling stock market, the threat of a war with Iraq and the fear that consumers may be slowing their spending.
Wall Street analysts are now predicting earnings growth of 4.7 percent for the S.& P. 500 for the third quarter, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Thomson First Call. That is down from a forecast of 16.6 percent on July 1. For the fourth quarter, the current consensus is 19 percent, down from 27.7 percent on July 1 -- and there is plenty of time for more downward revisions.
The new forecasts are especially disappointing because the third and fourth quarters were supposed to be easy ones for profit growth. That is because they hardly have tough acts to follow: earnings declined 22 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Financial companies in the S.& P. have a big effect on earnings. That is because they are the largest sector of the index, accounting for 81 of the 500 stocks and 23 percent of total profits. According to Thomson First Call, the forecast for profit growth for this group in the third quarter has fallen to 25 percent, from 39 percent at the beginning of July, and to 27 percent for the fourth quarter, from 35 percent.
Earnings expectations were reduced after J. P. Morgan Chase increased write-offs and reserves for bad loans. Bank of New York then said loan losses cut its profits by $260 million in the third quarter. More bank losses are likely because banks have the most bad loans on their books in a decade, according to federal regulators. The loans include those made to troubled companies like Enron, Adelphia Communications and WorldCom.
The frantic pace of the estimate downgrades can be seen in the number of profit revisions at some individual banks. In the last 30 days at J. P. Morgan alone, there have been 16 negative revisions for the third quarter and 15 for the fourth quarter. Bank of New York has had 16 for the third and 13 for the fourth, while Citigroup has had 7 for the third and 7 for the fourth, according to Thomson First Call.
ABOUT 20 percent of earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies index come from abroad. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that these earnings declined by 2.8 percent in the second quarter and that they are unlikely to rise very soon.
And while the dollar has fallen 7.6 percent against the euro in the year ended Sept. 30, it is stronger against many other major currencies. That means that gains from abroad will be reduced -- or losses increased -- when they are translated back into the dollar.
A third negative, the port closings on the West Coast, may be limited by President Bush's move to reopen them using the Taft-Hartley Act. Still, billions of dollars have been lost. The actual cost to fourth-quarter profits will depend on how quickly the ports can unload their backlog, said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
But any way you slice it, a meaningful revival in corporate earnings may have to await the new year.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
Diamonds,Money and Madness In Brutal African Wars

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
THERE is a grim resolve to the quest of some reporters to reach the dark core of their story, their personal addition to the canon established by Joseph Conrad.
 In "Blood Diamonds" (Westview Press, $26), Greg Campbell, an American freelance journalist based in Colorado, finds his apocalypse in the Sierra Leone town of Kailahun, a place so brutalized by civil war that the only impulse left is the desire to escape. The field hospital is a nightmare, a parody of its own name. The victims are no more than flotsam, beached by the receding tide of one of Africa's cruelest rebellions. Those who witness their plight -- the author included -- end up seized by the same wish to flee that grips those whose destiny is to remain. But while the rebellion's outcome was cruel, so was its cause: the greed for diamonds that fueled sub-Saharan wars in the 1990's. 
 This swashbuckling account of smugglers and warriors, of child soldiers and crazed victims, draws the stark contrast between the gem business on 47th Street in Manhattan and the lives of amputees who were victims of a war over access to diamond fields. (The struggle was so brutal that human limbs were routinely severed to send a message of terror.) It is also the story of how De Beers, the South African-based giant that built the world diamond industry, saw the dire threat from so-called conflict diamonds -- gems that are used to finance the acquisition of arms or enrich warlords -- and switched course to cast itself as the standard-bearer of probity after decades of opacity.
In the book, Mr. Campbell reminds us that there is no longer any such thing as an isolated regional conflict that governments and corporations can ignore with impunity. The illicit diamond trade in Africa, after all, may have been used by Al Qaeda to launder millions of dollars. Remote conflicts -- wars fought over resources, wars the world overlooks -- attract those who thrive in lawless environments.
Mr. Campbell's narrative turns on a 1999 report by an British advocacy group, Global Witness. It produced evidence that De Beers had been buying diamonds from Unita, a rebel movement in Angola that reaped an estimated $3.7 billion from diamond sales from 1992 to 1997 and used some of the proceeds to buy weapons. The evidence, which included remarks by a De Beers executive acknowledging that at least some Unita diamonds had found their way into the company's inventories, convulsed the diamond business because of fears that the gems themselves might be stigmatized, just as the fur trade was after the publication of photographs showing trappers bludgeoning baby seals.
De Beers, with its formidable public relations and corporate resources, went into top gear, reinventing itself as a crusader for clean diamonds. Governments, advocacy groups and the diamond industry -- De Beers included -- all pitched in to produce a code of behavior called the Kimberley Process (named for the South African town where De Beers first made its fortune), aimed at creating a global certification system for diamonds. At the same time, wars in Angola and Sierra Leone finally wound down.
End of story? Not quite.
The solutions came too late to save huge areas and vast numbers of people. Africa's diamond-fueled wars killed 3.7 million people and displaced 6 million, Mr. Campbell writes. Some of the most notorious smugglers who organized the diamonds-for-arms trade are still at large. Many of those who suffered during the wars have been condemned to lives of destitution.
But there is a paradox. For much of the book, Mr. Campbell regards the diamond trade in general and De Beers in particular with something between suspicion and contempt. He takes dismissive note of what he calls the "megalomania" of Cecil John Rhodes, the British colonialist who founded the company, and he reports acerbically on the company's conversion from shareholder ownership back into private hands in May 2001, when South Africa's Oppenheimer family and the Anglo American mining colossus jointly took control of the company. "According to the script drafted by Cecil Rhodes more than 100 years ago, De Beers is officially accountable to no one," he writes.
SO it comes as something of a surprise that when Mr. Campbell turns to contemplating likely solutions for Sierra Leone's woes, De Beers comes in on the credit side for the role it has played in countries like Botswana and Namibia, where its stake in the diamond mining business is enormous. "The company's partnership with the government of Botswana, which has the fastest-growing economy in the world, should be viewed as a shining example of what properly organized and regulated industry can do for the good of a country," Mr. Campbell writes, suggesting perhaps that as much as De Beers may have played the exploiter, it can also redeem. 
Some people may think that optimism disingenuous. De Beers is an unusually complicated company. Its long history is built, as Mr. Campbell recounts, on the magical imagery of diamonds, which draw value exclusively from their carefully nurtured mystique. As much as De Beers is under pressure in a modern business world to be transparent, the central pillar of its business rests on maintaining this quasi-religious mystery.
True, De Beers's contribution to the economies of countries like Botswana is impressive, but it still faces an antitrust investigation in the United States and it still controls two-thirds of the world's rough diamonds. Mr. Campbell does not seem to explore this ambiguous blend of cultured beauty and business brawn as deeply as he might.
He recounts a meeting with suave middle-ranking De Beers executives in London, coincidentally on Sept. 11, 2001, contrasting the calm at De Beers's offices with the mayhem in New York and Washington. He goes on to chronicle ties that were subsequently drawn between Qaeda terrorists and the illicit diamond business in West Africa. But to do so, he draws on -- as he acknowledges -- reporting in The Washington Post, without offering his own corroboration. That is a disappointment.
Yet there is a lesson in this narrative, and it is one that advocacy groups have taught big multinational oil companies like Shell or BP and mining companies like Anglo American: They can no longer simply breeze in and out of weak countries as it suits them. They bear a responsibility not only to their stockholders but to the broader array of stakeholders. Greed can no longer thrive as its own justification. In light of Enron or Tyco, however, it seems that not everyone has learned the lesson.
Mr. Campbell tells this complex tale from a personal, feet-on-the-ground perspective. His conclusions are drawn from direct contact with the guerrillas and hungry diamond miners who drive his narrative. In the seedy bars of Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, the reader smells the heat and tastes the cold beer.
This was a dangerous project, of course, but Mr. Campbell seems far more interested in highlighting the plight of victims than in boasting of his own courage. Indeed, he says that at times, when offered a ride to the front line somewhere in the jungle, he demurred. 
Those who have followed the news about blood diamonds will find no great new disclosures or glaring errors in this sad saga, but Mr. Campbell does bring home a powerful emotional message.
Consider, for example, his concluding line as he mulls the ubiquity of armless beggars in Freetown, people who lost their hands, and thus their futures and livelihoods, in a war over baubles for other people's fingers. These are not just beggars, Mr. Campbell seems to suggest, for even the receipt of gifts is a challenge for them.
"When giving money to the amputated," he writes, "you must put it directly into their pockets."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Hyundai Tiburon; 
Hot Date That's Willing To Make a Commitment

BYLINE:  By DAN NEIL

 BODY:
FOR 20-year-olds with 20 grand to spend on a sporty coupe, life keeps getting better. In this intensely competitive class, where "best of" titles fall as quickly as Hollywood's summer box-office records, the Hyundai Tiburon GT V-6 has come out of nowhere -- actually, out of South Korea -- to run with the best competitors that Japan and America can muster.
 For added emphasis, Hyundai offers a five-year bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year powertrain warranty -- twice as long as most of its competitors'. That has gone a long way toward enhancing the credibility of Hyundai, a company that has not historically been synonymous with quality in the way that the Taliban were not synonymous with frat parties. But a decade-long powertrain warranty in this segment is audacious, since these sporty cars are likely to be wrung out mercilessly by many of their fast-and-furious young drivers. 
 Hyundai is also using its warranty to mend fences. The company recently said its horsepower ratings had been inflated for several years, blaming an internal accounting error similar to those that are all the rage on Wall Street. To soothe customers, the company will extend roadside assistance until 2004 for 1999 cars. Owners of 2000 and later models will have a choice of a 5-year roadside-assistance extension, to 10 years; a year's extension (to 6 years) of the new-vehicle limited warranty, or a 2-year extension of the powertrain warranty, to 12 years or 120,000 miles.
The Tiburon is a front-drive fastback with 2-plus-2 seating -- define that as two adults in the front and two bags of groceries in the spine-compressing back seat. Its like-sized competitors include the precociously refined Acura RSX Type S, the whippetlike Toyota Celica GT-S and the Mitsubishi Eclipse RS.
The Acura's strength is its unstinting list of standard features, including automatic climate control, power moonroof, CD player and lots more, all for a base price of $20,450. But the Tiburon GT V-6, with a price of $18,494, measures up nicely.
The Celica GT-S, at $21,555, is the dentist's drill of sporty hatchbacks. Its in-line four-cylinder engine has advanced variable valve timing that helps to wring 180 horsepower from a mere 1.8 liters of displacement. The Toyota is also a bantamweight, tipping the scales at 2,500 pounds. The trade-off is that the Celica's twin-camshaft engine produces peak horsepower at a screaming 7,600 r.p.m. and peak torque (130 pounds-feet) at 6,800 r.p.m., which means that everyday drivers must constantly stir the six-speed shifter to get the most out of the motor.
The Tiburon V-6, in contrast, has a larger engine (2.7 liters with twin overhead cams) that produces a hearty 170 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m. and 181 pounds-feet of torque at a relatively low 4,000 r.p.m., so the car requires much less shopkeeping. With the ample torque available at lower engine speeds, the transmission ratios of the five-speed manual are more than adequate, even if you accelerate hard in a too-high gear. (A six-speed manual and a four-speed automatic are both optional.)
With its abundant torque, the Tiburon bolts to 60 m.p.h. in 7.1 seconds, according to Car and Driver magazine, a bit quicker than the Celica -- which is actually 500 pounds lighter.
In this segment, customers are more likely to worry about hair-gel consumption than gasoline use, so fuel economy isn't a deal breaker. Still, the Tiburon's V-6 is quite a bit more thirsty (19 m.p.g. in town, 26 on the highway) than either the small-displacement Toyota (23/32) or Acura (24/31).
Compared with the first Tiburon of 1997 -- as overstyled as a debutante's hairdo -- the new design is clean, simple and refined, with classic hot-hatch proportions over a settled stance on 17-inch alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot tires. Sassy details abound, from the body-colored rear spoiler to the chrome-tipped dual exhausts and crystalline fog lamps, all standard on the GT edition. The intent is to wow them on La Cienega, but the inspiration is direct from Italy. The Tiburon bears a passing resemblance to the Ferrari 456 GT, with its Coke-bottle waist, rising beltline and dueling scars behind the front wheels.
The interior is similarly handsome and restrained, with a gimmick-free layout of instruments and controls in a palette of black plastic and dense rubberized panels on the dashboard and doors. Bright trim is limited to bezels around the shifter and gauges and drilled aluminum pedals.
Drivers will like the GT's Infinity stereo, with a 36-watt amplifier, six speakers and a window-rattling subwoofer. Suburban neighbors may be less impressed.
The Tiburon feels substantial and solid; the leather shift knob and steering wheel fill the driver's hands nicely. The GT has leather bucket seats with deep side bolsters that hold you firmly in place while you put the car through its paces.
Such exercises are highly recommended. This car loves to run. Its foundation, a steel unit body shared with no other models, exhibits a strength and stiffness well above expectations. Underneath, the MacPherson strut front suspension and multilink rear suspension are attached to transverse subframes that further reinforce the body.
The GT's sport-tuned suspension has larger antiroll bars and stiffer springs and shock absorbers; combined with the low-profile tires it can make the ride a little crisp, but still civil enough for the young backsides that will find their way into this car.
The overall drivability of the engine and transmission package is excellent. The Tiburon surges in each gear with conviction and ease, accompanying itself with the mellow, husky timbre of its exhaust.
The rack-and-pinion steering offers fine road feel and progressively heavier feedback. The oversize tires really grip the corners, and the suspension keeps the "body roll" within agreeable limits. When it comes time to stop, the four-wheel antilock brakes (optional in all but the highest trim level, alas) halt the car with measured authority. I'm not sure why Hyundai is so stingy with its antilock system. In a car with so many standard features, it seems peculiar to ask people to pay extra for an important safety device.
What a swell car. With all of its attributes, and a price that will make many skeptics suspend their disbelief, the Tiburon looks to be a shoo-in on some "best of" lists. But that can't last, can it?
Perhaps not. But years from now, long after the latest, greatest hot hatchback has superceded the Tiburon, Hyundai service departments will still be doing free warranty work on the car. In the auto business, that's a sort of immortality.

HEADLINE: A Promise to Love, Honor and Bear No Children 

BYLINE:  By JILL BROOKE

 BODY:
TO the women he dated, Jeff Gundersen was all things wonderful. He was handsome, athletic and successful, a Wall Street headhunter who lived in a garden apartment on Gramercy Park. At 50, Mr. Gundersen, a divorced father of three, wanted to remarry, but there was a catch: he didn't want more children.
 "I was dating women in their 30's, and for many it was a deal breaker," Mr. Gundersen said. "I had already done the diapers, the weekend soccer games and the late nights with the kids' homework. I had been there and was happy to have my own life back." 
 When he met Lorraine White, who was a decade younger, Mr. Gundersen laid out the negotiables and the nonnegotiables. Before marrying two years ago, she agreed not to start a second family. 
"I realized we loved being together and had so much in common that it became O.K. not to have kids," said Ms. White, who founded and oversees Future Possibilities, which provides services to poor New York children. "What's more important? A great relationship or a child?"
"Men," she added, "like to be the child and taken care of. They don't want you to be distracted by a baby."
More than a decade ago, Fortune magazine coined the term "trophy wife" in a cover article to describe the lovely younger spouse, often with an impressive career, who is matched up with a titan of business on his second or third (or fourth) marriage. In this age-old but newly explored frontier in relations between the sexes, both parties were seen to benefit: the man gets a beautiful younger woman who provides affirmation of his status and sexual prowess; the women gets a life of ease and social access that would otherwise be out of reach.
One part of the bargain, however, is almost never mentioned: successful men who have raised children with Wife No. 1 often insist that their subsequent, younger spouses must forgo having children. Matrimonial lawyers say the arrangement, though legally dubious, is increasingly being written into prenuptial agreements.
Men who are "on their second or third marriages with two sets of kids are saying they're done and don't want to do it again," said Janis Spindel, the owner of Serious Matchmaking, a company in New York that charges $15,000 to introduce its clients -- mostly men making upward of $250,000 a year -- to suitable potential mates.
"In return, they offer an incredible lifestyle to their partners," Ms. Spindel said. "Even if you are financially secure, kids are expensive and demanding of time. Now these men have the freedom to shower their trophy wives with gifts from Harry Winston and spur-of-the-moment trips to Paris. You can't do that with a crying baby."
Lest one think that the women who agree to such conditions resent it, many say they are quite happy. Ms. White -- not a trophy wife in the conventional sense, since Mr. Gundersen is not quite a mogul -- is among them.
"We feel like we're newlyweds and on a date all the time," she said. "There's nothing to distract me from focusing on Jeff, and Jeff on me. Our relationship is so fantastic that I have no regrets."
Last year, Somers White, a mainstay of the black-tie benefit circuit, became the third wife of Jonathan Farkas, an heir to the Alexander's department store fortune. He was about 15 years her senior and made it a condition of marriage that they have no children, Mrs. Farkas said. She, too, reports no regrets. "I get two wonderful stepchildren, and I have more time to spend on Jonathan," she said. "This way, we get to be kids together."
Mrs. Farkas also has more time to devote to charitable causes, particularly the Audubon Society, than if she were raising a family, she added.
Mitchell Schrage, a matrimonial lawyer in New York who handles prenuptial agreements for couples that generally include at least one partner with considerable wealth, said that no-child provisions are becoming more frequent. "Ten years ago, we had one every other year," he said. "Now it's four or five."
"What you often see is the man who's worth $10 million saying that there's no negotiations," he added. "These women are often younger and want to get married, so they acquiesce."
Some legal experts said that prohibitions on children in prenuptial agreements are not enforceable. A 1959 court ruling in New York said such arrangements "violated public policy and the notion that part of marriage is having children," said Louis Newman, a matrimonial lawyer. The prenuptial agreements that Mr. Schrage draws up include an acknowledgment that the provision may not hold up in court. He said that none of his clients have ended up in litigation over the matter, and that the prenuptial language was primarily to "set the expectations" of the marriage. 
Sylvia Ann Hewlett, whose book "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children" caused a stir this year with its finding that 42 percent of professional women have no children by the age of 40, said that one reason was that those women marry men who already have children and don't want more.
"It was kind of a condition that the marriage had no children," Ms. Hewlett said. "In many cases, the women really craved children, but it was a trade-off they made."
That describes Lori Glicksman, who signed a prenuptial agreement in 1998 not to have children, and has come to regret it. She was 40 and working as a computer executive for a financial services company in New York. Her husband, who had a child from a previous marriage, insisted on the arrangement, she said. Ms. Glicksman said she agreed because she loved him, and also because life with a high-powered husband, whose name she asked not be published, was seductive.
"He's an Ivy League-educated, handsome, powerful man, and that was a great aphrodisiac," she said. "You have this great lifestyle, and he treated me very well and loved me."
But gradually the situation became painful, Ms. Glicksman said. "Suddenly I would see all these strollers on Madison Avenue and be pulled towards every baby," she said. "For two years this went on, and I couldn't let it go. I thought that if he loved me, he wouldn't take away my opportunity for motherhood, especially since he was already a parent."
"I thought I'd change his mind," she said with a sigh. "I didn't."
Ms. Glicksman and her husband are now separated. She recently became pregnant through artificial insemination, by a sperm donor. "I lost a husband, but will be a mother," she said. "I'll be a single mom by choice."
Joan DeMarco is also divorcing her husband, whom she declined to identify, over his refusal to have a child with her. Ms. DeMarco, who described her husband as 14 years her senior and twice divorced, said that she, too, agreed not to have children. "We've been together for 10 years, but now, at 41, I want a baby," she said.
Why did she accept the no-child prenuptial provision in the first place? "I had gone out with so many jerks, and here was this man who was loyal and wonderful, trustworthy and good to his word," she said. "He was originally hesitant to get married. I wanted to get married. People told me to be happy with what I have.
"We then got a standard poodle. But after I got the dog, it brought out more maternal feelings."
The men who insist on not raising a second family cite a variety of reasons, including the costs of children and a desire for a more romantic relationship with their new wives. One man -- a high-ranking investment banker at a prestigious New York company -- said he didn't want to subject a second set of children to a possible divorce.
"I could afford another family, but not the emotional turmoil my kids endured because of my divorce," said the man, 45, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "I don't ever want to go there again."
Having broken up with several younger women who wanted children, he has now changed his dance card: he is is dating only women over 40.
Of course, many couples of all ages and economic status debate having children, and some decide against it. They include a small portion of those marrying for the first time in their 20's and 30's. When divorced men and women with children remarry, the presence of stepchildren invariably influences the decision whether to add to the brood.
The doubts can be as deep for women who remarry as for men. Lauren Howard, a New York psychotherapist who is divorced and has two children, said she did not want to start another family following her breakup at 37, and she parted ways with one suitor who wanted children of his own.
"I asked for the divorce and exposed my kids to a lot of pain," she explained. "I didn't want them to ever feel displaced or replaced. New children offer new hope, and I didn't want their status diluted."
The situation of the older, successful man and the trophy wife is different, however, because in the debate over whether to have children, the two sides often wield unequal power. No matter how deeply in love a couple may be, the ability of a wealthy man to dictate the terms of a marriage is undeniable.
David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles the bon ton on a Web site, NewYorkSocialDiary.com, said wealthy older men expect to be adored by their second spouses and don't like to share the attention with a baby. At the same time, he said, "the younger woman wants a baby, because in case of a divorce, she has more of a legal claim on his assets."
Jeannette Lofas, president of the Stepfamily Foundation in New York, who counsels members of stepfamilies, said the expectations of men and women who remarry can be strikingly different.
"You have to convince the man to recognize that this relationship is different from his previous experience, and that children will add to their marriage," she said. "I'll often tell men that the woman will end up hating them if she's denied the child. And it will ruin the marriage. Most give in, but not all."
Ms. Lofas said she has known women who told their husbands, "Oops, I'm pregnant."
"In most cases," she said, "the man is happy and becomes a doting dad." But for the exceptions, the pregnancy can lead to divorce.
Lorraine White, who agreed to a no-child policy before marrying Mr. Gundersen, agreed. "If a man gets snookered, he'll resent you," she said. "I've seen men who cheat on their wives and eventually leave them. You have to have integrity and trust in a relationship. No means no, for men and for women."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Julie M. Van Cleave; 
Mason Street Growth Stock Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
PICKING stocks is a lot like competitive swimming, says Julie M. Van Cleave, who runs the $55 million Mason Street Growth Stock fund.
 "You have to be persistent, and you're always going against the clock and competing with the market and other managers," said Ms. Van Cleave, a master swimmer who competes in 100- and 200-yard races. In business terms, she said, "it's looking constantly at an industry from the ground up." 
 The fund lost 10.5 percent a year, on average, adjusted for its maximum 4.75 percent front-end load, or sales charge, for the three years through September, placing in the top 12 percent of all funds that buy large growth stocks; that fund group lost 17.1 percent, annualized, according to Morningstar Inc. Over that time, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.9 percent a year, on average.
The fund lost 19.3 percent for the last 12 months, versus a decline of 22.7 percent for its group, Morningstar said, and 20.5 percent for the S.& P. 500
Ms. Van Cleave, 43, is managing director for common stock at Mason Street Advisors, the fund's adviser in Milwaukee. Mason Street is a subsidiary of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.
In the Growth Stock fund, she aims to create a diversified portfolio of big companies with consistent earnings and revenue growth. 
The sector allocations typically reflect those of the 11 industry sectors in the S.& P. 500. But the fund now favors consumer discretionary stocks, including retail, hotel and media shares. They account for 26 percent of the fund's assets, versus 14.2 percent in the index. It also favors consumer staples, at 17 percent of assets, versus 10.1 percent in the index. By contrast, only 9.3 percent of its assets are in technology, versus 12.6 percent in the index.
"We've got an economy now where the strength is on the consumer side, not the industrial side," she said.
Ms. Van Cleave picks the fund's 70 to 90 companies from those with market capitalizations of at least $3 billion. The market cap of the portfolio averages $45.5 billion, versus $15.2 billion for the S.& P. 500.
In choosing stocks, she keeps a close watch on big American companies -- and on midcap stocks, too.
"We look for existing leaders in each of the market segments," she said, "and, more creatively, junior blue chips" that are creating new markets.
The quality of management is important, she said, as is the size of a company's market. "It's fine to be a national player if a company is early in its growth path," she said, "but for bigger companies, often the most important question is their global strategy."
She also prefers that companies have ratios of long-term debt to total equity of 35 percent or less. Too much debt, she said, can hamper management's ability to finance future growth.
She also reviews earnings and revenue growth during the last five years and projected earnings and revenues for the next five, relative to a company's own history, its industry and the overall market. She expects earnings of the portfolio companies to grow 10 percent this year, on average, and 16 percent in 2003.
The fund recently bought more shares of Kohl's, the clothing chain based in Menomonee Falls, Wis. She started buying shares when the fund started in April 1997, and has paid $27.64, on average, adjusted for stock splits, for the entire position. The stock now trades at $52.40. 
"Kohl's has created a new retailing concept," she said, offering the convenience of discount stores with the name brands of department stores -- and at attractive prices. 
"They run weekly circular ads in newspapers, and when you go in, they have the featured merchandise in the size and the color you need," she said. "In merchandising, that's key." 
She estimates that the company's earnings will grow 24 percent a year, on average, over the next five years.
Another stock that has always been in the fund's portfolio is Ecolab, a commercial cleaning products company based in St. Paul. She paid $29.84, split-adjusted, on average, for the shares; they closed on Friday at $46.22.
Ecolab differentiates itself with strong service, Ms. Van Cleave said. "Management created a nationwide network," she said, "so companies like Disney with national reach could use Ecolab products." She projects earnings to grow 13 percent a year, on average, over the next five years.
MS. VAN CLEAVE refers to Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle maker, as "experts on brand management."
"It's the one company that can get you to tattoo its name on your arm." she added.
Harley will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. That will raise its visibility, she said, and help market its new products. She projects five-year earnings growth of 18 percent a year, on average.
She began buying the shares in February 1998, paying a split-adjusted $25.48, on average. The stock now trades at $50.15.

HEADLINE: Calpers Wears a Party, or Union, Label 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
THE California Public Employees' Retirement System, perhaps the nation's most prominent champion of shareholder rights, has never suffered from an ill that plagues corporate America: a supine board, unable to thwart managers' worst instincts.
 In fact, Calpers, as it is known, is showing signs of the opposite problem, some critics say: a board so activist, so eager to promote social change through investing, that its effectiveness as a corporate watchdog and its ability to provide for the 1.3 million public employees whose pensions it guarantees are in question. 
 Calpers, at $136 billion the nation's largest public pension fund, is throwing its weight behind new goals: creating jobs, rejuvenating inner cities, providing affordable housing and putting pressure on developing countries to give citizens basic freedoms.
Calpers officials say that the top priority continues to be seeking maximum returns, that the fund has not abandoned its mission of pressuring companies on behalf of investors. But outsiders say these assertions mask an important shift. 
"The flavor of the board is changing," said James McRitchie, a state auditor who has run unsuccessfully several times for a seat on the Calpers board. "You're going to see a board that's increasingly tied to labor."
Driving the change is a new alignment in the fund's boardroom. Calpers trustees have far more power than directors have over companies, and now, for the first time in memory, all 13 represent either labor or the Democratic Party.
This situation, in an election year, has prompted some critics to level accusations that the fund has become politicized and is using its capital to promote like-minded entrepreneurs and to reward Democratic donors. Calpers denies that. And San Francisco's mayor, Willie Brown Jr., has caused consternation in some circles by saying he is thinking about running for board president. 
There are also concerns that the board's new tilt may have prompted at least some of a recent series of high-level resignations.
Not everyone in the Calpers boardroom wholeheartedly favors investing to bring about social change. But with Gov. Gray Davis expected to win a second term, and with union advocates vying for several seats on the board, the labor movement has a clear shot at a goal it has dreamed about for years: the ability to steer huge blocks of capital toward investments favorable to labor.
"The labor folks want to control Calpers's board because that's where the money is," Mr. McRitchie said. "Unions are realizing that pension funds are a stronger tool than collective bargaining." 
The unions may well be right. When investors own a large-enough stake or forge a like-minded coalition of owners, they can influence corporate policy on many issues, like capital investment, social policy and even labor relations. Union strategists say retirement-plan assets have too often been used to finance projects that ultimately hurt workers; getting a say at pension funds, they contend, would help right the balance.
"These institutions set the tone for the capital markets," said William Patterson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s office of investment. He said the public fund most badly burned by Enron was the Florida Retirement Fund, in which none of the three board members represent employees' interests.
"If the workers had had some kind of oversight, somebody would have said, 'Wait a second,' " when Enron executives began dumping their stock, Mr. Patterson said.
Not everyone views labor's involvement in such a positive light. Corporations worry, for example, that the phenomenon of unions as heavyweight investors will inevitably strengthen labor's power in collective bargaining. Some union officials think their job is to seek better benefits, not broad social change.
Some California public employees view the new mood at Calpers with alarm, too, saying their retirement nest eggs are not a suitable tool for advancing a social cause, worthy or not. And some shareholder advocates fear that the gains for organized labor at Calpers will embolden unions to push the same agenda at other public pension funds.
Richard H. Koppes, a former Calpers general counsel who for 10 years ran the fund's corporate governance program, said plan participants sometimes spotted him around Sacramento, where Calpers is based, and asked whether their pensions were safe. They are: Calpers is legally bound to pay a specified level of benefits. If it falls short, California taxpayers must make up the difference. 
But Mr. Koppes, a self-proclaimed "lifelong Democrat" who favors many goals now being espoused at Calpers, still doubts that those goals square with the fund's most fundamental obligation. "The bottom line for the board has to be their fiduciary duty to the members," said Mr. Koppes, now head of the corporate governance practice at the law firm Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. 
"But there is a challenge," he added. "There is a pull to use some of these funds for purposes other than the bottom line."
FOR more than a decade, Calpers has put its muscle behind the idea that a well-governed corporation -- one with a vigorous, independent board -- will reward investors more richly than one with an insider board wielding a rubber stamp. Resistant but forced to listen, the boards of giants like General Motors, Eastman Kodak, Mattel and Tyco International have responded with basic reforms.
That background makes the situation in Calpers's boardroom all the more striking. Seven of its 13 trustees are either political appointees or elected state officials.
The other six are elected to staggered four-year terms by Calpers beneficiaries and, in practice, come from public-employee unions. With 6 of the 13 votes, labor has one of its biggest boardroom contingents anywhere.
This arrangement was intended to ensure that all interests are represented: employees and retirees on one side of the table, taxpayers and state fiscal authorities on the other. 
When Republicans are in power in Sacramento, the interests of employees and the state -- roughly the same as labor and management -- are balanced and offset each other. But that dynamic has changed since Governor Davis took office in 1998 and began appointing Democrats, who have been more inclined to form alliances with the labor-backed trustees. The last Republican appointee left two years ago, when his term ended. 
Also in 1998, a strong-minded Democrat, Phil Angelides, was elected state treasurer and, by law, became a Calpers trustee.
Mr. Angelides, 49, a former developer, is known in California for his participation in the New Urbanist movement, which seeks to fight urban sprawl and promote civil behavior through the use of town planning. His developments are not just developments, but attempts to promote walking, reduce reliance on cars and bring people onto front porches. 
In much the same way, Mr. Angelides says California's vast pension fund capital offers an enviable chance to "mobilize the power of the capital markets for public purpose."
Specifically, he says investments by Calpers could do much "to close the chasm between the 'two Californias' " -- the rich and poor.
Early on, Mr. Angelides set a deadline: by the end of this year, Calpers should have 2 percent of its portfolio devoted to real estate and commercial investments in neglected communities. He also called for Calpers to begin buying California home mortgages made under a federal statute against redlining.
Asked in an interview whether investments aimed at poor communities were too risky, Mr. Angelides pointed to the enthusiasm with which Calpers and other institutional investors pumped billions into places like Indonesia and Thailand in the late 1990's -- investments that in many cases soured. How, he asked, could anyone credibly say an investment in an "emerging" California community was too risky? 
"Within America, and particularly in California," he said, "there is a whole set of 'emerging markets' -- Latino markets, Southeast Asian markets, African-American markets -- where there are investment opportunities that have been untapped because of stereotypes on the part of investors." He cited research suggesting that some of the fastest income growth in Californa in recent years has been in just such markets. 
Such locales can offer competitive advantages that institutional investors often overlook, he said. 
SINCE Mr. Angelides began promoting these ideas, they have found favor among those union-backed trustees who agree that broader social change is an acceptable goal. Calpers has committed $3.5 billion to "underserved areas of California," including about $1.2 billion to abandoned urban neighborhoods. A venture capital fund intended to make relatively small investments in businesses in poor neighborhoods has received $475 million, programs to build housing for the elderly have received $200 million and Calpers has bought $447 million of low-income mortgages.
Calpers officials said it was too early to evaluate the success of these programs. The board, however, is considering expanding them.
At the urging of Mr. Angelides and Sean Harrigan, another trustee with a strong labor background, Calpers has also changed the way it evaluates foreign countries. In the past, it rated countries based on standard financial criteria like market regulation and trading liquidity. Now Calpers includes political factors: whether the country has basic democratic institutions, and the energy with which it has worked to eliminate torture, child labor and other human-rights abuses. Mr. Harrigan, who represents the State Personnel Board on the Calpers board, is also the international vice president and regional director of the Food and Commercial Workers Union.
These standards have caused unhappiness in countries where investments are now deemed unacceptable. Corporate governance experts have also criticized the standards, saying Calpers has a better chance of securing reforms when it remains engaged.
Another recent Calpers decision, to divest its holdings in tobacco shares, has also been controversial because the sales were completed in 2000, just before tobacco stocks began to rise.
In this election year, there have also been accusations that some of Calpers's innovations are not so much about promoting democracy as about promoting Democratic politicians. 
Last spring, for example, there was a stir when Calpers made its first investment in agriculture: a $100 million commitment to Premier Pacific Vineyards, a real estate partnership that proposed to buy farmland outside California's traditional wine regions, convert it to vineyards and resell it to high-end wineries. 
Calpers projected returns of at least 15 percent. But some saw a subplot: Premier Pacific's co-chief executive, Richard Wollack, also happens to be a generous donor to Governor Davis. State records show that Mr. Wollack and his company made two five-figure donations while the vineyard proposal was being evaluated by the Calpers investment staff. 
The San Francisco Chronicle, which first reported Mr. Wollack's ties to Governor Davis, also reported that just a month after Calpers executed the $100 million contract, Mr. Wollack held a $2,500-a-person cocktail fund-raiser at his home, featuring Al Gore. 
Was there a connection? Would Mr. Wollack's project have received the Calpers money if he had not contributed? 
Mr. Wollack called the suggestions a "canard," and a Calpers spokeswoman said the vineyard investment was made strictly on its merits. 
Similar questions have been raised about two larger investments, totaling $760 million, in projects proposed by Ron Burkle, a supermarket magnate and longtime Democratic activist who worked his way up from grocery clerk and has strong feelings about labor. Records show that Mr. Burkle has donated more than $600,000 to Governor Davis's campaigns, and more than $50,000 to Mr. Angelides, who is also running for re-election.
Most of the Calpers money went to Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa America Funds, which pool union pension-fund money for investments in industries and companies that "maintain strong corporate governance practices and are sensitive to the interests of their employees," according to a Calpers statement.
Mr. Angelides scoffed at suggestions that Calpers had made the investments because Mr. Burkle was a backer of the Democratic Party. He said Mr. Burkle's proposal was evaluated and selected by the Calpers investment staff before the board voted. "They did it in a professional way," he said. 
But the denials have not stopped the California Republican Party from trying to use Calpers in its overall campaign strategy of attacking Governor Davis's fund-raising. 
And Calpers has been somewhat vulnerable, because the questions about its new investment objectives come in the wake of several nonpartisan scandals involving board members. In 1998, for example, several trustees were revealed to be taking expense-paid trips and other gifts from people trying to do business with the fund. Even earlier, questions were raised about the practice of ex-officio trustees -- who are also elected officials -- soliciting campaign contributions from money managers and others who could benefit from their votes.
Attempts to tighten the fund's conflict-of-interest rules have failed in recent years, and in some cases provoked clashes, as when the state controller, Kathleen Connell, sued Calpers to strike down a set of rules limiting ex officio trustees' ability to raise campaign money. She also brought suit over Calpers's staff salaries.
These conflicts may at least partly explain some recent departures. Since 2000, Calpers has lost its chief executive, deputy executive officer, general counsel, two chief investment officers and various subordinates. "It's scary," said one staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "To the extent we get headhunter calls -- and everybody who deals with investments gets them -- we're more open to them."
A new chief executive, Fred R. Buenrostro Jr., now the chief deputy director of California's department of personnel administration, will take charge in December. 
In addition, the president of the Calpers board, William Dale Crist, an economics professor who has served for 15 years, has chosen not to run again when his term expires at the end of the year. Michael Flaherman, a Harvard-educated transportation economist whom some in the shareholder-rights movement had hoped would succeed Dr. Crist, is also stepping down at year-end.
Dr. Crist said he was retiring because he is 64 and wants to pursue other interests. Mr. Flaherman said he was not leaving because of boardroom dynamics but to seek experience in the private sector. 
"We all have significant frustrations about the fishbowl element," Mr. Flaherman said, referring to the trustees' tendency to air their differences in public. "But it's really not a reason why I'm leaving."
Mr. Koppes, the former general counsel, said it would be up to Mr. Buenrostro to decide whether to promote or resist the board's current efforts to expand Calpers's influence in the world. "This is an active, policy-making board, and the risk is that it becomes too active and tries to do management's job," Mr. Koppes said. "That's going to be the big challenge for Fred: to say, 'No, you cannot micromanage.' "

HEADLINE: To Be Rich, Chinese and in Trouble: 3 Tales 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
THE actress and businesswoman Liu Xiaoqing may have crossed the line when she proclaimed herself, apparently optimistically, as China's first female billionaire.
 Yang Rong, the chief executive of one's of China's largest automakers, may have gone too far when he threatened to move operations somewhere where officials would treat him better. 
 And Yang Bin's attention-grabbing bid to transform himself from a troubled orchid tycoon into North Korea's capitalist ambassador was, in retrospect, a bit too brash.
Ms. Liu and Yang Bin are now under arrest. Yang Rong fled to Los Angeles last month, contending that he faced persecution in China. The three tested the limit of China's tolerance for flamboyant entrepreneurs -- and found it. 
China's nouveaux riches are not going to jail for arrogance, exactly. But as top officials prepare to formally welcome some private entrepreneurs to join the Communist Party next month, they are also insisting that at least some rich people start playing by the rules.
Authorities have begun selectively enforcing tax, securities and zoning laws on a handful of businessmen and celebrities known for flaunting their wealth and proclaiming their independence. The message is clear: as capitalism becomes more legitimate in China, capitalists should act less like rogues.
"A few people in China have gotten rich beyond imagination, and the government needs to show that it controls rich people, too," said Liu Huan, a finance expert at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing. "Private entrepreneurs have higher status now than before, but they also have more demands on them."
The crackdown on industry titans shows how China's economy -- however robust and Westernized it appears on the surface -- still answers to an ossified political system. The country has a growing number of multimillionaires and even a few billionaires, but their fortunes depend on the whims of a handful of Communist Party officials.
China recognizes that private enterprise, long the most dynamic part of the economy, has become its mainstay. As state-run companies continue to shrink and lay off workers, the private sector has surged ahead, increasing efficiency and production as well as the personal wealth of an entrepreneurial elite. Privately run businesses now account for just over half of the gross domestic product and employ 130 million people -- the lion's share of industrial workers, but only about one-fifth the total work force.
At least on paper, China has built the legal infrastructure to enforce commercial laws much as the United States does. The difference is that real enforcement occurs only when party bosses in Beijing decide that the time has come, and when they identify capitalists who have fallen from favor.
Wu Guoguang, an expert on Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, dismissed the idea that Chinese authorities had begun to insist on broad compliance with laws on the books. "If you started enforcing all the laws you'd have to throw every businessman in jail," Mr. Wu said. "Crackdowns like this happen for political reasons, and they target people selectively."
The cases of the two Mr. Yangs, who are not related, and Ms. Liu have different backgrounds, and they appear to have been under investigation for varying amounts of time -- in Ms. Liu's case, as long as five years. Still, they have a few things in common. All three names appeared last year on Forbes magazine's list of China's wealthiest people -- Yang Bin placed second, with an estimated $900 million in assets; Yang Rong came in third, with $840 million; and Ms. Liu was 45th, with $70 million.
They are among the most widely known businesspeople in China. Ms. Liu, a film star, became a commercial as well as a cultural icon in the 1980's by mixing business and entertainment like no one in China before her. Yang Bin almost single-handedly developed a market for tulips and orchids. Yang Rong navigated the bureaucratic auto industry to create the largest producer of minibuses. 
THE three shared another trait that may have contributed to their undoing: They were not shy about advertising their wealth, power and independence.
Ms. Liu built on her celebrity years ago by publishing a memoir in which she espoused an Ayn Rand-style philosophy of putting herself first, a shocking idea when China was still recovering from the radical collectivism of the Cultural Revolution. More recently, Yang Rong boasted that China's government "never gave me a cent" and that he owed nothing in return. Yang Bin asserted that his appointment as the governor of a new capitalist development zone in neighboring North Korea put him above China's petty politics.
"My role now is more than that of a businessmen," he said in a interview late last week. "I am also an international diplomat and political leader." A few hours after he gave that interview, Chinese police took him into custody.
Such flamboyance is not welcomed by political leaders. The Beijing leadership is already risking the outrage of old-line party members by standing Communist orthodoxy on its head and admitting businessmen as full members of the Communist Party -- perhaps even inviting some to join the powerful Central Committee. The proposal by President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to be adopted at the 16th Party Congress on Nov. 8.
To make the change more palatable to hard-liners, the authorities pressed over the summer for rich people to start paying personal income tax. The tax has been on the books -- and roundly ignored -- for years. Hu Angang, a researcher at Qinghua University in Beijing, estimates that while the nominal tax rate is 45 percent, the government actually collects only about 0.6 percent of aggregate personal income.
Figures like that enraged Zhu Rongji, the plain-spoken prime minister, who is struggling to close a gaping budget deficit. "Why is it that the richer people are, the less tax they pay?" he said this summer.
Ms. Liu, 50, became the nation's most prominent target. She is in jail awaiting indictment on charges that she owes at least $1 million in taxes. Through her lawyer, she has denied the allegations of tax evasion.
While it is not clear why authorities made her the marquee name in their tax campaign, Ms. Liu has long ruffled feathers in China's conservative bureaucracy by calling much attention to her wealth and success.
She became a household name in China in 1979 when she starred with Joan Chen, who later went to Hollywood, in a revolutionary war epic called "Xiaohua" -- "Little Flower."
As her film career wound down in the 1980's, Ms. Liu turned herself into a brand, founding real estate, cosmetics, food, advertising and production companies. Her production company made several television series.
Ms. Liu boasted about her earning power as if it were a measure of stardom, asserting that she had become China's first female billionaire, measured in yuan, meaning that she was worth at least $120 million.
Whether that wealth belonged to her companies or herself, the government eventually decided that it was not getting its share. Ms. Liu's companies paid taxes on a relatively modest scale, and she herself paid no income tax, according to state media. If convicted of tax dodging, she could face seven years in prison.
Hubris also caught up with Yang Rong, a former Chinese central banker who left government service to start Brilliance China Automotive, which became the leading producer of minibuses that are a staple means of transportation around China. In 1992, using his connections at the highest levels of financial policy making, he arranged for Brilliance, based in Shenyang in northeastern China, to become the first Chinese company of any kind to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Brilliance said it made more than 63,000 minibuses last year and more than 29,000 in the first half of 2002. It reported a profit of 900 million yuan, or $108 million, on sales of 6.2 billion yuan in 2001. While 2001 profits were down 6 percent from 2000, they were still almost triple those in 1998. The company also received government permission earlier this year to let a subsidiary make sporty sedans in partnership with BMW of Germany.
But Mr. Yang, 46, began to overreach. In 1999, the finance ministry ordered him to unravel a shareholding structure that let him classify Brilliance as a state-owned business even as he controlled the company himself. Without state ownership, Brilliance would never have been allowed to list abroad or borrow from banks. The official media said he did not fully comply with the order, and prosecutors now allege that he used government property for his personal benefit.
Mr. Yang also alienated local authorities by threatening to relocate out of Shenyang. Provincial officials promptly demanded that the state assert more control over the company, which it nominally owned.
Rumors of troubles at the company hurt Brilliance shares. They have fallen more than 70 percent from their record high of $37.75 two years ago. They closed on Friday at $11 in New York, well below the $16 at which they were initially sold to the public a decade ago.
Perhaps the most striking reversal of fortune was that of Yang Bin, 39. An orphan who enlisted in the Chinese navy, Mr. Yang roamed Europe in the 1980's, became a Dutch citizen and traded textiles to Poland. Later, he began growing tulips and orchids in greenhouses around China, then created and quickly dominated the market for those flowers.
An affable man, he bonded with powerful people, including Li Lanqing, a vice premier and a member of the Chinese Politburo, and George Soros, the financier. Mr. Yang's company, Euro-Asia Agricultural Holdings, listed its stock on the exchange in Hong Kong in 2001 and instantly became a hit among foreign investors looking for a way to tap into China's private economy.
Last year, Euro-Asia reported a profit of 521 million yuan, or $63 million, on sales of 1.1 billion yuan.
But he, too, appeared to push authorities and investors too far. He bought a large chunk of agricultural land on the outskirts of his base in Shenyang, promising to make it the "breadbasket of northeast Asia." Instead, he used hundreds of acres to create Holland Village, a kind of Dutch Disneyland, with life-size replicas of the Amsterdam train station, the royal palace and castles, windmills, moats and drawbridges.
The project's scale, including thousands of apartments, raised concerns that he was diverting funds from Euro-Asia to support a quirky folly estimated to have cost as much as $300 million. Official media also began questioning his use of the land, which is zoned for agriculture and is assessed at a lower tax rate than commercial property.
When the extent of the investment became widely known earlier this year, Euro-Asia shares plunged They also suffered because of the company's repeated clashes with Hong Kong securities regulators. Mr. Yang, for example, did not fully inform the public that he was selling large chunks of his own stake in the company. Over the last three months, its share price has plunged nearly 85 percent, to 38 Hong Kong cents, about 5 United States cents.
AS the pressure on him increased, Mr. Yang formed a friendship with Kim Jong Il, the leader of North Korea. Mr. Yang built greenhouses in the capital, Pyongyang, to ease the country's food shortage and donated more than 100 million yuan, or $12 million, to help North Korea buy rice and other necessities, according to a close associate of Mr. Yang.
Mr. Kim named Mr. Yang the governor of a new development zone on North Korea's border with China, called Sinuiju. The announcement, last month, caught authorities in Beijing by surprise; Mr. Yang said that neither he nor the North Koreans had consulted Chinese leaders in advance. China, in turn, surprised Mr. Yang. Police arrested him at his home in the theme park at 5 a.m. on the day he intended to drive to North Korea and inspect his new domain.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Domestic Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Marcia Angell; Marcia Angell, the former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, is a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
If it weren't for the steady beat of war drums, health care would be front and center in this fall's political debate. And war or no war, politicians will not be able to avoid it much longer. As John Breaux of Louisiana, long one of the most conservative Senate Democrats, recently told the press, "The system is collapsing around us."
 That is not hyperbole. Private health insurance premiums are rising at an unsustainable average of about 13 percent per year -- and as much as 25 percent in some areas of the country. Coverage is shrinking, as more employers decide to cap their contributions to health insurance plans and workers find they cannot pay their rapidly expanding share. And with the rise in unemployment, more people are losing what limited coverage they had. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that nearly 1.5 million Americans lost their insurance in 2001. 
 The fatal flaw in the system is that we treat health care as a commodity. That has been the case for a long time, but the effects were masked during the economic boom of the 1990's. Now, with the recession, the irrationality of that approach is exposed.
When health care becomes a commodity, the criterion for receiving it is ability to pay, not medical need. Private insurers and providers compete with one another to avoid getting stuck with high-cost patients, so they can keep more of their revenues. But this game of hot potato takes a lot of oversight and paperwork. In fact, the hallmark of the system is the extent to which health funds are diverted to overhead and profits.
Look at what happens to the health-care dollar as it wends its way from employers to the doctors and hospitals that provide medical services. Private insurers regularly skim off the top 10 percent to 25 percent of premiums for administrative costs, marketing and profits. The remainder is passed along a gantlet of satellite businesses -- insurance brokers, disease-management and utilization-review companies, lawyers, consultants, billing agencies, information management firms and so on. Their function is often to limit services in one way or another. They, too, take a cut, including enough for their own administrative costs, marketing and profits. As much as half the health-care dollar never reaches doctors and hospitals -- who themselves face high overhead costs in dealing with multiple insurers.
One more absurdity of our market-based system: the pressure is to increase total health-care expenditures, not reduce them. Presumably, as a nation we want to constrain the growth of health costs. But that's simply not what health-care businesses do. Like all businesses, they want more, not fewer, customers -- but only if they can pay.
All piecemeal attempts to improve the system -- while keeping it market-based -- have run into the following dilemma: if access to services is expanded, costs rise; if costs are lowered, access is cut. That's the way it is. The only way to avoid this dilemma is to change the system entirely.
What we need is a national single-payer system that would eliminate unnecessary administrative costs, duplication and profits. In many ways, this would be tantamount to extending Medicare to the entire population. Medicare is, after all, a government-financed single-payer system embedded within our private, market-based system. It's by far the most efficient part of our health-care system, with overhead costs of less than 3 percent, and it covers virtually everyone over the age of 65. Medicare is not perfect, but it's the most popular part of the American health-care system.
Many people believe a single-payer system is a good idea, but that we can't afford it. The truth is that we can no longer afford not to have such a system. We now spend more than $5,000 a year on health care for each American -- more than twice the average of other advanced countries. But nearly half that amount is wasted. We now pay for health care in multiple ways -- through our paychecks, the prices of goods and services, taxes at all levels of government, and out-of-pocket fees. It makes more sense to pay only once, perhaps through a new tax on income earmarked for health care (in the same way Medicare is financed through payroll taxes).
It is sometimes argued that innovative technologies would be scarce in a national single-payer system, so we would have long waiting lists. This misconception is based on the fact that there are indeed waits for elective procedures in some countries with national health systems like Great Britain and Canada. But that's because they spend far less on health care than we do. If they were to put the same amount of money as we do into their systems, there would be no waits. For them, the problem is not the system; it's the money. For us, it's not the money; it's the system. We already spend enough for an excellent universal system.
A single-payer system is not socialized medicine. Although a new national program -- like Medicare -- would be publicly financed, the doctors and hospitals would not work for the government, but would remain private. Some fear onerous government regulations from a national payment system, but surely nothing could be more onerous for patients and providers than the multiple, intrusive regulations imposed on them by the private insurance industry today.
We live in a country that tolerates enormous disparities in income, material possessions and social privilege. That may be inevitable in a free-market economy. But those disparities should not extend to essential services like education, clean water and air and protection from crime, all of which we already acknowledge are public responsibilities. The same should be true for medical care -- particularly since we can well afford to provide it for everyone if we end the waste and profiteering of our market-based system.

HEADLINE: The World: Strange Brew; 
Oil and Water: Why Prizes and Science Don't Mix

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
NOBEL fans have stopped being surprised when, come October, they learn who has won the prize for literature. Often it's someone hopelessly obscure (quick -- name your favorite work by Kenzaburo Oe, Wislawa Szymborska or this year's laureate, Imre Kertesz). Or the winner is so well known -- Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Toni Morrison -- that literary snobs can think of a dozen more deserving writers.
 The Nobel Prizes for peace (typically given more for good intentions than results) and for economics (more of an art than a science) can seem equally quixotic. By contrast, the prizes for physics, chemistry and medicine have a pleasing inevitability to them, as shown last week when widely recognized accomplishments in astrophysics, protein chemistry and molecular genetics were honored. 
 Science, unlike the arts, is conducted according to universally accepted standards. Experts can agree on what makes a good theory or experiment in a way they never could for a novel or a poem.
But that's the easy part. Trying to decide who instead of just what deserves recognition opens the door to the same kind of speculation and subjectivity that surrounds Britain's contentious Booker Prize for the year's best novel.
The discoveries to be honored this year by the Nobel Foundation are naturals. Using exotic particles and rays to probe hidden layers of the universe is an accomplishment that would make any physicist's short list. Accordingly, Raymond Davis Jr., an American, and Masatoshi Koshiba, a Japanese, will get half of this year's $1 million physics prize for their research on neutrinos, the famously ghostly particles that streak from the centers of stars. The remainder of the prize goes to Riccardo Giacconi, an Italian now working in the United States, for his work with cosmic X-rays, the invisible wavelengths of light that have revealed secrets otherwise hidden from earthly view.
In chemistry Kurt Wuthrich of Switzerland will get half the award while American and Japanese scientists, John B. Fenn and Koichi Tanaka, split the rest for developing methods to identify large molecules and show how they are built. The medicine prize will go to Sydney Brenner and John E. Sulston (Britain) and H. Robert Horvitz (United States) for discovering how genes are switched on and off to control the creation and destruction of the cellular components of life.
Even the work recognized by this year's economics prize had more of a scientific bent than usual. The winners, Daniel Kahneman (United States and Israel) and Vernon L. Smith (United States), use experiments to show how people really make economic decisions -- not as rationally as the classical theories suggest.
The same could be said for giving out Nobel prizes. For all the objectivity of the scientific process, pure reason alone cannot determine which members of the international scientific community deserve to be immortalized.
Consider, as a case study, this year's physics prize. Many of his colleagues would say it's about time that Dr. Davis, 87, got a Nobel for his ingenious experiments in the late 1960's, in which he captured solar neutrinos flying through the earth and into a detector placed at the bottom of a mile-deep gold mine. In a single stroke the experiment solved one problem -- confirming that the sun shines because of nuclear fusion -- and raised another: why were his instruments registering only a third as many neutrinos as predicted?
There is a pleasing symmetry to his sharing the prize with Dr. Koshiba, who headed the Japanese experiments (called Kamiokande and Super Kamiokande) that zeroed-in on the likely answer: many of the neutrinos change identity in flight, eluding detection.
BUT no matter how worthy the winners, the selection process is inherently unjust. According to Nobel Foundation rules, the prizes can be given to no more than three scientists. Hence the citation for the work on solar neutrinos must leave out people like John Bahcall, Vladimir Gribov, Bruno Pontecorvo, Stanislav Mikheyev, Alexei Smirnov and Lincoln Wolfenstein, who all played crucial roles in developing the theory. Absent as well are the leaders of other important experimental endeavors like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada.
The winners also must be living, which leads to another kind of distortion. Dr. Kahneman, one of this year's laureates in economics, worked so closely with Amos Tversky that "Kahneman and Tversky" trips off the tongues of economists as easily as "Watson and Crick." But since Dr. Tversky died in 1996 his name will never have the Nobel luster.
The same kind of hard and sometimes arbitrary choices are also made for the other science prizes. The result is a skewed projection of how science works.
The judges for the literature prize can honor the maverick or take delight in finding an unknown writer to catapult to fame. But no great science is done in basements and garrets anymore. Even Einstein's brilliant realizations were part of a tissue of ideas, a great work in progress with an ever-changing cast of co-authors extending across the world. Creativity and originality obviously count, but so does "works well with others."
If the Nobel prizes in science were truer to their calling, they would dispense with the people and just honor the ideas. But then there would be no one to invite to the banquet in December, when, dressed in white tie and tails, scientists from the world over gather in the cold gloom of Stockholm to toast, with feelings a little bittersweet, those among them chosen to enter the pantheon.

 BODY:
Blame the boss's style, or perhaps the e-mail server that keeps crashing. Whatever the reason, American businesses are unproductive 38 percent of the time, losing the equivalent of 86 workdays this year, a new study says. 
 The report, by Proudfoot Consulting, a management consulting company in Palm Beach, Fla., found American businesses second in productivity to those in Germany, which are unproductive 37 percent of the time, losing the equivalent of 83 workdays. At the bottom of the list of seven countries were Britain and South Africa. 
 Low productivity, the survey found, stemmed in part from poor planning and control by management and from weak morale. In America, morale problems became particularly troublesome, 
chewing up nearly seven more days than they did the year before.

Retailers have no illusions about the holidays. The weak economy and falling stock market will undoubtedly mean lackluster sales -- except, perhaps, for certain toys. 
A recent survey of toy and video game retailers shows healthy sales so far for educational toys, video games and licensed toys, in particular. The survey of more than two dozen national chains and specialty shops was conducted by PlayDate, a marketing firm in New York.

Some Ways to Keep Cold Out and Cash In

BYLINE:  Compiled by Vivian Marino

 BODY:
About this time each year, energy companies and conservation groups offer suggestions for lowering home heating bills. Heeding them may be particularly beneficial this year as winter approaches. 
 Last week, the Energy Department said Americans should expect to pay substantially more to heat their homes this winter because of rising oil prices and forecasts for more seasonably cold weather in some regions. 
 Following are some simple ways to reduce energy use throughout the home.
* Check for drafts. Examine windows, doors and other areas of the home and apply weather stripping or caulking where appropriate.
* Lower the thermostat. The Energy Department suggests keeping the temperature at 65 degrees during the day and 60 degrees at night. For each degree the thermostat is turned down, the department says, you will save about 3 percent on your heating bill.
* Divide and conquer. Avoid heating unused areas of the home. Close off unoccupied rooms and shut off their heating vents.
* Maintain heating equipment. Clean or replace the filter regularly in forced-air heating systems and check the duct work for any air leaks. Keep the heating system well tuned by scheduling professional maintenance for at least once each year. 
* Insulate. Two important places for insulation are the attic floor and the top-floor ceiling. How much is needed depends on where you live and the type of energy used to heat the home. 
* Install storm windows and doors. These can result in savings of as much as 15 percent a year, according to the Energy Department. As an inexpensive, temporary alternative, try using heavy, clear plastic sheets on window frames.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: RACE FOR CONGRESS; 
Antiwar Stance Proves Popular in Iowa Race

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
It ought to be dangerous for a Republican congressman in a competitive election to break with his president and vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. That, at least, is what the conventional wisdom in Washington would hold.
 But Representative Jim Leach's decision to oppose President Bush on Iraq looks very different here in Iowa's Second District. Calls and e-mail messages to his Congressional offices are running overwhelmingly in support of his stance. Contributions are coming into his campaign headquarters with handwritten notes, thanking him for his vote. Letters to the editor at The Cedar Rapids Gazette are running eight to one against a unilateral strike on Iraq. 
 Far from hurting him, many Democrats say, Mr. Leach's vote -- one of just six Republican votes against the president in the House -- has almost certainly helped him in his race against Dr. Julie Thomas, a Cedar Rapids pediatrician.
This is, after all, a newly drawn and heavily Democratic district, and Mr. Leach, a 13-term Republican moderate, is trying to run as an independent thinker willing to break with his party leadership. Lest anyone miss the point, Chuck Larson Jr., the state Republican chairman, said of Mr. Leach's vote: "He's very independent. He represents his district very well."
Still, even Mr. Leach's opponent, Dr. Thomas, said she did not believe he adopted his position because of politics. In fact, calculations of partisan advantage seem far removed from the debate over the war in this corner of southeastern Iowa.
"Your industry is motivationally oriented," Mr. Leach told a reporter this week. "I don't know any decision that I consider less political and more small d democratic, in the sense that I'm elected to apply the best judgment I can to the situation."
Mr. Leach, a longtime member of the International Relations Committee and a former Foreign Service officer with a background in arms control, outlined his position in a lengthy statement this week, part of it read on the House floor, most of it entered into the record. He had voiced his concerns for several weeks, and his vote was not a surprise.
He said he feared that the doctrine of pre-emption, if not exercised with restraint, could "too easily jeopardize the underlying conflict against terrorism and undercut core American values and leadership around the world." He also said he feared that an American attack would trigger an Iraqi strike against Israel, including the use of biological weapons.
Mr. Leach was the only member of Iowa's Congressional delegation to vote against the resolution. "Anyone who's thinking has got to be conflicted," he said. Mr. Leach, who voted for the resolution authorizing force against Iraq in 1991, said he suspected that Iowa was fairly divided, like the rest of the country, with a "silent majority" that tends to support the president and an antiwar side that is increasingly energized.
A poll conducted in late September for The Des Moines Register showed 51 percent favored United States military action "against Iraq to force Saddam Hussein from power." Another 32 percent were opposed, and 17 percent said they were unsure. There was a big partisan split, with only a third of the Democrats supporting an attack.
Dr. Thomas, who also opposes the resolution, describes Iowans as profoundly uneasy about the prospect of war. "There's just a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen," she said one afternoon this week. "I don't think they feel like they've got control over the situation."
Dr. Thomas said she did not believe the administration had made the case that the United States was in imminent danger, which would warrant a pre-emptive strike. While both candidates ended up on the same side of the issue, she criticizes Mr. Leach for not leading and not rallying more Republicans to his side.
A first-time candidate for elective office, Dr. Thomas talks about the issue in terms different from her opponent's.
"I'm a pediatrician," she said. "I have a lot of young people in my practice that I'd rather have go off to college than go off to war. I'd rather spend that money on health care and education than I would on a war with Iraq."
She noted that her sister was an Army nurse in Vietnam, that a lifeguard from her hometown pool died in Vietnam. "Sending lifeguards to their death is not something I want to do unless there's imminent danger to our country," she said.
For all the anxiety over the war, the campaign debate here -- as reflected in television commercials, newspaper stories and questions from voters -- is still heavily focused on bread-and-butter domestic issues like health care, Medicare and Social Security. Dr. Thomas noted that when she spoke to a Rotary Club this week, there was not a single question about Iraq.
Still, Rod Sullivan, chairman of the Johnson County Democratic Party, said it was "extremely frustrating" to have the Iraq conflict consume so much energy and attention that could otherwise go to an array of economic problems. Mr. Larson, the Republican state chairman, said he suspected that the prospect of war would lead to a pro-incumbent, pro-stability mood, which would bode well for Mr. Leach. Nobody, though, really knows how it will affect the voting next month.
What is clear is that in Iowa's Second District, particularly in the university community of Iowa City, the antiwar position gets a respectful hearing. On Wednesday night, an antiwar rally in College Green Park in downtown Iowa City drew a few hundred people, chanting, "One, two, three, four, we don't need another war" in the last light of a glorious autumn day. It was a group that spanned the generations -- many of the college-age demonstrators did not know the words to such antiwar standards as "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" -- and it was in a solemn mood.
Mr. Leach's office had sent a copy of his speech on Iraq, and one of the organizers read excerpts; there were cheers at his conclusion, "This is a precipice we should step back from." Dr. Thomas addressed the rally in person, promising, "I will do everything in my power to prevent this from being another Vietnam." There were many more speakers, and people stayed to hear them into the gathering night.

Future articles on the battle for Iowa's Second Congressional District will examine the personal cost of campaigning and the struggle to mobilize the vote.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DISRUPTIONS; 
Slowdown on U.S. Visas Stalls Business, Science And Personal Travel Plans

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
A global slowdown in the issuing of American visas to foreigners is disrupting lives in the United States and abroad. It is interfering with scientific research and business deals, forcing some people to postpone medical treatment and weddings and stranding others away from their homelands, say government officials and advocates for immigrants.
 As part of sweeping changes in government rules after the attacks of Sept. 11, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are comparing all visa applications against lists of criminals or terrorism suspects. As a result, visa applications are being delayed all over the world, not just in Muslim countries where many applicants, especially young men, have been required to undergo especially detailed reviews. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell recently voiced concern about the delays in a private meeting with lawmakers. 
In an embarrassing episode in July, the State Department was forced to cancel about 100 visas that had already been issued -- and in some cases used to enter the United States -- after the F.B.I. reported that the names had raised concerns. Since then, visa delays have increased greatly. 
Consular officials declined to comment on the extent of the problem, except to say that their abrupt release of 10,000 visas last month was an attempt to clear the backlog.
Some applicants have been waiting for months after clearance of their visas by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which normally takes 100 days to approve petitions for visas. Visas are issued by the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the State Department after applicants have cleared security investigations. 
"The fact is there are some national security reviews going on for visas," said Stuart Patt, a spokesman for the consular affairs bureau. "Some people are being inconvenienced by it, but the interests of the country are such that we must have visas reviewed by the law enforcement agencies."
The delays have been especially pronounced in China and Russia, even though their citizens have not been linked to the Sept. 11 attacks.
For example, a Chinese scientist who played a role in a recent breakthrough in AIDS research is unable to return to the biotech company in Fremont, Calif., where he works until he clears a new security review. The scientist, Siyu Fu, who has lived in the United States for more than three years, has been told to prepare for a wait of up to three months in Switzerland, where he traveled in September for what he thought would be a routine business trip, said his lawyer, Lisa Spiegel.
Universities like Michigan State are fretting over the loss of Chinese students and teaching assistants who have missed the start of the term.
"In a place like Moscow, things get gummed up pretty quickly," said Lisa Choate, a spokeswoman for American Councils, a nonprofit group that arranges student exchanges financed by the State Department. Three groups of high school students missed their visits because their visas were not ready. 
"We spend endless hours just trying to figure out what to do and how to do it," Ms. Choate said.
The delays have stymied Kip Thorne, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, who is part of a wide effort to prove Einstein's general theory of relativity. His Russian colleague, Vladimir Braginsky, who has visited the United States regularly over three decades, has been waiting since July for a visa to collaborate on the billion-dollar taxpayer-financed project involving 13 nations.
Despite many calls to officials in Washington, Professor Thorne said, Dr. Braginsky "has been left hanging for three months" without any information on the status of his visa. 
"It is a great embarrassment to me, as an American citizen, to have to tell my foreign colleagues of this situation when they inquire about Braginsky," Professor Thorne said, 
John Lanzetta, a financial planner in Swedesboro, N.J., is still waiting for his fiancee, who is in Moscow. Her visa was cleared by the immigration service in August, pending a security review.
"Emotionally, it's just draining," said Mr. Lanzetta, who says is phone bills are $1,000 a month as he tries to console his Siberian-born fiancee, Lyudmilla Chernyakhovskaya. 
Officials say the security agencies, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., are overwhelmed by the requests for visa security checks at a time when they are scrambling to update their watch lists of suspected terrorists. The watch lists include a database known as Tipoff that contains more than 80,000 names, with 2,000 more names being added every month. The security agencies workloads have surged 455 percent since Sept. 11, Chris Kojm, a State Department intelligence official, recently said at the joint Congressional inquiry into the attacks.
Troubled by previous lapses and confused about its role in the process, the C.I.A. lowered its criteria for placing applicants on the list, swelling the pool of suspects, according to a report last month by Eleanor Hill, the staff director of the Congressional inquiry.
"Tipoff is not adequately staffed to handle the increased workload," Ms. Hill said at a hearing of the joint committee. She added that the program's staff members -- 11 full-time workers and a few part-time workers -- are called upon "after hours, nights, weekends, wee hours." 
In the July incident in which about 100 visas were canceled, consular officials declined to discuss the operation or say whether, under closer scrutiny, the F.B.I. concerns led to searches or arrests.
After that, consular officials imposed a rule that no more visas be granted without the explicit approval of the security agencies, officials said. In the past, the State Department gave the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. 30 days to raise objections to a visa applicant, then processed the request as though the applicant had been cleared.
Some foreigners interested in coming to the United States seem to have given up on getting visas. In the last two months, State Department revenues from visa applications have fallen by 30 percent, officials said. Faced with a budget shortage, the department is planning to raise its fees to $100 from $60 for processing nonimmigrant visas.
Some applicants have sought to speed up their initial petitions for a visa by paying $1,000 for premium processing. By paying that fee, business executives, high-tech workers and performers have managed to shorten their wait at the hands of the immigration service to two weeks from 100 days, but they still must face the security reviews.
"The cumulative effect of all these measures is to discourage people from coming here," said Jonathan Ginsburg, a Virginia immigration lawyer who was briefed this week by consular officials. At some point, Mr. Ginsburg added, one has to ask: "Well, gee, isn't this going to have an effect on the overall economy?"
Consular officials acknowledge that they are taking few chances. Their bureau faced fierce criticism over the past year after the disclosure that 15 of the Sept. 11 hijackers had been granted visas to enter the United States, three of them without being interviewed by a consular official. The assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, Mary A. Ryan, was forced to resign, and her example weighs heavily on her former employees, officials say.
"If one of these other agencies comes in late and we've already issued the visa, who's going to be faulted for not caring about national security?" asked one State Department official. "It's going to be the visa officer, the State Department."
As it stands, the department would lose much of its visa-granting powers to President Bush's proposed Department of Homeland Security. Under the White House plan, the new department would set the guidelines and hold the legal authority for issuing visas, leaving the State Department's consular corps to carry out the paperwork.
The State Department last year issued 5.7 million nonimmigrant visas of all types. 
Now, stranded travelers, their loved ones and colleagues are beginning to clog the e-mail systems and fax machines on Capitol Hill with complaints.
"There are all kinds of problems," said one Senate aide who works on immigration. "It's affecting a lot of legitimate travelers."
Some lawmakers have interceded on behalf of high-profile applicants. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, recently manage to free visas for Russian hockey players so they could join the Dallas Stars, aides said.
"We regularly help people who have legitimate concerns, who are not security risks," said Lisette Mondello, the senator's spokeswoman.
But celebrity is not a guarantee. In September, Chucho Valdes, the Cuban jazz pianist, missed a chance to accept his first Latin Grammy. He was among 22 Cuban nominees who could not get visas that would have allowed them to attend the Los Angeles ceremony.
Responding to the outcry over that incident, the State Department late last month suddenly released the 10,000 visas to applicants that were being reviewed under the Visas Condor program, a security check for foreign students, business people and certain other travelers. Once the system is functioning properly, officials said, security delays will be reduced to one month.

HEADLINE: With Few Jobs Being Created, Pain Is Felt Far and Wide 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
Almost a year after the economy began growing again, the nation continues to suffer through a broad jobs slump that has spread the pain more evenly than almost any downturn on record.
 Few companies have hired significant numbers of new employees, and the worrisome economic signs of the last month have caused some to announce new layoffs, making last year's recession feel to many as if it is still going on. Despite indications that the economy is still advancing and predictions from most experts that it will improve next year, a clear majority of Americans, polls show, think that the economy is either deteroriating or remaining weak. 
 "The economy is growing, but it feels very disappointing," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, a technology and investment company. "The job market is moribund." 
The weak growth of the last year has made the "jobless recovery" of the early 1990's, which once seemed like a painful exception to previous economic patterns, look instead as if it could be the new norm. Although the economy has become considerably stronger in many ways over the last two decades, with downturns being shallower and coming less frequently, the hangovers they cause appear to endure much longer.
The layoffs of the last year and a half have also been unusually democratic.
Partly because the collapse of the technology bubble of the late 1990's has hurt white-collar workers even more than their blue-collar counterparts, the unemployment rate for college graduates has risen as much since early last year as it has for high school dropouts. Joblessness among whites has increased by about the same amount, in proportional terms, as it has among blacks and Hispanics. In the past, downturns usually hit the most vulnerable workers -- the low-paid, minorities and less-educated men -- by far the hardest.
Last week, Credit Suisse First Boston added to the white-collar layoffs, saying it would cut another 1,500 jobs, and many of its Wall Street rivals are taking similar steps. The lack of a recovery in technology spending has brought new cuts in that industry, like the 1,350 layoffs that EMC, which sells data storage systems, announced earlier this month, and the additional 10,000 layoffs disclosed Friday by Lucent, the telecommunications equipment maker. The slight weakening of consumer spending has led to job losses at some companies that until now weathered the downturn unusually well.
All that has weakened the job market again, at least temporarily. The number of people on payrolls fell in September for the first time in five months, help-wanted advertising has dropped significantly and the number of unemployment-insurance claims, while volatile, has generally risen.
"I think we're doing terrible right now," said Lorrie Carter, 39, of Warren, Mich., who lost her job assembling drive shafts for Dana Industries, a big supplier to the auto industry, when new orders slowed.
"Factory-wise, there are no jobs out there. I don't think there's even much retail work out there. And that wouldn't pay my bills anyway," added Ms. Carter, who has two sons and was making $14.60 an hour.
In a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 66 percent of respondents said the economy was in bad condition, up from 39 percent in June. Looking ahead, 39 percent said the economy was worsening and 46 percent said it was staying the same.
"There's not enough indication of any kind of economic recovery" for employers to add workers, said Linda Paulk, the president of Snelling & Snelling, a large employment agency based in Dallas.
David A. Daberko, the chief executive of the National City Corporation, a banking company in Cleveland, added that among his corporate customers, "There's no evidence of hiring or any desire to hire."
Still, barring an unexpected shock, the job market does seem likely to improve, particularly over the longer term. Indeed, if the economy follows roughly the same recovery schedule as it did a decade ago, companies will begin adding more than 100,000 jobs a month by early next year. The fallout from the overinvestment in technology and the stock market bubble could make this rebound less robust, but the labor market is expected to tighten over the next decade, as the advance guard of baby boomers begins retiring and fewer young adults replace them in the labor force.
Already, the unemployment rate -- while likely to tick up again for a variety of reasons -- fell to 5.6 percent in September, its second consecutive decline. The economy continues to grow at a modest pace, and in recent weeks companies have asked employees to work longer hours, as often happens shortly before new hiring begins.
"There's not another downturn ahead," predicted Lakshman R. Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, one of the few groups to have forecast last year's recession. But, he said, "we're not talking about gangbuster job growth."
In part, the new face of job cuts -- less severe but more long-lasting and widespread than in the 1970's and 80's -- reflects the shrinking of the manufacturing sector. In contrast to the booms at the start of past recoveries, when industries hired tens of thousands of production workers to fill new orders, the sector has continued its long-term decline in recent years, as it did a decade ago.
This jobless recovery has its own specific character, however.
Over the last decade, American companies have used new technology and strategies to become more efficient than they were in the 70's and 80's. The change is almost certain to benefit the country over the long term, allowing both incomes and corporate profits to rise. This year, however, the productivity increases have weakened the job market, because companies have been able to lift their output without hiring new workers.
Since last summer, for example, the Clorox Company has reduced its work force to 10,000, from 11,000, as part of its "cut costs everywhere" strategy. To keep sales and profits rising despite the company's new size, it has reduced the number of its bleach products, eliminating some fragrances and package sizes.
The managers of a bleach warehouse in Atlanta and a cat-litter warehouse in Spring Hill, Kan., have also found ways to move boxes onto trucks more quickly. Because raising prices is nearly impossible, "everything we can do to maintain our margins is really important," said Rick McDonald, who oversees the warehouses.
Repeated in similar ways across the economy, the productivity increases will require the economy to grow faster than before to create new jobs.
"We'd probably have to have growth in the next few quarters of above 4 percent to have really rapid payroll growth, and I don't think anyone's forecasting that," R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.
Mr. Hubbard emphasized that unemployment was lower and the labor market appeared healthier than it had been in the wake of other recessions and said he believed that the economy was on track to improve.
For now, however, many white-collar workers, just a few years removed from good salaries and rich benefits that often included stock options, are struggling to find jobs that pay anything close to what they had been making. 
Craig Adams, an accounting manager in Cupertino, Calif., who was laid off early this year, has sat in a few job interviews in which an executive has described being overwhelmed by the response to a job advertisement. "I think the number of choices are fewer," said Mr. Adams, 55, who has a graduate business degreee and was making about $80,000 at his old job, "and I also think there are a lot more people looking for the same positions." 
Others have applied to graduate and professional schools, making admission unusually difficult over the last year. Law school applications for the class that enrolled this fall rose 15.4 percent over the previous year, the largest increase since the Law School Admission Council began keeping track.
The recent recession and initial recovery have also reduced some of the gaps separating Americans of different classes and ethnicities.
For example, the gap between the unemployment rates for the most educated and least educated workers has narrowed substantially since early last year. In February 2001, only 1.6 percent of college graduates in the labor force were unemployed, compared with 7.4 percent of workers who did not finish high school. Last month, the unemployment rate among college graduates had nearly doubled to 2.9 percent, while it had edged up only slightly, to 7.8 percent, among the dropouts. High school graduates with no college also picked up some ground on the holders of bachelor's degrees.
The catch-up by the least educated workers has surprised labor economists. "That's not what people think of as typical," said David Card, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "The typical scenario is that the unemployment rate of less-skilled workers is more sensitive to business conditions, and as a result of that, during a recession, the gap would widen. That was pretty much the orthodoxy for the last four decades."
However, he hesitated to call the change a trend yet. "You can't really say for sure that this is the new pattern that we'll expect the next time there's a recession," he said.
During the 1990's boom, black and Hispanic workers, whose unemployment rates have always been higher than the rates for whites, started to gain ground on their white counterparts. That trend has continued through the most recent recession and recovery. "During some recessions, while black unemployment in absolute levels jumps up, the white rate increases faster," said William E. Spriggs, director of the National Urban League Institute of Opportunity and Equality. But for the first time, the ratio of the Hispanic unemployment rate to the white unemployment rate has also fallen during a downturn.
"The employment of Latinos continues even in a down economy," said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a research group based in Washington. "Even when more Latinos are out of work, more Latinos are coming into the economy, finding jobs."
Many experts attributed the narrowing of employment gaps during the boom to the tight labor market, which encouraged employers to dip more deeply into the pool of potential workers and made discrimination more costly. But the labor market has relaxed since then, and now explanations are not so clear. 
But one traditional effect of the economic cycle has returned. The unemployment rate for women has dipped below the rate for men, a situation that seems to arise only during and immediately after recessions. But this phenomenon may stem primarily from women dropping out of the labor force.
"Women are more likely to become discouraged workers," said Francine D. Blau, director of the Institute for Labor Market Policies at Cornell University. "That probably relates to traditional differences between gender roles in the family."
Ultimately, with a work force less concentrated in manufacturing, labor market slumps may last longer. Even before the recession began last year, "you saw manufacturers move very quickly," explained Jeffrey A. Joerres, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the big provider of temporary workers. "You saw technology and office environments say, 'I'm not feeling it yet; I'm still in this war for talent; I'm holding onto people.' Then the reality sunk in that it wasn't just manufacturing, it was everything, with the financial markets being last. Instead of being synchronized in all industries, it created a much longer cycle."

HEADLINE: New York's Homeless, Back Out in the Open 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
During his routine of supervising the McDonald's in Pennsylvania Station each day, Julio Velandia, the assistant manager, says he sees more homeless people than he did a year ago. "Those kind of people bother the customers," he said, "and they have a bad smell."
 Mr. Velandia is not alone in noticing an increase along the city's avenues and in its doorways. These days, merchants around Union Square, soup kitchen operators and commuters are buzzing about ghosts of the city past: street dwellers. 
 Homeless people, whose presence seemed to decline in the flush years of the Giuliani administration, are suddenly more visible, napping on park benches and camped out under scaffolding, possessions in tow. 
Neither the city nor the groups that advocate on behalf of the homeless actually survey this transient population, so it is impossible to say with certainty that their numbers are growing. City officials insist the problem is more one of perception than of reality, and plan to begin conducting an annual census of the street population this winter so that real data will be available.
"No one knows for sure," said the city's commissioner of homeless services, Linda I. Gibbs, "but we are hearing from both the Police Department and our outreach folks that it is not an increase in the number of street homeless, but a change in the pattern of street homelessness." 
Advocates for the city's poor, on the other hand, insist that the weak economy and a growing lack of supportive housing for the homeless who are mentally ill have led to an increase in the number of people sleeping on the streets. They point out that the average number of single adults in city shelters is 7,728 per night -- the highest since 1991. They also say that the city's soup kitchens and feeding vans are reporting crowds that they have not seen since the late 1980's, when the number of homeless in New York peaked.
No one is suggesting that Bryant Park and Union Square are becoming the homeless epicenters they were in the 1980's, but reports of increasing homelessness have alarmed business coalitions and city officials.
Last month, police commanders in Manhattan below 59th Street were told by their supervisors to draw up plans to address any homeless encampments swiftly. In an interview, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the directive resulted from increased reports of homeless people in several Midtown locations.
Mr. Kelly, Ms. Gibbs and a few service providers who have contracts with the city say that the homeless are more visible because of the displacement they suffered on Sept. 11. Before then, many homeless people were entrenched in the subterranean passages beneath the World Trade Center and in many other locations in Lower Manhattan. This dislocation, officials say, has been compounded by security concerns, causing the police to begin patrolling beneath bridges and beside waterways, disturbing enclaves that had been oases for the homeless.
Bloomberg administration officials said there had been no change in policy in dealing with the homeless, and no lesser effort to disperse them from the streets than under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. In 1999, after a man thought to be homeless attacked and seriously injured a young woman on a Midtown street, Mr. Giuliani announced that the homeless could either move on when prodded by the police or face arrest.
Mr. Kelly said that he did not believe the homeless had the right to sleep on the sidewalks, and that officers had been instructed to tell them to move along or to make an offer of shelter, and to arrest them if they violate public-nuisance laws. The number of homeless people arrested for such offenses this year has increased by more than 300 percent, Mr. Kelly said, although police officials attributed part of that to a change in how arrests are recorded.
At the same time, however, the Police Department, whose ranks have been thinned by attrition and stretched to deal with the threat of terrorism, has had 20 percent fewer contacts with homeless individuals so far this year compared with the same period in 2001. A contact can range from a call for aid to a simple encounter in a park to an arrest.
One homeless man in Midtown who gave his name only as John said last week that the officers he encountered these days were not as zealous as they were a few years ago. John, who was panhandling at 11th Avenue and 43rd Street, said that a few years ago anyone caught drinking beer from a paper bag was sure to get a summons, but that now officers use more discretion. "The cops are still out here," he said. "But they are not busting chops like that."
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said the police at Penn Station had noticed a slight increase in the homeless in the early morning hours. They said they used police patrols and outreach efforts to try to ensure the homeless do not disturb commuters during the day.
Many nonprofit agencies also say they have seen marked increases among the homeless in recent months. And the city itself reports that the number of clients using drop-in facilities grew to just over 1,000 in June 2002 compared with fewer than 900 a year earlier. The executive director of the Center for Urban Community Services, Tony Hannigan, said that in August workers at the homeless drop-in center the group runs on 126th Street recorded roughly three times as many new faces as in August 2001.
Advocates for the homeless say the main reason for any increase is a shortage of housing designed specifically to support the homeless who are mentally ill. Studies show that people with severe disorders like schizophrenia are particularly at risk to end up on the streets, compared with poor people who are not mentally ill and who tend to handle institutionalized shelter better.
"The major structural cause is that there is a reduction in the supply of supportive housing," said Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless, "and you can trace the increase in street homelessness pretty directly to a decline in vacancies for these supported beds."
The population of single adults in homeless shelters fell to its lowest point in 1994, he said, soon after several thousand new units of government-financed housing for the homeless became available. Shelter vacancy rates at the time were around 9 percent. Vacancy rates at shelters are now at less than 2 percent.
Advocates for the city's poor also contend that the city's struggling economy and more demanding requirements for public assistance have combined to push some people into the shelter system.
The number of single adults receiving public assistance declined through the late 1990's, but has begun rising again. In the first week of October, roughly 10,000 more single adults were on public assistance in New York than during the same week last year, according to the Human Resources Administration. These people use social services that had previously gone to the homeless who are mentally ill.
"These working homeless can manage well in the system, but there is a tax," said Andrew Apicella, program director for the Bowery Residents' Committee's homeless outreach unit. "It means the guy on the street gets less attention."
Whether the rise in the homeless population is real or an illusion, almost everyone agrees that the city is better equipped to handle an increase than it was when the first crisis hit two decades ago under Mayor Edward I. Koch. City officials are now under court order to provide shelter to anyone who seeks it, and despite their public reputation as being unsafe and dirty, the shelters, which are run by nonprofit agencies and monitored closely by the courts, provide levels of security and cleanliness that make them a model for cities across the country.
Having survived the homeless crisis of the 1980's, the city's business leaders are determined not to allow a repeat. "Any increase is an issue because there is a fear of going back to what was," said Joseph Tango, head of operations for the Union Square Business Improvement District and Local Development Corporation.
And New Yorkers in general seem more inured to, than annoyed by, the the homeless in their midst.
"As complaint central," said Jonathan Greenspun, commissioner of the mayor's community assistance unit, "I can tell you that as of today people care more about vendors, graffiti, transportation and noise than the homeless."
In a few dozen interviews across the city in the last week, residents said repeatedly that they were more saddened than angry or concerned for their own safety when they saw a homeless person.
Robert Stone, an electrician from Marine Park, Brooklyn, said he had noticed an increase of homeless people "lying about" on the Q train. "Like this morning, I got on and the first thing I noticed was the stench," he said, before adding, "I got that old sinking feeling, like there is nothing I can do to help."

HEADLINE: With Rebels on Attack, Ivory Coast Leader Fires Defense Minister 

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Rebels went on the attack in the west of the country today as President Laurent Gbagbo removed his defense minister and a Senegalese mediator made a last-ditch effort to avert all-out civil war.
 President Gbagbo took personal control of the army by leaving the Defense Ministry vacant and appointing Bertin Kadet, a junior security minister, as a minister attached to the presidency responsible for defense and civil protection. 
 That means that Mr. Kadet will take his instructions directly from the president, who will become de facto defense minister, said Mamadou Koulibaly, the president of the National Assembly. 
The ousted defense minister, Moise Lida Kouassi, whose reputation suffered because of false claims that the army had captured the central rebel stronghold of Bouake on Monday, will become presidency minister.
The rebels attacked the paramilitary camp outside the western town of Daloa this morning, and the battle was continuing as night fell, local residents said. 
The insurgents, army mutineers and soldiers who have returned from exile, staged an uprising on Sept. 19 and now control the predominantly Muslim north of Ivory Coast and key towns in the west, center and east.
The United States says it fears a "meltdown" in the west African country, once a beacon of stability and prosperity in a violence-wracked region. The United Nations is warning of a looming "large-scale humanitarian crisis" spreading beyond Ivory Coast's borders.
Daloa, 230 miles northwest of Abidjan, is the capital of the cocoa-producing western region.
Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of the bean, growing 40 percent of the world crop. Fears that the imminent harvest will be disrupted have pushed prices to 17-year highs.
Meanwhile, Senegal's foreign minister, Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, held two hours of talks with rebel negotiators in Bouake.
He told reporters afterward that no agreement had been reached but that discussions would continue on Sunday.
The minister said he had submitted new proposals from Senegal's president, Abdoulaye Wade, the chairman of the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas, but gave no details.
Master Sgt. Tuho Fozie, the rebel spokesman and one of their negotiators, said there was "nothing new" in the proposals.
But he added, "We have always said that we are prepared to find clear and fair solutions" to the crisis.
Ecowas mediators proposed a cease-fire pact last week, but that deal fell apart last Sunday when Mr. Gbagbo reneged on a pledge to sign it, saying the rebels had to lay down their arms first.
The African Union called in a statement released overnight for "an immediate ceasefire."
In Washington, the State Department urged the nearly 3,000 Americans in Ivory Coast to leave the country. "Our people are stressing the advisability of departing," one official said on Friday.
The United Nations World Food Program said it was suspending its normal feeding operation for more than 300,000 people in Ivory Coast -- mostly children -- and setting up a regional emergency program for those displaced by the turmoil.
Several countries are evacuating their citizens, or planning to do so, after attacks against the 4.5 million West African immigrants in Ivory Coast.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING; 
Last Place Aside, Underdogs Relish Roles

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Xavier De Lesquen, the bespectacled 40-year-old administrative judge who heads the French America's Cup team -- which has yet to win a race -- is finally smiling.
 For the first time since the Cup challenger races began two weeks ago, his team, Le Defi Areva, left the dock and returned in the afternoon without a loss. The reason? The wind died and racing was canceled. 
 "Today we have been lucky," De Lesquen said.
For all the attention being paid to the big budgets and the big egos competing for No. 1 -- and a chance to challenge New Zealand, the America's Cup holder, in February -- there is another compelling story here, in the fierce battle not to be last. Nine boats are competing in the first of two round robins. At the end of October, the top eight will advance to the next round. One will go home, leaving Auckland and the world's attention behind. 
Besides the French, the competitors for that eighth slot are the British GBR Challenge and the Italian syndicate Mascalzone Latino. Their backers entered the America's Cup the way Steve Forbes enters presidential campaigns: with slim prospects of winning and the knowledge that losing will cost millions.
"When we got here, my team was saying: 'We're here to win. We're here to win,' " said Vincenzo Onorato, a fourth-generation Neopolitan shipper behind the Mascalzone Latino. "I'm not here to win. My goal is not to be the first eliminated. I'm here to get experience."
Well, experience and maybe a bit of something else, too. Few sporting events can match the aura of history, glamour and rugged masculinity attached to the 151-year-old America's Cup. The contest evokes names like Vanderbilt and Lipton, Endeavor and Courageous, and simply sailing in the race entitles skippers to claim a bit of that majesty themselves. Even so, leaving will not be easy. With photographers and cameramen swarming by on helicopters and boats, being on an America's Cup yacht is akin to being on a runway in Milan.
The most humble person would have difficulty not feeling, at least temporarily, like a superstar. And to anyone with the gadget gene -- and everyone on an America's Cup boat has the gadget gene -- leaving Auckland will mean an end to the strange sense of purpose derived from countless hours of tweaking, reconfiguring and redesigning their yachts in search of speed.
Despite the possibility of their eminent demise, the underdogs have been the Cup challenge's main sources of levity. For the real competitors, after all, sailing is serious stuff.
Ernesto Bertarelli, the Swiss pharmaceutical heir behind the Alinghi syndicate, is seldom seen in public and does not give interviews, even shooing away a television crew from home that came to wish his campaign good luck. Team Prada fired its head designer after a single loss. Oracle-BMW asks visitors to sign confidentiality agreements at its base. The underdogs, by contrast, have open compounds, will invite practically anyone over for dinner and have staked out a defiant stance: the America's Cup will be fun.
"Sailing is not our job," Onorato said. "We do it for pleasure."
So what motivates someone to chase for -- and to spend for -- something they know they won't get? The combined budgets of the three underdogs is roughly $80 million, $5 million less than the budget of Larry Ellison's Oracle team, but not exactly chump change. For Onorato, the Italian, the idea was a lark. He was drinking beer and watching television with some sailing buddies on a windless day three years ago when it came to him.
"I said, 'Why don't we do the America's Cup?' " he recalled. "All my friends said: 'This is madness. You must be sick.' "
For Peter Harrison, the cheerful British technology entrepreneur who sold his companies at the height of the bull market and who rides in the back of his boat during races in a plastic chair with the legs sawed off, the motivation was patriotism.
He said he had been complaining to friends that despite founding the America's Cup, the British had never won it. In fact, they had not sailed in the Cup challenge for 15 years. He ponied up $30 million of his fortune, buying seven shipping containers of yachting gear from the defunct Japanese Nippon Challenge -- the equivalent of an "America's Cup starter kit," he said. "I decided to walk the talk." 
The French had America's Cup experience -- they made the semifinals of the last challenge series in 2000 -- but unlike the other two underdogs, they did not have a big money backer. 
"We had a good team and a good boat, but we had a single problem," De Lesquen said. "Absolutely zero euros in our pockets."
The project limped along on $2 million here and $2 million there, before landing an unlikely sponsorship from the French nuclear power company Areva, which pledged $15 million. 
For all the underdogs, not stopping means raising more money. As every weekend sailor knows, boats can do more damage to a bank account than a nasty gambling habit. Onorato said his Cup effort had cost him 30 percent more than he had planned, and he is still spending. "You keep thinking you can do a little bit better," he said. "The meaning of a little bit better is more money."
The need for cash explains why the French painted the hull of their boat a neon yellow the color of anti-freeze. "If you want sponsorship," De Lesquen said, "you have to have a boat that can be recognized."
Harrison has been searching for partners in Britain while simultaneously arguing in Auckland that what the Cup needs is the yachting world equivalent of salary caps.
"I said I wouldn't do it alone," he said. "For the good of the Cup, we should have others coming in so it's not determined by individuals. If it becomes the $100 million campaigns of Ellison and Bertarelli, then the person who spends the most wins."
What the teams lack in money, they try to make up for with esprit de corps. The French run their base camp like a kibbutz, with even the team's financial officers rotating cleaning and cooking duties. The crew of Mascalzone Latino eats pasta together each night, to build the team bond. Harrison said his team was a nautical version of the three Musketeers. "It's one for all and all for one," he said, but with an additional mandate: "Have fun."
Forming a bond may be easier for some of these crews than their faster competitors. Bertarelli, Ellison and the OneWorld Challenge backers Paul Allen and Craig McCaw have hand-picked professional, multinational crews from past Cup champions like New Zealand. The underdog boats are crewed by fellow countrymen, some of whom have sailed together for years. 
"We are friends," Onorato said. "I don't want to buy some great talent that makes your boat not your own."
Harrison took the idea a step further. He went in search of young British sailors, specifically exempting crew members from the 1985 and 1987 British Cup teams, with an eye toward building experience for future efforts. "I took the view they were the old guard," Harrison said. "It's an entrepreneurial, new economy effort."
Races today went some of the way toward clarifying who will end up in that ninth spot. After losing its first four races, the British scored a major victory over Larry Ellison's Oracle-BMW, to win its third in a row. Unless it falls apart in the second round robin, which begins Oct. 22, chances are good it will survive to the quarterfinals in November.
Mascalzone Latino and the French met in one of the closest races so far in the series. When the Italians crossed the line a boat length ahead of Le Defi, Onorato said his teammates cried. He is planning a party if his boat survives to the next round, and he says he knows what he will do there. "I will get drunk in the night," he said.
The French have nine more races ahead of them, including a rematch in late October with Mascalzone. A single victory and they are back in it.
"We are not at the level of the best team, that's for sure," De Lesquen said. "But we have improved a lot. If we stay alive, it's more than perfect."

HEADLINE: Bombing at Resort in Indonesia Kills 150 and Hurts Scores More 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

 BODY:
A powerful car bomb detonated in front of a discotheque on the popular Indonesian resort island of Bali late last night, killing at least 150 people and wounding more than 200 others, Indonesian and Western officials said. 
 A hospital official in Bali said today that 75 percent of the dead were foreigners. It was one of the worst attacks on civilians in Southeast Asia in many years. 
 The nightclub where the car was parked, the Sari, and an adjacent one engulfed by the flames, were popular with Western tourists. Officials said many of the dead and injured were foreigners, most of them Australians and Europeans. An American official said there were Americans among the casualties, though he did not have the number or names. 
Members of a football team from Perth, Australia, were at the Sari Club, Australian officials said. 
"The place was packed, and it went up within a millisecond," Simon Quayle, the coach of the football team, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
Mr. Quayle, whose team was visiting Bali and at the resort at the time of the blast, said that he made it safely out of the building but that 8 of his 19 players were missing.
The blast left a crater large enough for three cars, an American official said.
Bloodied and mangled bodies were being removed from the carnage into the early morning hours, and fear gripped the serene island, where Hindus and Muslims have lived in notable harmony. The airport was shut.
Shortly after the attacks at the nightclub in Kuta, there was a bomb blast near the honorary American consulate in nearby Denpasar, Bali's capital. No one was injured.
No group took responsibility for the attacks but suspicions immediately fell on a radical Islamic organization based in Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah. The group and its leader, Abu Bakar Bashir, have been linked to plots against Americans by an operative of Al Qaeda who was seized in Indonesia and turned over to the Central Intelligence Agency several months ago.
American officials described the bombings as terrorist acts, and said that they appeared to have been aimed at the United States. An F.B.I. team was en route to the bombing sites, a senior American official in Washington said last night.
The bombings are certain to have consequences far greater than the immediate death and destruction, which is what a terrorist group would intend. In a country reeling economically, tourism on the legendary island of Bali is certain to suffer, and foreign investors will stay away. 
The government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri may also have been a target of the attack, much as Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been a secondary target of terrorist attacks.
Indonesian attitudes and American-Indonesian relations may also be shaken by the attack.
The United States and its major allies in the region, Australia and Singapore, have criticized the Indonesian government for not acting decisively against suspected terrorists.
Bush administration officials say that Jemaah Islamiyah fits all the criteria to be listed as a terrorist organization, but the United States has refrained from doing so for fear of destabilizing Indonesia politically and making life more difficult for President Megawati. Mr. Bashir has a significant following among Indonesian Muslims, and has been warmly embraced by the country's vice president, Hamzah Haz.
"If anything is needed to convince Indonesians that they have terrorism on their doorstep, this is it," Sidney Jones, director of the International Crisis Group in Indonesia and an expert on Jemaah Islamiyah, said in a telephone interview from Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
The Bush administration's frustration with the Indonesian government's reluctance to recognize the extent of terrorism in the country boiled over with last night's carnage.
"We hope this sends a message to the Indonesians that terrorism is not just an American problem, but an Indonesian one as well," a senior administration official said.
The motive for the attack in Bali "wasn't a local commercial dispute," the official said scornfully.
In September, after a grenade exploded prematurely inside an automobile in a central Jakarta residential area, not far from the home of an American diplomat, the Indonesian police dismissed out of hand the suggestion that it was aimed at Americans. The police said the assailants were using the grenade to collect a debt from a person who happened to live next to the American. 
Ten days ago, the American embassy in Jakarta took initial steps to evacuate certain nonessential personnel and dependents of embassy officials because of threats of attacks on Americans, an American diplomat said. The diplomat declined to discuss the nature of the threats but said they were specific in nature.
The Bush administration went to the Indonesian government with another plea to provide more security.
In early September, the American Embassy in Jakarta was closed because of specific terrorist threats. It remained closed for several days while the Bush administration sought to convince the Indonesian police of the seriousness of the threats and urged it to provide increased security at the embassy.
Eventually, the police erected heavy barriers on the busy street in front of the embassy, and assigned more policemen to patrol the area. Embassy windows have been covered with bulletproof steel.
The move has angered many Indonesians who refuse to accept that terrorism is a threat in their country and see the American effort against terrorism as basically anti-Islamic. 
In an effort to convince the Indonesians that they must take the terrorist threat more seriously, President Bush telephoned President Megawati in September, then sent a top Indonesian specialist at the National Security Council, Karen Brooks, to deliver the message in person.
American officials said Ms. Megawati has now come to accept that the problem is serious, but she is not a strong or decisive leader and has not brought all of her top security officials on board.

HEADLINE: When a Smoking Ban Limits Freedom of Choice 

 BODY:
"Last Call for a Smoke" Oct. 6 states that "economic arguments are colliding with increasing concerns about the health risks to workers exposed to secondhand smoke for long periods." What about the freedom and choices of the patrons and employees? Should not the restaurant and bar owners decide what rules apply to smoking in their restaurants and bars? Liberty, the most fundamental American ideal, dictates that all Americans and, yes, Long Islanders as well, have an inalienable right to open a restaurant or bar with rules allowing patrons to smoke and breathe secondhand smoke. 
 There are dozens of occupations, social and recreational activities that have far greater safety hazards than restaurants and bars that permit smoking. Educating the public to the ills of secondhand smoke has great merit and serves an important function in society. However, individuals can and should decide for themselves what risk they will endure. 
 The potential danger from secondhand smoke is not reason for the government to outlaw it; otherwise, the government would be prohibiting junk food, swimming pools, automobiles, alcohol (they already tried that), scuba diving, sky diving, working on offshore oil rigs, on and on. We must remember that the most important ideal to uphold is freedom of choice. I agree with Peter Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the Nassau Legislature, who said, "This is moving in a very intrusive direction, soon they are going to move into the home." We are on a slippery slope. Let us stop this foolishness now.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INVESTIGATION; 
Signs of Revived Qaeda Are Seen In Latest Strikes and New Tapes

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
American officials say they fear that terrorist attacks in the past week and taped messages from leaders of Al Qaeda signal the beginning of a new wave of terrorist activity and possibly a large-scale attack.
 Senior government officials also say that an attack that crippled a French oil tanker near Yemen and another that killed a United States marine in Kuwait showed that the terror network had reconstituted itself, with smaller groups prompted to begin new attacks by inflammatory new messages from Qaeda leaders. 
 Kuwait's interior minister said today that a statement from the gunmen's leader suggested a link to Al Qaeda and that the group had planned other attacks. Page 17. But other officials said it was not known whether the attackers were operating under direct orders from Al Qaeda's senior leaders. 
The group's latest round of attacks may be a response to the Bush administration's Iraq policy, the officials said. An audiotape of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened continued attacks on "America and its allies," and denounced American plans to attack Iraq.
"The campaign against Iraq has an objective that is far beyond Iraq to reach the Arab and Islamic world," Mr. Zawahiri said on the tape. United States officials said his message appeared to be an attempt to justify and incite renewed violence against American targets. 
Another audiotape, which officials say is of Mr. bin Laden, repeated Al Qaeda's threats against the United States. Both tapes were broadcast in the past week by Al Jazeera, the satellite channel based in Qatar, and one American official said the two messages might have been intended to be a green light for Al Qaeda to initiate large-scale attacks.
Officials said that in the past week intelligence analysts had received reports of a spike in reported threats against the United States and American interests abroad. 
"I'm afraid you'll see a lot more of this," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican. "We always warned that there would be more attacks because we have not finished off the Al Qaeda group. We've disrupted it. We've had them on the run, but they are still around."
The government's latest intelligence analysis is based in part on the tanker explosion off Yemen a week ago, and on the shooting of two American marines on an island off Kuwait on Tuesday, an attack that killed one and wounded the other. 
"The marines in Kuwait and the ship off Yemen -- those could be precursors of more to come," one senior administration official said. "We believe this is a serious development."
So far, the government's response to the two attacks has remained deliberately low key. On Wednesday, the Bush administration discussed whether to raise the color-coded threat alert warning level from yellow to orange. But after a White House meeting, officials decided the threat was not yet specific enough.
Instead, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Homeland Security issued a threat alert to the country's 14,000 state and local police agencies, saying the recent messages showed that "Al Qaeda continues to plan major attacks against U.S. interests."
"The statements suggest that an attack may have been approved," the alert said, "while the specific timing is left to operatives in the field."
The threat warning said Al Qaeda had issued similar messages before the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998. "The content of the statements and the context surrounding these threats reinforces our view that they may signal an attack," the message said. "One senior detainee maintains that Al Qaeda would only release such a statement after approving a specific plan for an attack."
Officials are also concerned that another large-scale attack, perhaps in the United States, could be imminent because it usually takes at least one year for Al Qaeda to organize an ambitious attack. Nearly a year separated the attack on the American destroyer Cole in a port in Yemen in October 2000 and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
The latest wave may be linked to earlier attacks this year. In June, a suicide bomber blew up a truck outside the American Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 14 Pakistanis. Since then, the authorities have linked Al Qaeda to at least five attacks or thwarted attacks, though none in the United States.
Even if terror groups do not initiate another large and concerted strike, officials say, the concern is about small groups of Qaeda members carrying out attacks in the United States that are similar to the recent ones in Kuwait and Yemen.
"There are remnants that are still out there somewhere, and they still have all that training," one senior government official said. 
For months, senior officials have feared that Al Qaeda would emerge after its members' escape from Afghanistan as a more dispersed but deadly network that would be far more difficult to contain. They worried that the network's old hierarchy, led by Mr. bin Laden, had been replaced by tactical operatives with makeshift alliances to militant groups in countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Algeria and Yemen.
The issue of whether Mr. Zawahiri survived the war in Afghanistan seemed to be settled by the release of the recording with references to recent events, like the Iraq debate. But the absence of video images of Mr. Zawahiri suggested to some analysts that he had been injured or had somehow changed his appearance to elude capture.
In the taped message, Mr. Zawahiri also takes credit for several recent terrorist attacks, including several against German and French targets in the Middle East. One goal of American policy, he said, was to make Israel the dominant power in the region. Another objective, he said, was to divide Saudi Arabia into four regions, with its oil fields under the direct control of the United States.
Intelligence officials said they thought that the voices on the audiotapes were those of Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahiri. But they said that only the Zawahiri tape appeared to be recent, possibly recorded within the past month and no later than last summer, officials said.
Greater skepticism surrounds the bin Laden tape, released on Oct. 6 by Al Jazeera. In it, he refers to the Sept. 11 attacks as having already occurred but does not cite any other specific events that could be used to date the recording.
Mr. Zawahiri said in his tape that Mr. bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, had survived the war. But the tape provided no evidence to support that claim, and officials remain divided over whether Mr. bin Laden is alive. But they say that Mullah Omar survived the war and is in hiding.
The tape thought to be of Mr. bin Laden contained an anti-American message that is familiar from his previous video and audio messages. "Let America increase the pace of this course of conflict or decrease it," it says, "we will retaliate in kind, God willing, and, God is our witness, that the men of Islam are preparing for you what would fill your hearts with terror, and they will target the hinges of your economy until you stop your injustice and aggression or either one of us dies first."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Pattern of Incidents"Recent events suspected of being linked to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups: SEPTEMBER 9Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television station, first airs parts of a videotape that includes the voice of a man the C.I.A. identifies as Osama bin Laden, but it is unclear when the tape was made. SEPTEMBER 11A plot to bomb American embassies in Southeast Asia is foiled. Embassies in four countries are closed. The leader of a group with ties to Al Qaeda is believed to have been a leader of the plot. OCTOBER 2Suspected Abu Sayyaf guerrillas detonate a nail bomb in an open-air market in Zamboanga, in the Philip-pines, killing three, including an American Green Beret, and injuring 25 others. OCTOBER 6Al Jazeera receives and broadcasts an audio tape, reportedly of Osama bin Laden speaking. It is not known when the tape was made. OCTOBER 6A French oil tanker catches fires off the southeastern coast of Yemen. French officials later conclude the fire is the result of a terrorist attack. According to some news reports, a Yemeni Islamic fundamentalist group claims responsibility. OCTOBER 8A new audiotape of Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's top deputy, begins circulating. American officials say it was made in August at the earliest, but more likely in the past few weeks. OCTOBER 8Two gunmen in a pickup truck attack a Marine unit training on an island off Kuwait, killing one marine and injuring another. American officials say the attackers may have ties to Al Qaeda. OCTOBER 9An American marine in a Humvee fires on another vehicle in Kuwait after he sees someone in the vehicle point a gun. The vehicles separate; no Americans are killed.

HEADLINE: A World to the Wise 

BYLINE:  By Steve Garbarino; Steve Garbarino is a contributing editor of Vanity Fair.

 BODY:
Looming over Savannah's East Taylor Street from the veined pink marble steps of his 1869 Second Empire town house, the 6-foot-7 map dealer, shopkeeper and unofficial town historian John Duncan scratches his Confederate-era white beard, shrugs the midafternoon drizzle from his seersuckered shoulders and glances around Monterey Square, canopied by live oaks heavy with Spanish moss.
 Duncan is explaining the more genteel interpretations of the local turf. "In Savannah, we don't call them alleys," he says in a soft Lowcountry accent as insinuating as Vincent Price's. "We call them lanes." "Alleys" would be just too profane a word even for the potholed service roads behind every historic Savannah street, where the garbage is taken and "the help" sits peeling shrimp. 
 To Duncan, who is 65 and a 12th-generation Charlestonian transplanted to Savannah, it's all about where you are, how you got there and what happened when you did. His is a sepia-toned and watercolored world, one that unfolds and unravels in V. & J. Duncan Antique Maps, Prints and Books, nestled in the mansard-roofed, birthday-cake-ornate, three-story double town house that John runs with his wife, Virginia (Ginger to intimates). 
For more than a decade, map collectors from all over the world 2/3 even map-mad Britons 2/3 have been finding what they're looking for in the unassuming, low-ceilinged shop, crammed with more than 4,000 maps, most of them dating to the 18th through 19th centuries, depicting all points of the globe -- not to mention outer space. Celestial maps, mostly dating to the 17th to 19th centuries, including astrological formations and mythological gods, share space with weathered, frame-worthy botanical, animal and marine-life prints.
"The world of map collecting is a very small one," John says.
But the locked box that is the cartographer's world may not hold long, considering that current events have kicked off a new groundswell of interest in maps, borders and foreign soils. The lines of demarcation -- between India and Pakistan, for example -- have never been thinner. And from a psychological standpoint, it could be argued that people have never felt more lost. Maps, the Duncans believe, can provide a sense of security for the displaced.
"We've found that mostly men collect maps, but also that most collectors come from broken homes," says Ginger, 56, who next to John appears as diminutive as a porcelain doll. "My father died when I was very young. I think that my own displacement led to my attraction to maps," says Ginger, a Georgia native, patting her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Rosie. "Maps are comforting. They are for people searching for their past, for direction. Since Sept. 11th, I think they can help to provide a sense of place."
Italians were the first cartographers, in the 1400's. The 17th century was owned by the Dutch. The 19th century was America's moment in the cartography world. Ginger favors maps that depict "spheres and globes, pretty and decorated, somewhat primitive-looking ones," like those by the 18th-century German cartographer Herman Moll, who hand-colored most of his maps. John, who calls maps "enticing and sexy," prefers "flat maps with terrain and detail," particularly those by the 18th-century French hydrographer Jacques Nicolas Bellin.
But both look for peculiarities in their searches around the globe. Translation: maps with inaccuracies, often calculated ones. "It's like the postage stamps that show an airplane flying upside-down," John says. "Maps with mistakes are always more rare and sought after."
Though mapmakers are "generally honest," John says, since the late 19th century, they have often added a fictitious street to the top right corner to guard against forgers. When appropriators copy them, they "get nailed" since the streets don't exist. "The going rule," he says with a conspiratorial smile, "is that if there's a mistake, it's not a fake."
Freak details, which sometimes fall under the category of mistakes, can include nonexistent borders. Often, in those, the cartographer has inscribed "parts unknown." Pulling out a 17th-century map of New Guinea, John says: "See how the borders simply disappear? They are mysteries." Mistakes are also caused by laziness, ignorance and overzealous territoriality.
Take California, which was first depicted as an island in 1622 by the cartographer Antonio de Herrera. In 1701, it was proved that California was indeed connected to the mainland, but some maps continued to depict it as separate. Ginger says, "Obviously, the mapmakers were lazy, and used old engraving plates."
And old maps were often as biased as propaganda posters, serving the needs of those who made them and the countries they came from. Egotism, politics, elitism, racism and economics all played a part in their makeup. Many pre-1700 maps have a tendency to diminish the size of unexplored lands. John displays a woodcut world map by Sebastian Munster dated 1588. It depicts South America as almost box-shaped and far smaller than it should be. "Size is always defined by a European interpretation."
Similarly, the basis for standard time has until recently been anything but standard. While Greenwich, England, is the universal solar meridian today, in earlier times, countries showed degrees of longitude east and west of their capitals. "French maps used Paris," John says, "and shortly after American independence, American atlases used the capital of Philadelphia as the prime meridian. It's all very political."
For collectors, Ginger says, "bigger is always better." And shape is a selling point. Florida is always popular, she says, not just because of its exotic, bootlike shape, but because maps "sell where the population is growing."
"It may be a slight exaggeration," she says, "but in 10 years, the popularity of Florida maps has nearly equaled its percentage of population growth." Map collectors tend to favor places of refinement, and ones that are flush. "Middlesex, England, will sell way more than, say, northern Scotland," John says. "In the 60's and in the 90's, maps of Japan were in great demand, even in Savannah. But the downturn in its economy in recent years has reduced the demand and the price greatly. It's fair to say the demand and price of maps are directly related to the economy of the area depicted."
Maps of states are perennial favorites, especially those of the "island" of California; Texas as an independent republic; Oklahoma as Indian territory; North and South Dakota before they were divided; and Georgia and North and South Carolina with borders extending to the Mississippi River. And, John says, demand rises for locations "where anything bad, or in the news, is happening."
In recent years, the Duncans say, map collecting has broadened from its incestuous, tightly knit world to include people simply purchasing maps as substitutes for art in their homes, and even in some currently fashionable New York boites -- a practice pooh-poohed by map purists (but one that seldom curtails a sale).
"The first thing someone does when they walk into a room with a map hanging on the wall is try to locate where they're from," Ginger says. Such collectors are drawn to the more "olde"-looking maps that have gone through "toning," the changing of watercolored greens to blues on maps dating back 200 years or more.
Maps with fanciful cartouches are also in demand. Cartouches are details often bordered by an oval in a corner or at the top of a map. The most popular details include palm trees, exotic birds, American Indians, monkeys, alligators, even unicorns on some English maps. John shows a 1757 map of South Carolina, its cartouche featuring figures of slaves producing indigo.
"What is shocking, really, is how reasonable these old maps are" in price, he says. And while undervalued, they can be a solid investment in times of market volatility. One can buy a smallish map print dating to the 1500's for as little as $200. But a map of the Southeast that John bought in the 70's for $20 now sells for $500. A very rare map of historic Savannah showing the first four of the city's 24 squares was bought by John in the 1980's for $1,500. A few years ago, he was offered "the price of a brand-new Jaguar."
The Duncans, who like as much history in their environs as in their maps, have kept the Thomas-Levy House (named for its first two owners) as close to its late 19th-century look as possible. They bought it in 1976 for $36,000. Recent estimates place its value closer to $1 million. "We've spent a lot of money trying to make it look as old as it is," John says, although the Duncans do recognize a deal. Among the gilt mirrors and portraits, glossy patinas and parquet floors are lobby carpets bought for $1 from turn-of-the-century hotels.
When the author John Berendt went to Savannah to research his best-seller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," John Duncan acted as his tour guide, introducing him to the local characters and architecture. But even with this breadth of knowledge about where things are, both in Savannah and around the globe, John and Ginger often find themselves at a loss as to their immediate surroundings. "I think we started collecting maps," Ginger says, dead seriously, "because we're always getting lost -- even on our on streets."

You Can Go Home, And Write About It

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

DATELINE: FREEHOLD 

 BODY:
WHEN Kevin Coyne is sitting in his home office surrounded by walls of novels and history books, you do not immediately notice the similarities between him and Freehold's most famous son, Bruce Springsteen.
 But as Mr. Coyne's story unfolds, it is clear that the two share common ground. Both attended grammar school at St. Rosa Lima. Both left Freehold, became successful and returned with their families to raise their children in the area. 
 Mr. Coyne, a writer who once pitched an idea for a book about Mr. Springsteen, lives here with his wife and three children, two of whom attend a public school. The Springsteens live outside of town and send their children to private school in Rumson. 
Mr. Springsteen has said that it was important to him for his children to walk on the streets his father walked on, and Mr. Coyne, 43, wanted the same for his children. "Subconsciously, in the back of my mind, I always wanted my kids raised here," he said. 
They both write about their hometowns -- Mr. Springsteen in song and Mr. Coyne in articles and a new book. And both contribute to the town where they were raised. A fire engine paid for by Mr. Springsteen has "Born to Run" emblazoned on its side. He still performs fund-raising concerts here, and last spring he spoke at the dedication of a local park, where Mr. Coyne met him for the first time.
Mr. Coyne, a member of the City Council, is also the historian for this two-square-mile town of 11,000 residents in Monmouth County. He is commemorating his hometown in a book, to be published by Viking Penguin in February, about six men who left Freehold to fight in World War II and then returned to spend their lives here.
In the book, "Marching Home -- To War and Back With the Men of One American Town," Mr. Coyne writes that of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, about 900 came from this small town.
He spent four years researching and writing the stories of the six men, about their experiences in battle and the lives they made when they returned to Freehold. They came home to a town that, after the war, grappled with the closing of a major factory, racial conflicts and a deteriorating economy. In recent years, though, Freehold's economy has improved and ethnic and racial tensions have eased. 
Mr. Coyne said he saw Freehold as a "laboratory" of America, a microcosm of towns and cities across the nation because of its long history of racial diversity and an economy based on both farms and factories. He noticed, he said, "how accurately the town mirrored the changes in America." 
In the early 1960's, for example, Freehold witnessed a battle over whether prayers should be allowed in public schools, before the United States Supreme Court ruled that state-sponsored prayers were unconstitutional. And Freehold, like so many other towns, struggled with economic setbacks. In 1961, the Karagheusian Rug Mill, which provided employment for many of the borough's residents, closed, and Mr. Coyne said the town took nearly two decades to begin recovering from that economic blow.
Mr. Coyne is a member of the sixth generation of his family to live in Freehold. His ancestors came here from Ireland before the Civil War, and he is an avid collector of memorabilia. On one wall of his home is a framed bill from his great-grandfather's blacksmith shop, showing that a man named Frank Wilkins was charged $39.49 for work done between 1909 and 1912. A new shoe for Mr. Wilkins's horse cost 25 cents.
His collection also includes time cards from the mill and framed posters of rug advertisements. He also has a poster from an April 18, 1973, Springsteen concert at Christian Brothers Academy. Tickets were $3.50 and $4. 
Mr. Coyne, who became the borough's historian in 1999, has never lost his fascination with the place that was one of New Jersey's three original towns and the site of the single largest land battle of the Revolutionary War in 1778. Family members farmed, worked at the rug mill, or owned businesses, among other occupations. His father, Bud, who died in 1999 at the age of 65, was a pharmacist here and his mother, Anne, 67, still works as a bookkeeper. 
"My father never lived more than three blocks from the church where they had his funeral Mass," Mr. Coyne said.
But that was not the plan the author originally had for his own life. 
After graduating from high school in 1977, Mr. Coyne left Freehold to attend the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He graduated in 1981 with a degree in history and English, then spent a year putting out a small weekly newspaper in the Jersey Shore. He and his wife, Jane Kaye, then moved to Massachusetts, where she was raised. Living in Manchester, he worked as a reporter for a small newspaper during the 1980's. He said in the late 80's he had an interview with The Boston Globe, but suddenly realized that he did not want to spend his life as a reporter.
"I had this epiphany that I really wanted to write books," Mr. Coyne said.
In his first attempt at a writing project, Mr. Coyne prepared a a proposal for a book about Mr. Springsteen and Freehold. His agent could not interest any publisher in the concept, but an editor at Random House asked for other ideas. The concept that sold developed into a book about the 10 million Americans who are awake at 3 a.m. every night. The book, "A Day in the Night of America," was published by Random House in 1992. It was "well reviewed," Mr. Coyne said, and sold about 20,000 copies. 
In 1995, Mr. Coyne published a second book, "Domers -- A Year at Notre Dame." He spent much of the 1992-93 school year at the college attending classes, going to football games, and interviewing more than 400 staff members and students. Mr. Coyne said his goal was to describe "how Notre Dame became the Vatican of Catholic America." The book sold about 30,000 copies and also received good reviews, Mr. Coyne said. 
While getting ready to research and write the Notre Dame book, Mr. Coyne decided to return to Freehold. He and his wife had just had their first child, and Mr. Coyne's mother was visiting them in Manchester. While Mr. Coyne was taking a picture of his mother holding his infant daughter, he realized he did not want this to be an unusual event, requiring a long-distance visit. 
"There was a whole world here waiting for us," Mr. Coyne said of Freehold. The Coyne family moved here in 1992 and bought a house built in 1926, less than a mile from the house where Mr. Coyne grew up. "I needed a sidewalk between my house and a place where I could buy a newspaper," he said. Mr. Coyne and his wife have three children: Laura, 11; Alice, 9; and Richard, 3. 
Mr. Coyne, like the men he wrote about in his new book, said he returned to Freehold because it offered a sense of place. "It's a genuine community," he said. "You do things for someone other than yourself. I'm largely here because six generations of my family are buried in the cemetery here."
Nolan Higgins, 45, a childhood friend of Mr. Coyne's, said he was not surprised that his friend had returned. They grew up four blocks from each other and Mr. Higgins's father, Jim, is one of the veterans featured in Mr. Coyne's book. "I always thought he'd be back," Mr. Higgins said. "His roots are here. He's very dedicated to the town."
While working on the book about the veterans, Mr. Coyne spent three years as a part-time reporter at The Asbury Park Press. He left the paper in 1999 when he received the J. Anthony Lukas Prize, a grant of $45,000. The prize is given to authors who are working on nonfiction projects that show promise. 
Mr. Coyne is now working on a historical narrative set during World War I. Even though he may not write about Freehold again, he said he was content to stay here.
One of the best things about coming home, he said, is that he is able to keep up with the people he has known since childhood. A fellow council member and his barber, Mike DiBenedetto, was a classmate from kindergarten through high school.
"As a reporter and a writer, it's fascinating to get to see how the stories come out," Mr. Coyne said.

HEADLINE: SOAPBOX; 
Envisioning a New Jersey Triangle

BYLINE:  By JAMES E. McGREEVEY; James E. McGreevey is the 51st governor of New Jersey.

 BODY:
IN 1861, on the way to his inauguration, Abraham Lincoln addressed the New Jersey State Senate and spoke about the spirit of Trenton. He was referring to the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the Revolutionary War -- an event that had burned itself into his consciousness when he was a boy. 
 While New Jersey was once at the crossroads of the American Revolution, we are now a state at the crossroads of an innovation revolution. 
For years, New Jersey has been laying the groundwork to move from a manufacturing economy to a high-tech economy. Today, we have one of the world's strongest pharmaceutical and biotech clusters, some of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, strong universities and more than our share of groundbreaking small businesses. 
However, to make a successful transition to the information and innovation economy of this new era, we need an entirely different paradigm to guide us. We must establish an innovation triangle of partnerships between the private sector, the research university community and the State of New Jersey.
We have reconfigured Prosperity New Jersey with William C. Weldon, chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, and Dr. Shirley Tilghman, president of Princeton University, as its leaders. They will create a partnership between the private sector, the research university community and the state to leverage New Jersey's strengths and develop the Garden State as the Innovation State.
Prosperity New Jersey is working to ensure that New Jersey businesses have a corps of highly educated and highly skilled workers who can meet the demands of our new economy. The business and university communities must identify and address New Jersey's work force needs by developing and supporting innovative approaches that will better educate and train the state's workers for the jobs of the future. 
To meet this challenge, we must be committed to changing the structure of the university system to improve research and education, particularly in medicine and biotechnology.
New Jersey has several excellent schools and a strong research presence from pharmaceutical companies. We have the infrastructure; we should have one of the great health education centers in the United States.
With this in mind, I signed an executive order in March creating the Commission on Health Science, Education and Training. Working under the direction of Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, retired chairman and chief executive of Merck & Company, the commission will provide for synchronization between the education and health care industries.
At present, Rutgers University and New Jersey's health care education institutions are operating independently of one another. We must provide the necessary level of synergy to create a world-class, research-based university to complement the efforts of the private sector to develop intellectual property.
Most importantly, the state must undertake the necessary actions to fortify the structure of the new paradigm, namely a vibrant private sector, a research university premised upon excellence and a supportive state government.
Dr Vagelos's commission is critical to the state's economy, particularly in terms of developing job opportunities in the information and innovation economy.
As Prof. Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School has stated, New Jersey has more patent development in the private sector than in the public sector. We have corporate giants within economic sectors of innovation, yet companies yearn for a research university partner that will complement research and development efforts.
New Jersey also is supporting the spirit of innovation through such programs as the Spirit of Trenton Council and Lecture Series, which provides a showcase for the extraordinary cultural and scientific talent that is leading the innovative spirit now evident throughout New Jersey. 
As part of this program, Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University and Dr. Dennis Choi of Merck & Company, two of the most distinguished researchers of spinal cord injuries in the country, spoke recently about their work in regenerating nerve tissue. Their research gives hope to those who are paralyzed by spinal injury. Dr. Young and Dr. Choi are two of a growing community of scientists who look to the state to provide for the necessary link between pharmaceutical and rehabilitative therapies, clinical trials and the development of marketable products that will improve human lives.
In addition, the state's biotech industry is flourishing. A study conducted by the Rutgers University Graduate School of Management for the Biotechnology Council of New Jersey found that the industry contributed nearly $4 billion to New Jersey's economy in 2000, employing 7,500 people in 110 companies throughout the state. 
New Jersey also offers a series of incentive programs that provide financial assistance and other resources for businesses and educational institutions. 
Furthermore, our state is fully committed to enhancing research and development efforts as well as securing the protection of intellectual property. 
Today, through such initiatives as Prosperity New Jersey and Dr. Vagelos's commission, we are keeping alive the innovation of Edison and the idealism of Wilson -- both New Jerseyans -- as well as the spirit that inspired Lincoln. These programs continue to provide the foundation for innovation that will ensure the long-term competitiveness of the State of New Jersey.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for DEAN R. O'HARE; 
How to Tally the Costs of War?

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
 WITH President Bush threatening to attack Iraq, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, an old friend of the president and his father, expressed his solidarity in a speech last week to the nation's property-casualty insurers. He cautioned that a war with Iraq could be long and costly, but he received a warm response from the insurers, gathered at a conference in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. One of those applauding was Dean R. O'Hare, chief executive of the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, an insurer of businesses, homes and cars. Mr. O'Hare talked later about the business and economic implications of a war. JOSEPH B. TREASTER

Q. Why do you favor attacking Saddam Hussein?

A. This is an evil guy who is intent upon destroying us. And I think we need to extinguish him before he gets us. As for my fellow C.E.O.'s in the industry, I think you're going to find there are some people pretty much in favor of a pre-emptive strike and others who are not. Generally, I think the consensus of the people at the meeting, at least the people I spoke with, was that President Bush is doing the right thing.

Q. What impact do you foresee on the economy and the insurance business?

A. You've got to look at it as a negative impact. I don't think the impact is going to be enormous. But it's obviously going to have an impact on oil prices. We've lived through things like that before. I wouldn't even try to quantify it. But you can't view it as a positive. I think you could conceivably see us go from very small growth to a very, very small decline. I don't see anything more at this point. If there's a slowdown in the economy, obviously you're going to see a slowdown in certain lines of insurance coverage, workers' compensation, for example.

Q. Don't you worry about the possibility of counterattacks by terrorists in the United States?

A. That certainly is a possibility. But I don't think this is going to be a long and costly war. I think it's going to be quick and dirty. I think you need to talk in terms of months. But I think that in three months you have him out of power. I don't think you're going to have the level of retaliation here in the United States that some people are forecasting. There's always the potential for it. But I don't think we're going to have a situation where you have multiple occurrences. This is going to be a very high-tech war, and very one-sided.

Q. Since insurance coverage for terrorism has been withdrawn from most policies after 9/11, what effect would a new terrorist attack have on insurers?

A. A lot of policies have terrorism insurance included, but they don't have the same level of coverage they used to have. The 9/11 attacks will probably end up costing the insurance industry something in the neighborhood of $50 billion. If we had another one like that, my guess is that the amount of insured losses would be in the neighborhood of $15 billion. But there has been no lessening of coverage for terrorism in terms of workers' compensation insurance. If workers are injured or killed as a result of terrorism, the insurance companies would have to pay. Trying to control our possible losses, we're all being very careful in terms of insuring big groups in any one location. Before 9/11, no one ever thought you could have an attack where 3,000 people would be snuffed out. Now, we wouldn't dream of insuring 1,500 or 2,000 employees in a high-profile building in a major city. It's the possibility of the aggregate loss. People can get the coverage, but not from any one insurance company.

Q. You took the lead in calling the World Trade Center attack an act of terrorism, which at the time was covered in most insurance policies. In a war with Iraq, would you regard any counterattacks, for insurance purposes, as terrorism or as war, which is not routinely covered?

A. Any retaliation, I think, would come under the heading of war, not terrorism. Workers' compensation coverage would not be affected. The coverage is there regardless. But as far as property here in the United States or multinational holdings, they would definitely have a war exclusion. If you had a war and somebody dropped a bomb on a plant -- here or anywhere -- and destroyed it, you wouldn't have any coverage.
