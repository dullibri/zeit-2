HEADLINE: Senate Democrats to Press Inquiry Into High Energy Prices 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
With Democrats now in control of the Senate, its main investigating committee will focus on high energy prices. That will include conducting an inquiry into whether the federal agency that regulates electricity markets has been properly enforcing the law.
 The new chairman of the panel, the Governmental Affairs Committee, is Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who said today that it would take on tough issues in a bipartisan manner. 
 "I will refuse to allow oversight to become overkill," Mr. Lieberman said at a news conference.
The committee's focus on energy is part of a larger strategy by Democrats to try to highlight their differences with the Bush administration.
The committee's first hearing will explore the effects of deregulation on natural gas and electricity prices. Among those testifying will be economists who recently advocated temporary curbs on prices in volatile wholesale electricity markets like that in California. 
Mr. Lieberman supports price caps as a temporary solution in such markets. The Bush administration opposes them on the grounds that they distort the market by inhibiting investment in new plants.
Mr. Lieberman also said he planned to examine "whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was adequately carrying out its duties to ensure 'just and reasonable' electricity prices to consumers."
The commission, an independent agency that oversees a $250 billion industry, is charged with enforcing a 1935 law that calls for fair electricity prices. But as the energy markets have moved toward deregulation, the commission has tended to defer more to market forces, leading critics to question its enforcement of that law. 
Until this year, the commission had brought only one case asking for refunds in the electricity markets, collecting $598. More recently it sought $125 million in refunds from electricity generators for what it said were overcharges of California utilities. Mr. Lieberman said he would look at the commission's record under Democratic and Republican administrations.
He said he would also look at "serious allegations" raised by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, concerning the commission's relationship with the industry it regulates. Ms. Feinstein's concerns include a discussion earlier this year between the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., and Kenneth Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, the nation's biggest electricity trader. They said they discussed commission-related issues and Mr. Hebert's continued tenure as its chairman, though they had different interpretations on the talks. 
Mr. Lieberman said the committee would use its subpoena power if it was needed to hear testimony from industry officials.

HEADLINE: Subject to Review 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Almost nothing about the new tax law is irreversible. Even before President Bush signed it this morning with great fanfare at a White House ceremony, the politicians were talking about how to revise it.
 So this law -- Mr. Bush's top legislative priority -- will not necessarily lead to the kind of permanent change that would occur if Congress approved some of his other big policy proposals, like converting a part of Social Security into private savings accounts or requiring retirees on Medicare to shop for health insurance in the private market or installing a missile defense system. 
 Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have said they want to speed up the tax rate reductions and give new tax breaks to businesses, steps made harder by the new Democratic majority in the Senate.
Democrats in the Senate want to block some of the cuts in the new law before they take effect. Asked about this at his first news conference as majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota said: "I know we're going to revisit it. I just know that at some point that reality is going to come crashing down on all of us, and we're going to have to deal with it."
The law has the tax cuts going into effect gradually. That means they could be repealed before anyone could take advantage of most of them. Or they could be expanded.
As matters stand now, the lower tax rates will not become fully effective until 2006, the estate tax will not be fully repealed until 2010, the doubling of the tax credit for children will not take place until 2010 and new benefits for married couples will not begin until 2008.
And without changes, tens of millions of middle-class taxpayers will have most of their tax cuts eaten away by an arcane set of rules called the alternative minimum tax.
Most striking, all the tax cuts that became law today will expire on Dec. 31, 2010, and unless they are renewed, the tax law will revert to what it was this morning, before the president signed the new law. No one expects that to happen, but if it did, it would mean a sudden huge tax increase that could have disastrous economic consequences.
Most single income-taxpayers can count on a rebate check this year of $300. Single parents will get $500 and couples $600. But beyond that, little is certain. Year after year Congress will probably reconsider the law, and once tinkering with taxes begins, nothing in the tax code is immutable.
What gets changed will depend largely on unforeseeable political and economic circumstances. 
For example, if Democrats are in power, it is a safe bet that the repeal of the estate tax and the lowering of the top tax rate to 35 percent from the current 39.6 percent will never happen.
The only people who could benefit from these tax changes, which stand to cost the government tens of billions of dollars a year in lost revenue in the second decade of the century, are the wealthiest Americans. Democrats would rather spend the money on government programs.
If Republicans are in political control there is a good chance that the capital gains tax will be eliminated, or at least reduced, and that tax cuts will be expanded to include breaks for businesses.
Perhaps even more crucial to the fate of the tax cuts is what happens to the economy. The law was predicated on estimates by the Bush administration and the Congressional Budget Office that the government budget surplus would be $5.6 trillion over the next decade. 
Long-term forecasts like these are notoriously unreliable. Even the revised estimates due out this summer could be quite different from the ones made just last winter.
If, as the years go by, the surplus turns out to be larger than anticipated, the politicians will no doubt seek further tax cuts. But if it ends up being smaller, there will be strong pressure to renege on some of the tax reductions set to take effect late in the decade.
At this stage, it seems more likely that the surpluses will be smaller than that they will be larger. That is because the estimates assumed rigid limits on government spending that probably will not be maintained. Government spending is already smaller as a percentage of the national economy than at any other time since the 1960's, and the estimates of the surplus assume the proportion will drop another 25 percent in the next decade.
Furthermore, some expensive budget items are sure to be considered, like prescription drug coverage under Medicare and a missile defense shield. Future presidents and future Congresses may decide that the government would rather spend money on programs like these than let the tax cuts become effective.
And then there is the matter of the baby boomers. In 2010, this tax bill expires. The next year, the first of the baby boomers will reach 65 and become entitled to Social Security and Medicare. In the following years, the demands on the Treasury will begin to increase exponentially. It is difficult to imagine they can be met without higher taxes.
History has shown that politicians cannot keep their hands off the tax code.
The last big tax cut was in 1981, Ronald Reagan's first year as president. In 1982, 1983 and 1984, Congress approved tax increases that offset some of the Reagan cuts.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 wiped out scores of tax breaks for people and businesses and in return gave everyone much lower tax rates. It was viewed at the time as a monumental, bipartisan legislative accomplishment. But it was not long before new tax breaks were introduced and higher tax rates were imposed.
The first President George Bush promised no new taxes and then approved them in 1990. President Bill Clinton campaigned for lower taxes in 1992 and then raised them in 1993.
At the White House today, President Bush called the new tax law "the first major achievement of a new era."
"More achievements are ahead," the president said.
Doubtless that is the case. The question is, how much will the new achievements undo the first one.

HEADLINE: President's Signature Turns Broad Tax Cut, and a Campaign Promise, Into Law 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
President Bush fulfilled a major promise of his campaign for president today, signing into law the most sweeping tax cut in two decades, which he called "the first major achievement of a new era."
 Mr. Bush signed the $1.35 trillion tax cut -- which provides for soon-to-be mailed rebate checks of $300 to $600 for almost every income-tax payer -- amid the kind of presidential pomp he usually disdains: a formal ceremony in the East Room, with a Marine Corps band playing "Hail to the Chief." 
 For Mr. Bush, the moment completed the first major victory of his first year in office and the vindication of a political strategy that appeared dubious to some strategists during the campaign and politically improbable even after he was declared the winner of the presidential election. But his own relentless salesmanship around the country and an economic slowdown, which he used to justify an economic stimulus, turned the idea into an inevitability, a piece of political jujitsu that his own aides fear will be hard to repeat on many other issues. 
"Across the board tax relief does not happen often in Washington, D.C.," Mr. Bush said this morning. "In fact, since World War II, it has happened only twice: President Kennedy's tax cut in the 60's and President Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980's. And now it's happening for the third time, and it's about time."
Mr. Bush was surrounded by Republicans who have long argued for such a cut and by conservative Democrats, like Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia, who made it possible.
But beneath the smiles was considerable discomfort among the Republican senators who lost their cherished committee chairmanships and leadership posts after Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont defected from the party, shifting control of the Senate to the Democrats.
Yet Mr. Bush seemed to show little concern today about his political situation, and his top aides were already talking about the next step: pushing through a corporate tax cut sometime next year.
In an interview today, Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said: "I think that further reform on the business side is probably a good idea. We need to make it simpler and less costly."
In Congress today, a few Republicans talked about making the current bill permanent. An odd feature is that it expires on Dec. 31, 2010 -- a sunset provision put in because of Congressional rules governing spending more than a decade in the future. But the real effect is to disguise the true cost of the tax cut if Congress extends the bill, which it will be under great pressure to do.
Mr. Lindsey said today that he expected that the tax cut would be made permanent, "but not any time in the immediate future."
The final tax-cut legislation fell short of the reductions Mr. Bush wanted, by $250 billion. It lowered the top tax rate to 35 percent, not the 33 percent sought by Mr. Bush. It slowly winds down the estate tax, eliminating it in 2010. But the levy, which Republicans called the "death tax" to press their political case, will be fully restored in 2011, more than two years after Mr. Bush leaves office if he is re-elected.
"The White House does think the cuts should be permanent," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today. Mr. Fleischer noted that federal entitlement programs were permanent, while the tax cuts are not. "Washington was built to spend," he said. 
Following tradition in signing major legislation, Mr. Bush used a different pen for each letter of his name, then handed the pens to Republican Congressional leaders and a few Democrats whose support was critical.
Among them was Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the new chairman of the Finance Committee, whose decision to reach a compromise between his own party's more modest tax cut and Mr. Bush's more ambitious one angered leaders in his own party, including the new majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. But tonight Mr. Daschle was headed to the White House for a private dinner with Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, while Mr. Baucus said he did the right thing by striking a deal with Mr. Bush.
"Every day it looks like a better and better decision," Mr. Baucus said at the White House after the signing ceremony. "In many respects, I think politically I helped the party. We Democrats would have been in trouble in 2002 just saying no to every one of the president's proposals."
But other Democratic leaders continued to criticize Mr. Bush and argued that he had traded away deficit reduction. They predicted that the tax cut would have to be revised, but not soon.
For Republicans, the most politically beneficial moment may come this summer, when those who paid income taxes for last year begin to receive rebate checks, $300 for single filers and $600 for those who filed joint returns. (Some taxpayers, like children listed as dependents on their parents' returns, will not get rebates.)
Today, Representative J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican, told colleagues in a memorandum that as the refund checks are sent out, Republicans should remind taxpayers "who is working to give them more of their own money back to meet their own priorities, not Washington's."
Economists hope the rebates will spur consumer spending in the second half of the year, but the economic effect is hard to predict.
"I think it will create a big kick at the end of the year and then an additional four-tenths to five-tenths of growth next year," Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, said this evening.
Gradual cuts in tax rates will follow the rebate checks. A new 10 percent bottom rate will be created; the child credit will be increased gradually; and the amounts that can be contributed to individual retirement, 401(k) and educational accounts will be raised, deferring or reducing taxes.
While some Democrats were at the White House celebrating with Mr. Bush today, the bill's opponents were on Capitol Hill talking about its costs and promising to roll back some provisions.
Within an hour of the signing, the House minority leader, Representative Dick Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who led opposition to the cut, was already talking about a rollback if the budget surplus that Mr. Bush counted on failed to materialize. But many Democrats concede in private that the debate is largely over for the immediate future. If the surpluses do not appear, Mr. Baucus agreed today, "then the surplus will get squeezed."
How much it will get squeezed will depend on the economic growth rate, how much the Treasury collects in capital gain taxes and other cyclical funds and how much Congress spends. And while all sides of that debate proffer numbers to prove their point, history suggests that any surplus or deficit projections beyond the next two or three years are unreliable. For example, in the Clinton years, the White House consistently underestimated revenues; today there is evidence that projections may be too optimistic.
Congress seems in a mood to break out of the spending limits it set for itself earlier this year.
Today the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, C.W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, said "my position today" was that the 13 annual spending bills would honor the $661 billion total proposed by Bush administration and included in the 2002 budget Republicans pushed through Congress in April.
But that total excludes the administration's plans to overhaul military acquisitions, for a missile shield and for increases in education.
Today, an $18.9 billion spending bill that finances a host of conservation and energy programs sailed through a House subcommittee. It included $294 million more than Mr. Bush had requested for energy research and conservation, pushing the amount to nearly $1.8 billion.

HEADLINE: After Shift in Senate, Some in G.O.P. Are Fearing Wider Impact in 2002 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
Many prominent Republicans are worried that the unexpected switch of the Senate to Democratic control may carry enormous political consequences for their party that run far deeper than forfeiting the issue agenda on Capitol Hill.
 Republicans are concerned that the loss of the Senate -- even by the single defection of Senator James M. Jeffords -- will embolden Democrats and demoralize Republicans in the run-up to the critical midterm elections next year. 
 That, they said, could lead partisans to be less enthusiastic about making donations and working in the grass roots. And they expressed fears that the Republicans' minority status in the Senate might cause some senators not to seek re-election next year and could make it more difficult for the party to recruit the most formidable contenders.
Republicans also said the switch of the Senate raised the stakes of the two governors' races this year, in Virginia and New Jersey, where Republicans are already regarded as the underdogs. 
Those off-year races are not always a barometer of the political climate in the next year, but they can give the winning party an important psychological lift that helps fund-raising and stirs the activists. Even Republicans say they have an uphill climb to retain the governorships in those two states.
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, said of those races, and of the many more in 2002: "I don't stay awake late at night worrying about too many things, but this will keep me up. It's a very challenging time."
Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, chairman of the Republican National Committee, noted that the Democratic candidate to succeed him, Mark Warner, had far more campaign money than the Republican nominee, Mark L. Earley.
"We have to find some way to match the enormous wealth of the Democratic candidate," said Mr. Gilmore, who cannot run for re-election because Virginia bars governors from seeking consecutive terms. "That's hard to do."
Beyond the electoral worries, Republicans are engaged in a wrenching debate about how much President Bush and Republican lawmakers should moderate their positions now that Mr. Jeffords has defected.
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, for one, said they should not budge at all. "They should not be swept up by the thought or fear that somehow the country is lurching way to the left of them," Mr. Keating said. "The country isn't -- the Democratic Party is."
But former Senator John C. Danforth, a moderate conservative from Missouri, countered that the party had better be more inclusive.
"I'm concerned that we're becoming too narrow," Mr. Danforth said. "Jeffords is a real loss. His membership in the Republican Party said that while we're basically conservative, we're big enough to have differences of opinion."
While attention has been fixed on the Senate, many Republicans -- already wary of Democrats deploring that Mr. Bush lost the popular vote last year -- said they were worried about internal and outside polls showing the president's approval ratings slipping.
A nationwide poll conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post this week found that Mr. Bush's job approval has dipped to 55 percent, a rating lower than seven of the previous nine presidents had at this point in their tenure.
Many Republicans say Mr. Bush's trip to California last week did him more harm than good. His approval rating among that state's voters is 43 percent, down from 56 percent two months ago, according to a survey by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin & Associates.
"The party is on the defensive," said William J. Bennett, a former education secretary and national drug policy director.
Speaking of the president, Mr. Bennett said, "You know the honeymoon is over when the smiling face bringing you breakfast at your front door is Tom Daschle."
While some Republicans would discuss their dissatisfaction with the leadership of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, only privately, Mr. Bennett was not hesitant to speak out.
"He should consider maybe it's time for someone else to do this," he said. "We have a somewhat uncertain trumpet in the Senate."
Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald of Illinois complained of a lack of tolerance for diverse views among his party's leadership on Capitol Hill.
"We must come to grips with the fact that what it means to be a Republican in Vermont is not the same as what it means to be a Republican in Mississippi or Montana," Mr. Fitzgerald said. "You will see more willingness on the part of rank-and-file senators to question the infallibility of leaders."
That said, Mr. Fitzgerald added, "A Wall Street analyst would probably still call the Republican Party 'a buy.' We have the House. We have the White House. And we're only one vote away from a working majority in the Senate."
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, said he was not worried. "You never know how these things are going to play out," Mr. Rove said. "But I feel confident about the state of the party. The enthusiasm about our agenda has a great deal to do with it."
Mr. Rove said people "overstate the dramatic change in the Senate -- it's still a place that's going to require 60 votes to get things passed."
Governor Gilmore was downright ebullient, saying: "Whatever you're hearing, it's just not right. For heaven's sake, today we just signed the biggest tax cut we've seen in a long, long time." 
It could be, of course, that the loss of the Senate emboldens Republicans, just as the Democrats recovered after their electoral setback in 1994. And for all the concerns about alienating moderates, the party has succeeded in the critical task of keeping its conservative base happy.
Still, many Republicans say they are nervous about possible reverberations from Capitol Hill.
"There's always a shakeout period where you go from a tremendous high to a little bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Tom Cole, a party strategist who stepped down this year as chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. "But the Jeffords departure and the loss of the Senate is something that disturbs Republicans and concerns them quite a bit."
Warning that the Democrats are far more energized than Republicans, Mr. Cole said: "There's a psychological mood that you've got to be careful of. You never want to appear to be losing ground or on the defensive because it affects everything from candidate recruitment to the willingness of people to commit their time and money. We've not established ourselves as a legitimate winner in the way that Ronald Reagan was a legitimate winner."
Former Vice President Dan Quayle said he was deeply worried about losing longtime senators who do not want to be in the minority.
"My biggest concern is that there's going to be this self-fulfilling prophecy that the Democrats are back, and Republican senators are going to look at their minority status and some are going to decide not to run," Mr. Quayle said.
His strongest counsel to Republicans was, "Don't panic."
Those who do seek re-election may find that political action committees, hedging their bets, will be more apt to give to Democrats.
"Senators who are up in 2002 may have more difficulty raising money out of their own states and from the Washington political action community," said Wayne Berman, a Republican strategist and fund-raiser. But he added that the Senate shift could spur more donations from smaller donors beyond Washington eager to do battle with the Democrats.
Worries about recruitment only exacerbate the challenges for Republicans, who were already on the defensive about next year's prospects because the party that wins the White House often suffers in the subsequent midterm elections. Of particular concern is that Republicans will lose their dominance of governorships. The party now has 29 governors, but 23 of those seats are being contested next year, and many Republicans say a third of those seats appear vulnerable.
Republicans fear losing governorships in some large states, including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
"We're sort of the victims of our own success," said Mr. Rove, who noted that some incumbents were up against limits on the number of terms they could serve. "We're being as supportive as we can."
Even the most nervous Republicans seemed more inclined to criticize their leaders on Capitol Hill than Mr. Bush.
"I've had a lot of people say, 'We probably got what we deserved' because there's a feeling among a lot of Republicans that there was an unwillingness of some Republicans to compromise within the Senate," said Robert T. Bennett, chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio. "There has to be a sincere effort to address the concerns of everyday America."
Mr. Bennett and several other Republicans said their party should redouble its efforts and emphasize issues like the cost of prescription drugs and a patients' bill of rights.
"At the end of the day, the party in power still has to deliver," said Rusty Hills, chairman of the Republican Party in Michigan. "We've lost the Senate, but Bush is still the president, and we have got to deliver on issues like the patients' bill of rights, and we have to make sure the economy grows."
Other Republicans argue that the pressure is now on Democrats to perform. And rather than take the offensive, some seemed to be hanging their hopes on the possibility that Senate Democrats would alienate voters by overreaching in their agenda.
"If they're the architects of a destruction derby, they'll lose, and they'll lose big," Governor Keating said, referring to the parties' performance in next year's elections.
But if the Democrats are careful not to go too far? "Then they'll win," he said.

HEADLINE: City Insists on Administrative Cuts for School Board 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
City officials reassured the Board of Education yesterday that they would allocate additional money for instruction in the next school year if the board made cuts in its administrative costs over the summer.
 The proposal, which was still being hammered out yesterday as part of a budget agreement, could mean that the Board of Education would not have to ask school districts to make up to $200 million in cuts that would affect teachers, aides or academic programs. 
 Growing administrative costs have been at the center of a running dispute between Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The chancellor has maintained that administration represents a small fraction of costs, while the mayor has often spoken of a bloated bureaucracy at the board's headquarters that would have to be cut before the board could expect further spending increases. 
The City Council and the mayor agreed on a tentative budget on Wednesday. Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani dismissed the idea that the budget would create problems for the school system, saying the board's only challenge would be in reducing overhead costs. 
"That's a good problem to have," Mr. Giuliani said, "because the Board of Education has over $12 billion in city, state and federal money. And they should figure out how to spend that $12 billion effectively."
The budget calls for an increase of about $200 million -- about $50 million of that would come from city funds -- in the Board of Education's budget, bringing the allocation to about $11.5 billion, according to city officials. Board officials said that increase would actually mean a cut in the money available for programs after accounting for such things as mandated salary increases and the effects of inflation.
The City Council has come down on the mayor's side, insisting on administrative cuts. "We told them that if you can demonstrate you are trimming the central board's budget, then any instructional needs you have later in the year, we'll be happy to look at and fund," Jordan Barowitz, a Council spokesman, said yesterday.
It is not clear how much the board will have to cut from administrative costs to avoid reductions that would affect classroom services. "We don't have a hard target," Mr. Barowitz said. "We're looking for a good-faith effort."
City Council members were apparently reacting to the rapid increase in central administration costs this year. According to Board of Education budget figures, nonsalary expenses at the central board were budgeted at $50 million at the beginning of the current school year, which ends in June. But by the beginning of March, the expected level of those expenses for the entire year had ballooned to more than $110 million. Salary and fringe benefit costs were also higher than expected, at $83 million compared with an original budget figure of $50 million. Earlier this year, under pressure from City Hall, Mr. Levy laid out $22 million in cuts in central administration over two years.
Anthony Shorris, the deputy chancellor for management and policy, said yesterday that the board was waiting to see the language in the budget agreement before deciding where it would make spending cuts.

HEADLINE: More Cutbacks by Consultants As Accenture Trims Its Payroll 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Accenture, the consulting firm formerly known as Andersen Consulting, announced yesterday that it would lay off approximately 600 employees, mainly support staff, and encourage up to 800 consultants to take voluntary sabbaticals for up to one year in an effort to control costs.
 The steps are in response not only to a slowdown in client spending but also to a sharp decrease in the firm's attrition rate, which at this time last year topped 20 percent as consultants hopped jobs in search of dot-com glory. 
 Now, as employees see other job options vanish -- and as the prospect of Accenture's public stock offering beckons, though no date has been set -- attrition is 12 percent, said Roxanne Taylor, a spokeswoman for the firm. 
The cutbacks will be mainly in the United States, she said. Over all, the firm expects net growth of 9,000 new consultants this year, with much of the growth in Europe, she said.
Accenture is the latest consulting firm to show signs of strain because of uncertain economic conditions in the United States. Companies that hired the firms in past years are reluctant to spend as much now, industry officials say.
"They're not manufacturing a product, so the quickest way for them to cut costs is through head- count" reductions, said Jack Sweeney, the editor of Consulting Magazine. "At the same time, morale takes a pretty severe hit any time you have layoffs. They're getting creative to avoid that."
Accenture's sabbatical program, an effort to retain people with valuable experience but still cut wage costs, is unusual.
Available at the firm's discretion to consultants who sign up by the end of the month, the program pays participating employees 20 percent of their salary for 6 to 12 months and maintains benefits during that period. They are guaranteed a job when they return, Ms. Taylor said.
"The plus for us is, during this sort of economic slowdown, we save 80 percent of the salaries that people are making," Ms. Taylor said. When consultants come back from sabbatical, they do not have to be trained as new employees would, she added. 
Still, Accenture employees may want to consider the risks of participating, said Russell H. Miller, a partner at S.C.A. Consulting, a compensation advisory firm.
"When you say a job will be there in 12 months, the implicit understanding is it will be there if the business will support it," Mr. Miller said. "If the economy does not turn, I would make a strong case that these jobs will not be there just as they're not there now."
The 600 job cuts, less than 1 percent of Accenture's worldwide work force of 75,000, will focus on office support staff, according to Ms. Taylor. Most will be in the United States.
Other consulting firms have also announced staff reductions as business has slowed. In recent weeks the strategy consultant Booz-Allen & Hamilton announced layoffs, as did William M. Mercer, a human resources consulting firm.

HEADLINE: A Stanford Economist to Be No. 2 at I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund announced today that it had named Anne O. Krueger, a Stanford University economist and a strong proponent of global free trade, to serve as its No. 2 official, responsible for carrying out the fund's role as the world's financial firefighter.
 Ms. Krueger, 67, will replace Stanley Fischer, who during his seven years as deputy managing director, devised a series of financial rescue efforts for developing nations. The position is traditionally filled by an American who has the support of the White House. Until today's announcement, Ms. Krueger had been President Bush's choice for a seat on his Council of Economic Advisers. 
 The choice suggests that the Bush administration does not intend to try to radically reinvent the way the I.M.F. works. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and his top deputy for international matters, John Taylor, have in the past criticized the fund's bailouts.
Ms. Krueger, who served in the Reagan administration as chief economist at the World Bank, the I.M.F.'s sister agency, has echoed Mr. O'Neill's calls for better early warning of impending financial crises to prevent the need for multibillion-dollar rescue packages. But she has also defended the fund's rescue efforts in Asia in the late 1990's.
Horst Kohler, managing director of the I.M.F., had recommended naming Timothy Geithner, who served as under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs in the Clinton administration, to the No. 2 post, fund officials said. But Bush administration officials rejected that choice, the officials said, because Mr. Geithner was viewed as too closely associated with policies of the Clinton team.
The I.M.F. instead named Mr. Geithner as director of the policy development and review department, succeeding Jack Boorman. He had been considered for that position before Mr. Fischer announced his intention to resign.
Toward the end of the Clinton presidency, Mr. Geithner worked closely with Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to shape recommendations for I.M.F. policies. Last year, he managed the American role in the contentious and prolonged process of selecting a new managing director. 
The I.M.F. announced two other appointments today. Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard University was selected to be chief economist, succeeding Michael Mussa. Mr. Rogoff worked at the fund in the early 1980's and has also worked at the Federal Reserve.
Gerd Hausler, former chairman of Dresdner Bank's investment banking arm, was appointed to head a new capital markets department. Mr. Hausler, a German, is expected to help the fund monitor stock, bond and currency markets and to provide more coordination between the fund and private financial companies.

HEADLINE: City Budget Seeks More Money for Child Care, Housing and Orderly Elections 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
There is an extra serving of money intended to prevent -- or at least minimize -- chaos at the polls this year. The dollars are still there to follow up on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's promise to build more low-cost housing. And nearly 11,000 more city children will be able to get subsidized day care.
 These are among the details that surfaced as the City Council moved yesterday toward adopting a $39.7 billion budget, following up on the accord reached with the mayor on Wednesday afternoon. 
 Not all the news was so rosy, though. There were signs yesterday that the city might have difficulty winning approval in Albany for part of a $500 million tax cut plan. There was also a chorus of criticism, once again, from fiscal monitors who warned that generous spending in the 2002 budget could create problems for the next mayor.
"There are enough clouds on the horizon economically that it does not seem prudent to put the city's payroll at the highest level in 25 years," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. 
Inside City Hall, these concerns, at least for now, did not interfere with the pleasure of completing work on what will be the Giuliani administration's final budget. The first order of business yesterday was nothing too exalted: printing the voluminous budget document so that the City Council members could actually see the plan before voting on it. 
"In so many areas, this is a document that makes a difference in people's lives," Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said. "The budget is the most important law that we pass." 
The budget, which would go into effect July 1, changed little from the plan outlined by the mayor in April. Changes were few even through the last few days' squabbling between the Council and administration about what sounds like a lot of money -- a couple of hundred million dollars -- but is actually less than 1 percent of the overall spending.
The Council persuaded the mayor to restore about $180 million in various cuts, from libraries to parks and cultural programs. The package also includes a collection of new items that should, at least in theory, improve some New Yorkers' lives.
There is enough city, state and federal money to add 10,618 subsidized child-care slots, a 12 percent increase. About 25,000 people are already on a city waiting list for child care vouchers. 
The city's investment in low- and moderate-priced housing will increase, by the administration's count, by about 25 percent in the coming year, with an extra 2,850 apartments or homes built or renovated as part of the mayor's housing initiative.
Mr. Giuliani said earlier this year that he would accept the extra city spending only if he won Council approval for changes in the city building code and in the regulation of the construction industry that would reduce the cost of building housing. He failed to win those concessions, but the money remained.
The budget also includes about $1.7 million extra for the Board of Elections, so it can try to prevent gridlock during the municipal elections this year. A call center would be set up to answer voters' questions on days when the polls are open. Extra mechanics would be hired to repair the city's aging voting machines. Interpreters who speak Korean and Chinese would be hired. And if legislation pending in Albany passes, pay for the nearly 30,000 poll workers will be increased, to a base wage of $250 for a day's work. 
Even with this extra spending, the administration expects to end the 2002 fiscal year with at least a $545 million surplus. The figure that concerns the fiscal monitors is a $2.7 billion deficit projected for the 2003 fiscal year, a number they consider dangerously high but that the Giuliani administration said can be taken care of without hardship.
On the revenue side, the final value of the tax cut package is still somewhat undecided. The small reduction in the city's personal income tax is assured, saving the average taxpayer $49 a year. About 3,000 businesses in Manhattan should no longer have to pay a city tax on their rent. Those two items constitute $205 million of the $500 million tax cut package, but all the rest needs Albany approval.
A tax credit for parents with children in child care and the elimination of the city sales tax on clothing may not be approved in Albany, because they will be part of a legislative bill that also includes the proposed elimination of a $2 fee on hotel rooms, a measure that the Assembly has opposed.
"The Assembly Democratic conference rejected a similar proposal last year, and there is no indication they have changed their position," Speaker Sheldon Silver said through a spokesman yesterday.
Adam L. Barsky, the director of the City Office of Management and Budget, said he remained hopeful that the tax plan would win full approval.
"This is not an election year for the Assembly, so maybe they will be more willing to back it," Mr. Barsky said. "And if it doesn't, we will find other taxes to cut. So we are not backing off."

HEADLINE: A Progressive Past 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your June 2 news article about the establishment of a "living wage" in New York City reminds us that this city used to be the nation's leader in terms of progressive social policy experiments. Indeed, in 1961, Mayor Robert F. Wagner signed the first such "living wage" law in the land, requiring city contractors to pay their workers no less than $1.50 per hour at a time when the minimum wage for most workers was just $1 per hour. 
 The current movement for a living wage has unified an unusually robust coalition of community, labor, nonprofit, religious and business leaders. Passage of this law will re-assert New York's historic role as a city where the nonwealthy also enjoy the fruits of our economy.

PERSON: Henry Michel 

HEADLINE: Henry Michel, 76, Civil Engineer And Leader in Building Industry 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Henry Ludwig Michel, a globe-trotting civil engineer with a 50-year career that made him a leader in the construction industry, died on May 23 at his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 76.
 The apparent cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 Mr. Michel was chairman emeritus and a former president of Parsons Brinckerhoff, a Manhattan construction and consulting firm. He retired in 1994, after almost 30 years with the company, but he kept in close touch with it and the industry.
The firm, now 116 years old, designed the original IRT subway line in New York City. Mr. Michel oversaw the firm's work on more recent large-scale transportation projects, like Atlanta's rapid transit system, the first Caracas Metro line in Venezuela and the transit system of Taipei, Taiwan.
He was a native of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and a 1949 civil-engineering graduate of Columbia University. Early in his career, he took part in a project designed to upgrade British fighter-bomber bases to NATO standards.
From England, he moved to Rome and started an engineering company that became a contractor at sites in Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. He helped develop the University of Baghdad, the Nigerian Parliament in Lagos, Tunis University and the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva.
He returned to New York in 1965 and joined Parsons Brinckerhoff. He was made a partner in 1969 and, in 1975, led the traditional partnership's reorganization into an employee-owned corporation. He was its first president and chief executive and became chairman in 1990.
During his tenure, the firm went thoroughly international, with six offices overseas, and its work force grew to 4,000 from 500 employees. After stepping down as chairman, he continued to travel widely abroad on its behalf.
He also joined a new trouble-shooting venture, Global Construction Solutions, in Princeton, N.J. It brought together retired top industry executives and academics to advise companies facing problems in their foreign operations.
Similarly, he became a co-owner of Pegasus Consulting, also of Princeton, in which he teamed with two M.I.T. professors and a risk-management firm, among others. Pegasus provides assessments of political, social, economic and assorted other realities a company should be aware of before it invests in big overseas projects.
Mr. Michel was a founding member and former president of the Civil Engineering Research Foundation. He lectured at M.I.T., Columbia and other schools and was the recipient of many honors, including Columbia's Alumni Federation Medal and the Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievement.
Mr. Michel is survived by his wife of 57 years, Mary Elizabeth Strolis Michel; two daughters, Eve M. Milanese and Ann M. Wilde, both of Manhattan; a brother, Frank, of Dover, Mass.; and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Catching the Wave; 
Surfware Makers Rush to Cash In On a Growing Trend

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
From his salt-scented perch along the Atlantic Ocean in Narragansett, R.I., Tom Hogan has had a front-row seat for every surfing trend in the last 20 years. Mr. Hogan owns a surf shop called Warm Winds, where he sells boards, wax, sunscreen and surfer clothing. Especially, these days, the clothing. 
 In the last couple of years, he says, there has practically been a stampede into the store, particularly for women's and children's clothing. And customers want specific brands -- as in "Dude, where're my Hurley shorts?" Surfing's popularity has climbed recently, but the surfwear craze has taken off even faster, with a number of companies paddling hard to cash in, whether the shopper surfs or not. 
 To be sure, the trend has been pushed and pulled to try to make sales regardless of season and geography. Across the retail business, sales have slowed with the dips in the economy, and surfwear has another worry: how long the trend can last in a world of constantly shifting style, led by notoriously fickle teenagers. The hotter brands tend to be newer labels, like Hurley International, Volcom and Stussy, which emphasize a style somewhere between surfer and skateboarder. Some surfwear companies are adding clothes designed for skateboarders, on the theory that anyone can skateboard -- as long as there's a pavement nearby. 
Surfwear can range from bikinis printed with multiple hibiscus to fleece pullovers in drab winter-seascape colors. There are boardshorts -- those lace-up baggies mainly identified with surfers -- and long pants, suitable for the casual office. Accessories abound, like Pacific Sunwear's Venus zippered wallet, selling for $16, and Roxy's lines of makeup, jewelry and shoes.
"We used to have to search out women's wear," Mr. Hogan said. "Now we can get what people want from Billabong, Point Concepcion, Quiksilver, Rusty and companies like that." There are also plenty of clothes for young girls, led by Quiksilver's Roxy line, which started to build up steam five years ago. And in surfwear, it seems, there is an endless summer, or at least a full calendar's worth of sales. Mr. Hogan carries sweaters and other heavy clothes made by the same companies that issue wet suits, boardshorts and breezy cotton dresses. 
"The whole look and the image and the lifestyle that goes along with it are very popular," Mr. Hogan noted, "and people don't make any bones about spending for it."
While surfing itself is mainly confined to California, Florida and pockets of the Northeast, and surfwear sales are higher there, the clothes also turn up in the landlocked reaches of Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota. Department stores like Nordstrom's and Macy's, which is owned by Federated Department Stores, carry it. Big merchandisers like the Gap, Children's Place and Abercrombie & Fitch have generated their own versions of it. Mail-order icons like L. L. Bean and Lands' End sell it, as do mall-based chains like Pacific Sunwear and tourist destinations like the Typhoon Lagoon at Disney World. And next spring, there will be something of a surfwear milestone: the first Surf Expo dedicated to back-to-school shopping. 
Karen Bizer, a Manhattan mother of 9-year-old twins, shops for shorts and other surfwear made by Billabong and Quiksilver at Marsha D. D., a store on the Upper East Side. She was urged to buy the clothes by her children, she said, who liked them for their colors, comfort and distinctive style. "On some level, they have an innate appeal," she said. "They didn't know they were tied to surfing." 
Many of the purchases are made by the increasingly financially liberated teenager, who does not want to wear any old pair of shorts or T-shirt. 
"They are looking for the hot brands, and the hot brands obviously are the authentic brands," said Jim White, head of investor relations for Pacific Sunwear, a publicly traded company based in Anaheim, Calif.
Authentic can mean many things to many people. While Pacific Sunwear, with 500 stores considered responsible for taking surfwear to the masses, has had success with its store brands as well, such success is not easy to come by. Earlier this year, the company's sales suffered when it brought out what analysts call "the wrong pants" for its men's collection. Both Pacific Sunwear and Quiksilver have had wobbly sales as the economy cooled this spring. Quiksilver's share price closed yesterday at $24.55, down 15.7 percent from its 52-week high, and Pacific Sunwear's shares have dropped 41.6 percent since hitting a high in February of $35.875, closing yesterday at $20.95. 
But analysts say the trend remains strong. Fall orders from surf shops rose 20 percent this year, according to one analyst's survey. One reason is that surfing is having a mini-renaissance. Wet-suit sales, a key indicator, grew to 700,000 last year in the United States, up from 400,000 in 1992, according to the Surf Industry Manufacturers' Association, a California-based trade group.
Some of the growth is fueled by the rising number of women taking up surfing. Five or six years ago, women made up just 5 percent of surfers; now they account for 15 percent, said Michael Kingsbury, whose Huntington Beach, Calif., company represents amateur champions like Holly Beck. Companies like Quiksilver, one of the largest makers of the clothing, have rushed to sponsor champion female surfers who some consider more appealing than their male counterparts. One surfer, Lisa Anderson, had extra appeal to working mothers, since she traveled to various surfing competitions all over the world with both her surfboard and her child. 
"The women are very marketable," said Mr. Kingsbury, who also serves as spokesman for the trade group. "The guys tend to be spoiled and pampered. The women have had to struggle to get their contracts, and they are more outgoing, more articulate." 
Quiksilver has not wasted any time getting on that bandwagon. The company's Roxy division sponsors surf camps, contests and professional female surfers to both market and develop its clothing, said Dana Dartez, Roxy's design director. "I hang out at the high schools, the lunch places, the shopping malls and the surf shops," she said. "I try to be a sponge and see what they want." 
The interest in surfwear "is very much tied in to what's going on socially and politically," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a Manhattan consulting firm. "When we got richer and better and could be more cool about things, all of a sudden everybody could relax a little. You started to see slip dresses, and mules, and surfwear." 
For others, it is a constantly recurring summer theme. "You will see the beach and surf lifestyle almost every summer in our collection," said Rebecca Weill, a spokeswoman for the Gap. "We've got a graphic T-shirt this year with dolphins on it. To me, that is surfwear." 
Some say the bigger retailers have difficulty with the concept, possibly because surfwear's adherents are quick to sense whether something is "authentic." Last year, the Gap and its Old Navy division ran into trouble with their surfwear, said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an analyst for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "There wasn't enough of a mass appeal for nonauthentic surf products," he said. 
The look definitely does not appeal to everyone. In focus groups of New York area teenagers, a cultural divide emerged. "What we saw was that for the black kids, surfwear is totally irrelevant," said Faye I. Landes, who covers retail for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "And the white kids said that Quiksilver is what kids wear in California." 
Still, even small designers say they find a following, sometimes in unexpected places. Izzy Tihanyi, a 29-year-old surfer, started the Surf Diva surf school in La Jolla, Calif., five years ago to teach other women how to enjoy the sport. Many surf schools were "all about the testosterone challenge against the ocean, and that's not how women like to learn," she said. 
Along the way, she and her twin sister, Caroline, brought out a clothing line decorated with the Surf Diva logo. The line includes T-shirts, sweatshirts and rash guards -- lightweight nylon shirts. The rash guards come in batik prints and a snakeskin pattern, along with other colors. 
Orders have streamed in to the company's Web site from all over the country -- not just from surfers. "Some women are even wearing them out to clubs," Ms. Tihanyi said. "We're getting orders from Kansas." 
At Quiksilver, where sales have soared from $193 million in 1996 to $516 million last year, surfer style is seen as extending well beyond the beach. "We are an attitude," said Greg Ziegler, the Huntington Beach company's executive vice president for operations. "People enjoy getting outdoors, being in the sunshine, being active and living life. The clothes are a reflection of that attitude."
Within the last year, Quiksilver has expanded into golf apparel, come up with a new brand for post-college-age women and begun aggressively marketing a line named for Tony Hawk, a professional skateboarding star, which seeks to merge the worlds of surfing and skating -- many teenagers say they do both -- and snowboarding as well. At a store opening last fall in the Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, N.J., thousands of teenagers turned out to see Mr. Hawk. 
It is hard to explain why other water-based life styles have not fueled fashion trends. No one has tried to mass-market Michigan lake-cottage clothes, for example, or Mississippi Delta resortwear. But Mr. Ziegler, who grew up in Indiana, says there is still a huge untapped market for surfwear in the heartland. 
"The challenge has always been, how do you get into that Midwestern kid's lifestyle?" he said. "Is it through Rolling Stone? Or MTV? We have had a big increase in those areas, but it's not anywhere near the levels we deal with on the coastal areas." 
What is considered "ripping" -- surfer talk for "great" -- in one place does not necessarily play elsewhere. Huntington Surf and Sport, a shop in Huntington Beach, opened a branch recently in Osaka, Japan, filled with racks of clothes from Stussy and Volcom as well as the store's private label. While tastes in Japan lag behind those in California by a year or so -- fluorescent T-shirts are still selling well in Osaka, but would be considered so last year in Huntington Beach -- both markets seek the latest and most surfer-oriented stuff. 
"It is very hard to come out with a new line and have it be successful," said the company's creative director, Dean Bradley. "The kids know what has been around and what supports the sport at its core." 
Marketing the surf look beyond its basic constituency is tricky. "You can't be some mainstream label that decides to shift its distribution toward this channel," said Mitchel Kummetz, a specialty retail analyst for A. G. Edwards & Sons. "A lot of these companies are owned or managed by former professional surfers."
Not all waves are meant to be shared, as any surf instructor will confirm, and no wave lasts forever.

PERSON: Victor Paz Estenssoro 

HEADLINE: Victor Paz Estenssoro, 93, 4-Time Bolivia Leader, Dies 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 8 

 BODY:
Victor Paz Estenssoro, who was president of Bolivia four times in a career that he began as a moderate leftist and ended as a conservative, and who went into exile three times, died on Thursday. He was 93.
 News service reports said Mr. Paz Estenssoro died where he was born, in Tarija, of complications from the amputation of his right leg because of circulatory problems. 
 Mr. Paz Estenssoro is best remembered for being a leader of a revolution in 1952, the defining political event in modern Bolivian history. He decreed a thorough land redistribution, nationalization of the mining industry and universal suffrage, including the Indian majority. Radical labor unions have been major figures in Bolivian politics since then.
Mr. Paz Estenssoro was born on Oct. 2, 1907, into a family of landowners in the southern wine region. He traveled to La Paz, the capital, planning to study law. But he specialized in economics and spent much of career as an economics adviser and professor.
In 1942, he helped found the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, at first a motley coalition of radical urban professionals and military rightists, that remains an important center-left party.
He won a presidential election in 1951. But Congress handed over power to a military junta. After brief fighting in 1952 in La Paz and other cities, Mr. Paz Estenssoro returned from exile in Argentina and was sworn in as president. He, in turn, exiled many of his opponents.
The Eisenhower administration embraced the revolution as an alternative to Communism, and aid from Washington flowed. But hyperinflation eroded Mr. Paz Estenssoro's support among the middle class. In the election of 1956, he was replaced as president by another leader of his party. But he returned to office in 1960, and again in 1964. His third term was cut short after three months by a military coup.
Mr. Paz Estenssoro, who was ambassador to Britain and the Netherlands, was known as a reclusive man with simple tastes. He took part in few public events and left much of the work to his ministers, especially in his final term.
But Mr. Paz Estenssoro, nicknamed the Old Fox, was also known for toughness. One of many popular anecdotes began in an early term, when the leader of a mining union surprised Mr. Paz Estenssoro at a worker protest by stuffing a stick of dynamite in his belt and threatening to light it. "If you want to die, light it and we'll go together," Mr. Paz Estenssoro reportedly said. The miner backed down, and the uprising was over.
Mr. Paz Estenssoro was re-elected for a fourth time, in 1985, at age 77, when Bolivians turned to him at a time of economic and political turmoil made notable by an annual inflation rate of more than 25,000 percent. Mr. Paz Estenssoro then reversed some of the changes of his first presidency, privatizing the mines, cutting government deficits, overhauling tax collection, lifting price supports for food and floating the currency at a single unified rate. The inflation rate plummeted. 
He also drew closer to the United States in efforts to halt a growing cocaine industry, but he favored crop substitution and rural development over military efforts 
When tin prices collapsed, miners marched on La Paz in 1986, and Mr. Paz Estenssoro responded with authoritarian measures. He declared a state of siege, arrested union leaders and ordered the army to block the march. He was able to complete his term in 1989, the first elected leader to do so in a quarter-century.
Mr. Paz Estenssoro was married twice and had five children.

HEADLINE: Europe Union's Dreams Meet Electoral Reality 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 8 

 BODY:
The European Union's lofty project to embrace the formerly Communist nations of Central Europe, a project that would double the size of "Europe" as people now think of it, collided with a serious new obstacle put up today by Irish voters.
 In a shock to leaders across Europe, Irish voters resoundingly rejected a treaty that would redistribute power within the European Union and is intended to prevent paralysis if its membership climbs from 15 to as many as 27 countries. 
 Though Ireland has an economy that is smaller than many American cities, today's unexpected "no" vote threatened to tangle the European Union's entire effort to get its house in order in time for the new arrivals.
"We are very disappointed," said Goran Persson, Sweden's prime minister and the leader who currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. 
In rushed consultations by telephone this evening with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, Mr. Persson suggested that Irish leaders would organize a second vote on the rejected measure, the Treaty of Nice.
But Mr. Persson, who issued a joint statement with the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, quickly found himself struggling between the need to respect a democratic vote and the need to preserve an agreement that was only reached after months of closed-door power struggles.
While noting that "we fully respect the outcome of this democratic process," Mr. Persson and Mr. Prodi quickly added that they wanted to win approval for the treaty "without changing the substance" of it in the process. 
The democracy predicament is not new. When a top official at the European Commission casually suggested last year that German leaders might want to consult voters on the subject of enlargement, German government leaders were horrified at the thought of losing control over the process and vehemently denounced the idea.
The stakes are high, because leaders on both sides of the old East-West divide are convinced that the enlargement talks are beyond the point of no return. European leaders first dangled the prospect of membership nearly 11 years ago, when the old Communist governments were falling. Mainly because of those promises, countries like Poland, Hungary and even Slovakia have put themselves through wrenching reforms and are now in concrete negotiations for membership. In all, 12 countries have been accepted as potential candidates for membership, and the most advanced countries like Poland and Hungary are hoping to become members by 2005.
The Irish vote will probably not derail the process, but it could make it much more difficult. The Treaty of Nice must be ratified by all 15 nations in the European Union, but Ireland is the only country that has decided to ratify the treaty by means of a popular referendum.
Today's vote leaves European leaders with no easy options. The first would be to make changes in the treaty in a way that satisfies Irish voters, but does not unravel the delicate bargains that were worked out last year.
The other option is to have the second vote in Ireland, this time paving the way with a concerted promotional campaign. All three of Ireland's major parties support the treaty, and Ireland has generally been one of the most enthusiastic members of the European Union.
At its heart, the Treaty of Nice deals with the excruciatingly sensitive issue of power-sharing and sovereignty. To make decision-making less unwieldy with a much bigger membership, it would introduce qualified majority voting in which bigger countries would have more votes than smaller ones. It would also reform the distribution of top executive posts in the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, and smaller countries would no longer have an automatic right to name the director of at least one department. 
European and Central European leaders quickly asserted that today's vote will not slow down the enlargement negotiations now under way. "If the majority would be against the Nice Treaty, it would not affect the enlargement process," said Gunther Verheugen, the European Commission's top official in charge of negotiations with candidate countries, as he awaited final results in the Irish elections. "We would continue with the same speed and the same quality," Mr. Verheugen said during a visit in Slovenia.
To be sure, the expansion process had already become more bogged down and tense in recent months. Germany and Austria, frightened about being flooded with immigrants, recently persuaded other member countries to insist on a "transition period" of up to seven years before Central European workers would receive an automatic right to live and work anywhere in the European Union. Polish leaders insist that is unacceptable, but they have dragged their feet on a number of reform measures and have sought their own transition period before Western Europeans can buy Polish land.
Malgorzata Alterman, a spokeswoman for Poland's mission to the European Commission in Brussels, said the Irish vote was a surprise but not a catastrophe. "It is a serious matter, a matter of concern," she said. "But the European Union has managed problems in the past and we are confident that this one can be solved."

HEADLINE: 10,000 Plead To Be Exempt From Blackouts 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8 

 BODY:
The jockeying has begun among California businesses desperate to avoid blackouts this summer.
 More than 10,000 requests for exemptions have poured into the state's Public Utilities Commission in recent days, as businesses -- from oil refiners to farmers to drug makers -- lobby for relief from the hundreds of hours of darkness that experts predict California will experience if the state's energy crisis worsens. 
 The commission has hired a consulting firm to help evaluate the applications. But few executives are likely to be satisfied with the results. 
"In a way, the whole process is scary, because what this is ultimately about is telling people no," said Carl Wood, the utilities commissioner in charge of the process. "I argued with a lot of people whether we should go down this road. It is going to be messy."
Already, about 40 percent of consumers and businesses are exempt from blackouts, because they are hooked up to the same portions of the electric grid that serve operations deemed essential to health and safety, like hospitals and fire stations.
That leaves regulators little room to maneuver. The demands of grid management mean the state needs to be free to cut the power of at least 50 percent of all users.
How to choose? One criterion the commission has rejected is economic impact. "Everyone has a case for that," Mr. Wood said. The commission will also not consider claims that blackouts would inconvenience companies or their customers.
Some businesses have turned elsewhere for relief. The California Senate passed a bill Thursday that would let Universal Studios and its theme park switch power providers, from the beleaguered Southern California Edison to the more reliable Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
Several months ago, the Public Utilities Commission said oil refineries would not be exempt from rotating blackouts, despite a recommendation otherwise from the state energy commission. Refiners have also asked the Legislature to intervene.
Last week, David J. O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive of the Chevron Corporation, sent a letter to Gov. Gray Davis warning him of the economic damage that would befall the state if oil refineries were not exempted. Gasoline prices, already as high as $2 a gallon here, could go higher, Chevron executives have said, and fuel for airplanes and machinery could be in short supply. 
On Thursday, Governor Davis sent a letter of his own to the utilities commission, requesting that the refiners get their waiver.
Everyone seems to be asking for favorable treatment these days. Pharmaceutical companies have complained that sudden power outages can play havoc with sensitive technical equipment that takes days to reset, slowing medical tests and trials on important drugs. Farmers in the Central Valley have said their crops will wither and animals die without the electricity to pump water. And that, they said, will raise prices at the grocery store.
"It reflects the reality that a reliable electric supply is an essential underpinning of modern society," Mr. Wood said of the exemption requests. 
It was the state's biggest industrial users of electricity -- including oil refiners and farmers -- who pushed hardest for deregulation in the mid-1990's, hungry for the lower prices they thought would result.
"The bottom line is deregulation did not work out the way people thought," said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. "The issue used to be about high prices. Now it's about reliability."
The Public Utilities Commission has begun releasing the names of those seeking relief -- from dentists to catering companies, pet hospitals to beauty salons, and churches, as well. The consulting firm will review the applications, and it may be early August, when summer is half over, before any exemptions are granted.
Mr. Wood said the requests being submitted "are all going to have good stories."
"All we are talking about is degrees," he said.

HEADLINE: Software Failure Halts Big Board Trading for Over an Hour 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
A failed software upgrade left investors unable to trade shares on the New York Stock Exchange for nearly an hour and a half yesterday morning.
 The shutdown, the second the exchange has suffered in three years, prevented many stocks from opening for trading. As a result, the exchange shut its trading floor at 10:10 a.m. Trading resumed in most stocks by 11:35 a.m., but shares in the most severely affected companies, including I.B.M. and Verizon Communications, did not open until the afternoon. 
 The Nasdaq, the other major United States market, remained open during the New York exchange's trading halt. But the shutdown made calculating market indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index impossible. 
When trading resumed, stocks on the exchange dropped broadly. The Dow Jones average, which mostly comprises exchange-traded companies, lost 100 points, or almost 1 percent of its value, in less than an hour. But the Nasdaq composite index was also down yesterday, and traders said the Big Board's sell-off was unrelated to the trading halt.
Traders scrambled to make up for the halt during the afternoon, but only about 726 million shares changed hands on the Big Board for the day, down from 1 billion one week ago. It was the slowest day on the exchange since Dec. 23.
The failed upgrade was part of the system that electronically directs orders from securities firms to the exchange. While the Big Board still has a trading floor and human specialists who match buyers and sellers, many smaller orders are forwarded to the exchange and matched automatically by computer.
"It was the equivalent of a drawbridge remaining up," said Richard Grasso, chairman of the Big Board, at a news conference yesterday to discuss the problem. Mr. Grasso said the exchange did not yet know why the upgrade had failed. "We've got to do a very comprehensive diagnostic," he said.
But Mr. Grasso said the problem was the fault of the exchange, not the hardware or software companies that sell equipment to the Big Board. "The responsibility for what happened today is right here," he said. "It happens to be my turn in the barrel."
The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would review the problems at the exchange after the Big Board analyzed the reasons for the failure.
The shutdown is embarrassing for the Big Board, which has a reputation for reliability and is the world's largest and most important stock market. The exchange has 2,600 companies with a total market value of $16 trillion. That figure is four times the market value of either the Nasdaq or the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its closest competitors.
Mr. Grasso said the exchange could have continued some trading using backup systems but had shut completely to be fair to individual investors. Larger investors like mutual funds sometimes go outside the exchange into regional markets like the Cincinnati Stock Exchange to route their trades of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By shutting down completely, the exchange caused the regional markets to halt their trading as well.
The Big Board's halt also crimped fast-growing electronic trading networks like Island ECN and Instinet. Those networks, which directly match buyers and sellers for both New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stocks, remained open during the exchange's shutdown. But because most investors are used to trading Big Board stocks through the exchange, relatively few trades were made through the electronic networks before trading reopened, even in big companies like Verizon and I.B.M.
"We do more business, not more market share but more business, when the New York Stock Exchange stays open," said Doug Atkin, the chief executive of Instinet, the largest electronic trading network.
Once they learned what was happening, traders took the shutdown in stride, said Andrew Goldman, a spokesman for Island.
"There was initial confusion that folks weren't clear who was up and who was down," Mr. Goldman said. "Folks were trying to sort their way through what was going on in a very reasonable way."
Fridays during the summer are typically low-volume trading days in New York in any case, because many big investors and traders leave early to travel to summer homes.
Also, no major economic reports were released yesterday.
"Fortunately, it was a Friday," said Ayako Tsuboya, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. Volume is "really, really light."
David Colker, the chief executive of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, said the New York exchange was known for its expertise in information technology. But problems like yesterday's are always possible because the software that runs stock exchanges is incredibly complex, Mr. Colker said.
"You test this stuff for months, and there's always the risk when you put it in that you've missed something," he said.

HEADLINE: Former I.R.S. Chiefs Back Tax Haven Crackdown 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Seven former commissioners of the Internal Revenue Service urged Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill yesterday to withdraw his opposition to a proposed crackdown on Caribbean nations and others that are considered tax havens.
 A letter to Mr. O'Neill from the former commissioners preceded a meeting on the subject on Monday in Paris by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose 30 members are developed nations including the United States. 
 The organization, which has helped draft international polices on trade and governance, has already persuaded nine countries that it calls tax havens to cooperate with criminal tax investigations and to ease some of their bank-secrecy laws. But many of the countries it regards as offenders, including Panama and Turks and Caicos, have stiffened their opposition since Mr. O'Neill issued a statement on May 10 saying the Bush administration would not support an overly broad effort to impose sanctions on tax havens. 
Supporters of the initiative said that tax havens assisted tax cheats and thereby forced honest people and businesses to pay higher taxes. They also argue that tax havens distort trade, giving multinational corporations an advantage over domestic, and usually smaller, competitors.
But opponents, including many of the 35 nations that the international organization has listed as havens, say they have a right to sovereignty over tax policy and call the proposed crackdown an attempt to create a global tax cartel to maintain high tax rates in Europe, Japan, the United States and other industrial nations. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington, has also raised the specter of tax disclosures being used by governments to punish some of their own citizens.
In his statement in May, Mr. O'Neill said he was "troubled that low tax rates are somehow suspect" and he expressed concern about "potentially unfair treatment" of some countries. The Bush administration favors tax competition between nations, he said, and "it will not participate in any initiative to harmonize world tax systems."
While acknowledging that the administration "cannot turn a blind eye toward cheating in any form," he made clear that his preference was to pursue suspected tax criminals individually, then through bilateral treaties and only then through multinational organizations.
The bipartisan group of tax commissioners suggested that Mr. O'Neill was misinformed about the purpose of the campaign. The commissioners wrote that contrary to Mr. O'Neill's statement, the project explicitly rejects harmonizing tax codes and said that the countries had such diverse systems that any effort to unify tax rates would not work.
They then warned that "with increasing globalization and the use of the Internet, U.S. taxpayers seeking to evade U.S. taxes will have an increasing ability to transfer assets to tax havens further afield."
"These tax havens," the letter said, "are even less likely to bend to U.S. unilateral pressure. Conversely, they may well cooperate where 30 O.E.C.D. countries, some of which have close historical ties in addition to geographical proximity, act in concert." 
Urging a quick change in the Bush administration's stance, they stated that "we have never been closer to cracking down on tax abuse through the use of tax havens and that is especially important to the United States." 
The Democratic commissioners are Sheldon S. Cohen, Mortimer M. Caplin, Jerome Kurtz and Margaret M. Richardson, and the Republicans are Donald C. Alexander, Randolph W. Thrower and Johnnie M. Walters. The seven served in the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton administrations. 
Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mr. O'Neill, said yesterday that the administration is "working to concentrate the project so that its work product improves our ability to enforce the U.S. tax laws." She said that Mr. O'Neill had been "very clear that he favored a more effective project" focused on limited disclosures in cases of suspected tax cheating without interfering with the tax practices of sovereign nations. The secretary, she added, is sending two officials to the meeting in Paris to "better focus the project."

HEADLINE: A Hasidic Village Gets a Lesson In Bare-Knuckled Politicking 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: KIRYAS JOEL, N.Y., June 7 

 BODY:
When this Hasidic village was incorporated by the ultra-orthodox Satmars in 1977, its founding fathers hoped they would be able to replicate the intensely religious and insular enclave they had fashioned for themselves in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. And to a large degree, they have succeeded, as manifested by the dozens of shuls and the predominance of Yiddish spoken on the streets.
 But at least one ingredient of mainstream America has seeped into Kiryas Joel: suburban politics. 
 On Wednesday, this village of 13,000 in Orange County staged its first-ever contested elections for local office, as a small group of mavericks challenged the founding fathers. But far from the landslide some had predicted early in the campaign, the election turned out to be a very competitive affair that induced more than 90 percent of eligible voters to cast ballots. It followed a bare-knuckles campaign filled with inflammatory rhetoric, legal scuffles over voter eligibility and accusations of voter fraud and intimidation. 
In the end, the establishment slate, led by the mayor, Abraham Wieder, prevailed with roughly 57 percent of the vote. But the fact that there even was a contest suggests that the dissident faction, led by Mendel Schwimmer, promises to be a future electoral force. And both sides' emphasis on typical suburban issues like housing, public services, good government and the economy -- not religion, not Williamsburg -- underscores the extent to which this fast-changing, fast-growing community has evolved politically.
"Whether they like or not, and much as they may claim to the contrary, the larger society's influence has reached into the Satmar community as it does with everyone else," said William Helmreich, professor of sociology and Judaic studies at the City University of New York. 
"The kind of suburban politics that occurs everywhere else occurs in their community, too," Professor Helmreich said.
For years, local elections in this village 45 miles north of New York City were regarded as mere formalities, since no one dared to oppose the leadership's hand-picked slate, Professor Helmreich said. And though there was a small but vocal group of self-described dissidents here who opposed the village's religious and political leadership, they complained constantly of being intimidated. To speak out, they claimed, would be to risk their jobs, their connections, everything, said Joseph Waldman, the village's most outspoken dissident.
But this year, the dissidents, led by Mr. Schwimmer, a village trustee since 1990, decided to break with tradition and challenge Mr. Wieder, who was been near the nexus of power here since 1984. One reason, Mr. Waldman said, was fatigue from the village's protracted legal battle over the separate public school district it operates for its disabled children. But a far more important one, he said, was anger over the way Mr. Wieder had handled a new, $10 million public housing project.
Affordable housing is a crucial issue in Kiryas Joel, where 63 percent of the residents live below the poverty line, where the population grew by 76 percent in the 1990's, and where nearly half the families live in households with seven or more people, said Samuel C. Heilman, Harold Proshansky Professor of Jewish Studies and Sociology at CUNY.
"They are interested in their local issues, and that's very different from what's happening in Williamsburg," Professor Heilman said. 
And in this instance, the village had selected families for the 48-unit Atzei Timurim housing project through a lottery system conducted by an independent consulting firm. Of the 48 families selected, Mr. Waldman said, about half were generally considered dissidents. But to date, the units have been empty for more for than a year, and critics have accused Mr. Wieder's administration of preventing the families from moving in.
During a campaign that blanketed the 1.1-square-mile village with Yiddish posters, Mr. Wieder, together with two running mates, ran under the banner of "Experience and Results," while Mr. Schwimmer's team ran under the name "People Together in Kiryas Joel."
Those who supported Mr. Schwimmer said that they wanted a reformer who would push for more affordable housing and more open government, and who would end what they said were hardball tactics and discriminatory practices.
One group of synagogue students, for instance, were huddled near a Winnebago covered by the banner "Voter's Investigation Team;" it was the place for people to report voting irregularities.
"We won it, and they stole it," said Mr. Waldman, who still had the rat-a-tat rhetoric of the campaign on his lips. "They are dividers, and we are the uniters."
Most supporters of Mr. Wieder cited his accomplishments, like a new health center and a sewage treatment plant, and his good relationship with Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, the village's religious leader.
"I think his experience was very great," said David Greenfeld, a school manager at the United Talmudical Academy. "He's finished what he promised."
As Mr. Greenfeld spoke with two visitors at the Kiryas Joel shopping center, he was surrounded by more than a dozen young men.Unprompted, the young men brought out campaign brochures with photos of Mr. Wieder with Bill Clinton, Gov. George E. Pataki, Senator Trent Lott and others. Then they began to conduct their own instant day-after exit poll.
"Abe Wieder?" they would ask passers-by.
"Of course," people would reply.
"You see?" one young student said, turning to a visitor. "Abe Wieder!" Then, in a jab at the opposition, he said: "All the big synagogues, all the big businesses is us. They have nothing."

HEADLINE: Demand Is Rising for Members of the Clergy as Fewer Answer the Calling 

BYLINE:  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Faith Presbyterian Church, a 420-member congregation in a suburban neighborhood of Indianapolis, spent 16 months unsuccessfully seeking a new associate pastor. The pastor, the Rev. Glen Bell, made several calls himself, including one to a promising senior at a seminary 300 miles away.
 "He told me I was the 12th church that had contacted him," said Mr. Bell, who added that seminaries often listed such students on their Web sites. 
 The church gave up this spring and split the job into four part-time positions, to be filled by a retired minister, a pastoral counselor and two lay people. 
For a number of other congregations in the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), searching for a minister has become a daunting prospect. In May, 1,450 congregations were advertising vacancies, for which only 1,277 members of the clergy were available, said Marcia Myers, associate director of churchwide personnel services for the denomination. In January 1994, by contrast, 944 Presbyterian congregations seeking pastors or associate pastors could choose from 1,697 candidates, Ms. Myers said. 
Until recently, most mainline Protestant denominations as well as Jewish Reform and Conservative organizations seemed to be doing fine in attracting new clergy, in contrast to the Roman Catholic Church, which has faced a deepening shortage of priests for many years, as seminary enrollments have plunged and priests have resigned, often to marry. Protestants and Jews had little trouble filling all but the most remote pulpits, and some groups even had more members of the clergy than jobs, as their memberships stagnated. 
But a number of churches and synagogues are finding that filling vacancies takes much longer than it once did, and the pool of candidates has shrunk. Some never find the leaders they seek.
For Protestant denominations, religion officials say, the problem's roots include the attraction of more lucrative careers in what long was a booming economy, a wide variety of choices in religious life for seminary graduates and escalating retirements from a demanding job in which the pay is often modest and the hours are long. 
In addition, the average age of seminarians has risen, so there are fewer single people mobile enough and unencumbered by educational debt to take over smaller, financially strained congregations.
The denominations affected have not grown as many evangelical churches have, and many of those evangelical churches have lately undertaken efforts to train lay people to serve as pastors, rather than relying on traditional seminary graduates.
A part of the problem among mainline Protestants is that diminishing membership within the larger denominations has meant that a growing number of smaller churches, in rural and inner-city areas, wind up with little money to pay a pastor.
One of the closest statistical analyses of the problem within one denomination was published last year by the 5.1 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The church, the nation's largest Lutheran body, found that the proportion of small congregations without permanent pastors (those with 175 or fewer baptized members) rose to 39 percent from 27 percent between 1990 and 1999.
During the same period, the overall number of pastors within the church declined.
The Rev. A. Craig Settlage, an official with the church's Division of Ministry, said some rural synods, or jurisdictions, were critically short of newly minted seminary graduates -- or "first-call" pastors -- to serve small congregations. But some metropolitan areas may have a surplus of clergy.
Presbyterian officials say the shortage strikes hardest among churches seeking associate pastors and ministers for young people.
Paradoxically, Ms. Myers said, the denomination did not have a shortage of people who had been ordained as ministers.
"It's a shortage of people who are willing to be pastors in particular kinds of situations," she said.
In California, demand for Presbyterian ministers has begun to outstrip supply, said the Rev. David Tomlinson, a vice president at San Francisco Theological Seminary. In May, the seminary conferred master of divinity degrees on 29 students, 19 of whom will be ordained as ministers.
"Probably every one of those 19 could get three offers today" from churches seeking a pastor or associate pastor, Mr. Tomlinson said.
Five years ago, he said, a graduate might wait months for an offer.
Nationally, the number of students in masters of divinity programs has remained steady, according to the Association of Theological Schools. But some denominational officials say they believe fewer people with those degrees are going into parish ministry.
Teresa Blythe, a 2000 graduate from San Francisco Theological Seminary, calls herself a lay minister who works as a spiritual director with individuals and groups.
"A lot of my friends in my graduating class were choosing not to go into pastor jobs," Ms. Blythe said. "People like myself are taking it outside the church."
That such a course is possible reflects public fascination with spiritual matters, rather than institutional religion, in which lay-led Bible study groups, various spiritually focused seminars and retreats, and an immense number of religiously themed books for the solitary "seeker" are available.
Officials of the two largest branches of Judaism, the Conservative and Reform movements, say they lack enough rabbis to go around. They believe that the strong economy of the 1990's lured young people into other professions. 
The problem also affects Orthodox Jews, at least those synagogues in Orthodox's modern wing, said Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America. The problem has been most felt in smaller communities, Rabbi Dworken said.
"In mainstream Orthodoxy," he said, "we have taught our children and imparted the message all too well that you can be a Jew at home and in the marketplace."
"They went to Wall Street, they went to law school, they went to advertising," he said.
But the other causes the Reform and Conservative officials cite vary somewhat from those among Protestants. Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, said that among Conservative congregations, the problem was due to more demand for rabbis, "because more and more of our congregations are feeling the need for a second or third rabbi" to serve different groups within the congregations.
As a result, Rabbi Epstein said, 50 to 75 synagogues are without a rabbi or an assistant rabbi this year.
One of those is Aventura-Turnberry Jewish Center, a 1,400-family synagogue up the Florida coast from North Miami Beach. After enrollment in its day school shot up, the synagogue last year sought an assistant rabbi to work with younger families.
"Lo and behold, we found there's not a lot of people out there," Rabbi Barry Konovitch said. "We're not doing the interviewing -- the people who are available, they're interviewing us."
With the Reform movement, leaders of the rabbinical and synagogue organizations became so concerned that they established a task force to examine the issue.
"If you travel around the country," said Robert Heller, an antitrust lawyer who is its chairman, "you hear the same stories over and over: 'We need a new cantor, we need a new rabbi.' "
Among Protestants, some experts say that talk of a clergy shortage should be kept in perspective, particularly compared with the shortage of Catholic priests.
Barbara Wheeler, president of Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, said the bigger cause for concern, among Protestants, was why seminaries had increasingly attracted older, second-career students.
A recent study by Auburn found that the mean age of seminarians was 35, a decade older than men and women entering law school and medical school. Older students can bring professional experience, but they have fewer years to devote to church service. They may also be married and less able to move outside an urban area where a working spouse can find a job.
But amid the trend, the 8.2 million-member United Methodist Church has found a long-existing tool that has helped it get around its clergy shortage.
The number of seminarians annually ordained as Methodist ministers declined throughout the 1990's, said the Rev. Robert Kohler, an official with the denomination's Board of Higher Education and Ministry. But during the same period, Mr. Kohler said, the denomination increased the number of people serving as "local pastors," people who complete special, nonseminary study and are assigned to serve a congregation. In Alabama and West Virginia, local pastors now outnumber ordained clergy.
"If we didn't have that," Mr. Kohler said, "we'd be in crisis."

AMERICAN AIRLINES ANDFLIGHT ATTENDANTS STILL AT ODDS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 American Airlines, a division of the AMR Corporation, and its flight attendants have failed to reach a labor accord after four days of talks, and federal mediators will consider asking President Bush to intervene to block a strike days before the busy Fourth of July holiday, the carrier said yesterday. The National Mediation Board convened talks in hopes of negotiating a contract before attendants are allowed to walk off their jobs at the carrier on July 1, the height of the summer travel season. 
The board recessed talks until June 20, and said it was awaiting an economic impact study from the Transportation Department. Such a study is required before the board would ask Mr. Bush to intervene and delay a strike up to 60 more days.

HEADLINE: U.S. FIGURES SHOW PRISON POPULATION IS NOW STABILIZING 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 8 

 BODY:
After growing explosively for three decades, the nation's prison population has begun to stabilize, according to new government figures.
 For the first time in years, the overcrowding that has plagued state prisons and local jails alike is beginning to ease, as a result of falling crime rates and a decade of new construction. 
 Through the middle of last year, the number of state prisoners grew by only 1.5 percent, the lowest annual increase in 29 years, according to figures recently compiled by the United States Department of Justice. In the three most populous states, the number of prisoners in California and New York actually fell last year, and the number in Texas grew by only half of 1 percent.
Nine other states -- including New Jersey -- also reported a decline, the largest number of states to do so in two decades. Connecticut's prison population grew 1.4 percent. 
Government officials and other experts in the field say there are several reasons for the slowing growth, but the most important is that the prison system is finally experiencing the benefits of the decline in crime rates that began in the mid-1990's.
Before the crime rates fell, many states had begun toughening their criminal justice systems, imposing longer minimum sentences for a wider spectrum of crimes and ending parole. The average sentence increased by 13 percent during the 90's, and with more prisoners staying behind bars longer, it took several years for the drop in crime to be reflected in the prison population numbers.
"The reason we saw those increasing numbers every year was because of the sentencing reforms undertaken by so many states," said Allen J. Beck, the chief of corrections statistics for the Justice Department, who compiled the new figures. "In the 90's, there was a much greater chance that violent offenders would be incarcerated, and would stay longer. But those reforms had their effect, and now we're finally starting to see the prison population stabilize."
The drop in crime was not directly related to the increased sentencing; a variety of studies have shown no relationship between the length of sentencing in a state and its crime rate. Rather, criminologists say, many of the tough sentences imposed earlier in the decade began to run their course at the same time as the crime rate continued to decline.
During that same period, many states with corrections systems that became overwhelmed by the new prisoners also began experimenting with alternative sentencing -- special drug courts and diversionary programs for drug users that are starting to have an effect on reducing inmate populations. By more closely supervising convicts on parole, states have kept many of them from returning.
"Forty percent of the people walking through our prison doors were parole violators, mostly who had relapsed into drug use," said Martin F. Horn, who was the secretary of corrections in Pennsylvania for six years until earlier this year.
"So we started a system that put them in an intensive treatment program inside prison for six months, then put them back on the street under close supervision, Mr. Horn said. "Now our prison population has been flat for three years, which we hadn't seen since before 1980."
In addition to California, New York and New Jersey, the other states that reported declines in prisoners were Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
State prisoners represent about 60 percent of all people incarcerated in the United States. The growth in the number of jail inmates -- usually people held for a year or less, representing 32 percent of those incarcerated -- has also been flat in the last two years, which is considered a more direct reflection of the drop in crime.
"Jails are the most immediate beneficiary of the crime decline, because their sentences are shorter," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who studies crime statistics. "Typically, at least half the people in jail are awaiting trial, and as the crime rates declined, trials can occur faster."
But the trend has not held true in the federal prison system, which grew by 11 percent last year, mostly due to mandatory drug sentencing and the federal takeover of prisoners from the District of Columbia. Federal prisons remain considerably more crowded, on average, than state prisons or local jails.
One reason for that is the boom in prison and local jail construction during the 1980's and 90's, which doubled the number of state prisons, though it was not matched at the federal level. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of state prisoners nationwide grew by 75 percent, to 1,242,962 from 708,393, corresponding to the rise in drug arrests, more vigilant policing and harsher sentences.
But prison construction in most states has kept pace and often exceeded the increase in prisoners, even though most prisons remain overcrowded. Justice Department figures show that the state prisons were operating at 115 percent of capacity in 1990, and at 109 percent of capacity in 1999, the latest year for which statistics are available.
Similarly, the number of local jail beds almost doubled during the 1990's, to 677,000. In 1990, jails were operating at 104 percent of capacity, but last year, that number dropped to 92 percent. Mr. Beck said that in the year ending last June, more jail beds were added than jail inmates.
Many states continue to make headlines because of overcrowded prisons and jails, mostly in cases where the state has not built new prisons as fast as elsewhere. New Jersey has the most crowded prison system, according to the Justice Department, at 143 percent of its capacity, and Illinois and Wisconsin are only a few percentage points behind. Other states, including Alabama, have allowed local jails to hold their excess prisoners, resulting in lawsuits over jail conditions and court orders to expand state capacity.
But nationally the crowding is diminishing, and experts predict it will become a much less serious problem in the coming decade as the number of prisoners stabilizes and prisons now under construction open. Several states added so many beds that they have an excess of prison capacity, and Texas and Virginia have made a lucrative business out of leasing their spare prison beds to more crowded states.
Ten percent of the inmates in Virginia's prisons are from out of state, and the state expects to receive more than $80 million this year for housing them. Several prisoners from Connecticut and New Mexico who were housed at Virginia's newest "supermax" prisons have filed lawsuits complaining about abusive conditions and racial discrimination at the new buildings, which restrict the movement of prisoners more sharply than in most prisons.
Marc Mauer, deputy director of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group that supports prisoners' rights, said he expected that questions regarding treatment of prisoners at new institutions would eventually overtake crowding as the principal concern of advocates.
"Crowding only tells you whether there are enough beds for all the inmates," Mr. Mauer said. "It doesn't tell you how many vocational or treatment programs there are, or what life is like inside the prisons 24 hours a day."
If the prison population continues to stabilize or diminish, it could have a substantial economic benefit to states and localities. State prisoners now cost an average of $23,000 a year to house, so the 65,810 prisoners added between 1998 and 1999 increased the nation's prison expenditures by about $1.5 billion. By contrast, the following year, only 18,558 prisoners were added, a difference of more than $1 billion. 
But prison-building remains popular with many politicians and voters, and new prisons often provide a boost to rural economies. Few people in the field expect building to stop.
"We're a long way from the point where crime is not a major political issue," said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University. "The political agenda is still heavily weighted towards punishment, and many states are much more willing to spend money on prison construction than on new schools."

HEADLINE: School Board In New Dispute On Test Scores 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The testing director for the New York City Board of Education accused a major testing company yesterday of miscalculating yet another set of scores, this time on a sixth-grade reading test in April 2000.
 Board officials said that because of the alleged error, about 60,000 students were given higher scores than they deserved on the test of 50 multiple-choice questions. But the testing company, CTB/McGraw-Hill, insisted that it had scored the exams correctly and that the sixth graders had simply performed extraordinarily well. 
 Although students in grades three through seven take standardized reading tests, only the sixth-grade scores from 2000 are in dispute. Officials on both sides expressed confidence last night that scores on the 2001 reading test, which will be made public next week, are accurate. But they said it will be impossible to compare this year's sixth-grade scores with last year's. 
The episode stirred echoes of the mistaken scoring of 300,000 reading tests in 1999, which compelled nearly 9,000 students to attend summer school unnecessarily. That incident also undermined the reputation of the schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, who later lost his job.
But while CTB/McGraw-Hill ultimately admitted botching the 1999 scores, the company's president adamantly denied any error on the 2000 exams yesterday. And while Robert Tobias, the board's longtime testing director, said he felt certain that the company had miscalculated, he added that he had not been able to prove it so far.
"It seems to me that the test was judged to be of greater difficulty than it actually was, and that led to the inflation of scores," Mr. Tobias said in an interview last night. "I see lots of evidence that there is something wrong. But I have not found a definitive smoking gun."
Mr. Tobias said that the sixth-grade scores appear to have been miscalculated because half of the questions on the test were assigned a greater level of difficulty than they deserved. As a result, he said, the citywide results were mistakenly inflated. Sixth graders had the city's most impressive gains in reading last year, with the average score improving by 12.4 points, according to the disputed scores.
Part of the problem, Mr. Tobias said, was that only 21 questions on last year's exam had been tested on a national sample of sixth graders to determine their level of difficulty. The other 29 questions were new and had not been tested, he said.
It is standard practice to include questions that have not been tested on a national sample of students, he said, but those questions are usually kept to a minimum and the scorers assign them a level of difficulty based on questions that have been tested on a national sample.
But in this case, Mr. Tobias said, students who answered the new questions correctly apparently got more points than they should have. As a result, the overall scores were high -- so high that Mr. Tobias said he was immediately suspicious.
"We brought it to the testing company's attention, and their research scientists said, 'Yes, it looks a little strange,' " he said. "They did a variety of analyses but assured us that everything was accurate."
David M. Taggart, the company president, said that his staff members had indeed pored over the test data and had found nothing wrong with the scoring process. One possible reason for the "remarkable" scores, he said, was that 12 of the 50 questions had also been used on the 1999 sixth-grade test, raising the possibility that students had seen them before.
"We're saying it looks anomalous," Mr. Taggart said of the performance on the 2000 test. "Does that mean those scores were wrong? No. It means those students had a good year last year in terms of their performance on the test."
Mr. Tobias said he felt certain that the scores of last year's sixth graders had been miscalculated after reviewing the same students' scores on the reading test they took this year, as seventh graders. There was "absolutely no gain" in the students' scale scores, which was highly unusual, he said. As for Mr. Taggart's theory that the students had for some reason performed exceptionally well as sixth graders, Mr. Tobias said, "I totally reject that."
Mr. Tobias had been debating the scores' accuracy with CTB/McGraw-Hill for weeks, but the conflict did not come to a boil until yesterday, after reports in The Daily News and The New York Post. Mr. Taggart and Robert Evanson, president of McGraw-Hill Education, the testing company's parent, met with Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy and his aides at the Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn. After hours of tense discussion, Mr. Levy and Mr. Taggart released a carefully worded joint statement acknowledging that the sixth-grade scores in 2000 were "overstated." The statement also said that the scores had immediately raised a red flag, but they said that they did not want to draw conclusions before seeing the 2001 scores.
"While there was some evidence of anomalies in the results last year, we agreed at the time that they were not conclusive," the statement read. "Now, we have determined that the anomaly was real. This means that aggregate performance data reported for sixth-grade reading last year were higher than warranted."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Levy said he was "very disappointed that this happened" but was careful not to attack the testing company.
"There was a judgment exercised that in hindsight I think was wrong," Mr. Levy said of the decision by the testing company and the board to release the sixth-grade scores last spring even though they had concerns about them.
Although Mr. Levy would not say whether he thought the company had erred, he said Bob Tobias is "really the dean of this field, and I rely heavily on his office's judgment."
Mr. Levy also said that the alleged inflation of scores did not significantly affect the number of sixth graders sent to summer school last year, even though that decision was based largely on test scores.

 The government will not extend Russia's lease on its sole military base in Southeast Asia when it runs out in 2004, the Foreign Ministry announced. Instead, it plans to use the natural harbor and facilities of Cam Ranh Bay for civilian economic development. The base, built by the United States during the Vietnam War, served as a Soviet listening post in the 1980's and as a runway for Soviet nuclear bombers, intelligence officials have said.

HEADLINE: Rival Medicare Drug Plans Are Both Ruled Affordable 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office provided the first independent estimates today of the cost of new Medicare drug benefits, showing that the proposals of Senate Democrats and House Republicans are both affordable under the budget adopted by Congress earlier this year.
 Members of both parties welcomed the estimates and said they increased the likelihood of legislative action on the issue this year. 
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who took over this week as chairman of the Finance Committee, said the new figures showed that "we have the money in our budget to enact a truly comprehensive drug benefit -- one that will guarantee coverage to all beneficiaries."
The Senate Democrats' proposal would cost $318 billion over the next decade, the budget office said. That is just a bit more than the maximum of $300 billion allowed under the spending plan adopted by Congress in May. 
The budget office also said a Republican proposal for Medicare drug benefits passed by the House last year would cost $157 billion in the coming decade, about the same as the amount proposed by President Bush in February.
Senate Republicans tend to favor legislation that would offer drug benefits through a range of competing health plans. The budget office said this approach -- proposed by Senators John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee -- would cost $176 billion over 10 years.
The main factor determining the cost of each proposal is the generosity of benefits, budget analysts said. When Bill Clinton was president, he proposed drug benefits that would have cost $425 billion over 10 years.
Medicare beneficiaries are among the greatest users of prescription drugs, but they are much less likely than working families to have insurance to cover the costs. About one-third of the 40 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare have no insurance for drug expenses, even though drug companies are continually developing costly, effective new medicines to treat the elderly.
Senate Democrats rejoiced at the new cost estimates. They had feared that the budget office, the official scorekeeper for Congress, might put a much higher price on their proposal.
In an interview, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a principal author of the Democratic proposal, said he was "extremely pleased" with the cost estimate.
Mr. Graham said Democrats hoped to start moving their legislation through the Finance Committee in July. Michael Siegel, a spokesman for Mr. Baucus, said drug benefits were "definitely at the top of his priority list." Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, has said he will use his new power as majority leader to push for action.
House Republicans also expressed satisfaction, saying the new estimates supported their contention that the $300 billion in the budget was more than enough to provide drug benefits.
The budget office estimated the premiums that would be charged under the various proposals: about $53 a month under the Senate Democratic and House Republican plans in 2004, compared with $28 a month under the Clinton plan. 
Premiums would rise in subsequent years. In 2011, the budget office said, beneficiaries would pay a monthly premium of $65.50 under the Clinton plan, $114.70 under the Senate Democratic proposal and $92.50 under the House Republican bill.
Under all the proposals, the government would spend roughly $100 billion over 10 years to help low-income beneficiaries pay premiums and other costs.
Marilyn Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute, put the proposals in perspective. Under all the proposals, she said, drug benefits would be less generous than what workers typically receive, and the cost to participants would be higher.
Drug spending by or for Medicare beneficiaries will total $1.3 trillion in the next decade, and the government would pay only one-third of those costs under even the most generous proposals, the budget office said.
Experts at the Congressional Budget Office said that Medicare coverage of drug costs would increase demand for prescription drugs, leading to larger price increases than would otherwise occur. None of the major proposals call for explicit federal regulation of drug prices. But all envision a role for private companies in trying to manage drug spending under Medicare.
Such companies would try to negotiate price discounts with drug manufacturers and pharmacies and would steer beneficiaries toward lower-cost drugs.
Cost-control techniques in the House Republican bill would be much more effective than those in the Senate Democrats' plan, the budget office said.

HEADLINE: Talking With North Korea 

 BODY:
President Bush is right to resume discussions with North Korea on curbing its long-range missiles and addressing a number of other important security issues. The White House denies that its new position reflects any policy change. But it was just three months ago that Mr. Bush announced an indefinite pause in talks with the North on the grounds that Pyongyang could not be trusted to live up to any agreements. 
 After a careful internal review, the White House now seems to recognize that diplomacy is its best option for dealing with North Korea. The place to insist that tough verification requirements must be part of any missile agreement, for example, is at the negotiating table. If North Korea accepts Washington's offer, talks could resume in a few weeks. 
 The administration rightly declares America's goals to be verifiable limits on North Korea's development and export of long-range missiles, international inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities and shifting the North's conventional forces, now facing South Korea, into less threatening positions. To the extent that North Korea is willing to address these legitimate American concerns, Washington is prepared to respond with increased humanitarian aid and an easing of American economic sanctions against Pyongyang. 
The Bush administration's temporary suspension of negotiations with North Korea had frustrated South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, who was pursuing his own efforts at reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. The suspension also sparked uncertainty in the North about the direction of American policy, adding to the reasons that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has still not scheduled a visit to Seoul to reciprocate for Kim Dae Jung's historic trip to Pyongyang last June. One benefit of the administration's decision to resume negotiations should be closer coordination between the United States and its South Korean ally. 
Under the best of circumstances, North Korea has been a prickly and unpredictable negotiating partner. It may not be happy about Mr. Bush's public statement of America's negotiating goals. But if Pyongyang is sincere in its expressed desire for better relations with the United States, it should respond positively and constructively to Mr. Bush's offer of renewed talks.

British Pound Falls Further On Labor Party's Landslide

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 8 

 BODY:
The British pound slipped again to a 15-year low against the dollar today, after a landslide victory by the Labor Party amplified talk that Prime Minister Tony Blair may speed the replacement of the pound with the euro.
 When William Hague resigned today after leading his Conservative Party to disastrous defeat on an anti-euro platform, it reinforced the perception that the outcome of the election had lowered the political hurdles to joining the 12-nation euro currency union. 
 "Hague's departure certainly demonstrates that the 'no' campaign has taken a heavy blow," said Graham Bishop, an independent economic consultant.
The Labor Party victory on Thursday was not a surprise, and speculators had begun pushing the pound down sharply two days before the balloting. But Mr. Hague's resignation set their hammers falling in earnest, and the pound was driven down to $1.3773, lower than at any time since February 1986. It closed in New York at $1.3806. Over all, in this election week, the pound lost 2.6 percent of its value against the dollar, and 2.2 percent against the euro. 
"I think it's got a bit overexcited, this whole euro story," said Michael Lewis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank. Still, he said he believed the pound could sink lower. Some big banks have lowered forecasts for sterling over the next few months, and one, WestLB in Germany, foresees $1.34 to the pound this summer.
But economists said that there was little chance of a quick move to adopt the euro.
Before the election, Mr. Blair said he expected to decide within two years whether to take the most pivotal step, calling a referendum on adopting the euro. Gordon Brown, the finance minister, said on Thursday that the process could take even longer, with two years spent just to assess whether membership in the euro zone would meet the five economic tests Britain has set for entry.
Public debate would follow the assessment, and only after that would a referendum be scheduled. Mr. Bishop, the consultant, said that at the earliest, Mr. Blair might begin making a public case for adopting the euro in September.
Whatever the timing, analysts said, Mr. Blair leads a nation whose attitudes about the euro range from ambiguous to downright hostile. "The real obstacle lies not in the economic tests, but in whether the government can get the assent of the people in a referendum," said Ian Stewart, chief British economist at Merrill Lynch.
Mr. Hague sought to paint the election as a vote for or against British euro membership, saying repeatedly that the ballot was "the last chance to save the pound." His party's resounding defeat suggested that the rallying call did not resonate with voters.
On the other hand, opinion surveys since the euro was introduced in Continental Europe in January 1999, have consistently found that two-thirds of Britons oppose entry, though the same proportion said they thought it was inevitable.
Beyond politics, economic and technical issues underscore the differences between Britain's possible alliance with the euro and the Continent's marriage to it. The core euro-zone countries, especially France and Germany, had their economies and currencies marching in step for years before January 1999, while Britain has kept its own economic rhythms and fell out of the exchange-rate coordination system in 1992.
Qualification for joining the euro depended on straightforward statistical criteria, but Britain's self-readiness tests are much more woolly. "I have to say that the government's tests are so broadly drawn that a lot will depend on the eye of the beholder," said Mr. Stewart at Merrill Lynch. It is not clear whether Mr. Brown's treasury or the government as a whole would do the beholding.
The tests pose five questions:
*Are the British and Continental European economies capable of "sustainable convergence?"
*Can the euro cope flexibly with economic upheaval?
*How would British membership affect investment?
*What would the disappearance of the pound mean for the City, Britain's Wall Street?
*Would euro membership increase British employment?
Beyond those issues, Mr. Brown wants to be assured that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, whose policies and pronouncements on monetary policy have so far tended to confuse investors, can operate as openly and effectively as the Bank of England, whose autonomy in interest rate policy was enshrined when Mr. Blair first took office in 1997.
Some of the economic gaps between Britain and the rest of Europe are closing. Benchmark interest rates set in Frankfurt and London are now just 0.75 of a percentage point apart, down from four points in 1999. Long-term rates are close together as well, and Britain's inflation is the lowest in Western Europe.
But there remains the thorny matter of negotiating the exchange rate at which Britain would join. Many investors expect the pound to be devalued sharply before entry.
The European Union accounts for half of Britain's foreign trade, so the fates of the pound and euro are already linked. Bloomberg News calculated this week that the two moved up or down in step against the dollar 92 percent of the time this year.
But "the current market rate would lock Britain in forever at an uncompetitive rate," said Michael Klawitter, a strategist at WestLB. When the pound is high, British exports cost too much to sell well overseas, while domestic producers are undercut by cheap imports.
British exporters want a substantial devaluation. "Ten percent off is a good starting point," Mr. Bishop, the consultant, said. "But then the question is: How to manage the rate downwards without provoking a serious sterling crisis?" A rapid movement could ignite inflation, he said, provoking interest rate increases from the Bank of England and widening the rate gap with Europe, just when it should be narrowing.
Such considerations, though, may well pale beside the broader contours of Mr. Blair's second term. "The bottom line is that it's a political decision," said Mr. Stewart at Merrill Lynch. "The government didn't campaign on it, and they really have a mountain to climb."

Shares Drop on Juniper Networks' Outlook

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday as investors shed technology issues after Juniper Networks released a bleak second-quarter forecast, reigniting Wall Street's concerns about weak corporate profits.
 Trading was disrupted yesterday morning when computer software problems forced the New York Stock Exchange to shut down for nearly an hour and a half. But analysts said the disruption contributed little to the selling yesterday. 
 Semiconductor stocks, which rallied sharply on Thursday on investors' hopes that the chip industry was beginning to revive from its slump, lost ground yesterday.
Analysts said the conflicting news from technology companies puzzled investors, who, without any major economic data to consider, were seeking clues about the strength of the economy from the coming preannouncement season.
"There still remains quite a lot of indecision regarding what to do with these stocks," said Brian G. Belski, a market strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 48.90 points, or 2.16 percent, to close at 2,215.10. For the week, however, the Nasdaq was up 3.05 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 113.74 points, or 1.03 percent, to 10,977.00, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 12.00 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,2964.96. Both indexes were virtually unchanged for the week.
Shares of Juniper Networks, a network equipment company, tumbled $8.50, to $38.02, in late trading after it reduced its second-quarter sales forecast by one-third, to $200 million to $210 million, and said it would cut jobs by 8 to 9 percent. Other network equipment companies dropped as well: Cisco Systems $1.33, to $20.49, and Ciena $5.70, to $56.14.
Intel, the chip maker, fell 49 cents, to $30.67. The company said late Thursday after the stock market closed that its sales in the current quarter would be within the lower end of its previous forecast. Investors had initially taken Intel's new projections as a sign that the chip industry might be reviving, sending its stock up to $33 in after-hours trading.
Among other semiconductor stocks, Xilinx fell $2.96, to $46.41; National Semiconductor dropped $1.91, to $29.13; and Texas Instruments dropped $1.40, to $37.99. But Advanced Micro Devices gained 82 cents, to $31.10.
Trading was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange around 10:10 a.m. after new trading software malfunctioned, exchange officials said. The system came back online around 11:35 a.m. But some stocks were still not trading by midafternoon. 
Exchange officials said that the halt in trading was the first time the Big Board had failed since Oct. 26, 1998.
Even so, analysts said the breakdown had little influence on market activity.
In the bond market yesterday, Treasury prices drifted lower. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 12/32, to 97 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.36 percent from 5.31 percent on Thursday.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32, to 94 28/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.74 percent from 5.72 percent.

HEADLINE: Bush Trip Aimed at Winning Over Europeans 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ and FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
President Bush will carry few specific proposals when he embarks on his first major overseas trip on Monday, hoping instead that face-to-face encounters will win over Europeans skeptical of his policies and abilities.
 "The common European perception is of a shallow, arrogant, gun-loving, abortion-hating, Christian fundamentalist Texan buffoon," said a senior administration official. "They read all the press about a hard-line unilateralist. They really believe this stuff about cowboys. We need to get it all on a higher plane." 
 Though Mr. Bush and his aides say they are aware of Europe's disagreements with the administration on a range of issues -- including the death penalty and the environment -- they have been depicting these as problems that could be overcome by the president's charm and personality -- as happened, experts note, with President Ronald Reagan nearly two decades ago. 
Mr. Bush arrived tonight at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., where he will spend the weekend receiving briefings from his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. The briefings are intended to ensure that the president, who has seldom traveled abroad, will be ready to transform himself into a player on the world stage. 
During the five-country trip, which will include a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Bush will confront a Europe increasingly aware of -- and prepared to exercise its economic and diplomatic influence on -- matters including missile defense, climate change, the American peacekeeping role in the Balkans and the creation of a European military force to complement NATO. European leaders have made it clear that they are uncomfortable with the American positions on those issues, and with the unilateralism that seems to underlie them.
On a personal level, many European leaders and opinion makers view Mr. Bush as a political and intellectual lightweight who has flubbed basic tests on foreign affairs, and whose position on some social issues like capital punishment is out of sync with that of the rest of the world. The perceptions will only be strengthened by the impending execution of Timothy J. McVeigh -- the first federal execution in the United States in 38 years. It is scheduled for Monday, the day Mr. Bush is to leave for his first stop, Spain.
In an interview aboard Air Force One this week, Mr. Bush said he would seek to reassure the European allies that the United States was not abandoning them by shrinking into an isolationist shell. He also said he would try to allay their doubts about missile defense and impress upon them the correctness of his view. 
"There are some in Europe who worry about America becoming isolationists," Mr. Bush said. "And I'll ease their concerns. We're an internationalist government." 
He looks forward to "making the case," he said, that missile defense is necessary in the post-cold-war era because "we need to use our technologies to be able to develop ways to face down the post-cold-war threats."
The possible development of those technologies took a step forward today when the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Office announced that the next test of an interceptor "kill vehicle," a major component of the missile defense system, would be conducted in mid- to late July, a year after the last test failed.
Defense Department officials say that more than two dozen options are under consideration for initial deployment of missile defenses, and that no timetable exists for a decision by Mr. Bush.
After Mr. Bush's visit to Spain, which was selected as the first stop in large part because the president speaks Spanish and because the administration sees Madrid as a "center-right government," he will go on to Brussels, where he will address NATO. He will then travel to Goteborg, Sweden, for the United States-European Union summit meeting; fly to Poland, where he will deliver a major address on his vision of the American relationship with Europe; and then end up in Slovenia for his meeting with Mr. Putin. 
Mr. Bush said he would explain to Mr. Putin that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty was no longer relevant. He will tell him that "we don't need to be bound by a treaty that was signed when both of us viewed each other with hostility, and that we need to think differently."
Stressing the personal nature of the scheduled two-hour meeting with Mr. Putin in the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, Mr. Bush said, "It's very important for him to hear it from me and for me to hear from him." 
The meeting with Mr. Putin is in fact a late add-on to a long-planned trip that is anchored to the United States-European Union summit meeting, a semiannual event that the White House wants to reduce to once a year because it regards the meetings as unproductive.
The White House did not want to hold the meeting with Mr. Putin until later, perhaps as part of a summit meeting of seven industrialized nations and Russia in Genoa, Italy, in July.
But persistent problems with China, including the American spy plane incident, officials said, made the administration reconsider the extent to which it wanted to keep Russia at arm's length.
Further, in preparatory meetings for the president's trip, European officials made clear that one of the ways of diminishing the doubts in Europe about Mr. Bush was to signal that the administration could manage the relationship with Russia properly. 
Mr. Bush's aides said they had not laid out any major objectives for the meeting with Mr. Putin. "We're not expecting major agreements here," Ms. Rice said in a briefing with reporters. "What we really are doing here is establishing a foundation with these two presidents in their personal relationship that can help us to promote a constructive and realistic relationship with Russia."
Ms. Rice said that "the new security framework" would be the focus of the discussion with Mr. Putin but that other matters would be covered, including Chechnya, press freedom in Russia and Moscow's proliferation of missile technologies. 
Setting a more moderate tone toward Moscow than harsh remarks made by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld just after he assumed office, Ms. Rice said, "The president wants to signal his support for having a Russia that is really a part of Europe, that is a respected partner in international politics." 
As administration officials laid out their game plan for Mr. Bush's journey, they stressed that things were not as bad between Washington and the allies as they might seem.
"This is a relationship under some stress but by no means in crisis," said Richard Haass, the director of policy planning at the State Department. An administration team that went to Europe last month to describe the Bush ideas about missile defense prepared the way for the president's visit and allayed the basic fear that Washington would act unilaterally, Mr. Haass said. 
For his part, Mr. Bush noted in the interview this week that consultations were under way. "One of the things we did on the missile defense issue is we sent high-ranking officials to consult and spend time with -- in various capitals -- on the issues, explaining our position," he said. "There's a lot of give and take. And that's important." 
The White House organized the missile defense briefings after failing to take such a course on the international treaty on global warming, known as the Kyoto Protocol. The sudden announcement that the United States would not abide by the pact contributed to the image in Europe of a high-handed White House. 
At a meeting in Luxembourg on Friday, the European Union's environment ministers set the stage for a standoff on global warming at the summit meeting. The ministers said the European Union would press forward with final negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol so that ratification procedures could get under way. 
But the White House continued to signal this week that Mr. Bush did not plan to change course. 
Despite unanimous support for the pact that is expected to be expressed by the 15 members of the European Union in Sweden, the administration officials said there was no flexibility in their attitude toward the Kyoto proposals. 
They suggested that the administration might work up a set of principles on climate warming but that this would fall far short of any proposal to modify or renegotiate the pact, which requires mandatory emission reductions.
Concerning the death penalty, which is outlawed in European Union nations, it is not on the formal agenda of the summit meeting. But Mr. Bush is still expected to hear much about it during a free-wheeling dinner discussion with European leaders. Ms. Rice, asked by reporters about the awkwardness of Mr. Bush's arriving in Europe when Mr. McVeigh's execution is expected to occur, said the use of the death penalty in the United States was no one else's business. 
"I believe that our allies probably understand that this is a matter for the American government," Ms. Rice said. "It is a matter for America's democracy, not a matter for international negotiation."

HEADLINE: Tony Blair's Centrist Majority 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair's resounding re-election victory on Thursday marks him as Britain's most successful politician since Margaret Thatcher. He deserves full credit for leading his Labor Party to its first re-election to a second full term in office. But his task was made easier by the blinkered anti-European stance taken by his Conservative opponents under the leadership of William Hague, who announced yesterday that he would step down as party leader. To regain credibility as a serious contender for national power, the Conservatives will have to move back toward more constructive policies on Europe. 
 Labor built its current success on an earlier move to the center. After taking over party leadership seven years ago, Mr. Blair engineered a shift away from Labor's previous nationalization and spending policies and its old trade union base, and toward the growing suburban middle class. 
 Consciously modeling his political program on Bill Clinton's, Mr. Blair blended fiscal conservatism, cautious social reform and international engagement, including a constructive attitude toward Britain's role in the European Union. By the 1997 elections the Labor Party had attracted the overwhelming majority of the swing votes that decide elections in Britain as they do in the United States.
Over the past four years, Labor has established a credible governing record, especially in economic and fiscal management. Britain has also been Washington's most reliable ally on difficult international issues like Iraq and the Balkans. Meanwhile the Conservatives have championed populist and nationalist causes, such as rejecting foreigners who seek asylum on political or humanitarian grounds. The party also warned that British sovereignty and democracy could be harmed if Mr. Blair holds and wins a referendum on joining the new European currency. 
At times, Britons complained that Mr. Blair and his fellow ministers appeared smug and aloof. Some cabinet changes have already been announced. There is also discontent with the deterioration of public services, particularly the national health service and the recently privatized railroads. But Labor has promised increased spending in both areas and has an almost unassailable parliamentary majority of 167 seats. 
It was only after successive defeats by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives that Labor turned to more modern policies and leaders. Now it is the Tories who must begin drawing hard lessons from their back-to-back defeats.

HEADLINE: NEW & NOTEWORTHY PAPERBAKCS 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 GREENE ON CAPRI: A Memoir, by Shirley Hazzard. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.) With a pervasive wariness and modesty, the novelist recalls the long, often stormy, friendship she and her husband, the Flaubert scholar Francis Steegmuller, struck up with Graham Greene, who is portrayed as a proud but prickly soul who ruthlessly disagreed with anyone who agreed with him. "Hazzard tells of a relationship that was a treasure hunt among nettles," Richard Eder wrote in the Book Review last year. Her "feeling for the landscape is incantatory."

SOME THINGS THAT STAY, by Sarah Willis. (Berkley, $13.) This first novel's feisty narrator is an artist's 15-year-old daughter who is intent on testing life's possibilities (including her ability to fly) as she comes of age in a small town in upstate New York in 1954. She is "an engaging character not because she gains insight but because she's so responsive to the world," Joanna Scott wrote here in 2000.

LIVING TO TELL, by Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $13.) An entire family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this wry, obsessively observed novel, which begins with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother while driving drunk. "The story's hard-won, moderately happy ending is a satisfying benediction" upon an ensemble cast "about which the reader has truly come to care," Emily Barton said here last year.

EXPERIENCE: A Memoir, by Martin Amis. (Vintage International, $14.) The novelist crams a lot into his account of growing up in the shadow of his father, Kingsley Amis, including his youthful wanderings, his midlife crisis, his withering assessments of fellow writers and even his elaborate dental work. " 'Experience' is a portmanteau of personal history, ancestor worship and promiscuous opinionizing, and a pinata of literary gossip," John Leonard wrote in these pages last year.

THE END OF THE PEACE PROCESS: Oslo and After, by Edward W. Said. (Vintage, $14.) In a series of angry essays that find fault with all involved in the Middle East power struggle, the author, a professor at Columbia University and an eloquent advocate of the Palestinian cause, views the 1993 Oslo accord as an unpalatably one-sided expression of Zionism. "You don't have to agree with Said to admire him," Ethan Bronner said here last year. His voice is "deep, rich and courageous in what is often a scripted and dishonest international dispute." Yoram Hazony, the author of The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel's Soul (Basic Books, $18), maintains that some leading intellectuals have been undermining the Jewish purpose and nature of Israel and calls for a new vision that will revitalize the nation's mission. Last year in these pages, Walter Reich said that even if "Hazony's argument is at times overheated," his book "contains much that is valuable and illuminating." Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age, by R. Stephen Humpreys (University of California, $17.95), explores the many stubborn issues facing a region whose most serious challenges, he says, lie less in economics than in perceptions, habits and attitudes. In 1999 our reviewer, Max Rodenbeck, called this an "objective yet sympathetic, scholarly yet accessible" work.

THE SLEEP-OVER ARTIST, by Thomas Beller. (Norton, $13.) Less a novel than a set of interwoven stories, this collection follows the evolution of its hapless Holden Caulfieldesque hero from the age of 6, when he's tossing water on people from the windows of high-rises, into his mid-20's, when he's fumbling toward maturity and becoming entangled in romantic relationships. "Beller is particularly skilled" at capturing "the myriad stages of fear, discovery and elation that mark one's first sexual experiences," Katherine Dieckmann wrote here last year.

WHEN MOUNTAINS WALKED, by Kate Wheeler. (Mariner/ Houghton Mifflin, $13.) This first novel unfolds along parallel tracks as it tells of an idealistic young woman struggling to bring health and prosperity to a remote Peruvian valley, and of the woman's grandmother, who traveled to the region many years earlier -- with tragic results. "It's the kind of novel you gulp down, curious to find out what happens next," Susan Bolotin said here in 2000.

LEGACY OF THE DEAD, by Charles Todd. (Bantam, $5.99.) A guilt-ridden detective sent to Scotland to identify the remains of an English aristocrat finds that the person accused of murdering the noblewoman was the fiancee of a soldier he executed during World War I. The result is a "study of postwar Scotland as a land rich in beauty but barren of new life," Marilyn Stasio wrote here last year. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Customer Service By E-Mail 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
There is perhaps no easier way to get a person started than to ask about a travel horror story.
 For Jennifer Zimmerman, it was a business trip in October from her hometown, Dallas, to Washington, D.C. At midday Sunday she checked her bags at an American Airlines gate, then watched the thunderstorms roll in. After a succession of cancellations and delays, she drove home early the next morning, frazzled. 
 The next day was barely better. Ms. Zimmerman got a flight, but it arrived after a crucial business meeting had begun. She rushed off the plane in jeans and sandals, looking frantically for her luggage, to no avail. 
An airline employee eventually discovered that Ms. Zimmerman's baggage was still in Dallas and told her there was nothing she could do. 
"I fly 35,000 to 75,000 miles a year on American, and I cut them a lot of slack," Ms. Zimmerman said. "Not this time." She had seen a billboard advertising a Web site called PlanetFeedback.com, which claims to help wronged consumers get responses from companies. The site helped her construct an e-mail complaint to American's chief executive, Donald J. Carty, and sent it on her behalf. A week later she received an e-mail apology from American -- and a $250 travel voucher.
Such happy endings are rare in an era when travel providers -- airlines in particular -- have earned ever lower marks for customer service. The fact that the complaint was resolved through the Web is even more remarkable since, according to travel industry analysts, many travel sites offer poor customer service.
"In situations where something's gone wrong, there are ways to get it taken care of on the Web sites -- usually through e-mail forms -- but they're typically buried," said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research, a company with headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., that analyzes technology changes for business clients.
But even if customers find the e-mail link on one of the airline sites, for example, they may be wasting their time. Forrester recently found that six of the nine major airline sites didn't respond to e-mail messages within five working days.
Mr. Harteveldt said that consumers will see "major improvements in the next year, or even six months, since every company says it's focusing more on customer service on the Web." For instance, he said, he expects companies to set standards for answering e-mail messages within two to six hours, depending on the level of the complaint. "Of course, if it's an immediate problem, that's probably 1 hour and 59 minutes too long," he said.
One airline Web site where the e-mail link is not buried is United (www.ual.com), which says "contact us" at the top of the home page. Clicking on those words takes you to a page with contact information, including an e-mail link. According to a United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite, e-mail is usually answered within 72 hours, regardless of the subject matter, "but if we have a backlog, it can take up to a week," he said.
Mr. Brathwaite said that the company will address complaints more quickly if a customer is a member of United's frequent-flier program and includes a membership number along with the note. 
The company does not track the percentage of people who send e-mail inquiries rather than calling, according to Mr. Brathwaite, but Mr. Harteveldt, of Forrester, said that over 70 percent of consumers use the telephone to get help with travel problems, while just 15 percent use e-mail (the rest send faxes or write letters).
The beauty of complaining through e-mail, of course, is that you can state your case clearly, in as much detail as you like, without having to contend with a call-center labyrinth, five-minute spans on hold and the misery of repeating the same story to a succession of employees.
Fortunately for the millions who book through them, the major online travel agencies, Expedia and Travelocity, do a better job of handling e-mail inquiries than do many travel providers. On Expedia's Web site, for example, customers are assured that their inquiries will be answered within 24 hours, although the company's marketing director, Suzi LeVine, said that responses come within five hours.
The substance of the responses, though, may disappoint those who are counting on the site to resolve their problems. In many instances, the site will "work with the travel supplier to make sure a situation is remedied," Ms. LeVine said. "But unfortunately, there are some situations where it's clearly the responsibility of the travel supplier, and there's nothing we can do."
In the case of lost luggage, she said, "we can point people to phone numbers, but unfortunately that's the purview of the airline."
The same is true on Travelocity.com. A customer service representative said that in disputes with airlines Travelocity does whatever it can to help, but that the airline will have the final say. 
A new competitor of Travelocity and Expedia, Orbitz.com, says it will do things somewhat differently. The site, which is scheduled to roll out to the public this month, has been operating in a test mode for several months, selling airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals. According to Gerry Romanescu, Orbitz's vice president for customer care, the company will coordinate lost-luggage claims and other complaints on a customer's behalf. It will forward a customer's e-mail message to the airline, Mr. Romanescu said, "and if they don't get back to you in the normal amount of time, we'll follow up." The company is also trying to persuade the airlines -- five of which are part-owners of the site -- to allow Orbitz to act on their behalf. One airline, which Mr. Romanescu would not name, has already agreed to pass along its rules about providing discounts and other perks to rankled customers, thereby allowing the site to cut through bureaucracy.
Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are taking their complaints to online ombudsmen, like PlanetFeedback, or smaller operations like ComplaintDetective.com. According to Pete Blackshaw, PlanetFeedback's chief executive, the site does not yet track the number of travel-related complaints that are ultimately resolved because of his company's intervention, but he believes it is well over 50 percent.
Not surprisingly, the airlines have generated the most complaints within the travel category in the past six months, with roughly 8,500 such e-mail messages. (The site also sends compliments on behalf of customers; airlines garnered 3,000 of those.) Unlike some other complaint sites, PlanetFeedback sends a follow-up e-mail message to a user after three weeks, asking if the user received a response. If not, the site will send an "escalation" e-mail message.
"It's amazing how many companies will ignore a complaint the first time, but respond to the second one," Mr. Blackshaw said.
For those who have tried in vain to get a response, Complaint Detective may be worth considering. Aggrieved customers pay a $25 deposit to the site, explain the issue by e-mail or by telephone, and the company pursues a remedy. If the problem isn't resolved, customers get their deposits back. But if they get a refund or travel voucher, they pay the site about 20 percent of the value of whatever remedy is offered.
"It may take me five calls to customer service to get a nice rep who'll give me the right name, but eventually I'll get it," said Lisa Quinn, the site's president. She added that she's always had good success with the airline complaints.
When asked to divulge her secrets for getting through to the people who actually make the decisions within the airlines or other travel companies, Ms. Quinn hesitated. "Well, I figure there are a lot of people who are e-mailing or calling," she said. "So I always get the fax number."

Beach Towns Evolve by Adding Year-Round Homes

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AN oceanfront block in Manasquan has been bulldozed to make room for an enclave of 26 upscale condominiums, a move that in many ways is a metaphor for the continued evolution of the shore community in southern Monmouth County to a year-round address.
 Until last month the block was crowded with an amusement arcade, shops and timeworn bungalows that hosted generations of college-age students and young adults and was as much a beachfront tradition as salt water taffy. But traditions change. 
 "It was a major nuisance and an eyesore," John L. Winterstella, the mayor of Manasquan, said of the block. Its transformation, he added, is in keeping with Manasquan's changing character "as a year-round, family town." 
The project sits between Brielle Road and East Main Street and overlooks the beach and Atlantic Ocean, separated from them only by the stretch of macadam, instead of a traditional boardwalk, that spans the borough's mile-long shoreline. 
The $13 million development, Surfside Estates, will rise in the next 18 months and consist of seven buildings, each three stories high and each with three or four apartments. The units all will have three bedrooms, 1,800 square feet of space, two-car garages, a front deck and price tags of $650,000 to $700,000, according to Paul R. DeBellis Sr., president of the Franklin Group of West Paterson, the developer.
Surfside Estates is the first sizable condominium in the 1.4-square-mile borough and one of a smattering of developments under way or about to begin at the water's edge. Among the reasons for the slow pace of construction along the beach, real estate professionals say, are the lack and high cost of oceanside land and state regulations, mainly the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, governing growth along the state's 127-mile shoreline.
In February 2000 the state changed its coastal law to align it with its state Development and Redevelopment Plan. The plan encourages growth where highways and utilities are in place and discourages it in less-developed areas. 
To that end the state's Department of Environmental Protection designated shore towns into existing centers and four other types of land-use areas. Each area has been given an allowable density with "the more-dense development allowed in those places, including the barrier islands, where development already exists," said Raymond E. Cantor, assistant commissioner for land-use management and compliance at the department 
The new rules, however, never completely closed what many say is a loophole in the 1973 law. While the law governs some single-family homes within 150 feet of the water, it is silent about developments of 2 units to 24 units. 
In turn, there are those who say the rules are too loose and those, including developers, who say they are too stringent. The opponents include the New Jersey Builders Association, which filed a lawsuit against the Department of Environmental Protection. 
Mr. Cantor said he was confident the rules would be upheld and would result in "better protection of the shoreline."
Meanwhile, development continues. Most of the activity along the oceanfront consists of tearing down modest older homes and replacing them with larger ones. Although there are no exact figures available, Mr. Cantor said the activity "has been substantial for the last decade." 
There are also projects, like Surfside Estates, that recycle parcels. Plans are also advancing to replace an old restaurant on Brielle Road in Manasquan with 12 more condos, said John T. Trengrove, the borough administrator. 
That is also the case in Spring Lake, where the century-old, blocklong Warren Hotel, a remnant of the town's past as a luxury resort, was recently demolished to make way for 10 Victorian-style homes. They will have 4,500 square feet of space, sit on 75-by-150-foot lots and cost from $2.5 million to $2.8 million, said Daniel Matthews, a principal at National Home Developers of Spring Lake, the developer. Construction will start the end of the month, he said, noting that seven houses had been sold. 
Exceptions to small, piecemeal projects can be found in more urban shore towns like Long Branch. There, a redevelopment plan is in place to transform 150 acres of the city's faded Atlantic Ocean coastline into a mix of residential, commercial and entertainment uses. And in Asbury Park redevelopment efforts have been discussed for years for its mile-long oceanfront. But they have been tied up in litigation and complications arising from bankruptcy and so far have not moved forward. 
VACANT parcels outside such redevelopment areas are also gaining new life. Indicative of that are two projects bordering the redevelopment area in Long Branch. One, called Renaissance on the Ocean with 86 residences, is under way on 9.2 acres at the southeast corner of Ocean and Brighton Avenues.
The residences range from condominium apartments to town houses and single-family detached homes with 2,000 to 4,000 square feet. Since sales began three years ago, all but four units have been sold at prices ranging from $300,000 to $1.9 million, according to the developer, Renaissance Estates L.P., made up of a group of investors based in Neptune. 
An empty, weed-choked lot across Ocean Avenue is the site of the second project. It will contain 23 town houses, with 2,700 to 3,400 square feet, covered front and rear porches and prices starting from $400,000. Construction will start in mid-July, said Joseph Forgione, a principal at Sterling Properties of Livingston, the developer. 
Manasquan, founded in 1887, originally was a summer community with rows of little bungalows and a boardwalk. But the borough, like many others along the shore, is evolving into a year-round community. Over the last decade its year-round population increased to 7,000 from 5,300, according to census figures. (During the summer the population at least doubles.) 
Meanwhile, the borough's supply of bungalows is dwindling as developers tear them down and put up large waterside houses. There have been 5 to 10 such teardowns a year for each of the last four years, said Mr. Trengrove, the administrator. 
Such homes sell for about $1.5 million and replace bungalows, often three on a lot, that cost a total of $700,000 to $1 million, said Robert Wood Sr., who runs the Wood Agency, a real estate office in Manasquan.
The Surfside Estates site became available only after the death of its former owner, Irving Kirsch, a large property owner in the borough. Mr. DeBellis, the developer of the condominiums, said his company bought the one and a half acre parcel three years ago for $3.2 million because the chance to redevelop a whole oceanfront block was "absolutely like finding a treasure." Initially, the project planned 36 condominiums, but borough officials thought that was too dense and the number of units was cut to the current 26, said Robert Richardi, a Franklin principal and the project's architect. He said reducing the number also enabled his company to spread the buildings apart and design them so the garages, rather than being visible from the street, will be tucked into an interior courtyard, which pleased local officials. 
The borough also required the company to use certain construction materials to better withstand the high winds and salt water at the shore. 
Mr. De Bellis said meeting all the borough's requirements added 25 percent to the overall cost of the project. But in the three years since it was planned, the real estate market improved, "making it economically worthwhile to move ahead," he added.
Richard F. Martel Jr., the manager of the Spring Lake office of Coldwell Banker, the residential brokerage, said that because of the sluggish national economy, prices for oceanfront housing in towns in and around Manasquan "have not dropped, but they are no longer going through the roof." There also are 20 percent more homes on the market today than a year ago, so they are taking longer to sell, he said. 
Mr. Wood, the realtor, said the average sale price of existing single-family detached beachfront homes in Manasquan is $800,000, up 35 to 40 percent from two years ago.
Mr. DeBellis said there is a pent-up demand for the kind of maintenance-free housing at the water's edge that Surfside Estates will offer. Fifty-one people have put their names on a waiting list, he said.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
A Cautionary Tale Taken From Pulpit to Stage

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
MUSIC has never been a very effective medium for polemics. To have an impact, a polemical argument must be precise and persuasive. Music is powerful but indistinct. Propped up by rabble-rousing music, a political tract tends to sound bombastic.
 Even opera resists preaching, as Verdi understood. His operas are full of disarming choruses expressing the nostalgia of captive people for far-off homelands or stirring calls to battle. But the expressions are generalized. In "Simon Boccanegra," Verdi didn't try to sort out the alliances and grievances of 14th-century Genoa that motivate the factional strife in the hopelessly confused story. Yet the music presents poignantly recognizable human beings coping with loss, regret and disconnection. 
 The Danish composer Poul Ruders seems to have a Verdian understanding of the genre. In his opera "The Handmaid's Tale," which received its premiere last spring at the Royal Danish Opera and has just been released on CD's, he found a grippingly operatic way to tell a story so loaded with polemics that it might have crushed a lesser composer. The opera is an adaptation of a futuristic 1986 best-seller, a cautionary tale by the Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, written in response to the emergence of the Moral Majority in the United States, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, the policing of birth rates in Romania and China, and other signs of increasing intolerance.
In the book, a part of the northeastern United States has been taken over in the 21st century by Christian evangelicals aghast at the country's wantonness and alarmed at the widespread pollution and virulent new infections that have depleted the population and rendered a majority of women infertile. They establish a male-controlled totalitarian state, the Republic of Gilead, where women are divided into classes based on their household functions and identified by uniforms. There are Marthas, the efficient housemaids, in drab green; Econowives, the working class, in colored stripes; Wives in blue; and Aunts, like some matronly thought-control force, in brown. Clad in bright red are the Handmaids, named for Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid in Genesis. Their sole function is to bear children for the heads of households, called Commanders, whose wives are barren. Abortion and divorce are capital offenses.
The libretto, written by Paul Bentley in English and translated by Mr. Ruders into Danish for the premiere, retains the framing device of the novel. The opera begins with a prologue set in 2195. At a worldwide video conference, the 12th Symposium on the Republic of Gilead, a newly discovered audio cassette diary will be played. It was left by Offred, a Handmaid in the republic, whose name, like those of all Handmaids, is derived from that of her Commander: she is "of Fred."
To judge from his work, Mr. Ruders was less interested in the politics and symbolism and more taken with the charged dramatic situations and internal struggles of the characters. He clearly saw the potential for opera, with its ensemble technique, to project the different tiers of the story simultaneously.
This riveting, kaleidoscopic score can now be heard in a Dacapo recording, taken from the premiere performances in Copenhagen. Conducted by Michael Schonwandt, it features two mezzo-sopranos, Marianne Rorholm as the Offred of the diary and Hanne Fischer as Offred in the time before. The music is a triumph of stylistic pluralism. Mr. Ruders, 52, has thoroughly modernist credentials, and he writes in a pungent, freely atonal harmonic language. But washes of diatonic consonance often flood his scores, and for a while he was associated with the Minimalists. He is a brilliant practitioner of musical parody, riffing everything from medieval chant to break-dance disco. A highly original ear for harmony and texture, as well as an infectious love of the large gesture, runs through almost every Ruders work.
Surely, "The Handmaid's Tale," his first large-scale opera, represents a summing up. The lavish scoring deftly mingles electronic and standard instruments. In the apt phrase of Stephen Johnson in the program notes, Mr. Ruders is the "Richard Strauss of the computer-age orchestra."
From the opening moments, when sustained soft, misty, strangely astringent orchestral chords hover in the background while bits and pieces of themes in solo instruments struggle to break out, the music is haunting. Though prone to violent shifts of mood that closely follow the situations, the score has a taut linear continuity. But what gives it dramatic richness and rescues the story from Ms. Atwood's weighty symbolism is Mr. Ruders's use of musical parody. The wife of Offred's Commander, a gospel singer named Serena Joy, is depicted in a grotesquely beautiful rendering of "Amazing Grace." Hints of Bach chorales, grimly fractured, keep recurring. In a scene at a private club for the Commanders, Mr. Ruders offers a wicked skewering of 1940's big-band music.
For a work of literature to be a good operatic source, there must be something music can add. Andre Previn might have considered this obstacle before taking on "A Streetcar Named Desire." Even John Harbison's "Great Gatsby," an opera I admire, struggles to achieve a profile that can stand up to Fitzgerald's classic novel.
But Mr. Ruders felt that "The Handmaid's Tale" was begging for operatic treatment. And in providing one, he freed the story from its sermonizing, something even a 1990 film adaptation starring Natasha Richardson could not do. How the opera works on stage, those of us who were not at the premiere can look forward to discovering, for productions of "The Handmaid's Tale," in Mr. Bentley's original English, arrive in London in 2002 and in Minneapolis in 2003.

In Belleville, the Priorities Speak Volumes

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
ON the ceiling of the reference room at the Belleville Public Library are three allegorical panels painted in an Italian Renaissance style. Together, they tell the story of a man on a quest for knowledge and wisdom. The middle panel shows the man in mortal battle with a beast.
 "Slaying the dragon of Ignorance," said Cindy LaRue, the head reference librarian. 
 A similar battle is going on in Belleville. 
The Town Council, which finds itself facing a $5 million budget shortfall, is considering cutting the library budget by $146,000, and requiring the library to pick up the $200,000 tab for employees' benefits. That would cut the budget by 54 percent, to the minimum allowed by law.
Belleville's library director, Joan Taub, doesn't think she can keep the library open on such a tight purse. "I almost have to not let myself think about it," said Ms. Taub. 
Ms. Taub recently had a dream in which she was in a library -- -- supposed Belleville's, but it wasn't. She was screaming at someone to get out. "And I never scream in the library," the soft-spoken librarian explained.
Nor does she scream in Town Council meetings, like the one on May 22, in which she was interrupted during a prepared speech and asked to stop.
"I don't think it is appropriate at this time," Mayor William Escot said. "We are all very aware of your opposition to the budget cuts."
Ms. Taub quietly took her seat.
When some residents brought up the library budget that night, the town manager, Tom Banker, brandishing his credentials as a former director of the Newark Public Library, said: "I'd like to see the library funded at high levels. "But you can't have your cake and eat it too."
What he's referring to are the competing desires to put out fires, stop robbers, educate children -- and buy books -- and not raise property taxes. Services on the chopping block include the fire and police departments.
Nobody can explain how Belleville got in such a mess, although three new Town Council members were elected last summer on a tax-cutting platform, and managed to bring the tax rate down by four points. Then Belleville, which is self-insured, swooned under the unexpected burden of 10 catastrophic illnesses. Still, the town is thinking about lowering taxes again -- by one tax point.
Many see the current budget battle as part of the rough-and-tumble politics that dominates this distressed, blue-collar town, which looks like a set out of "The Sopranos" and is in fact used when the fictional mob family needs a funeral home.
"The library is the only oasis in a wasteland," said Irving Berkowitz, who has lived in Belleville his entire 77 years. "Culturally, it's the finest thing in this town." 
Actually, the library -- which was built with an Andrew Carnegie grant in 1910 and renovated for $300,000 in 1992 -- is too fine for the likes of some people. With its Italianate ceilings, faux-marble columns and baby grand piano, it's a bit too much for some. "People felt it shouldn't have been so grand," Ms. Taub said of the renovation.
I wanted to research the history of libraries, so the other day, I went to Belleville instead of using the Internet. Ms. LaRue directed me to a reference I hadn't even thought of it: the encyclopedia. There were pictures of grand, columned libraries throughout history, reminding me that libraries, like churches, are things that can be built only by communities. Libraries, in fact, are churches for books. Recording, remembering, referencing history -- their buildings tell us -- is a sacred task.
In Belleville, a town whose modest housing stock has always attracted immigrants, libraries have another sacred duty: educating the newcomer. Sitting next to me was Del Lagdameo, who came to Belleville from the Philippines last year, and was studying books on dental and medical careers. In the next room, Dawit Tadesse, who came to Belleville five years ago from Ethiopia, was reading about his homeland. The library also provides classes on English as a second language.
The encyclopedia also mentioned that libraries flourish under "strong and stable governments" in times of "economic health" -- two conditions that seem perceptibly lacking in Belleville these days. 
Ms. Taub didn't even want to mention it, but somehow it slipped out. When she invited the Town Council to a breakfast last month, not one person showed up. If you weren't in a library, it could make you scream.

For Old Union Carbide Headquarters, a Time of Flux

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: DANBURY 

 BODY:
A MILE and quarter down a private two-lane road within a 646-acre tract of unspoiled forest and meadowland alive with deer and wild turkey lies the 2.1-million-square-foot former world headquarters of the Union Carbide Corporation -- Connecticut's largest office building, acknowledged to be among the most architecturally significant, innovative and controversial office structures in the country. 
 Despite its auspicious opening in 1982 as an icon of Fairfield County's crop of corporate campuses, the property has been in flux for most of its life -- and, with the end of Union Carbide earlier this year, it remains in flux. Since 1992 it has been called Corporate Center. Currently it has 451,000 square feet rented and 236,000 square feet available at annual rents of $23 a square foot, plus electricity, according to Leroy Diggs, its facilities manager. 
 From its earliest days, the building was tied to Union Carbide's declining fortunes. Starting in 1986, space was rented to outside tenants, and its fate was also linked to its location in Danbury, a secondary office market. This year, in a merger consummated on Feb. 6 with the transfer of $10.2 billion worth of its stock, debt and equity, Union Carbide became history. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow Chemical Company -- its products and stock known by Dow's name and the 200 or so remaining members of a Carbide staff that once numbered over 3,000 now employed by Dow. 
The building, off Old Ridgebury Road, was designed by the architectural firm of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates and constructed at a cost of $190 million. It rests in spectacular fashion off the ground on 5,000 columns ranging from 8 to 40 feet tall, accommodating the hilly terrain and avoiding vast amounts of earth- and rock-moving that would have been required for a conventional foundation.
Inside and out, the building wears its age with remarkable grace. The original interior wall coverings, carpeting, furniture and patterned wood floors, and the building's awesome exterior of anodized aluminum and glass, have been maintained in pristine condition. 
Current tenants include Praxair, a supplier of industrial gases, with 135,000 square feet; Honeywell International, with 60,000 square feet; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, with 9,000 square feet; Boehringer Ingelheim, a health-care products company, with 76,000 square feet; NuKem, a uranium trader, with 9,000 square feet; American Express Travel, with 5,000 square feet; and Dow, which occupies Carbide's 288,000 square feet of space. 
Carbide's downward spiral began in 1984 with the deaths or disabilities of more than 6,500 people in Bhopal, India, after a massive gas leak occurred at the company's chemical plant there. Settlement costs totaled $470 million. The next year, Carbide fended off a hostile takeover by the GAF Corporation by divesting itself of several divisions, further weakening its financial structure. 
IN 1986, to avoid seizure, the Danbury building and 100 surrounding acres were sold to Sunbelt Management of Delray Beach, Fla., in a 20-year lease-back arrangement that ends in 2006. Carbide rented out the space that it no longer needed to a variety of companies that moved in, moved out, sometimes came back, sometimes expanded within the building. 
While never fully occupied, the building attracted sufficient tenants to provide a steady stream of income that will now go to Dow. Dow will in turn continue to pay rent to Sunbelt according to the leaseback agreement, and as the city's largest taxpayer, it will take over payments totaling $3,862,056 in real estate and personal property taxes.
Dow would like to sell the 546 undeveloped acres not owned by Sunbelt, according to Garland G. Warren, former manager of real estate services for Union Carbide, who is now performing that function for Dow. But restrictions placed on Dow by the Federal Trade Commission as a result of the merger prevent it from selling any of its properties for two years. In 1989 the same vacant tract was sold by Union Carbide to RP Development Limited Partnership of New York City, but with the real estate recession of the early 90's development never took place, and Carbide bought it back in 1997. 
Dow's headquarters are in Midland, Mich., and it has 50,000 employees in 170 worldwide locations. Jim McIlvenny, chairman of Dow's Danbury site management team, said: "Dow has always coveted an East Coast presence to attract and retain East Coast graduates. We will continue to maintain an East Coast presence, but in a reduced capacity."
While Corporate Center has its admirers, prospective tenants can be put off by its unusual configuration. It is composed of a long four-story rectangle, slightly curved like a centipede about to turn a corner, and its snowflake-shaped office pods sprout from its sides like legs. Lit up at night, it has been compared to a science-fiction starship. 
Incorporated into the building are two four-story parking wings totaling 900,000 square feet and accommodating 2,568 cars. There is no outdoor parking. Centered crosswise between the wings is a vertical 222,000-square-foot core containing five variously styled dining rooms; a marble-floored cafeteria; a conference theater; 10 conference rooms and two board rooms; law and business libraries; a shopping arcade; a medical clinic; dry cleaning, hair cutting and ATM facilities; a reception hall; and a fitness center with dozens of exercise machines, showers and dressing rooms. 
EVERY office has individual temperature controls and natural light from continuous ribbons of windows. Vaulted skylights, reflected light from mirrored ceilings and diffused light from translucent wall panels provide daylight in dining rooms, hallways and service areas. A jogging track runs through a mile of the property, and a helipad is in active use. 
Ten interior roadways take employees and visitors to their appointed parking areas. Employees drive to spaces directly facing the pods, where their offices are 10 feet away, across glass-enclosed pedestrian bridges. They need not set foot outdoors from home to office. "It's a huge building made small," said Ivana Tibbetts, Dow's public information officer for the building, who led a visitor on a recent tour. 
Like some of his colleagues, Ed Tonnessen, an executive vice president at Albert Ashforth Inc., a Stamford, Conn., brokerage company, finds the layout of Corporate Center hard to market. "Some companies don't want to be small fish in a very big pond," he said. "Some large tenants want their own signature on a building, and the need to be close to where the C.E.O. lives is not a need that Danbury satisfies."
But Arthur Delmhorst of Delmhorst & Sheehan Inc. of Stamford and Manhattan, leasing agents for Corporate Center, said that these days tenants and potential tenants seem happy with the space. "Five years ago, when we started leasing, people wanted large blocks of open space -- a big shoe box," Mr. Delmhorst said. "This building was never suited to that. But today people are more interested in private offices."
Rentable spaces range from 4,000 to 100,000 square feet. But "there are not a lot of big tenants floating around the Danbury area," Mr. Delmhorst said. "We thought we'd have bigger companies and more from Manhattan, but most of them have been from Stamford or along Route 7." 
Many brokers in lower Fairfield County consider Danbury unsuitable, in part because of the narrowness of Route 7. "It's an alternative market unto itself," said Dean Shapiro, executive director of Insignia ESG in Stamford. "Technically it's in Fairfield County, but it really operates independently, the reason being its relative inaccessibility to the rest of the county because of Route 7. It can take an hour to get from Danbury to Stamford." Attempts by the state's department of transportation to widen the road are strongly opposed by many residents who fear an increase in traffic and urbanization.
In addition, "from a cachet standpoint, Danbury is low on the scale relative to the rest of the county," Mr. Shapiro said. "But relative to the rest of the county, its housing costs and labor pool are terrific." 
Even though Dow said that it hopes to maintain an East Coast presence, Mr. Tonnessen of Albert Ashforth said that he has "the impression that Dow will disappear as soon as it can."
"When it does there will be more space available," he said, "and that will have a governing effect on the price of office space in Danbury, that is now in the $23 to $25 per square foot range."
Richard Reeves, president of Sunbelt Management, said he was beginning to consider what he would do when Carbide's -- now Dow's -- lease expires in 2006. "We will think about our strategy over the next two years and decide," he said. "It's a long way off."

HEADLINE: Along the Rivers, Routes for Paddlers 

BYLINE:  By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
AT a landing behind a parking lot off Route 3 in Cromwell, about a dozen people eased their canoes and kayaks into the Mattabesset River. Soon they were in a different world from the nearby cars and commerce as they paddled past quiet hillsides looking for birds and making their way toward the big freshwater tidal wetland called Cromwell Meadows.
 On this sunny Saturday morning the Mattabesset, which meets the Connecticut River beyond the Meadows, had risen above its tree-lined banks and resembled a flooded forest. 
 "This is the spring freshet," Michael Lutz said, describing how the melting northern snow had raised the waters of the Connecticut and its tributaries.
Along their route, Mr. Lutz spotted a cormorant darting between the trees, and a fellow paddler, Jim Beck, reported on other river birds. 
"There's a heron that likes to sit by the landing," Mr. Beck said. "Last week I saw a couple of eagles over the Meadows."
The Mattabesset River Canoe/ Kayak Trail, which the two men were following, is scheduled to officially open this summer. The trail continues through the Meadows into the Connecticut, ending at Harbor Park in Middletown.
The trail is one of a growing number of routes in Connecticut that take paddlers down rivers and creeks, into coves, around islands and marshes, past historic sights and close to an impressive variety of birds, animals and plants.
With signs and other materials along the way, these trails help canoeists and kayakers navigate safely, savor the natural world without disturbing it and learn a bit about what they are paddling past. The hope is that the trails will help people enjoy, appreciate and become more protective of the state's waterways.
In recent years at least three such trails have opened: in Cheshire, in Old Lyme and in Essex. Besides the Mattabesset, the other trails scheduled to open this summer are in Deep River and in Norwalk, along with the start of a trail in East Lyme. In the works for next summer are a trail in Old Saybrook and an extensive trail on the Sill and Housatonic rivers stretching from Danbury to Monroe.
"There's an explosion of interest in canoeing and kayaking," said J. H. Torrance Downes, a regional planner who designed several trails. He said paddlers welcomed trails that have informative signs and brochures.
The Quinnipiac River Watershed Association got things going around 1995, with help from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven. Members of the association put numbered signs at sites along the riverbank and printed the Quinnipiac River Canoeable Trail Guide, a booklet with entries corresponding to the signs.
"It's an educational trail," said Mary Mushinksy, executive director of the association, "and it's a way of enticing people down to the river."
The trail follows a quiet stretch of water through Cheshire with numbered sites, including an upland forest that buffers the river and a spot where otters like to romp.
In 1998, the Connecticut River Estuary Regional Planning Agency started a trail that became a model for the others. The project got its start when Peter Webster, first selectman of Essex and a longtime kayaker, suggested to Mr. Downes of the river planning agency, that canoe and kayak trails would help people explore and appreciate the lower Connecticut and its tributaries.
Mr. Downes started scouting routes, reading and talking with biologists, historians, fishermen and others who knew the river. In 1998, the river planning agency received a grant from the D.E.P.'s Long Island Sound Fund for the trail in Old Lyme. Since then the Essex, the Deep River, the Mattabesset River and the Norwalk Islands trails have been developed with support from the Long Island Sound Fund, along with help from towns and other sources.
In May, the fund approved $6,184 to establish the Old Saybrook trail and $25,000 for a sign, ramp and floating dock on the East Lyme side of the Niantic River.
The trails aided by the Long Island Sound Fund follow the pattern devised for the Old Lyme trail by Mr. Downes. There are no signs along the way, but there is a big sign with a map at a launch site, and paddlers can carry along a laminated brochure. Each brochure includes a map, illustrations and information about what can be seen. The brochures also include information about tides, currents, safety regulations, approximate paddling times and areas that should not be disturbed, such as the feeding and nesting sites for birds.
Following tidal creeks, the Connecticut River Estuary Canoe/Kayak Trail in Old Lyme includes views of the 500-acre Great Island salt marsh and of Griswold Point, a shifting sand spit. Paddlers checking the brochure learn that off that spit, in 1775, David Bushnell of Old Saybrook launched his submarine, the Turtle. They also learn why salt marshes matter.
The Connecticut River Estuary Canoe/Kayak Trail in Essex meanders through four coves and along the river; its brochure points out where birds feed and where 18th-century shipyards turned out splendid sailing vessels.
This season the Connecticut River Estuary Canoe/Kayak Trail in Deep River will open, with one of its three launch sites at the Town Landing on the river. This trail includes passages into Pratt and Post Coves, both freshwater tidal wetlands. A brochure explains just how the tides of Long Island Sound affect such wetlands; it also notes that ships once delivered ivory for the local factories that produced combs and piano keys at the Town Landing. 
For the Norwalk Islands Canoe/ Kayak Trail, the Southwestern Regional Planning Agency hopes to have its sign ready by early summer, with the brochures following later, said Rich Stoecker, a planner at Southwestern agency. Starting from Calf Pasture Beach, Norwalk, the trail will include two loops in Long Island Sound.
"An interesting aspect of this trail is its access to some of the publicly owned islands and its connection with ground trails on the islands," Mr. Stoecker said.
Paddlers will encounter islands that are wildlife refuges and islands that have public beaches. On Sheffield Island they will see the 19th-century lighthouse maintained as a museum by the Norwalk Seaport Association. (In the summer, for $3, they can stop for a climb to the top.)
Mr. Stoecker said the idea was for people to enjoy the islands and, at the same time, gain a "heightened appreciation for the resources of the Sound and the need for better protection and stewardship."
The town of East Lyme hopes to have its floating dock with ramp in place at Cini Park on the Niantic River by late summer. There will also be a big sign advising paddlers on how to avoid nearby strong currents and areas of large-boat traffic as well as providing information on local history and natural features.
The long-range plans are for a complete trail, on the river's quiet, scenic stretches north of the dock. Next summer, the Old Saybrook trail will open in North and South Coves.
Meanwhile, the Mattabesset River Canoe/Kayak Trail is already showing people a steam that is beautiful and full of life. 
"It's a river that we're trying to take back and draw people to," said Jane Brawerman, director of the Connecticut Riverwatch Program at the Middlesex County Soil and Water Conservation District Inc. The district established the trail with help from volunteers, including members of the Mattabesset River Watershed Association, an advocacy group.
The new Mattabesset brochure notes that the river, though cleaner than it once was, still gets polluted run-off from many sources, including lawns, roads and construction sites. But the brochure also includes drawings of thriving river plants, like wild rice, and describes the Meadows, an important conservation area that is home to many birds and a nursery for anadromous fish.
The Saturday paddlers moved nicely along the Mattabesset, sometimes chatting about the locals (muskrats, snapping turtles), at other times muttering about such topics as lawn pesticides.
"It's part of the mission to get people aware of their environment, so they'll think about what they do on land and how it affects the water," said Mr. Lutz, who is on the board of directors of the Soil and Water Conservation District. 
Other efforts to guide paddlers include two folders (with maps): the Mattabesset River Canoe Guide and the Willimantic River Recreation Guide.
While the organized trails are laid out to be reasonably short, safe and doable -- a few hours of steady paddling, without major difficulties -- each of these folders briefly describes an entire river, noting launch sites and also warning paddlers about areas with rough water or obstacles like dams. The Mattabesset folder covers 12.6 miles, the Willimantic 23 miles.
Something bigger and different, is one the way. The Housatonic Valley Economic Development Partnership is planning a 38-mile trail on the Sill and Housatonic rivers. The trail will start on the Sill in Danbury, follow that north to meet the Housatonic at New Milford, and then continue on the Housatonic to the Stevenson Dam in Monroe. Boat launches are to be placed about every five miles.
The Housatonic River Valley Trail also differs from the others in that it is being developed by the economic development partnership, said Peg Daley, project director for the trail. The idea is to increase tourism as well as the quality of life in the area. The trail will also draw attention to the improved state of the Sill, which once ran in the colors of dyes dumped by Danbury hat makers.
Ms. Daley hopes the trail will be open by next summer. She said the project has the support of the public, a grant from the National Park Service and technical assistance from the King's Mark Resource Conservation and Development Area of the United States Department of Agriculture, but more help was needed.
"The most difficult thing is finding money," she said.
More trails are expected.
"Interest has spread to other groups," said Kate Hughes, coordinator of the Long Island Sound Fund, who added that she had gotten inquiries about starting other trails.

Tidbits for Treks on Water
For the Connecticut River Estuary, the Mattabesset River and the Norwalk Islands trails, the laminated brochures are free. The estuary trail brochures are available at several locations, including area town halls and libraries.

HEADLINE: Battle Continues Over Mall That Won't Die 

BYLINE:  By LINDA SASLOW 

DATELINE: SYOSSET 

 BODY:
SURPRISES are unlikely at Tuesday's scheduled meeting of the Oyster Bay Town Board, when its seven members are expected to vote down the Mall at Oyster Bay. But even if the developer of the proposed shopping mall loses, the deepest disappointment seems to be reserved for anyone who hopes the vote will end the most bitterly contested development dispute in recent Nassau County history.
 The proposed mall, on a 39-acre Syosset site formerly owned by the Cerro Wire and Cable Company, has been a source of controversy in the Town of Oyster Bay for the last seven years, since the developer, the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., proposed a 950,000-square-foot shopping center with upscale anchor stores that could include Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. 
 Although the developer has downsized the original proposal twice, first to 860,000 square feet and in April to 750,000 square feet, local residents, concerned about the impact of mall traffic, have been unrelenting in their opposition, while supporters have been equally vociferous in touting the economic benefits. 
Some heavyweights have joined the fray. While the Nassau-Suffolk Building Trades Council has endorsed the project, the Nassau County Council of Chambers of Commerce has opposed it. After Simon Properties, owner of five million square feet of Long Island shopping centers including Roosevelt Field, Walt Whitman Mall and the Mall at the Source in Westbury, joined a consortium of civic and business groups to block the project, accusations went as far as to suggest that Joseph Mondello, the Nassau County Republican Party chairman who is also a partner in the law firm that represents Simon Properties, had strong-armed the town supervisor, John Venditto, to oppose the mall.
Last month, the Town Board voted 6 to 1 to adopt the findings of the town's environmental review committee, which concluded that the mall would have a negative impact on the environment that outweighed any possible economic benefits. Interviews with several members indicated that the board's vote on Tuesday will not contradict the acceptance of the environmental report.
"The dominant factor is traffic density and its impact on the environment," Mr. Venditto said. "Having accepted these findings, the board would be hard pressed to approve this project."
But the board's action drew angry criticism from the developer, because the environmental review committee made its evaluation based on its earlier plan of 860,000 square feet, ignoring the revised plan that reduced the size of the mall by more than 100,000 square feet.
"The new proposal had effectively mitigated the concerns raised by a previous report prepared by the town that reviewed issues ranging from traffic to quality of life," said Morton Weber, a Melville lawyer who represents the developer. "It demonstrated a willingness by the developer to compromise and negotiate."
While Mr. Venditto acknowledged the inevitability of a court challenge, he dismissed Mr. Weber's argument.
"For the last four years we've been moving the process along on the basis of an 860,000-square-foot mall," the supervisor said. "Now, at the 11th hour, 59th minute and 59th second, along came the applicant, apparently reacting to adverse environmental findings, changing the application to 750,000 square feet with the assumption that if this doesn't work, they'll continue to scale it down. It's like a jury who has been listening to a trial for many months and as they're ready to vote, along comes the prosecutor with a new piece of evidence and no chance for the defense to respond. My sense of fairness was that we couldn't accept the new proposal at the last minute."
The majority of board members also supported the findings of the environmental review committee.
"This has been one of the most thorough processes in my history of more than 12 years on the board," said Leonard Symons, a Republican. "There has been a huge amount of input both from experts and from the public. Part of good government is being able to listen to all sides and then make an intelligent decision. There has to be some finality to this never-ending story."
Anthony Macagnone, a Democrat, the only board member who voted against accepting the environmental findings and who has publicly supported the Mall at Oyster Bay, said, "I thought the report was ambiguous in its findings. It also contradicted an earlier report that indicated that economic factors outweighed environmental factors."
Bonnie Eisler, another Democratic board member, would not disclose how she will vote this week, but said, "The adoption of the environmental findings is indicative as to how the board is going to vote. It's up to us as the lead agency to decide whether the economic benefits outweigh these environmental issues."
But regardless of the board's vote on Tuesday, the saga seems destined to continue, in court.
"We're not going away," Mr. Weber said. "We are anticipating a no vote from the town and would be shocked if they vote otherwise. But Taubman will continue with this fight to build the mall."
Gary Lewi, a Taubman spokesman, said, "This long-term battle has come to a new and uglier phase, and for those who thought the process had come to an end, it hasn't."
Cerro Wire operated at the site adjacent to the Long Island Expressway, manufacturing electrical conduits and copper rods, from the early 1950's until 1986, when it sold the property to the Tribune Company, the Chicago newspaper publisher, which now also owns Newsday. In 1983, the state Department of Environmental Conservation declared the site a hazardous waste site, but after a cleanup it was removed from the list in 1994.
Proponents of the mall have said it would bring upscale shopping opportunities and thousands of jobs.
"This mall means a lot of jobs for us," said Jack Kennedy, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Building Trades Council. "We anticipate between 3,500 and 4,000 jobs during construction. The developer has made a commitment that all work will be done by union members."
Mr. Lewi said that once built, the mall would provide 2,500 full- or part-time jobs and a $75 million annual payroll.
On the other side are 26 chambers of commerce and civic, education and business groups united as the Cerro Wire Coalition to block the project. 
Howard Avrutine, a Syosset lawyer who represents the Birchwood Civic Association, said the regional group represented 44,000 families in the Town of Oyster Bay who were concerned about land use, traffic and other environmental issues.
"This mall is just the wrong project for this property," he said.
Dave McDonough, president of the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce, agreed. 
"This mall would mean too many dollars taken from small businesses," he said. "We're not against growth and development, but against something that would hurt our own constituency."
The board's vote, although clearly not the end of this seven-year debate, will be a turning point.
Mr. Venditto said: "We've been criticized for taking so long, but I'd rather have the process be too open than have anyone feel they didn't get a fair say. Whatever subsequent litigation we face, I want to be comfortable that when any judge reviews this record, he will stand behind our decision."

HEADLINE: Conservationists Are Divided on Cross-Sound Gas Pipeline 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL to build a 40-mile-long natural gas pipeline across Long Island Sound has divided conservation groups in New York and Connecticut, not just along state lines but along philosophies. At the heart of the disagreement is whether the project will threaten the environment or improve it.
 On the Connecticut side are the organizations that contend the pipeline will destroy oyster and lobster habitats and fish breeding areas and will endanger delicate wetlands. Many of the groups that oppose the gas pipeline also opposed the proposal for a cross-Sound electrical cable that was rejected by regulators in March, primarily because of environmental issues. 
 "It's very unlikely they could put a gas pipeline across the Sound in a way that would be environmentally acceptable," said Barbara C. Gordon, the executive director of the Connecticut Seafood Council, an industry group. "There are alternatives for utility companies, and there is no need to damage the environment." 
On the other side of the Sound are some environmental advocates who say that growing electricity demands will require new power plants and that gas-fired generators will produce much less air pollution than coal- or oil-fired plants.
"From an energy point of view, we support it," said Neal M. Lewis, the executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, a grass-roots citizens' group with an office in Massapequa. "What we're calling for in the short term is more gas to replace the oil-burning plants on Long Island."
Some Long Island groups have avoided taking any position on the project yet. "We don't want to see brownouts in Suffolk County and have people saying, 'You dopey environmentalists caused this,' but on the other hand, we don't think they have proved the need for this," said Howard R. Meinke, the president of the North Fork Environmental Council, in Mattituck. 
The pipeline proposal is being put forward by the Islander East Pipeline Company, equally owned by KeySpan and Duke Energy, based in Charlotte, N.C. John P. Sheridan, a spokesman for Duke Energy in Boston, said that the pipeline would run along existing utility and railroad rights of way and across industrial properties.
The new pipe, which would would vary in size from 24 to 30 inches in diameter, would tap into an existing Algonquin gas pipeline in North Branford, Conn, just east of New Haven, and would then run south through Branford into the Sound. From there it would run southward to the Town of Brookhaven, where it would hook into existing pipelines on Long Island Power Authority property in Wading River. The new pipeline would initially transport 250,000 decatherms of gas a day, or enough to heat about 600,000 homes. 
To avoid the most sensitive shellfish areas, Islander East would use a horizontal drilling technique to sink the pipe 30 to 40 feet below the seabed for about 4,000 feet after it leaves Branford. The company plans to meet with officials on the Long Island side to determine what areas it must avoid there.
"We are taking every possible step to reduce the impact on the environment," Mr. Sheridan said.
So far, he added, public comments have been more positive than negative. "People realize there will be a need for natural gas resources in the 2003-2004 time period, and Islander East will come on line just in time to meet that need," Mr. Sheridan said.
State and federal regulatory agencies will have to balance all the arguments when the formal proposal is submitted this summer, after which a 14- to 16-month review period will begin. 
Local officials on both sides of the Sound seem to be waiting for more details on the need for the pipeline and its potential impact before taking an firm position.
For example, Inez Birbiglia, the spokeswoman for the Town of Brookhaven, said that officials there were waiting for an "energy summit" on July 12, with representatives from the Long Island Power Authority, Brookhaven National Laboratory, KeySpan and other groups.
"We want to examine what's good about it, and what's not, and we want to hear about any alternatives," Mrs. Birbiglia said. "We want to hear from the experts before we set a clear direction for the township. We want to be careful about where new energy sources go, but at the same time, we want to be realistic, and do what makes the most economic sense for our residents. Everyone is watching what's happening in California and asking, 'Is that what's in our future?' "
Environmentalists in Connecticut remember one pipeline that had harmful environmental results. In 1996, the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company paid a $22 million fine for damaging 200 rivers and streams when it constructed a pipeline through New York and Connecticut in 1991 and 1992.
Mrs. Gordon of the Connecticut Seafood Council said while measures to protect the environment have been implemented since then, the Islander East pipeline would still cause significant environmental disruption. She contended that silt from the digging in the Sound could settle over shellfish beds, which would take many years to recover.
"It's very unlikely that they could do this in a way that would be environmentally sound," Mrs. Gordon said. The council will discuss the proposal during its next meeting on June 19, she said. The Islander East pipeline venture is designed to carry gas from fields off Sable Island in Canada into the United States. It is one of six major projects proposed for New England, according to the New England Gas Association, which represents distribution companies serving 2.3 million customers.
Mr. Sheridan of Duke Energy said that the Islander East project would give southern New England and Long Island a direct link to a major energy source. 
"Gas will be flowing north to south, where typically for the last 50 years it has been running in the other direction, north from the Gulf of Mexico," he said. "That's going to make additional supplies of gas available for Connecticut and Long Island distributors."
Thomas M. Kiley, the president of the gas association, said that the entire region would benefit from Islander East. "By adding more pipeline capacity, it makes for a more robust distribution system, which will give customers more choice in terms of suppliers," he said. He noted that in a recent study, the regional electric power distribution agency, ISO New England, concluded by 2005, 10,000 to 11,000 megawatts of additional electricity generating capacity will be needed, and it called for improving the gas distribution pipeline to do it.
Sarah J. Meyland, the executive director and general counsel for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, in Farmingdale, said that her group had not taken a position on the pipeline, but she noted that it could provide a valuable option.
"Down the line, as fuel cells become more commercially available, we will need a supply of natural gas," Ms. Meyland said. "That's a future technology that could prove to be very valuable for Long Island."
Mr. Kiley said pipelines were generally "environmentally benign" once they were constructed. In fact, in some areas the open spaces above them can be put to good use. "A lot of people use them for recreation activities, such as biking and snowmobiling," he said. "They have proven to be pretty good neighbors in most cases."

HEADLINE: An Uncomfortable Debate 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
ORIGINALLY founded as a parish and named for a Congregational minister, Brookfield is not a place typically associated with shops selling X-rated videos and sexual aids. But town leaders are considering whether to create a business district that would allow such shops, an issue that has everyone from grandmothers to a Roman Catholic priest talking about sexual devices and pornographic films.
 It is an uncomfortable debate that is not confined to Brookfield. Several towns around the state have been forced to consider the creation of such districts. While no one is putting up welcome signs for the sex industry, officials are learning that without zoning regulations, such businesses can almost open up wherever they wish. 
 That's what happened in Brookfield, a town known for furniture stores and its craft center. Last year, the Satin & Silk Sensations shop, with its signs forexotic lingerie and videos, opened on Route 7. The shop is in the town's central business district, next door to a pizzeria that is popular with teenagers and families. It didn't take long for shocked residents to complain to the town.
"It's next to a pizza place where I bring my five-and-a-half-year-old son," said Mary Ann Capron, owner of Merles Barber Shop, which is located just south of the store. "I don't want to walk by there. It's the porno crap that's got to go."
But the town soon discovered that the shop broke no zoning laws. In fact, the laws didn't even bring up the subject. So not wanting similar stores to open up around town, officials decided they had no choice but to consider setting up a zone that would confine the shops to one area of town.
"We are not trying to legislate morality or anything like that," Martin Foncello, the first selectman, said. "But we are trying to restrict, in terms of taste, the type of things you would like to see in the town."
The proposed ordinance, which is not expected to be voted on for months, puts Brookfield on a growing list of communities that are grappling with the presence of adult businesses that have long been associated with urban centers but are now popping up in inner ring suburbs. 
In recent years, municipalities including Burlington, New Milford, Thomaston, Windham and Wallingford have adopted ordinances or amended zoning regulations to include sections on adult-oriented businesses. East Hartford and New London also have them in place.
"I think there were some other towns having some problems and I believe they wanted to get something in place, too, so it didn't catch them blindsided," Kip Brammer, the first selectman of Thomaston, a Litchfield County town of about 7,500 residents, said of its decision to include a section on adult entertainment businesses in its zoning regulations. "You don't want to lose sight of your character and that type of thing but I think they were trying to protect us from businesses overflowing from different things that tend to be from bigger cities."
Kevin Maloney, spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said it was a quality of life issue.
"They tend to have an impact on the commercial and or residential neighborhoods that they exist in or are located near," he said. "No town wants to be known for having an adult entertainment business. And certainly it's going to attract traffic to that area that other people would prefer would not be there."
So towns put them somewhere else. David Hubbard, director of community planning and economic development for New Milford, said his town created a zone for the sex industry in an industrial area off of Route 7.
"All of the communities are essentially faced with the prospect of either providing a designated zone for whoever may wish to undertake such a business or suddenly facing them any place in town," he said. "For instance, if somebody opened an exotic lingerie store in the middle of the town green, I think that would raise an awful lot of conversation, and so we eliminated that possibility. If someone were to open up an exotic dance club directly next door to a church, it would probably create some conversation. So we just moved to minimize the conversation."
The owner of the Brookfield shop, Nicole Lynn Jones, who listed a New Milford address on her zoning application, and a female sales clerk refused to comment about the issue. According to town records, Ms. Jones applied for a certificate of zoning compliance on July 18, 2000, writing in the application that she intended to sell clothing, fashion and accessories.
But what Ms. Jones referred to as accessories, others called X-rated material. In addition to lingerie and swimwear, the store sells sexual aids and pornographic videos. 
"I wouldn't consider that accessories in a store," said a longtime resident, Mary Lou Moker, a grandmother of 12 who visited the store with a friend under the guise of buying a bridal present. "That would be the last thing on my mind."
"I am not a prude," added Ms. Moker who filed a complaint with the zoning office in September. "But I draw the line to what should be exposed in public and especially when there is a pizza parlor where families go to."
Not everyone is upset by the store, saying it is perfectly legal and wouldn't be open if people weren't shopping there.
"I think they should just leave her alone," Gail C. Apilado, owner of the Village Liquor Shop, said of the store's owner. "She's still open, isn't she? She's making money."
Ms. Moker and other residents have questioned why officials can't cite what they say is a misleading application to shut down the store. But Zoning Commissioner William Schappert said it would be a difficult task to determine whether Ms. Jones intended to deceive zoning officials.
"It's a hot potato from a legal point of view," Mr. Schappert said. "You'd have to get 16 lawyers to figure that out and the Zoning Commission isn't about to do that."
So some residents approached their priest, the Rev. Albert D. Audette Jr., pastor of St. Marguerite Bourgeoys Roman Catholic Church in Brookfield. A widower with four children and 15 grandchildren, Mr. Audette visited the store and was amazed at what he found. While he acknowledged that many businesses sell pornographic magazines, Mr. Audette said that devices such as mechanical sexual aids should not be sold in a store.
"The question is would you have this stuff in your home?" Mr. Audette asked. "Would you give it to your children? And so why do we sell it?"
Mr. Audette, who said he believed such merchandise should be sold strictly through mail order catalogs, called local religious leaders to ask them to protest the store. He expressed hope that they would meet with Mr. Foncello in the coming weeks to discuss the issue.
Meanwhile, Mr. Foncello's office has been flooded with calls from people who noticed the store with its hot pink door and window trim while stuck in traffic. With Sal's Pizza II located next door, residents expressed concern that it would be a teenage magnet. 
Mr. Foncello asked the town attorney, Edward McCreery, to investigate whether such stores could be prohibited and learned that it would be unlawful to ban them. So he and the other two members of the Board of Selectmen have proposed an adult-oriented business establishment ordinance that would regulate similar businesses should they come to town. 
Under the proposal, about 1,500 feet of frontage on the west side of Route 7, north of Production Drive, near the New Milford border and its own such district, would be designated for such businesses.
The ordinance would prevent the businesses from opening within 500 feet of a residential structure or property lines of a school, day-care center, senior center, restaurant or establishments that sell alcoholic beverages other than beer or wine for on-premises consumption.
The businesses would not be allowed to have entertainers or employees who expose certain parts of their bodies.
But at a recent public hearing, residents questioned whether such an ordinance is appropriate. One resident read out loud "giggly words" like breasts and buttocks, and claimed that it looked like the town was trying to entice such businesses into town, Mr. Foncello said.
"We were certainly not encouraging anything," he said. "We are trying to restrict the area that they can operate in, being mindful of everybody's constitutional rights."
The proposal was later sent to a town meeting where residents asked officials to toughen it. Mr. Foncello said the Board of Selectmen is seeking additional input, including whether the proposed zone, which would be sandwiched between a preschool that is under construction and a proposed worship center in New Milford, is a proper location.
Business owners in that area don't think it is. "We don't want it here," said John Ambrosi, a partner in Alpine Cutlery on Route 7. "There's enough crazy people around. Whoever needs to be adult entertained is either a pervert or a nut job."
But Frank Santora, pastor of the Danbury-based Bright Clouds Ministries, which wants to build a community and family life worship center in New Milford on land just north of the proposed zone, saw it as a chance to help people.
"My conviction is that people who turn to those types of entertainment are searching for inner peace or searching for some type of comfort, but they are looking in the wrong place," Mr. Santora said. "I believe that just the presence of godly light and voice in that area would be an alternative for them that can perhaps be a blessing for them."
Mr. Hubbard, the New Milford official, said he doesn't believe these kind of businesses can survive in small towns, pointing out that the only topless bar in New Milford closed down several years ago.
"The reality of this is these types of districts flourish when there are two elements present," he said. "The first element is a larger population so that they have the patronage base. And the second element is anonymity and they tend to go hand in hand.
"What we have up here is a very low density, rural part of the world, which lacks both dense population and anonymity," he added. "If Harry parks his pickup truck in one of these places, his wife, Julie, is going to know in about 32 seconds. There are just no secrets in a small town."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Red Hook; 
Isolated Brooklyn Area Starts to Awaken

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
A FAMILIAR green image of a mermaid stands on Van Brunt Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn, near the corner of Coffey Street. "Coming Soon," the sign says, "Starbucks Coffey."
 Both a play on words and a joking reference to the neighborhood's nascent gentrification, the sign does not seem an accurate prediction -- at least not yet. 
 With a long history as a shipping port and industrial district, the neighborhood, not quite two miles across from the Battery at the tip of Manhattan, is thoroughly urban. But in the evenings it is as quiet as a remote and leafy suburb, a result of its relative inaccessibility and isolation. There are no subway stops in Red Hook, and it is bounded by water on three sides and the elevated Gowanus Expressway on the fourth. 
While other Brooklyn waterfront neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Dumbo have developed an image of youthful urban chic in recent years, Red Hook is still largely the gritty industrial district it has been for decades. Though the faux Starbucks sign is only a joke, neighborhood boosters point to several developments of recent years as increasing the area's attractiveness. 
With the introduction of the MetroCard for buses in 1995, the trip to Red Hook from Manhattan on public transit suddenly became easier, and the cost fell to $1.50 from $3. In addition, a proposed ferry that could begin operating as early as next summer and would circulate through points along the Upper New York Bay, including Red Hook, downtown Manhattan and Staten Island, would make getting to the neighborhood easier still.
Another major development occurred in May 2000, as the city was deciding how to handle household waste after the close of the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island this year. When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a plan for garbage disposal that did not include a waste transfer station in Red Hook, it erased a big question mark hanging over the neighborhood's real estate values, said Frank P. Manzione, a real estate agent who does business in Red Hook.
In addition, two years ago, the propeller on the flushing tunnel of the Gowanus Canal, the neighborhood's eastern border, which was notorious for its stagnant, foul-smelling water, was replaced and reactivated, circulating the water for the first time in more than 30 years and eliminating the stench.
Within the last few years, new businesses have opened in the neighborhood, including the Independence Community Bank branch at Lorraine and Columbia Streets, which opened in 1997, and the neighborhood's first restaurant in many years to be open at night, the Liberty Heights Tap Room. The restaurant takes its name from an allusion to the area's proximity to the Statue of Liberty, a name that some feel avoids the negative connotations of Red Hook and may itself help attract new residents.
The neighborhood is divided into two quite different sections by Richards Street, which runs down its center. To the east is the area known as "the Front," or "the Houses," which mainly consists of the largest public housing project in Brooklyn, the Red Hook Houses, 30 red brick buildings that are home to roughly 8,500 people. To the west of Richards Street is "the Back," or "the Point," where turn-of-the-century and Civil War-era brick row houses and frame houses are interspersed among warehouses, industrial buildings and weedy or trash-filled vacant lots.
The neighborhood's main commercial areas are on Columbia and Lorraine Streets near the projects and on Van Brunt Street from Verona to Dikeman Streets. On Van Brunt, one can find the AR bagelry, the Red Hook Coffee Shop and the Red Hook chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
The Dutch gave Red Hook its name in the 17th century for its peninsular shape and its ruddy soil, said John Manbeck, the Brooklyn borough historian. (Another bulge on the Brooklyn shore -- now known as Bay Ridge -- was called Yellow Hook until yellow fever epidemics in the 1790's made the name unsavory, Mr. Manbeck said.)
During the Civil War years, while Park Slope was still farmland, the neighborhood was already a busy commercial district. Forty-five years ago Red Hook reached its greatest population, 22,000. Now it is about half that. "It's a rundown waterfront village," said John McGettrick, co-chairman of the Red Hook Civic Association. "You see shadows and images of a community that once was bustling."
At its height, Red Hook was largely populated by Italian and Irish dock and factory workers and their families. A few institutions hark back to those days, including the local Roman Catholic church, Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the R. M. Amendola Italian-American Grocery, which has stood on Van Brunt Street for 41 years.
Ralph Amendola, 65, and his younger sister, Sue, lifelong residents of Red Hook who run the store, have watched their neighborhood fall from its pre-World War II heyday into a desolate, crime-ridden corner of Brooklyn as the shipping industry moved to New Jersey and blocks were razed for a container port and a sewer line.
"They took a lot of houses down," Mr. Amendola recalled from his seat by the store's window. "The movie house, the Pioneer, they took that down. The grain elevator, that stopped."
WITH no new housing in decades, the availability of buildings is low, and prices depend a great deal on whether a building has been recently renovated. Newly renovated multiple-family buildings sell for $350,000 to $425,000, while others usually go for $250,000 to $350,000, Mr. Manzione said.
The neighborhood has one-family buildings and six-family buildings and everything in between, but the majority are for two or three families and are owner occupied. Few residential buildings are taller than four stories. They are mostly brick, but there are also frame houses and a few rare brownstones. 
Housing prices depend on location as well. Residential buildings can often be found on blocks that also house warehouses or industrial buildings. These usually sell for $100,000 less than comparable houses on the prime all-residential blocks.
The most desirable streets in Red Hook are Coffey Street, especially the block near the waterfront between Ferris and Conover Streets but also the blocks extending inland to Dwight Street; Pioneer Street between Van Brunt and Richards Streets; and Dikeman Street between Conover and Dwight.
Values throughout the neighborhood have been rising in recent years. Five years ago, prices began increasing 2 to 3 percent a year, said Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates and Properties. Within the past two years, prices have gone up 10 to 12 percent a year.
The increase is partly the result of demand for the area by artists. "They're making their way into Red Hook," said Benny Torres, the sales agent who specializes in Red Hook at Joe Felix Realty in Bushwick. "They need new space because they're priced out of Williamsburg."
Red Hook is only 15 minutes from Manhattan's financial district by the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, but it is not an area with many commuters. "The commute is terrible, especially in the winter, at night, when you're waiting there at Jay Street" for the bus, said Geoff Porter, 30, a freelance writer who lives on Van Brunt Street. "This is a neighborhood for people who work at home."
Parking is not a problem. To many people, it's a necessity. "You need a car out here," Mr. Porter said.
The small but growing artistic community in Red Hook has made its mark at a few spots along lower Van Brunt Street, which is home to the Red Hook Zawia Gallery, an open furniture design studio run by Craig Palmer, 32, and an annual art exhibit put on by the Brooklyn Working Artists Coalition, a nonprofit group. The exhibit, in a two-story warehouse at the Beard Street Pier at the southern end of Van Brunt Street, features works by 200 artists. It runs for six spring weekends and will end next Sunday. 
Two community centers have opened recently. One is the first new building to be constructed in the neighborhood in many years, the Good Shepherd Services Center, an $8 million, 35,000-square-foot building at Conover and Wolcott Streets, which opened last month. The center houses administrative offices, a family counseling program and the South Brooklyn Community Academy, an alternative school for youths who have dropped out of high school.
The other is the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a community court and social service center opened a year ago by the New York State court system. The center offers job counseling and classes to help people get their high school equivalency degrees and has office space for the Legal Aid Society and AmeriCorps.
But the center's existence points to the neighborhood's troubled past. The movement to create the center began after Patrick Daly, a beloved principal at P.S. 15 on Sullivan Street, was killed in a drug-related gunfight one morning in December 1992 as he searched the Houses for a 9-year-old boy who had left school crying after a fight.
That year 7 homicides, 22 rapes, 490 robberies and 359 assaults were reported in the 76th precinct, which encompasses Red Hook, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and Carroll Gardens. Last year, reports of those crimes were down to 1 homicide, 6 rapes, 61 robbieries and 46 assaults.
Mr. Daly was succeeded by Mary E. Manti, who helped start a chorus and a band at the school. Thirty-one percent of students at P.S. 15 read at or above grade level, a figure slightly below the citywide average. The neighborhood's other elementary school is P.S. 27, on Huntington Street between the Houses and the Gowanus Expressway, where 17 percent of students read at or above grade level.
Children go to middle schools in Community School District 15, which extends from Cobble Hill to Windsor Terrace to Sunset Park. The only middle school in Red Hook is the School for Leadership in the Environment, with 80 students in Grades 6 to 8, which is within P.S. 27. Middle School 142 is just outside Red Hook on Henry Street.
Besides the Beard Street pier, the neighborhood has two other public piers. One is the Red Hook Garden Pier at the southern end of Conover Street, where marigolds and irises bloom next to the Waterfront Museum, which exhibits artifacts from a time when barges plied New York Bay and the Hudson River. It is housed on an antique barge docked at the pier.
The other is the Louis Valentino Jr. Pier, a concrete pier and ramp for canoes and kayaks that opened in 1998 at the cobble-stone paved western end of Coffey Street. It is managed by the Parks Department and named for a firefighter from Red Hook who was killed in 1996 in the line of duty.
On weekends neighbors gather at the pier to walk their dogs, enjoy a magazine or gaze out across the bay and talk. On a recent sunny Saturday, Virginia Santivanez, 29, a film special effects designer, let her dog play in the grass nearby.
The pier offers a view of Staten Island, Jersey City and Governor's Island and what many say is the best view of the Statue of Liberty from land.
Looking to the north, Manhattan can be seen but not heard. That's how Ms. Santivanez likes it. "To me," she said, "this is the most civilized place in New York."

IF YOU BUILD IT . . .: Among the Civil War-era warehouses at the foot of Van Brunt Street are old-looking trolley tracks and overhead power wires. Unlike the warehouses nearby, these are not vestiges of a Brooklyn past. They are the newly built first leg of what the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association hopes within two years will become a $1 fare trolley line that will run 1.6 miles from the Red Hook waterfront to Borough Hall. The line now extends just a quarter mile along the waterfront, and the trolleys are driven only on special occasions. But the association is awaiting government financing that would allow it to extend the tracks a half-mile to the intersection of Coffey and Richards Streets, where trolley tracks that have not been used since 1951 lie buried under three inches of pavement. The group hopes to use these tracks for much of the route to Borough Hall. "The trolleys will help reintegrate Red Hook into downtown Brooklyn," said Bob Diamond, president of the railway association. "They have a nostalgic charm that will help to improve the area."

HEADLINE: A Pipeline Proposal for the Sound 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL to build a 40-mile stretch of natural gas pipeline across Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island has divided conservation groups on both sides of the Sound, not just along state lines, but along philosophies. One side said the pipeline will hurt the environment; the other said it will help.
 On the Connecticut side are the organizations that contend the pipeline should be judged based on the oyster and lobster habitat and fish breeding areas it would destroy and the delicate wetlands it would cross. Many of the groups that oppose it also fought a cross-Sound electric distribution line earlier this year that was rejected by regulators, primarily because of environmental issues. 
 "It's very unlikely they could put a gas pipeline across the Sound in a way that would be environmentally acceptable," said Barbara C. Gordon, executive director of the Connecticut Seafood Council. "There are alternatives for utility companies, and there is no need to damage the environment. These are things that, once you damage them, you don't get the opportunity to bring them back to the quality you had before." 
On the other side of the Sound, some environmental groups say growing electric demands on Long Island will require new power plants, and that natural gas-fired generators produce much less air pollution than coal or oil plants, and there are not the radioactive waste problems of nuclear power.
"From an energy point of view, we support it," said Neal M. Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network. "What we're calling for in the short term is more gas to replace the oil burning plants on Long Island. There are a few plants that can burn either, but if you want them to switch to gas there has to be a better supply of it."
The pipeline would start from the existing Algonquin gas pipeline in North Branford, south through Branford, into Long Island Sound, and end in Wading River, N.Y. The pipe would would vary in size from 24 to 30 inches in diameter and be able to transport 250,000 decatherms of gas a day -- enough to heat about 600,000 homes. The companies behind the proposal, Duke Energy and the Keyspan Corporation, said the pipeline is necessary to help them meet the energy needs of Long Island.
"There are a lot of people in town who are really concerned about this, not only about the impact during construction, but the safety impacts over the long term," said William C. Horne, president of the Branford Land Trust, which owns four properties in the pipeline's path, two with ponds and two with low-lying wetland areas.
Some Long Island-based groups, however, have avoided taking any position on the project yet.
"We don't want to see brownouts in Suffolk County and have people saying, 'You dopey environmentalists caused this,' but on the other hand, we don't think they have proved the need for this," said Howard R. Meinke, president of the North Fork Environmental Council in New York. "The question we want to see answered is, what is the local demand? If this is going to come down to supply power plants that could be built to produce power that would be shipped somewhere else, that's a different story, and the public would be less interested in seeing it built."
John P. Sheridan, a spokesman for Duke Energy, a partner in the Islander East pipeline project along with the Long Island-based Keyspan Corporation, said the company is running the pipe along existing utility and railroad rights of way, and on industrial properties. It has agreed to use a horizontal drilling technique to put the pipe 30 to 40 feet below the seabed for about 4,000 feet after it leaves Branford, Conn., to avoid the most sensitive shellfish areas. The company is meeting with officials on the Long Island side to determine what areas it must avoid there.
"We are taking every possible step to reduce the impact on the environment," Mr. Sheridan said. So far, he said, the public comments have been more positive than negative.
"People realize there will be a need for natural gas resources in the 2003-2004 time period, and Islander East will come on line just in time to meet that need," Mr. Sheridan said.
Joel M. Rinebold, executive director of the Connecticut Siting Council, said state and federal regulatory agencies are going to have to balance all the arguments when the formal proposal is submitted this summer, which will begin a review period estimated at 14 to 16 months.
"It's not a simple on-off, yes-or-no question," Mr. Rinebold said. "It's 'yes' only if it's the best possible corridor, if it is environmentally sound, and due diligence must be applied at each step of the construction process. These projects are large, they're going to be in the ground for many years, so it just makes economic and environmental sense to get it right the first time."
Local officials on both sides of the Sound seem to be waiting for more details on the need for the pipeline, and any potential impact, before taking an firm position. In Brookhaven, where the pipeline will come ashore on Long Island, Inez Birbiglia, a town spokeswoman, said there will be an energy summit on July 12, with representatives from Long Island Power, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Keyspan and other groups.
"We want to examine what's good about it, and what's not, and we want to hear about any alternatives," Mrs. Birbiglia said. "We want to hear from the experts before we set a clear direction for the township.
"We want to be careful about where new energy sources go, but at the same time, we want to be realistic, and do what makes the most economic sense for our residents," she said. "Everyone is watching what's happening in California and asking, 'Is that what's in our future?' "
Islander East is designed to bring gas from fields off Sable Island in Canada down into the United States. It is one of six major projects proposed for New England, according to the New England Gas Association, which represents distribution companies serving 2.3 million customers in the region. Thomas M. Kiley, the association president, said that while it might seem that Islander East is designed to serve Long Island and will only pass through Connecticut, it will provide benefits to the entire region.
"By adding more pipeline capacity, it makes for a more robust distribution system, which will give customers more choice in terms of suppliers," Mr. Kiley said. He noted that in a recent study the regional electric power distribution agency, ISO New England, concluded there will be a need for between 10,000 and 11,000 megawatts of additional generating capacity by 2005, and it called for improving the gas distribution pipeline to do it.
Sarah J. Meyland, executive director and general counsel for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, N.Y., said her organization has not taken a position on the pipeline, but has taken no option to oppose it, not only because gas-fired electric plants are more acceptable from an environmental standpoint, but it could open even better options for the future.
Down the line, as fuel cells, which convert natural gas to electricity, become more commercially available, "we will need a supply of natural gas," Ms. Meyland said. "That's a future technology that could prove to be very valuable for Long Island."
Mr. Kiley said pipelines are generally "environmentally benign," once they are constructed, and in fact in some areas provide open space. "A lot of people use them for recreation activities, such as biking and snowmobiling. They have proven to be pretty good neighbors in most cases."
But some environmental organizations in Connecticut recall that the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company paid a $22 million fine for damaging 200 rivers and streams in a pipeline project that runs through New York and Connecticut.
The Branford Land Trust met with representatives of Islander East recently and voted to oppose the project, though it has agreed to allow environmental, cultural and social surveys on its properties.
"We actually think we're going to be in a stronger position if they know what's on the property than if they're just flying blind," Mr. Horne said.
Mrs. Gordon of the Connecticut Seafood Council said that while the companies have adopted some measures to protect the environment, the disruption would still be significant. For instance, silt from digging a ditch across Long Island Sound could settle over shellfish beds, which would take many years to recover.
"It's very unlikely that they could do this in a way that would be environmentally sound," Mrs. Gordon said.
Her organization will discuss the proposal during its next meeting at 6 p.m. June 19 at the Past Time Club in East Norwalk, though she said the council will probably not take an official position at that time.
Some of the environmental groups have accused Duke of coming in with the pipeline proposal during a period when an energy shortage in California has caused rolling blackouts, and there is worry about a similar situation in the Northeast this summer.
"I think that is on a lot of people's minds," Mr. Sheridan said. But the company is responding to the demand for natural gas, not seeking to take advantage of any fears about energy shortage, he said.

HEADLINE: A Last Best Chance To Revive Camden 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE crowd erupts when one of the Camden Riversharks hits a home run, the ball sailing over the green wall, heading for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge looming majestically beyond the outfield. In the month since its opening, Campbell's Field, the new minor league baseball stadium on the banks of the Delaware River, has become a hot destination for mostly white, mostly suburban families looking for a fun night out and a home team worth cheering about.
 It has been a long time since there was anything to root for in Camden, a city that decades ago ran out of disparaging adjectives to describe its squalor. And the notion of heading into the heart of the city for a family outing has been unheard of until recently. 
 To be sure, school-age children may take class trips to the New Jersey State Aquarium and the adjacent Children's Garden, or teenagers might catch a concert at the Tweeter Center, but as soon as the activity is over, visitors flee the city. But now, with the old-fashioned-style brick-and-green stadium joining the aquarium and the concert arena as the third anchor along Camden's re-emerging waterfront -- and with ambitious plans to fill in the spaces between the three major sites -- an unfamiliar sense of optimism is in the air here. 
"I honestly believe that this is and may be the last chance in our lifetime to turn this city around," said Paul Drayton Jr., chief executive of the Delaware River Port Authority. "There are a tremendous number of resources coming to bear on this city. It's the first time we've seen it and the first time it's happening in a coordinated fashion."
With visions of Baltimore's Inner Harbor dancing in its head, the Camden Waterfront Marketing Bureau predicted that in the next five years, visitors to Camden's waterfront would jump from the current level of just over one million to five million annually. If the Philadelphia side of the river can get its plans in order, the projection jumps to 10 to 12 million people visiting both sides of the river each year.
While a proposed $250 million entertainment complex at Philadelphia's Penn's Landing is encountering a number of delays, development along the Camden side of the river continues to buzz along -- to the surprise of many.
After years of wrangling with Bayonne and to a lesser extent Jersey City, Camden won out in its bid be the berth of the much decorated battleship New Jersey, which will open as a fully refurbished museum on Labor Day at its site just outside the Tweeter Center. Next spring, it will be joined by the Moshulu, the floating restaurant that chose to cross the river to Camden after a disastrous pier collapse forced the Philadelphia institution to shut down last year.
To make the trip across the Delaware less cumbersome, pylons are being installed for an aerial tram system that will carry visitors between Philadelphia and Camden by the spring of 2003. A public-private venture to double the size of the aquarium, then adding a restaurant and IMAX theater next to it got closer to reality when the aquarium expansion was included in the state's proposed revitalization package for Camden. Moreover, additional private funds have been raised to convert one of the old RCA plants into luxury waterfront apartments. 
The level of proposed public and private spending now focused on Camden is unprecedented in the city's history, leading those who have long been involved in shaping a new vision for New Jersey's poorest city to believe that for the first time, they are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.
"This is a good time for Camden," said Jane Kenny, New Jersey's Commissioner of Community Affairs, whose department was given oversight authority over Camden's finances last May and has been instrumental in putting together a proposed $150 million in state aid. "Many people have been paying attention to Camden and right now all systems are go."
Camden is one of only two cities in New Jersey currently under state supervision; the other is East Orange. And while East Orange has turned its $9 million deficit in 1999 into an anticipated $4 million surplus this year, Camden continues to fall short in covering basic city services and balancing its budget. In addition to the $70 million in comprehensive aid New Jersey contributed to the city's $112 million budget this year, the state provided another $13.5 million to close the ever-widening budget gap.
The last four administrations have floated various proposals to save Camden, the latest being the recently announced Camden Rehabilitation and Recovery Act.The proposed legislation will get its first public airing tomorrow when the NJ Senate Economic Growth, Agricultural and Tourism Committee holds a hearing on the rescue package.. 
Under the terms of the proposed legislation, the state would issue a $150 million bond to provide Camden with funds for neighborhood revitalization, job training, new streetscaping and signs, more police and fire service, support for the city's colleges and hospitals and expansion of the aquarium. The colleges and hospitals would have to match the state's contribution, adding another $24 million to the pot.
The package also called for about $5 million in residential tax and rebates and commercial tax incentives, and about $10 million to $15 million in matching private investment at the waterfront. On top of that, Camden County has agreed to kick in $50 million to repair the city's outdated sewer system and take over management of the parks and the 911 system.
To help coordinate the city's recovery and turn the old patterns around, the state would install a chief operating officer here who for the next five years would act as a city manager -- having full power to make appointments, approve expenditures and veto decisions made by city council, the mayor and all city boards. The port authority was named as the agency in control of the funds. 
"In the last 12 years, every management study has shown that there are problems in the city's government," said State Senator Wayne Bryant, the Camden Democrat who drafted the proposed revitalization legislation. "All we've been doing until now is plugging holes. It's time for the state to take a bold approach."
Yet Senator Bryant has become the target of city officials who see the legislation as a wholesale takeover of Camden. Indeed, the newly elected mayor, Gwendolyn Faison, stole the spotlight from Acting Governor DiFrancesco at a news conference two weeks ago by following the announcement of his proposal with a public plea to "please don't take the ability away from me that I can't even change a light bulb," and the promise that "at no price will I sacrifice my democracy."
An inevitable battle between the state and city may result in the entire proposal being tabled. But while the legislation wends its way through various committees, people in Camden are encouraged by what they see going on right now. Throughout the city, words like "momentum" and "renaissance," and phrases like "something magical," or at least "cautious optimism" are being used to describe Camden.
This is an enormous change for a city in which one out of seven houses is abandoned, the county prosecutor's office can identify 150 drug corners, and the former mayor, Milton Milan, became the latest city official to be convicted on corruption charges last December.
"I believe there's a positive spirit that's going through our city," said the Rev. J. A. Jones, who is currently trying to raise $2 million to build a new church for the congregants of First Nazarene Baptist Church. "People are starting to feel hope." 
When the 1,200 congregants -- more than half of whom now live outside of Camden -- had to decide where to build their new church, Reverend Jones said, "We felt the moving van out of the city was not the answer."
In the meantime, several blocks away, in the Parkside section of town, red iron beams pierce the sky, while rows of cement blocks begin to form the walls of the new Boys and Girls Club being built across the street from Camden High School. And while the high school suffers a dropout rate of more than 50 percent, the building going up across the street represents a chance for the city's youth. 
"The city's deterioration is like rust," said Lewis Katz, the owner of the New Jersey Nets, who grew up in the neighborhood where he is spearheading the building of the Boys and Girls Club. "It never slept. And 50 years of rusting has left it in pretty sad shape. Camden needs hope, it needs the sense that it can be done. And things are being done, one project at a time."
The 10-square-mile riverfront city was not always in such desperate straits. At the turn of the century, Camden was a bustling metropolis, serving as home to Campbell Soup and the Victor Talking Machine Company, later known as RCA Victor. With active ferry service along the river and a web of railroads converging in the city, Camden was a hub of transportation and commerce, thus earning it the title of "the biggest little city in the world." But with the advent of the automobile, the building of the Ben Franklin Bridge, and a sharp decline in ferry and rail service, the city began to lose jobs and population.
While other urban areas were hurt by white flight and the disappearance of a manufacturing base, Camden, which never had much of a middle class, took its losses particularly hard. Now, with 46 percent of the population living at or below the poverty line, Camden ranks as the nation's poorest city of more than 20,000 residents. Homes in the largely deteriorating neighborhoods cost an average of $30,000, with just 37 percent being owner-occupied.
In a city where the aggregate income of $582 million for its 79,904 residents is less than what some individuals in New Jersey earn, the concept of close to $1 billion in public and private funds being spent here over the next five years is nearly unfathomable.
In addition to the $200 million of state and county aid in the economic recovery package, another $437 million has been earmarked to build or renovate public schools, stemming from the 1998 Abbott v. Burke Supreme Court decision calling for equitable programs for disadvantaged school districts. Westfield Acres' land has been cleared for a new $100 million affordable-housing development, largely financed by federal and state dollars. The tram will cost the port authority $26 million. The baseball stadium carried a $24 million price tag, and the restoration of the New Jersey will cost $22 million. 
Then there is the $615 million Trenton-to-Camden light rail line, which, with four stops in downtown Camden, not only provides financial advantages to the city but also much-needed access to Philadelphia and Trenton.
"Ever since they shut down the Pennsylvania line in 1952, it's like the lights went out in Camden," said Tom Corcoran, executive director of Cooper's Ferry Development Association, which has been largely responsible for the Camden waterfront development. "There's been a sense of isolation. One by one, the lights are starting to come back on, connecting us back again to the larger economy of the region."
But conventional wisdom says that if Camden is ever to succeed on its own, it will have to attract private investment. And while the city's rating has been so low it has not been able to go to the bond market for the last 20 years, some investors are starting to see opportunity. While ventures here are still considered quite risky, developers like Stephen Shilling and Carl Dranoff are willing to take a chance.
When Mr. Shilling first got the idea for a minor league baseball stadium in Camden a few years ago, he commissioned a feasibility study to determine its viability. The results he got back were so positive that he ordered a second study. The conclusions were the same: Philadelphia was an underentertained market and the only major city with just one baseball team. Minor league baseball had proven successful in Trenton and Wilmington, Del., and rather than cutting into those markets, a Camden stadium would draw from the four million people living in the greater Philadelphia area.
Armed with an ambitious master plan for Camden's waterfront and the fact that the other waterfront sites experience almost no crime, Mr. Shilling's Quaker Group was able to raise the money needed to build the new ballpark and install his team, the Camden Riversharks. Helping to make the deal work was selling the stadium's naming rights for just under $3 million to Campbell Soup Company, which has been based in Camden since 1869 and had a food-processing plant on the site of the stadium until the early 1990's.
"If this was somewhere else, we wouldn't have done it," said Jerry Buckley, Campbell's vice president of public affairs. "But it's a natural for us in Camden. Our employees are excited, and we think the stadium is a very good development for the area."
While the stadium cost more and took longer to complete than planned -- the front gates were still being welded into place three hours before the opening game -- Mr. Shilling says he is willing to take a chance in Camden once again.
"There were a lot of frustrations dealing with various government agencies along the way," said Mr. Shilling, who would like to build another office tower near the waterfront. "I can't say they exactly opened their arms and said, 'Come on in.' But I'm on a roll now, and hopefully I won't have to spend a year convincing people again."
Likewise Mr. Dranoff, a Philadelphia developer who has made a name for himself turning dilapidated factory buildings into desirable housing, got wind of Camden's potential a couple of years ago, during a groundbreaking for one of his Philadelphia projects. He was approached by Mr. Corcoran, who asked him to come over and check out Camden. Mr. Corcoran showed him the Nipper Building, named for the four stained-glass tower windows depicting the RCA mascot terrier, Nipper. After two months, and some due diligence, Mr. Dranoff concluded that "Camden's revival was about to happen big time."
He struck a deal that allowed him to buy the 520,000-square-foot building for $1, after the port authority spends $6 million in remediation now underway, then invest $50 million to turn the 92-year-old building into 349 waterfront lofts. Mr. Dranoff also has first option on two other historical buildings near the waterfront, which, if he pursued them, would add another 175 apartment units, creating what he called "a critical mass" of market rate housing on the waterfront.
"I've been in this business 20 years, and every time I go into a new area people are skeptical," said Mr. Dranoff. "In my business I always have to be ahead of the curve -- the out-in-front guy finding the hot new neighborhood before the revival begins."
Like Hoboken and Jersey City, which benefited from the overpriced, overcrowded New York City housing market, Camden may be able to do the same, with Philadelphia's residential market becoming more competitive than it has been in many years. Indeed, Mr. Dranoff said he had heard of "others nosing around" for investment opportunities.
"People have said, 'You woke us up,' " Mr. Dranoff said. "They're looking around at those neighborhoods adjoining the waterfront, looking to get in before it gets too expensive. Mr. Dranoff hopes to begin renting apartments in the Nipper building, which he is renaming the Victor building, by next summer.
One area likely to enjoy the spillover effect is Cooper's Grant, the Victorian-era neighborhood between Rutgers University's Camden campus and the waterfront. Rutgers has already purchased several buildings along Cooper Street, which the university plans to convert to executive offices and more dorm space. Down the street, Rowan University and Camden County College are planning expansions of their downtown campuses as well, using funds from the state's economic revitalization package.
Currently, only 500 of the Camden Rutgers 5,000 students live on campus. And though admissions are up at the Camden campus, the provost, Roger Dennis, said the image of Camden as a dangerous, drug-ridden city was the biggest sticking point in attracting students.
"If you have an 18-year-old kid whose vision of college is Princeton, or some small town in Vermont, then we have some selling to do," said Mr. Dennis, who has lived through many other periods of promise in his 20 years in Camden -- but thinks this time it's different.
"There have been other grand plans that were really exciting but didn't come off," said Mr. Dennis. "I guess I'm a romantic, but this time it feels real. This is a once-in-a-generation chance for Camden to have some fundamental change and I'm very hopeful it will happen."

HEADLINE: East New York: a Neighborhood Reborn 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
FOUR stops after the No. 3 IRT line rises out of its tunnel in the far reaches of Brooklyn, its elevated tracks enter East New York, looming above what was, less than a decade ago, a six-block stretch of weed-choked grassland.
 This was no natural habitat. That swath, criss-crossed by a street grid, was pockmarked in those days by the rusted hulks of junked cars, torched mattresses, tire mounds and the scattered remains of hollow-eyed abandoned buildings. 
 These days, most of that stretch below the IRT tracks -- along with dozens of similar sites throughout the neighborhood -- is lined by newly constructed, privately owned, pastel-shaded row houses set off by wrought-iron gates, some bearing ornamental sculptures. Sprinkled like confetti throughout the 5.6-square-mile community are hundreds of rehabilitated homes. 
The main commercial strip, Pennsylvania Avenue, is now dotted by chain stores. A 640,000-square-foot mall is planned -- with 88 percent of it already leased -- for 50 acres at East New York's southern end. And 2,300 homes are to be built on another 180 acres surrounding the mall.
Back in the late 80's and early 90's, most New Yorkers thought of East New York, when they had to, as some sort of frontier town -- out there at the end of Brooklyn, but not in Queens; out of sight but not quite far enough out of mind. Newspaper stories, citing the morbid statistics, dubbed it the "murder capital of New York City."
For the last 10 years, E. Perry Winston has walked the streets of East New York. As the senior architect at the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, Mr. Winston has seen -- indeed, has helped promote -- a significant transformation.
"It's nice to walk down part of Snediker Avenue where 10 buildings have been rehabbed," Mr. Winston said. "Snediker, by the way, is now repaved."
"Moving further down the street there's a row of Nehemiah homes, privately owned attached houses built by East Brooklyn Congregations," he said. "Then there's brand new multiple-family rental housing built by Genesis Homes, another not-for-profit.
"A block away on Williams Avenue there's a row of rehabbed multifamily buildings done by East New York Urban Youth Corps, also rental. And then near the Williams Avenue apartments, there's a community garden, sponsored by the East New York Urban Youth Corps."
All of that has sprouted in a core of East New York "that the local police precinct used to call the 'Dead Zone,' " Mr. Winston said. "This was the most extreme area of devastation in the community, and to drive down that street now shows how far East New York has come."
Daunting problems persist: desolate lots still blemish the community; ramshackle buildings remain; there is a dearth of on-the-block retail activity; drug deals still go down. But the shift is undeniable.
Despite the demolition of dozens of dilapidated buildings over the last 10 years, the overall number of homes in East New York has increased. Mortgage loans and home-improvement loans have doubled, both in number and in their total dollar value.
In 1991, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, a triennial study conducted for the city by the Census Bureau, there were 41,800 housing units in what the bureau calls the subborough area of East New York. By 1999, there were 44,600 units -- an increase of 2,800.
Citing statistics recorded under the Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Glynis Daniels, associate director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, said, "There are clear signs of improvement in the community as far as investments in housing and the value of housing." The mortgage disclosure act, designed as a barrier against redlining (refusing to make loans to particular racial or ethnic groups), requires most banks and large lenders to report mortgage data to the federal government.
Between 1996 and 1999, Ms. Daniels said, "There was a significant increase in the amount of mortgage lending activity in East New York, both in purchases and especially in home refinance and improvement loans."
In 1996, 511 home-purchase loans were originated in the area; during 1999 there were 650. And, again comparing those years, the total dollar amount of home-purchase loans increased from $66 million to $109.5 million. "There was a bigger increase in the dollar amount than in the number of purchases," Ms. Daniels pointed out. "That could indicate that values are going up, but also that people are rolling in some money for home improvement with their purchase loans, borrowing more than the purchase price to make improvements."
In the refinancing and home-improvement category, 515 loans totaling $40,558,000 were originated in 1996, compared with 1,093 loans totaling $89,337,000 in 1999. "That's significant, a doubling in the number of loans and a doubling in the amount," Ms. Daniels said.
Jaral Chamble bought his first home six months ago in East New York, just a few blocks from where he grew up. "I was raised on Schenck Avenue, across from the projects," said Mr. Chamble, who is 29 and sells cars in Teaneck, N.J. "I lived in a six-story apartment building -- drug-infested, urine smell in the hallways; a lot of gunshots at night, robberies."
It was on Dec. 20 that Mr. Chamble and his wife, Danielle, closed on the two-story, three-bedroom row house on Williams Avenue, built with city subsidies by the Nehemiah Homes project of East Brooklyn Congregations. "Our Christmas present," Mr. Chamble called it -- and that coming only one month after the birth of their daughter, Deja Janelle. 
The Chambles paid $110,000 for the house, making a down payment of $5,000 and another payment of $5,000 for closing costs, on a New York State-backed mortgage that started at 4 percent interest and will rise to 7 percent after four years.
"We weren't too sure about being able to afford a house," Mr. Chamble said, "so we had an apartment on Belmont Avenue for two years." The rent was $568 a month. The current monthly mortgage payment is $588.
Ron Waters, the general manager of the Nehemiah Homes Development Fund, pointed out that the interest rate for most homes in the program is currently about 7 percent, but that occasionally -- as in the case of the Chambles -- the state offers special mortgages at 4 to 4.5 percent for the first four years, with a jump to about 7 percent after four years.
Mr. Waters has an unusually decorated wall in his office. "I made it a goal of mine that when we have our house closings, as we hand people the keys to their new, first-time home of their own, we take a Polaroid shot of them," he said. "We have about 400 of those shots on the wall."
Mr. Chamble, asked what it meant to own his own home, unhesitatingly reeled off his list: "Pleasure, pride, a sense of accomplishment, hope, a step up, space, no more clutter, a sense of safety and security."
In the last five years, the community has "become much more peaceful; not as much gunfire," he said. "Now I'm proud to say I live in East New York."
In 1993, according to Inspector James Secreto, the commander of the 75th Precinct, there were 126 homicides in East New York -- the still-standing record for any precinct in the city. So far this year there have been 10.
According to the Housing and Vacancy Survey, in 1991 the median income for the community was $17,000; in 1999 it was $24,000. In 1991, according to the New York City Department of Finance, there were 27.8 million square feet of vacant land in East New York; by 1999 that had been reduced by 26 percent, to 20.7 million square feet.
Property values have risen significantly -- though not quite as much as Virginia Daniels hopes.
For 28 years, Ms. Daniels (no relation to Glynis Daniels at the N.Y.U. real estate center) has lived in the high-ceilinged, four-bedroom house at the corner of Newport Street and Alabama Avenue -- its porch cheerily decorated with potted, though sometimes plastic, plants.
"This was a shell, gutted, when I moved in," said Ms. Daniels, who is 55 and works for the federal government. "The steps were really busted up; you couldn't get to the second floor. We had to replace the walls."
"The house is 100 years old, but it's solid; layers of brick," she continued. "Quality was built in in those days."
Ms. Daniels said she is still fixing up the place, with even greater impetus now that the community's prospects have brightened. "Ten years ago, I was the only one on the block," she said. "Now there are neighbors with jobs trying to pay that mortgage. It feels like a real neighborhood now."
Asked what she believes she could get if she sold her house, Ms. Daniels said, "$400,000."
That may be a stretch. According to the Housing and Vacancy Survey, the median price for a single-family home in East New York was $140,000 in 1991, and by 1999 it had risen to $165,000.
The trend has continued, said Gerard Longo who, as president of Madison Estates and Properties in nearby Marine Park, has brokered about 300 deals in East New York over the last four years -- many for first-time buyers, others for investors seeking to buy, fix and flip properties.
"For example, there is a two-family on an 18-by-100-foot lot on Eldert Lane," Mr. Longo said. "It sold for $131,000 in 1996 and recently sold for $177,000."
Mr. Longo also cited a one-family, three-bedroom attached brick home on Milford Street that sold for $77,500 in 1996. "It sold again at the beginning of April for $172,000," he said.
"Keep in mind," Mr. Longo said, "that a great many homes in this community were built in the 1920's, 1930's, and it's not uncommon to see houses from 1915, 1910. So what we are seeing is a lot of people renovating, taking pride of ownership. And we also have a lot of speculators buying and selling flip properties."
THERE was a two-family frame house on an 18-by-100-foot lot on Decatur Street, built in 1915, that sold in June 1998 for $64,000, Mr. Longo said. Three months and considerable renovation later, it sold for $99,000. And two years after that, it sold again for $224,000.
"The community has turned around," Mr. Longo said. "You see houses being better maintained, people painting, gardening. It's turned from what might have been called a lower-income area to a middle-income area. The $200,000 range, that's middle income." 
It seems a good sign that the memorial mural on the brick wall at the corner of Newport Street and Williams Avenue -- "Memories of Yvette: I shall not listen when they say life is sad and brief" -- is peeling.
There was a time when too many murals, usually eulogizing a teenager from the neighborhood, were all too freshly painted. "You don't see many new ones," said Mr. Chamble, the new homeowner who grew up in the neighborhood.
In the eyes of the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood, pastor of St. Paul Community Baptist Church and co-chairman of the Nehemiah program: "The community became a cemetery. For those of us who believe in the resurrection, the best place to start a resurrection is a cemetery."
It wasn't always so.
From the 1920's through the early 1960's, East New York was primarily a community of blue-collar Irish, Italians and Jews -- lured there by its moderately priced row houses and low-rise apartment buildings, its walk-ups over storefronts and its bustling shopping districts along Pitkin and Livonia Avenues. Fortunoff's got its start in a small shop on Livonia in 1922. A young John Gotti found company among the men playing cards and sipping espresso at a "social club" run by Carmine Fatico, a capo in the Gambino crime family.
"Pitkin Avenue was an important shopping street for working-class people from all over Brooklyn who weren't going to Macy's," said Jerilyn Perine, the city's commissioner of housing preservation and development, who grew up in Flatbush and has taken a keen interest in East New York. "This was traditionally a community for people to buy their first home, then maybe move out to Long Island. There's so many stories when you talk to people from out there -- the house that their grandmother first bought."
But white flight took its toll from the late 60's through the 1970's, and the community -- particularly vulnerable because of its aging, low-rise housing stock -- became a target for racial steering and redlining. With less affluent minority householders moving in, mostly as renters, the community's population climbed by 4.1 percent during the 1980's, even though the total number of housing units dropped by 2.7 percent.
"You had deterioration going on; people moving in because of lower rent, but living in more crowded conditions," said Mr. Winston, the architect from Pratt Institute. "People were living doubled-up next to vacant buildings" -- most of which had gone into foreclosure and been taken over by the city.
The small buildings of East New York would also fall victim to economies of scale. Although Mayor Edward I. Koch had pushed through a $10 billion citywide housing revival program, Mr. Winston pointed out, "Smaller buildings hadn't yet found a place in the program; it was more economical to rehab larger buildings containing 15, 20 or more units with one roof, one boiler, one set of stairs, than the 3- to 5-unit buildings."
In the mid-80's, a community activist group called Acorn began organizing residents to pressure city officials into rehabilitating smaller city-held buildings. It sent squatters into vacant buildings in East New York. The squatters were arrested for trespassing. But, acting on a motion by the Brooklyn district attorney at the time, Elizabeth Holtzman, a judge dismissed the charges. At about the same time, East Brooklyn Congregations was starting its Nehemiah program.
And out of that ferment, the city would slowly refocus its housing efforts, turning toward programs in partnership with nonprofit groups that stressed, particularly, private homeownership.
Since 1987 -- primarily by selling city-owned property for $1 per lot, but also by underwriting low- or even no-interest loans and relocating tenants while their buildings were being rehabbed -- the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has helped create 2,216 owner-occupied homes in East New York. Of those, 516 are rehabs; the rest are newly constructed. It has also either helped renovate or build 2,870 rental units. Current plans call for the creation of another 3,087 units for private ownership over the next four years -- 2,300 of them adjoining the new Gateway shopping mall, near the Belt Parkway -- and 276 rental units.
Since 1987, the city has spent approximately $140 million to help revive housing in East New York, with another $63 million allocated for further development.
"When we first came, 85 percent of the street corners in East New York had no signs," Pastor Youngblood said. "Ambulances, the police and, of course, visitors could hardly find their way." Organizing residents to perform the required street survey, the Nehemiah program successfully lobbied the office of the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, to pay for 32,000 new street signs.
Nehemiah has since become, by far, the most productive of the nonprofit groups in East New York -- erecting 1,539 prefabricated, 18-by-37-foot, two-story, two- or three-bedroom homes throughout the community -- most on contiguous lots, but many as in-fill construction. It helped create a company to manufacture the prefabricated homes, the Capsys Corporation at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which now employs about 50 people and sells to other housing groups.
"We've raised a phoenix out of the ashes because we were given 150 vacant acres to build on by the city," Pastor Youngblood said.
The more tempestuous activities of Acorn evolved into the founding of the Mutual Housing Association of New York, for which Mr. Winston at Pratt would provide architectural plans as well as construction oversight for the rehabilitation of 75 buildings containing a total of 237 units. Since then, Mr. Winston has been working with community groups on such needs as social services, schools, neighborhood patrols, recreation, community gardens, a farmers market on New Lots Avenue and, particularly, local retail.
The new and rehabilitated city-supported housing, Mr. Winston said, inspired its neighbors to renovate. "They no longer had a fire hazard next door," he said, "so they saw that it was worth their while to spend money on their own house." That attracted newcomers to the neighborhood; and that has increased demand for local shops and services.
EAST NEW YORK'S central shopping district -- Pennsylvania Avenue, from Linden Boulevard to Flatlands Avenue, with the towers of the 6,000-unit, 42-building Starrett City middle-income rental complex looming to its south -- has, in recent years, become home to chain stores like Modell's, H&R Block, Rite Aid, C-Town and Strauss Discount Auto.
"We're busy, near the Belt Parkway," said Randall Bailey, manager of the Strauss store, which opened in 1997. "The company always does market research before they open, and they saw the possibility for growth in this area. It's not so bad like before; people feel more comfortable coming out to do business."
But the little mom-and-pop stores on local streets remain, to a large extent, shuttered. A 1996 study by Pratt graduate planning students showed that only 50 percent of the money spent on produce by neighborhood residents was being captured by local food stores. "If you want to get a carton of milk, you don't want to deal with what we call destination shopping," said Mr. Winston, who sees an opportunity in the problem.
"A lot of these commercial strips were three-story, mixed-used buildings; two or three apartments above a storefront," he said. "Even if you fix up one storefront, but have two vacant stores next to you, you don't have a good retail environment."
"It would require somebody going in and doing several of these storefronts at once," Mr. Winston said. "It might be government; it might be enlightened private capital, but somebody's got to put the foot forward." 
The city sees ongoing opportunity in East New York, Commissioner Perine said.
Adjoining the new Gateway shopping mall, just northeast of Starrett City, what Ms. Perine sees as "essentially a new town" will rise off the drawing boards over the next four years. Called Gateway Estates, its 2,300 units -- 600 to be developed by Nehemiah, the rest by the Starrett Corporation for market-rate sales -- will be a mix of attached and semiattached homes, with an occasional multifamily building, interlaced by 40 acres of parkland. Construction of a new exit off the Belt Parkway is already under way.
Asked about the city's continuing commitment to the community, Commissioner Perine said, "There's a big constituency to see this development through, more work that we're committed to seeing done."
Looking back at how, as young girl, "it was a big deal to go out to Pitkin Avenue, this bustling shopping street you had to elbow your way down," the commissioner recalled an annual pilgrimage to her mother's favorite fabric store. "You'd pick out the material for your next year's good dress," she said.
"I hope we'll have that again," she said. "Ten years from now, I think you'll see an even more dramatic expansion and rebirth of East New York, based on the seeds that have been planted."

HEADLINE: In East Camden, Scars of Urban Strife Fade 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE most striking thing about East Camden is what's missing. The burned-out buildings and grafitti-ridden storefronts that fill the city's other neighborhoods are scarce on the blocks around Woodrow Wilson High School and Dudley Park. In their place are houses with flower-filled planters, painted front doors and debris-free porches, the kinds of touches that people living in neighboring suburbs take for granted but that are an anomaly in the state's poorest city. While developers and city planners are busy trying to figure out how the success of Camden's waterfront may spill over to the depressed inner city, this neighborhood has worked to bring itself back, largely because of the efforts of the St. Joseph's Carpenter Society. 
 In 1985, when the Carpenter Society began rehabilitating houses along the blighted blocks of 28th Street adjacent to St. Joseph's Pro Cathedral, the idea was to raise money and bring in volunteers to fix up the houses, then sell them for the cost of materials, minus what was raised. With houses selling for $5,000 to $10,000, more people were able to buy, but increasingly lower-priced housing was coming onto the market. In the meantime, inexperienced buyers not only didn't know how to take care of the homes, they had no sense of having any equity worth protecting. 
 "We were looking at it from a charity point of view," said Sean Closkey, executive director of St. Joseph's Carpenter Society. "What would be the kindest thing we could do? Give these people a home. Our good intentions were having terrible consequences."
Under Mr. Closkey's leadership, the building program shifted to a market-driven model, with housing prices rising as more homes in the area were rehabilitated and the neighborhood improved. So far, the Carpenter Society has finished 250 houses in East Camden, with rehabilitated houses now selling for $45,000 to $69,000. The Society traded in its volunteers for paid workers, Mr. Closkey said, pumping $2 million in construction activity into the neighborhood.
The homes go to the highest bidder, but buyers are required to complete the 12-week Homeowner Academy, a course in financial management financed by Campbell's Soup. An optional 10-week course in home maintenance is also offered. 
Rather than the city's average of one in seven homes being abandoned, this neighborhood has one in 40, and most of those are buildings the Carpenter Society is trying to acquire. Of the 250 homes sold, only two have gone into default. And while housing values elsewhere in the city have dropped by 35 percent in the last five years, here they have risen by the same percentage.
Moreover, while this has taken place, the Carpenter Society has gone from a small charity group to one of the city's most well-capitalized and influential nonprofit organizations. When the federal and state government kicked in $78 million to build 200 new affordable houses to replace the Westfield Acres projects, the Carpenter Society bought its place at the negotiating table with $17.8 million in leveraged grant money. Working with Camden Churches Organized for People, the Carpenter Society fought against a notorious crack corner and won. The Society took over the site on Mickle Street six years ago and it has remained drug-free since.
"That caused a fundamental shift in the way people viewed their neighborhood," said Mr. Closkey. "This is a community that's coming back through thoughtful reinvestment, not only in its properties but in its people."

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
Putting Their Chips Down On an Arena for Newark

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
Arena politics makes strange bedfellows. How else to explain the alliance between State Senator William Gormley, the powerful Republican from Atlantic County, and State Senator Sharpe Jame -- who also happens to be the mayor of Newark.
 Last week, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco unveiled an arrangement worked to pay for a downtown arena that seemed to please more of the parties involved than anything previously proffered. 
 The basic contributors to the $355 million arena for the Devils hockey team and the Nets basketball team are the teams' owner, YankeeNets ($115 million), the city of Newark and Essex County ($50 million from undetermined sources), fans and local shoppers ($190 million in tickets as well as other fees and sales tax revenue) and motorists ($30 million from the State Transportation Trust Fund, financed by gasoline tax).
The proposal also incorporates a piece of pending legislation sponsored by the two senators -- from different parties at different ends of the state -- with few apparent ties except the desire to show they can reach across the aisle to get something done.
The bill could help generate economic activity -- new hotel rooms, shops, restaurants -- that would contribute the $190 million in sales taxes and various fees by encouraging companies with casinos in Atlantic City to invest in other areas.
The proposed measure, which was approved by the Senate in March and is now before the Assembly, requires that casinos invest $20 million in entertainment, retail or housing projects in urban areas outside Atlantic City to qualify for tax breaks on casino expansion plans.
For now, casino operators say they are open to the idea. Joe Cole, a spokesman for Aztar Corporation in Phoenix, which owns the Tropicana, said his company was considering investing in a mixed-used development incorporating the former Hahne's Department Store.
"It's an opportunity for us to leverage our investment in Atlantic City," Mr. Cole said. 
A spokesman for Park Place Entertainment Corporation of Las Vegas, which owns Bally's Park Place in Atlantic City, said it had had preliminary discussions about a 350-room hotel across from a new arena.
For Mayor James, the motivation to push for an arena in Newark seems as clear as a backboard. Mr. James is also up for re-election as mayor in May 2002, as well as for his first full term as senator this year, and reaching an agreement on an arena could boost his popularity.
"For too long we've been the butt of every joke," Mr. James said last week with quiet resentment after Mr. DiFrancesco made public his plan on financing a new arena here.
For Mr. Gormley -- who plans to run for the United States Senate seat now occupied by Robert G. Torricelli, the motivation to be co-sponsor of a bill that benefits areas outside his district is fairly obvious.
While Mr. Gormley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been in the spotlight recently for leading committee hearings on racial profiling this spring, experts say he still needs to become more well known outside South Jersey.
"This is what South Jersey politicians are always up against: improving their name recognition up in North Jersey," said David Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University.
John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University, said that in addition to spotlighting Mr. Gormley as a bipartisan legislator, the bill being co-sponsored by Mr. James could help soften his image among voters who question the value of legalized gambling. 
"I think for Gormley, he is so clearly identified with issues involving Atlantic City and Atlantic County, and it allows him to show that he is involved with other parts of the state and made contributions to the state," Mr. Weingart said. "And for people who are not comfortable with casino gambling, it could be a tangible benefit that could be seen outside of Atlantic City.".
As for Mr. James, Mr. Weingart said co-sponsorship of a high-profile bill associated primarily with the economic development of Newark could deflect criticism for holding two major offices -- senator and mayor of the state's largest city. 
"He gets the benefits of the funds from Atlantic City, and he also gets what would appear to be a tangible benefit of being a dual office holder," Mr. Weingart said.
State Senator Richard J. Codey, the Senate minority leader, had more than a little sarcasm in his voice when he said of Mr. Gormley: "I would say that his motives are altruistic, that he's doing it for the benefit of the city of Newark and its not for his Senate run."
Even a likely Republican rival to Mr. Gormley for the Senate nomination next year, Essex County Executive James Treffinger, said, "I take my hat off to him."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Premier Jazz Players at Home Here

BYLINE:  By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
MUCH of New Jersey is a bedroom community for New York City, and some of those bedrooms are in the homes of talented musicians from the world of jazz, a close-knit community where everybody knows everyone else and artists and audiences alike feed off each other's love of the music.
 "Everybody has to live someplace, and every musician is a 'local artist' to some group of people," said Rio Clemente, a master of jazz piano who was born in Morristown and now calls Randolph home. "That does not mean the person was not talented enough to escape from his hometown to make it in the big city." 
 On the contrary, many of the versatile musicians who top almost any critic's list of the best jazz players in the world made a conscious decision to live in the Garden State, creating a gold mine of talent in many small New Jersey towns. 
"South Orange is small, about 16,000 people, but a lot of artists of all types, including musicians, live in and around here," said Judy Wukitsch, assistant director for recreation and cultural affairs for the village. "We started doing a free summer concert series, and it sort of grew to be dominated by jazz. Then we do our Giants of Jazz Concert every fall, and we do a small indoor jazz series in the spring and fall.
"We can attract a dozen well-known jazz players, many of them local," Ms. Wukitsch said. "Our audience values South Orange as a place they can come to for good jazz. John Lee, a prominent bass player and member of the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars who lives here, brings in other people. In fact, he has gotten other musicians to move here."
Montclair, Maplewood and other northern New Jersey communities also stage regular jazz concerts.
The largest and oldest jazz festival in the state will be held at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison June 23 and 24. The outdoor Jazzfest 2001, which lends itself to picnic lunches and is popular with families, is sponsored by The New Jersey Jazz Society and Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company.
Among the prominent jazz players who will be featured at Jazzfest 2001 are Mr. Clemente; the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars, which is led by John Faddis and includes Mr. Lee and Slide Hampton as well as other well-known artists; Bucky Pizzarelli; Warren Vache; Bill Charlap; Winard Harper; Kenny Davern; Russell Malone; and Earl May, all New Jersey residents. 
Some of the attractions of New Jersey for musicians are the same things that make the state attractive to people from all walks of life, including the proximity to Newark International Airport, which is important to world-traveling jazz players.
"It's comfortable, not as crowded as New York City, and more economical," said Mr. Malone, a guitarist who moved to Jersey City from Georgia. "I never wanted to be a big fish in a little pond like I could have been in Georgia. Here, there is no room for coasting because there are always up-and-coming musicians who are out to take your place. There is always something going on; always other musicians to listen to and learn from."
Although the jazz scene is good in the metropolitan area compared with most of the rest of the country, it is not as good as the musicians would like. The same handful of clubs, including the Crossroads in Garwood, the Cornerstone in Metuchen and Shanghai Jazz Restaurant in Madison were mentioned as the places where New Jersey jazz fans gather. Mr. Clemente also plays in the unusual setting of a Randolph supermarket at lunchtime four days a week.
"There are a lot of talented people here but not enough places to play, even in New York City," said Mr. Davern, a clarinet player, who said he moved to Manasquan because of the beauty of the area after playing a series of gigs on a ferry boat in nearby Brielle. "Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan used to be filled with clubs when I was growing up in the 1940's and 1950's." 
The existence of those clubs can also be credited with the development of some of the musical talent in the suburbs.
"Today's jazz grew out of what happened in the 40's and 50's," said Bill Steinberg, president of the New Jersey Jazz Society. "People playing today were inspired by those musicians. They heard them play in person, the way someone living in the Midwest could not have done."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE; 
Friends of a Celebrated Garden Don't View a Pathway as Progress

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
The city's first community garden may be sheared in half by the march of urban renewal.
 Named for the East Village resident who founded it in the early 1970's, Liz Christy's Bowery-Houston Garden blooms along the southern edge of a mostly abandoned block. The city, which owns the block, is seeking to build a complex of apartments, stores and community facilities there, and the developers want to construct a pedestrian pathway through the garden. 
 The garden is at Houston Street and the Bowery. The plan calls for extending Extra Place, a tiny alley that runs parallel to the Bowery, through the middle of the garden to connect First and Houston Streets. The idea is to aid access to the new complex.
"In no way would the park be diminished," said Fred Harris, vice president of development at AvalonBay Communities, a partner in the project. "Any space consumed by the walkway would be given back."
But the gardeners are vehemently opposed, saying the pathway, planned to be 22 feet wide, would be disruptive. "Cutting it in half would destroy the spirit of the garden," said Donald A. Loggins, who has volunteered at the site from the start. 
The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which is overseeing the project, seems sympathetic. Calling the path "an oversight" in a $230 million renewal project, Christopher J. Allred, a spokesman, said, "It's our intention to preserve the garden."
The Bowery-Houston garden was started by Ms. Christy and a loose group of activists, known as the Green Guerrillas, who would lob "seed grenades" into vacant lots to spawn green spaces.
In 1973, the group took over the site, which was then strewn with rubble, laid down topsoil and began planting. The following year, the city agreed to rent the space to the gardeners for $1 a month, and the city's first community garden was created.
Today, the garden is home to a small pond, seven red-eared turtles, hundreds of migrating birds and 2,000 plant varieties, from white bamboo to white strawberries.
Last Tuesday, the developers and city officials met with the gardeners after touring the site. No alternatives to the path were proposed, but officials said they would explore ways to keep the garden intact, including selling the plot to the Parks Department. DENNY LEE

Christy, a distant cousin of Frederick Law Olmsted, loved gardens.A sprightly figure often seen chain-smoking, she darted around the city in a green Datsun with a back seat full of plants. She was a co-founder of the Green Guerrillas, an environmental group that still nurtures the city's community gardens. Ms. Christy was involved in the protests at Columbia University against the Vietnam War, worked in advertising and taught arts to children. She was also a landscape painter. But gardening was her first love. Besides starting the city's first community garden, she was the host of "Grow Your Own," a gardening show on WBAI radio in the 70's. She also wrote numerous articles for gardening publications. In 1985, at age 39, she died of lung cancer. The next year, the Bowery-Houston garden was renamed in her honor.

SLOW GROWTH IN 90'S

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 Despite a low unemployment rate and an increase in new jobs, New Jersey ranked near the bottom among states in terms of economic growth during most of the 1990's, according to a report released by the federal Department of Commerce last week. 
New Jersey ranked 42nd in growth in the gross state product, which is a measure of the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property, increasing by 2.9 percent from 1992, when recovery from the 1990-1991 recession first began, to 1999. The national average was 4.0 percent, with the fastest-growing states in the West. New Jersey's slowest growth areas were in construction and manufacturing. Karen DeMasters

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Living In Denial, Comfortably, In a Big Home

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
YOU would think that between the economic slowdown and the high cost of heating, people would become nervous and build smaller homes. But that is not the experience of Lee Baum, a Memphis builder. He is building or preparing to build five McMansions, including one for a doctor who is putting the home around the corner from his present big house so that his children and grandchildren will have a place to stay when they visit.
 Now that is consumer confidence. This slowdown has the potential for considerable longevity and considerable damage. The two precipitators, a stock market sell-off and a collapse in capital spending, are not easy to reverse. But the consumer keeps his finger in the dike, and nowhere is this resistance to hard times -- "denial" some would call it -- more noticeable than in America's love affair with big homes. 
 "People's sense of personal space has increased tremendously in recent decades, and even in these difficult months they are expressing that preference," said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. "Children are no longer expected to share a room, and each spouse counts on having private space -- a study, a den, a sewing room. They get different names, but they are dedicated to the use of one spouse."
The average size of newly constructed homes reached 2,305 square feet at the end of March, up from 2,265 last year, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Construction of the newest dwellings began last fall, during some of the scariest days of the slowdown. Frightened families could have canceled or postponed construction, or scaled back the size of their homes -- to three bedrooms, for example, instead of four or five. They could have shrunk the kitchens.
The average home has grown steadily in size for more than 30 years; it is 53 percent larger today than in 1970, although the average family is 15 percent smaller. The only setbacks came in the recessions that hit the economy in the mid-70's, early 80's and early 90's. Homes will probably shrink again if the current slowdown turns into a recession.
Or, the Americans yearning for bigger homes could help to keep the slowdown from going that extra, terrible step. That may be overstating the economic power of the $500,000 to $1 million homes that Mr. Baum and his counterparts are building in so many cities and suburbs. But five years of considerable prosperity and easy credit have honed self-indulgence. The big-home phenomenon is a prime example. And giving up self-indulgence is not coming easily, despite the prods from layoffs, buyouts, falling profits, a weaker stock market, under-water options and shrinking raises as well as bonuses.
This is not a nation reefing sails for hard times -- and that may be a blessing, a Keynesian stimulus of sorts from an unexpected quarter: the consumer. Not all consumers, however. Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said that Pew's polls had found that people with incomes above $100,000 a year were more confident about their earning power in January 2001 than they had been in September 1999, while "satisfaction with earning power" plummeted among people with less income.
High earners, in sum, are sustaining home construction, an important leg of the economy, and their preference for McMansions, the giant-home phenomenon that first appeared in the late 1990's, keeps pushing up the size of the average home. Mr. Baum's customers include these high earners: the doctor, a lawyer, a plant manager, a scrap dealer, an executive of an ice-cream company. The homes that Mr. Baum is building for them or preparing to build -- 5,000 square feet and up -- feature 6 bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths, a playroom, a theater room. "These are well-established people with good jobs," he said. "They don't have a problem."
ECONOMISTS see logic in the big-home craze. Falling interest rates make financing cheaper. Baby boomers are still buying or building homes. Tax cuts in 1997 added an incentive. And despite the slowdown, the prices of big homes -- all homes, for that matter -- keep rising. Many experts, in fact, argue that home prices are likely to hold their own during a recession, or at least not slip much. That makes homes seem an attractive alternative investment for wealthy people who have pulled money from the stock market.
Still, logic may fail. Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, is uneasy. "We spend a fair amount of time trying to understand the remarkable resiliency of the housing sector at a time of economic sputtering," he said. "It is almost as if people, in building a big home, are resisting mortality."

HEADLINE: CITYPEOPLE; 
The Last Bohemian

BYLINE:  By PETER EDIDIN 

 BODY:
LUFTMENSCH. Superfluous man. Flaneur. Beatnik. Bohemian. For a century, New York been a magnet for such economically marginal figures, whose role it was to stroll, read, reflect, write and, especially, critique the way the rest of the world lived. They have been a staple of urban life at least since the mid-19th century, when the Parisian Henri Murger wrote his novel "Bohemians of the Latin Quarter," which in Puccini's hands became the opera "La Boheme." 
 Lionel Abel exemplified this type; he lived most of his 90 years at an economic and intellectual distance from the mainstream. He died April 19 in New York, the city he had helped establish as the world's capital of art, ideas and argument. 
 Mr. Abel was 57 before he took his first regular job, an English professorship at the State University of New York in Buffalo. "You know what the first thing he bought was?" said Leslie Fiedler, the literary scholar who arranged the hiring in 1967. "Some false teeth. He had needed them for some time."
The sociologist Daniel Bell has placed Mr. Abel among the founding New York Jewish intellectuals of the 20's and 30's. He was one of the last survivors; only the novelist Saul Bellow and the Partisan Review editor William Phillips are left. But Mr. Abel was possibly the rarest bird among them, though others would achieve far greater prominence as academics, political activists, editors and writers. He was a self-educated and largely self-invented polymath, and he came to the city at a time when it was still hospitable to people who lacked money but had ideas, a compulsion to share them and the ability to stay up all night talking. 
Mr. Abel, born Lionel Abelson, was raised in Niagara Falls, N.Y., the son of a rabbi. He was brilliant, said his younger brother, Raziel Abelson, a retired philosophy professor at City College in New York, and finished high school at 13 1/2. He also spent a lot of time shooting pool with people who wound up their evenings at a local brothel, and this, with his indifference to Hebrew, brought conflict with his father. Lionel Abelson left home at 15 and shortened his name, literally erasing his filial status.
After being tossed out of the University of North Carolina for publishing a magazine the administrators found scandalous, he made for New York, arriving in 1929. 
In Washington Square Park he met the glamorous actor Lionel Stander, who took Mr. Abel on a tour of Greenwich Village. They found the poet Maxwell Bodenheim, who told Mr. Abel to move to Isle of Capri. Joe Gould, a man said to have written a great history of modern times, although he had in fact written nothing, warned: "Don't run after Joe Gould. Find out what Joe Gould runs after, and then run after that. But I'm not gonna tell you what it is." 
There were others, all talkers, whatever else they were, and it was enchanting. A year later, Mr. Abel had rented his own place on Charles Street. 
"He and his friends used to go around, cadge money from acquaintances, do odd jobs, live from hand to mouth," Mr. Abelson said of his brother. But there were cheap bars and all-night cafes packed with people talking politics and art -- Hubert's on Grove Street, Romany Marie's on Fourth Street, the Jumble Shop on Eighth Street. Prohibition beer was 25 cents a glass.
"He was like Socrates, always wandering around Greenwich Village, looking for people to have conversations with," Mr. Abelson said. "He talked from day to night."
Mr. Abel became so well known that when Raziel Abelson came to town in the late 1930's and walked into a Village bar asking if anyone knew where Lionel lived, "half the bar stood up and told me." 
Mr. Abel also became a writer and reviewer for the best intellectual journals, as well as a French translator, a playwright who helped establish Off Broadway theater and the author of a standard text on theatrical tragedy. He came to know virtually everyone of distinction in artistic and intellectual life -- novelists, poets, painters, philosophers, art critics.
In Joseph Dorman's 1997 documentary, "Arguing the World," Mr. Abel emerges as a mocking and somewhat arrogant figure. Mr. Abel always liked a good fight -- literally, on occasion: once he was knocked down a flight of stairs by the art critic Clement Greenberg.
As a young man of the left, he attacked those on the right. As he grew older, he moved increasingly rightward and the left became his target.
In 1963, Mr. Abel set off an enormous storm by mounting an attack in Partisan Review on "Eichmann in Jerusalem," Hannah Arendt's book about the trial of the Nazi official responsible for directing the mass murder of European Jewry. He stated that Ms. Arendt's scholarship was dishonest and that underlying her views was an ugly sympathy for the Nazis and a dislike for Jews that was based on finding that "Eichmann is aesthetically palatable while his victims are aesthetically repulsive."
After Mr. Abel's stint in academia, where, Mr. Fiedler said, "He was best for those students who liked to be despised a little by those who taught them," he returned to New York. In his eyes the city had grown dirtier, more expensive, more dangerous and less accommodating to free expression and the life of the mind. Many of those he respected had died or moved away.
But the city's human resources remained unmatched, as he made clear in the closing chapter of his memoir, "The Intellectual Follies." It consists of a letter urging a young man living in California to return to New York. "To what am I asking you to come back?" he wrote. To "the handful of people still in New York who cannot be duplicated in any other of the nation's cities." Come to New York, he insisted, and "prove yourself, and prove likewise that you are worthy to replace some one or other of the interesting and illustrious persons who made this city what it was at its best, and, such is my hope may again be."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Behind The New Gleam In Steel

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
FOR years, steel was not a compelling investment, and for a good reason: the companies did not earn much money. 
 Since 1997 alone, 18 American steel makers have filed for bankruptcy; five have shut down completely. But so far this year, steel stocks have been on a tear. Through Friday, the Standard & Poor's steel index is up by more than 30 percent. 
 Last week, the Bush administration took the first steps toward imposing broad restrictions on imported steel. Michelle Appelbaum, a managing director and steel analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, talked last week about the industry's prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. This is the first time since the early 1980's that stiff barriers on steel imports have been considered. Is the current situation different from 20 years ago?

A. There are a number of differences.
The antidumping suit back in 1981 was filed by Bethlehem Steel, and was not supported by the industry or the Reagan administration. They did it alone. 
Bethlehem won the case, and Reagan's people negotiated what was essentially a quota program. But it was not enforced until the summer of 1986, after LTV filed for Chapter 11. 
Over the last 20 years, there has been a massive downsizing in the industry. Output has shrunk by a third. There are only one-fifth as many workers now as then. 
The biggest difference is that the Bush administration is bringing this action. They are not only going to give some breathing room to the industry, but are showing some interest in negotiating global rationalization in steel-making capacity. That is a sea change.

Q. Is it likely that the administration can prove that foreign companies are dumping steel -- selling it at below domestic market prices?

A. As defined, dumping is very easy to prove. And foreign steel companies use the United States as a pressure valve when their own market drops.
But it cuts both ways. In 1991, steel exports from the United States quintupled. Our economy was slow and foreign economies were doing well. I don't know if that steel was dumped, but because steel is such a high-fixed-cost industry, the incremental production costs of those tons was almost nothing. And you can see where the industry would be inclined to never cut production and ship it out of the home market. The economics of the business are so persuasively supportive of dumping that it is going to happen. 

Q. Is there a need to reduce global capacity?

A. Global capacity has shrunk nominally. There have been some capacity increases outside of Japan, Europe and the United States.
You have to look at the fact that the fundamentals of this business are such that steel either needs to be a state-owned monopoly or there needs to be state intervention into the global management of the business. The best solution is to have fair trade enforced across all nations, and for the global industry to address the capacity issue in much the same manner the aluminum industry did in 1994. 
The aluminum agreement, which Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill was deeply involved in, has made it a very efficient industry, one with no national walls. 
There are more nationalistic barriers with steel, and you would need to have buy-ins with unions and governments. But there is no question steel consumers would support it.

Q. Do you expect steel consumers to fight import quotas when the administration presents its case?

A. Historically, automobile and consumer-goods companies have been noticeably quiet on these protection issues. There are a couple of reasons for that. First, they don't use much foreign steel. Second, they buy on long-term contracts.

Q. If conditions in the industry are so bad, why have the stocks done so well this year?

A. The stocks have done very well, but it is not based on the fundamentals. Money has been coming out of technology and into other sectors. It's like pouring buckets into thimbles. Steel is a very small sector. The combined market capitalization of the 12 steel companies I cover is about $10 billion. They are cheap.

Q. Which steel companies are you particularly enthusiastic about?

A. I am recommending the entire list.
One of my favorites is U.S. Steel. Financially, it is the healthiest company in the group. and they just bought an operation in Eastern Europe that is very profitable and they paid very little money for. And a couple of weeks ago, the parent company said it might split off U.S. Steel from Marathon Oil. It is the easiest stock to own in the group.
National Steel is another good stock. It has the most operating leverage in the industry. And Nucor is a great company.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK NEWSPAPERS; 
Little Scandal, But Lots Of News Of Commerce

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
Queens Business Today, a new weekly newspaper, is short on scandal and long on profiles of bank managers squeezed between reams of advertisements for local businesses. To some, it may be the city's least dynamic read. But its existence is intriguing. Has Queens become such a commercial center that it needs its own business newspaper? 
 Victoria Schneps thinks so. Ms. Schneps owns the Queens Courier, a media company that includes a chain of five local newspapers, a health magazine and a weekly cable television show about Queens. 
 Ms. Schneps said she noticed recently that there were 45,000 businesses, most small, in the borough. Thinking like a businesswoman, she pictured their owners as readers and customers for her advertisers, who fill about 70 percent of the paper's space. She began publication last month with the goal of becoming what she described as "the Crain's New York of Queens," referring to the business newspaper published in Manhattan. Unlike Crain's, Queens Business Today is free.
Does this mean Queens is coming of age as an economic powerhouse? Maybe.
Marie Nahikian, director of the Queens Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit business advocacy group, said Queens has had a 5 percent increase in jobs, income and wages over the last five years, the highest in the city. She added that the borough's 4 percent unemployment rate is its lowest in 15 years.
But some manufacturers are being driven out by rising rents, she said, which may lead to job losses.
Lucy Nunziata of the Queens Chamber of Commerce named a number of thriving commercial strips, like Steinway Street in Astoria and Woodhaven Boulevard in Ozone Park. But Igor Tomic, a professor of economics at St. John's University, pointed to Union Turnpike, a long commercial avenue that struggles to draw customers from the surrounding area. 
Mr. Tomic said merchants on the turnpike near St. John's might benefit from reading a local business newspaper. Few stores there cater to students, he pointed out, even though 2,000 students have been living a block away in new dorms for the past two years.
But is the Queens economy strong enough to float a weekly business newspaper? Peter Constantine, of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state economic agency, thinks so. "You have papers in Queens that cover two square blocks," he said. "There is definitely enough economic activity to warrant a newspaper." JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
Tales of Greed in Post-Soviet Russia

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
MARKETS have short memories, and the mourning of the latest boom-gone-bust is usually brief. In the nearly three years since Russia defaulted on its debt, investors have moved on -- first to the dot-com frenzy in the United States and then to its fizzle. Russia's derring-do tales of billions made and lost, of gun-toting tycoons and panic spreading across the globe have long since slipped from the headlines.
 Yet for much of the 1990's, the buzz surrounding emerging markets was intense, reflecting the fact that history was at a turning point: Russia was being sold off -- a former Communist superpower up for grabs in a way that would have once been inconceivable, especially considering that the country was a lumbering monster dripping with oil, diamonds, foreign money and, last but not least, nuclear weapons. 
 For a peek at what went wrong, it is worth dissecting the interplay among investment opportunities, investors themselves and the framework in which they operated.
In Matthew Brzezinski's "Casino Moscow" (The Free Press, $25), a fast-paced narrative of Russia's dalliance with bare-knuckles capitalism, a range of players stand accused: Boris N. Yeltsin's weak government, the Russian oligarchs who became billionaires on the ruins of Communism, the American and other foreign investors who flocked to Moscow for a slice of the action, and even the Clinton administration and other outside powers for what the writer describes as myopia toward corruption on a huge scale.
The conclusion from this travelogue-cum-primer, due in bookstores in July, is that all share responsibility for the mammoth collapse, but that Russia's own share was the biggest and that President Yeltsin was the biggest culprit of all. Those conclusions emerge late in the book, which may disappoint those who seek a detailed dissection of the era but will entertain readers looking for an anecdotal counterpoint to the ponderous legacy of debt negotiations and political analysis.
The truth, the writer argues, is that no one lost Russia but the Russians. During the 1990's, the West offered Russia the same assistance package received by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Mr. Brzezinski says. But unlike those prospering countries, which have been rewarded with NATO membership, or the thriving Baltic states, which seek admission to the European Union, Russia's post-Communist leaders never wanted to join the Western family of nations.
Russia's freewheeling and corrupt business elite, the West itself and Western financiers all come in for a share of the criticism. Russian businessmen had been only too happy to take the West's money but were not interested in adopting the openness that is essential to join the global business community in earnest. That Wall Street fell for the hundred-billion-dollar trick is a testament to the blinding power of greed.
Given Russia's imperial history, its wounded pride and the ramshackle institutions that collapsed once the central support of the Soviet state fell away, the events of the 1990's perhaps should not have been so surprising. After all, on a much smaller scale in eastern Germany, a post-Communist failure to absorb capitalist pressures had already become clear. 
But readers interested in the details of what went wrong, or a behind-the-scenes saga, would be ill-advised to look for it here. Mr. Brzezinski, a former freelance contributor to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal who went on to join The Journal's staff in Moscow, offers a far more a personal odyssey.
If Mr. Brzezinski's name seems familiar, the reason is that his uncle is Zbigniew, President Jimmy Carter's ferociously anti-Soviet national security adviser, and a scion of a Polish family that implanted a vigorous mistrust of Russia in the author. (The reader learns of this relationship early in the book, finding out that the writer has a Polish eagle tattooed on his chest -- arguably one of those tidbits of information that some might regard as gratuitous.)
What this book does offer, though, is a flavor of the times. Like many memoirs written by journalists when their time is up on a big story, the book is filled with anecdotes -- the personal stories accrued but never published in those impersonal dispatches from the front. But the anecdotes should transcend after-dinner brandy-and-cigars conversation. Some of Mr. Brzezinski's stories originated in conversations at dinner tables in Moscow's upmarket restaurants.
For all that, "Casino Moscow" offers rich pickings -- from the writer's terrifying ordeal at the hands of thieves in Ukraine to a chilling portrait of a Chechen gangster in a Moscow hotel. The gangster bemoans the fact that he needs so many bodyguards -- it seems that they are always bumping into things and getting in the way. Some of the writer's most telling yarns come from his trips outside Moscow, to oil fields of Russia's far east or to the rusting Soviet fleet in Sevastopol.
The story is not told exclusively from a journalist's viewpoint. Early on, Mr. Brzezinski introduces Roberta, his partner, who worked for the World Bank and later for a private investment company itself drawn to the opportunities presented by post-Communist Russia. That provides some entree to the platinum-card world of investment-bank living that contrasts garishly with the cruel deprivations of ordinary Russians outside Moscow, bartering their goods for survival in the dislocations of the national economy.
The bookends of this story are provided by the rise and fall of the political influence of Russia's business czars, the so-called oligarchs, who dominated much of the time that Mr. Brzezinski spent in Ukraine and Russia from 1996 to 1998. Their demise, as Vladimir V. Putin succeeded Mr. Yeltsin, is told in a brief footnote after Mr. Brzezinski's departure.
There is, perhaps, an air of abruptness to the ending of the era or at least to the ending of the expatriate heyday in Moscow, when, as the writer says, more foreigners lived in Moscow than at any other time in its history.
Mr. Brzezinski does not try to offer a road map to the future of Russia -- probably a wise choice, because forecasts would almost certainly founder on Russia's unpredictability. That is arguably the most somber message to emerge from the book.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Richard P. Howard; 
T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
RICHARD P. HOWARD is a risk-averse technophobe, and while his fears might have been a handicap when dot-coms were flying high, they have given him an edge this year.
 "I really don't understand electricity, let alone the Internet," said Mr. Howard, who runs the $1.2 billion T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation fund. "And when I used my value lens on those securities, they just didn't make any sense at all. You get lots of people screaming at you to swing, but you don't have to swing." 
 Mr. Howard says he worries as much about risk as about reward -- the fund is intended not to lose principal in down markets. The last year has given him plenty of opportunities to test that design.
The fund returned 28.3 percent during the 12 months ended Thursday, compared with 0.04 percent for its peers in the domestic hybrid group and a 12.2 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Over the last three years through Thursday, it returned 13.2 percent a year, on average, compared with 5.0 percent for its group and 6.0 percent for the S.& P. 
Mr. Howard, 54, likes to keep at least 65 percent of the fund in United States value stocks and the remainder in convertible securities and bonds. The investment pickings are now slim, he says, so stocks are at 55 percent, convertible securities at 22 percent and bonds at 8 percent. Cash is at 15 percent, compared with only 7.8 percent on June 30 of last year; he has raised the total after a series of market shocks. 
"We've had a boom in the stock market," he said of the bull market of the 1990's. "And I think that we have the risk of a bust in the future."
To reduce risk, he concentrates on value stocks. The price-to-earnings multiple for the portfolio, based on 2001 earnings, averages 12, compared with 22 for the S.& P. 500. The fund's price-to-book ratio is 1.8, versus 4.7 for the index.
"We look for companies that have problems that cause their stock price to fall significantly" -- 5 percent to 50 percent, depending on the company, he said. He uses research to help determine if the price can rebound. 
"We want to understand the business approach," he said, "and how management will overcome the problem that they very well may have inflicted on themselves."
Mr. Howard closely reviews changes in a company's balance sheet over the last quarter and year. "Companies that work off inventory or take high depreciation charges mask improvements in income statements that you can see on balance sheets," he said. 
The energy sector accounts for the biggest chunk of the portfolio, at 15 percent of total assets. "I'm more optimistic than the stock market in terms of energy prices rising," he said, "and the earnings power of companies that can meet the demand."
His bet on energy carries over to bonds, which he is using to build a stake in distressed California utilities. Usually, his bond holdings are plain-vanilla corporate or government agency issues maturing in three to five years, he said. But today, more than 50 percent of the bond portion is made up of Tennessee Valley Authority bonds. Because the bonds do not mature until 2036 and 2045, prices will shoot up if interest rates fall sharply, he said, but a "put feature" on each bond gives him one chance to sell at par if rates rise.
He looks for similar protection in convertible securities -- preferred stocks or bonds that can be converted to common shares at a set price and time. "If stock prices fall, I don't lose much because the converts have a lot of bond value," he said. "If stock prices go up, the converts go up a little, too."
He does not sell often. The fund's turnover averaged a measly 32.4 percent in 2000, compared with 115 percent for all stock funds.
Mr. Howard says he has been buying more shares of USX-Marathon Group, which along with USX-U.S. Steel is part of the USX holding company. The oil and steel units will be formally split by year-end, he said, which should lead to an increase in the value of the oil company. It now trades at $31.97; he first bought it at $23.50 in May 2000. 
The company "has fairly leveraged exposure to the production of natural gas in the U.S. and oil and gas worldwide," he said. 
"You also get a fairly significant amount of refining capacity," he added, "so that if the economy improves, the company should be a major beneficiary." It is also a potential acquisition target, he said.
Another favorite is Fortune Brands, the consumer products company based in Lincolnshire, Ill. Its home improvement and office products units have been hurt by the economic slowdown, he said, while its golf business, which includes Titleist, has been battered by competition, mostly from Nike. Over all, Fortune Brands sells for 14 times 2001 earnings, just over half the market multiple. While it has an unusual mix of businesses, he said, "you don't get to buy a company so cheap without doing something a little offbeat," he said.
The company's spirits business, which includes Jim Beam bourbon, Gilbey's gin and DeKuyper cordials, is growing moderately but consistently, he added. "I think people will be drinking Jim Beam 50 years from now, and I'm pretty sure people won't be using Cisco products that long," he said.
He bought shares in April 2000 at $27.50; they now trade at $35.18.
On May 23, Mr. Howard bought more convertible securities of the Teck Corporation, a mining company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The convertibles, with a 3.75 percent coupon due July 2006, have a yield to maturity of about 8 percent. Teck mines gold, silver and other metals; it is scheduled to open a big copper mine in Peru this summer, he said. It also operates a lead and zinc smelter in British Columbia, powered by its own hydroelectric dam. Management will shut down the smelter from August through September and sell the electricity to California. "They're going to make a pile of money," Mr. Howard said.
He bought the convertibles at $820; they traded at $825 as of Thursday.

HEADLINE: China Viewed Narrowly 

 BODY:
Though the Bush administration has yet to articulate a fully formed China policy, there are unsettling indications that it may be inclined to see China primarily as an emerging military threat. The United States cannot ignore the possibility that China will grow into a global military power in the decades ahead, but Washington's handling of Beijing ought not to exaggerate the threat. 
 China's armed forces are large but poorly trained and equipped. They have begun modernizing, but pose no real military threat to the United States and will not for many years to come. Some Chinese military leaders speak wishfully of making inroads on America's long uncontested naval dominance of the Western Pacific. Yet Beijing's modest naval forces lack the means for any serious challenge. The more complex problem is finding ways to encourage China to use its growing regional power in peaceful and constructive directions. 
 Fashioning a realistic China policy will require a balanced approach to trade, diplomacy and geopolitics. Military concerns are part of the mix but should not be allowed to drive the larger relationship. President Bush must not let Pentagon concerns about China distort his approach to Beijing. Unfortunately, at this point the administration still lacks an authoritative voice on China in its highest policy-making councils to keep these issues in perspective.
China has been steadily increasing its military budget for most of the past decade. It now spends about $40 billion a year, roughly the same as Japan and less than 15 percent of what Washington spends. Most of China's increased spending has been used to improve the living standards of its soldiers, not to acquire advanced weaponry. China has no real capacity to produce modern weapons on its own and must buy what it needs from Russia and other foreign suppliers. It has obtained some late-model destroyers and jet fighters, but lacks the aircraft carriers and in-flight refueling tankers it would need to deliver substantial forces beyond its borders. 
With two and a half million active-duty troops, China has the world's largest standing army. But it is primarily a land power. Any potential Chinese military challenge would come at sea, where the United States Navy, with its dominance in advanced destroyers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines, would have a decided advantage.
It is not Mr. Bush's fault that the April collision of an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet brought early attention to military aspects of the relationship. Beijing's bellicose handling of that incident aroused nationalist emotions on both sides of the Pacific. But in the weeks since the plane crew's release, the administration has done little to get the relationship back on course. 
In his speech on missile defenses last month, Mr. Bush spoke of reaching out to both Russia and China. Yet while he elaborated on his desire to build a constructive new relationship with Russia, he held out no such prospects to China. Washington reinforced this message when the high-level emissaries it sent to consult with Asian leaders on American missile defense plans conspicuously omitted Beijing from their itinerary. A lower-level delegation visited Beijing. China has legitimate concerns that its relatively small nuclear missile force could be blunted by an American shield. Then came word that a major Pentagon review of America's global military strategy would recommend a major shift of planning and resources to the Pacific to counter rising Chinese military power. Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has sharply curtailed contacts between American and Chinese military officials, depriving both countries of a useful tool for better mutual understanding.
There is no question that China has become more assertive in its pursuit of regional goals like unification with Taiwan and control of offshore waters and mineral rights in the South China Sea. In addition, Beijing is now less concerned about aligning itself with Washington than it was during the cold-war era, when both nations worried about containing Soviet ambitions in Asia. This newly nationalist tone has led to occasional frictions with the United States and will again. But the problems can be more easily overcome if Washington continues the policy of active engagement with China on economic and arms control issues pursued by the past six administrations. If Mr. Bush hopes to build the "productive relationship" that he spoke of after the 24 American crew members were returned in April, he will have to keep military issues from disproportionately influencing dealings with Beijing.

Arafat Is the Leader, But Who's In Charge?

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
ISRAEL'S prime minister, Ariel Sharon, makes it sound simple: If Yasir Arafat wants peace, he must halt the suicide bombings and other acts of terror and he must do it by arresting the several dozen Islamic militants on a list Israel has handed him.
 But, as always in the long Israeli-Palestinian struggle, the reality is much murkier. 
 As American and European envoys struggled feverishly last week to hold together an exceedingly shaky, bullet-punctuated cease-fire, Israeli officials publicly focused their ire on Mr. Arafat as a kind of supreme puppet-master. They did it to such an extent that it spurred speculation they had run out of patience and might somehow try to oust him. 
"It has been proven categorically that Arafat controls what goes on in the field," said Maj. Gen. Amos Malka, the chief of military intelligence. Reuven Rivlin, the communications minister whose thinking is close to Mr. Sharon's, added bluntly: "Arafat is the brunt of the problem."
But others, including some in Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence service, paint a more complex picture of political infighting among the Palestinians . In the end, these analysts say, Mr. Arafat and the Islamic fundamentalists in Hamas and Islamic Jihad have starkly opposing, irreconcilable goals: Mr. Arafat, having achieved international recognition as the Palestinians' leader on the basis of the Oslo peace accords, wants to salvage what he can from the faltering agreement; the Islamicists want to wreck it.
"The basic relationship is one of rivalry," said Rashid Khalidi, a University of Chicago professor. "It's a competition for power and support, for who can appeal to the vast Palestinian middle. These are people who are not in the same ballpark as far as their objectives. They're like oil and water, it's a basic polarity."
At the moment, the Islamic forces are in the ascendancy, for several reasons. The eight-month-old second intifada, in which more than 484 Arabs and 108 Israelis have died, is directed not only at the Israelis and the frustrated hopes raised by the Oslo accords, but also, to a large extent, at Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Many in the West Bank and Gaza Strip see the authority as corrupt, high handed and dominated by cronies Mr. Arafat brought back with him from exile in Tunis.
Palestinian anger and bitterness has been fed by the draconian measures with which Israel has tried to suppress the uprising, including the use of snipers and targeted assassinations. A virtual state of siege has crippled what little is left of the Palestinian economy. Palestinian stone throwing demonstrations have turned into low-level guerrilla warfare, with roadside ambushes and bombs; Israel has responded with tanks, helicopter gunships and even an F-16 air raid. 
Feelings have now hardened on both sides: After Hamas conducted a suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv nightclub, killing 20 teenage Russian immigrants, there were cries for "blood" and "war" even from Israelis who had voted for the dovish parties of the left. Many had come to doubt that Mr. Arafat ever intended to make a real peace. And a recent poll by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion showed that 75 percent of Palestinians supported armed revolt, including suicide bombings, and 80 percent thought Israel was not serious about seeking a halt to the violence. Similar polls showed drops in Mr. Arafat's already low approval rating.
With his people feeling that way, it appears politically impossible for Mr. Arafat to arrest the militants; he would be seen as a lackey doing Israel's work.
It was not always so. Dr. Khaladi, the descendant of a distinguished family of Jerusalem intellectuals who has long studied the Palestinian movement, noted that during the first years of the Oslo agreement, Hamas tried hard to disrupt the peace process but in the prevailing optimism found little support and abandoned the effort. After a resumed wave of bombing in early 1996, Mr. Arafat's security services began hounding the Islamic forces and continued until last summer, when about 300 Hamas and Jihad members were in jail. Human rights groups say about 20 Islamic fundamentalists died under torture in Palestinian prisons. 
But when the intifada started last fall, the 300 prisoners were released. It is members of this group that Israel is now demanding be re-arrested. 
The current public mood is one of frustration and rage, however, and when Mr. Arafat's police tried to arrest a militant in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp two months ago, they were met with an open revolt.
One of the more curious aspects of the tit-for-tat violence is that Israel's response has largely been directed at the Palestinian Authority's security units, rather than at the Islamicists themselves. It has hit, for example, the headquarters of a police force in Nablus much disliked for reining in demonstrations. The two heads of Mr. Arafat's preventive security forces who had been most effective in cracking down on militants in the past, Mohammed Dahlan in Gaza and Jibril Rajoub in the West Bank, are said to fear they are targets of assassination after having come under Israeli gunfire.
On the other hand, both Israelis and Palestinians are looking over their shoulders at the court of international opinion. Mr. Sharon declared his cease-fire late last month after his F-16 attack was followed by urgent calls from the United States to reduce the violence. Mr. Arafat's cease-fire declaration was virtually dictated to him after the Tel Aviv bombing by Terje Rod-Larsen, the United Nations envoy, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fisher. But the Palestinians are less a tight command structure than a hodgepodge of forces. And even though the level of violence did fall markedly during the week, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas spiritual leader, immediately announced: "The resistance will continue. Whatever agreements Arafat makes are not binding on us." Islamic Jihad added: "The martyrdom seekers will continue their missions."
The Israeli army has let it be known that it is readying a massive response, or as Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezar put it, "fingers are ready on the trigger." The leading newspaper Ha'aretz reported last week that the bombing had interrupted plans for a large operation to "stamp out terror" by invading the Palestinian-controlled areas to remove "suspects and heads of hostile extremist organizations," destroy some Palestinian Authority buildings and seize weapons.
All of which leaves the initiative in the hands of the next, inevitable, suicide bomber.

A Case of Radical Surgery on Failing Schools

BYLINE:  By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
Inner-city schools have grown dramatically worse in the four decades since the economist Milton Friedman first argued for permitting children to transfer from failing public schools to successful private schools, taking public dollars with them. Critics protested that a voucher plan would bleed dollars from an under-funded system. But the Friedmanites have continued to argue for permitting children to escape failing schools while they are young enough to be saved, leaving the schools that failed them to shape up or close.
 The argument for preserving the public-school monopoly carried weight in the minority community when inner-city schools were frayed at the edges but still meeting the needs of their students. But the argument has lost public support in educational dead zones where graduation rates sometimes linger in the single digits. This loss of confidence is vividly evident in Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Ridge has advocated using vouchers in a number of troubled districts. As a form of compromise, the Legislature passed a law ceding the state sweeping new powers to take over and refashion entire districts where more than half of the children fail state math and reading tests. 
 The law could eventually be used against a dozen districts, including Philadelphia, one of the largest urban systems in the country. But the initiative was primarily aimed at the neighboring city of Chester, an educational eyesore of 20 years' standing that is widely recognized as one of the country's worst. The district has performed so poorly for so long that the state has considered actually dissolving it and dispersing its children into surrounding districts.
The state-appointed panel that runs the Chester Upland school district has taken the unusual step of hiring three for-profit companies -- Edison, Mosaica and LearnNow -- to run not just a few schools, but the entire district, with the exception of three existing charter schools. The privatizers have generated a mix of hope and suspicion among residents who are accustomed to failure and false promises. In addition, the politics of failure that have dominated the city for decades have already thrown the privatizers some nasty curve balls.
For the past several school years, the Chester Upland district has been the lowest-performing school district in the state. The most recent statistics show that nearly 70 percent of the city's children failed math and reading tests, but in some neighborhoods the failure rate is substantially higher. The dropout rate is more than four times that of the state. Only about 40 percent of Chester High School's students go on to college -- the lowest figure in the county. Nearby districts like Rose Tree Media, Wallingford-Swarthmore and Marple Newtown have college rates between 80 and 90 percent. 
As a Republican governor with both houses of the State Legislature in Republican control, Governor Ridge came to office counting on a full range of methods to use in school reform, up to and including vouchers. His first voucher proposal failed, as did his second and third. Members of the Ridge camp were stoic at first. But as the years rolled on, they began to criticize fellow Republicans who refused to extend their free-market philosophies to the education field. As one state official said earlier this month, "The unpleasant secret is that some in our party oppose vouchers because they don't want poor children from the inner city coming into their neighborhoods to go to school." 
Edison and LearnNow decided to merge after the Chester deal was struck. They and Mosaica are hoping to boost their business fortunes by succeeding where the public system has failed.
The privatizers typically interview the teachers at the schools they take over, keeping those who fit their profiles and encouraging the others to move on. Edison, Mosaica and LearnNow naturally assumed that the Chester project would work this way as well. The companies say they had already committed to Chester when they were told they would have to hire the union teachers who already worked in the schools. 
It is unclear how much flexibility the teachers' union will provide. But one privatizer said that the task of evaluating the teachers and getting rid of the unsuitable ones would probably result in "a house-to-house fight."
The state plans to hold the companies to strict performance targets, and has warned them that failing to meet those targets is a fireable offense. But with the takeover scheduled to begin in September, the companies are just beginning to comprehend a school district budget that has historically been the main source of patronage in the city. As one manager said: "We still do not know where the bottom is. . . . There are leeches all over Chester's schools. When you pull back the patient's clothes, you see that those leeches have burrowed deeply into the body."
The privatizers are eager to show Wall Street that they can make money by improving Chester's spectacularly dismal schools. But they have already seen that this is no walk in the park. In addition, if Chester thwarts them, a Legislature that has rejected the voucher route may well be inclined to reconsider.

A Week of Puzzles but Few Answers

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Uncertainty was the theme on Wall Street last week. With a paucity of economic news and major company announcements, investors had few tea leaves to read. 
 The biggest news came from the technology bellwether Intel, which said sales this quarter would be within expectations, though on the low end. National Semiconductor also issued an earnings warning, saying it would post a bigger-than-expected loss, but predicted that results would soon turn around. The two reports touched off a rally in technology stocks, with investors interpreting them as signs that the worst was over. 
 Among the three major indexes, the technology-heavy Nasdaq fared best, rising to 2,215.10, up 65.66 points, or 3.1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also ended higher, at 1,264.96, up 4.29 points, or 0.3 percent. Only the Dow industrials slipped, weakened by a big jury award against Philip Morris. It finished at 10,977.00, off 13.41 points, or 0.1 percent. 
 Bonds rallied early in the week on comments by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that inflation was not a threat. But jitters about the economy caused a sell-off at week's end. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained unchanged from the previous week, at 5.36 percent. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

Empire-Building On a Paper Route

BYLINE:  By ROBERT ROSS; Written with Judy Tong.; Robert Ross, who is 82 and lives in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., made his fortune in the 1970's by trading commodities like grain and petroleum with the Soviet Union. He founded the Ross University School of Medicine on Dominica in the Caribbean and the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine on St. Kitts. He sold the schools this year for $135 million. The chief buyer was Leeds Weld & Company, a private equity firm in New York.

 BODY:
WHEN you grow up in harsh economic times, as I did during the Depression, there may be a special incentive to get ahead. My father died when I was 8. 
I lived with my mother and my four sisters in Detroit. I was the baby. As we grew older, my sisters and I all contributed to the upkeep of the house. 
 I was always ambitious. At 13, I had a paper route that included some large apartment buildings. I got up at 4 a.m. to deliver 200 copies of The Detroit Free Press, the morning paper. But I wasn't satisfied with a small paper route. I wanted a huge paper route. So after school I delivered 200 copies of the afternoon paper, The Detroit News, to the same apartment buildings. I rarely missed a day. 
 Because I had built one of the biggest routes in Detroit, I won a prize from The News in 1933 to go to the Polo Grounds in New York to watch the Giants play the Washington Senators in the World Series. I was 15 and I was earning $100 a week.
 Entrepreneurship is something you are born with. I had it. What is an entrepreneur? One who takes great risks. In many cases you are not successful, but you have to be tenacious. If you are not, and don't follow through, you'll be a failure.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 17, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, the My First Job article last Sunday, in which Robert Ross, the founder of the Ross University School of Medicine on Dominica, described his boyhood work delivering newspapers, carried an erroneous credit for the writer who worked with him on the article. She was Jenny Holland, not Judy Tong.

It's Not Just the Job; It's the Hours on the Job

 BODY:
So you think you have a long workweek? Don't let the average worker from South Korea hear you complain, or people in Turkey or Argentina, for that matter.
 On average, South Koreans put in 55.1 hours a week, which is more than workers from 31 other countries surveyed by Roper Starch Worldwide in New York. 
The survey, whose results were released last week, questioned 1,000 workers in each country. 
 Just behind the Koreans in hours worked were the Turks, at 54.1 a week, followed by the Argentines, at 53.5, and the Taiwanese, 53.4.
Workers in the United States, where economic growth has slowed, and in China put in the same amount of time on the job -- 42.4 hours, below the global average of 44.6.
Who works the least amount of hours each week? According to the study, it is the French, who average 40.3 hours and the Italians, at 40.5. 
France cut its workweek to 35 hours from 39 hours about a year ago to tackle high unemployment levels and bolster the economy. In other industrialized countries, "we're beginning to see greater emphasis on balancing work and leisure," said Tom Miller, group senior vice president of Roper.

HEADLINE: A Holy Place in China Fights for Its Life, Body and Soul 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: YUBENG, China 

 BODY:
The 133 residents of this remote mountain hamlet know they live almost in paradise. 
 In the spring the old-growth forest, one of China's last bits of raw nature, twinkles with the pink rhododendrons that grow in astounding profusion -- one of many reasons why biologists call the area a "hot spot" of biodiversity. 
 In the fall, flaming maples and oaks illuminate the spruce, fir and pine. Bears, monkeys and the occasional snow leopard roam these mountains; golden eagles cruise the valleys while giant squadrons of green parakeets hunt for pine nuts. 
The villagers, ethnic Tibetans in a stronghold of traditional culture, take spiritual as well as aesthetic comfort from the landscape. Commanding the valley and protecting the village is 22,107-foot Kawagebo, the second-holiest mountain in Tibetan Buddhism, which tens of thousands of pilgrims circle each year. 
The hillsides abound with sacred forests, a sacred waterfall and other holy sites that are marked by gaily flapping prayer flags -- places where the faithful can deposit their worries or seek good fortune. 
"My spirit and soul are here," said Aqianbu, a 30-year-old Yubeng man, as he watched horses placidly grazing in the village meadow, against the unreal backdrop of glacier-draped pinnacles. "We worship the nature around us." 
But if this is almost paradise, that "almost" contains a world of sorrows the people of Yubeng could do without. 
Mr. Aqianbu matter-of-factly gave an example. He, his younger brother and the wife they share, in the polyandrous triangle common to the region, have watched three of their four babies die -- a result of the near-total lack of modern medicine, the poor sanitation and nutrition and, ultimately, the poverty and isolation of a village that is an arduous six-hour hike from the nearest dirt road. 
They are proud of their surviving daughter, but they are not happy that to attend school beyond the third grade she must make that same hike over a high mountain pass, then stay at school for two weeks at a time, paying dormitory fees that are a terrible strain. 
Today, the Yunnan provincial government is aggressively promoting tourism and other development, in part to replace the huge revenues lost when logging -- the former mainstay of counties surrounding Yubeng wherever roads had made it feasible -- was banned in 1998 to protect watersheds. 
Now the people of the region, especially in more pristine places like Yubeng, are facing a challenge that many other parts of China have already failed: finding a way to prosper, while preserving their unique environment. 
To solve this problem, the people of Yubeng are engaged in an unusual dialogue about their future -- part of a collaboration between the Yunnan government and the United States-based Nature Conservancy, one of the largest private international conservation groups. 
"The goal of the Nature Conservancy is to protect biodiversity," said Rose Niu, a 39-year-old member of Yunnan's Naxi minority group who has a master's degree in resource management and directs the conservancy's China project. 
"But here, it's very clear that you can't protect nature unless you work together with local communities and preserve the culture too," she said. "We especially need to promote the traditions calling for harmony with nature." 
In this ethnic Tibetan zone of northwest Yunnan, some families and temples keep discreet pictures of the Dalai Lama and the exiled leader is revered, but the political atmosphere is less tense than in parts of Tibet proper. And the Yunnan government has supported the rebuilding of temples and the controlled promotion of Tibetan culture, if nothing else as a way to draw tourists.
Ms. Niu is not Tibetan, but from the ancient Naxi town of Lijiang, a World Heritage Site to the south, which the conservancy is also working to preserve. 
Lijiang's old quarter, she noted, remains quaint but is already overrun with tourists and now has crime and prostitution. 
"In China I don't know of any place that is a good example of eco-tourism," said Ms. Niu. Especially since the logging ban, many counties in northern Yunnan are desperate for quick money, she said, but she hopes the region can pursue "a long-term, sustainable kind of tourism."
Two refugees from Washington politics are also living in Yunnan and advising the project on behalf of the Nature Conservancy. Ed Norton, a lawyer, was a leading environmental advocate and his wife, Ann McBride, was president of Common Cause, the campaign-reform lobby, before the two became entranced by the possibilities and moved here in 1999. 
Their endeavor is called the Yunnan Great Rivers Project, reflecting yet another spectacular trait of the West Virginia-size region it covers. The upper reaches of four of Asia's mightiest rivers -- the Yangtze, the Mekong, the Salween and the Irrawaddy -- flow in parallel within a band of 55 miles, separated by high mountain ridges, 
The drastic elevation changes, the rainy summers and the region's latitude -- at the transition from temperate to subtropical -- fostered an explosion in biodiversity: northern Yunnan is home to 10,000 plant species, including 162 species of rhododendron and 120 species of primrose.
The region is a prime source for Asian medical herbs and for matsutake and morel mushrooms, which are picked by villagers for export, offering badly needed cash income to supplement their subsistence farming and possibilities for sustainable enterprises in the future. 
"It's unbelievable," said Bob Mosely, a botanist from Idaho who is helping with research and strategy in the Yubeng area, part of the range known in Chinese as Meili Snow Mountain. "You turn a corner, and you see three or four different species of plants."
Mr. Mosely is working with local experts to map the "sacred geography" of the area, the zones that are largely protected from cutting and hunting already because of animist beliefs, as an aid to demarcating future reserves. 
The cutting of trees for home heating and cooking, as well as home construction, is a growing threat to the region's forests and must be confronted soon, said Mr. Norton, who also noted that longtime supposed nature reserves were inhabited and heavily exploited. 
The local government is experimenting with biogas, using animal and human waste to create cooking fuel, and in Yubeng there is talk of expanding the current mini-hydro plant, which now generates just enough electricity to light a few 15-watt bulbs in each home. 
"We have to find a way to hook the villagers into the stream of benefits," Mr. Norton said as he hiked the rugged trail to Yubeng. "How can they, and not outsiders, capture most of the revenue?" 
Still-remote places like Yubeng are ideally situated for small-scale eco-tourism, Ms. McBride said, attracting visitors who want to hike and explore both nature and Tibetan culture. "Villagers need to gain the skills to guide visitors and teach them about the environment and the religion," she said. 
Even before the current aid project started, Mr. Aqianbu, the village man, had a similar vision, borrowing money from relatives two years ago to build a small trekker's lodge. But so far, he says, he barely gets by -- unable to save enough to pour cement on the dirt floor or even to build the latrine that is essential if a surge in visitors is not to pollute the sacred land. 
"I have many dreams but I don't have the means to realize them," Mr. Aqianbu said, explaining why he and fellow residents of Yubeng desperately want the road that has been proposed in regional plans, but that some experts say may never be economically feasible. 
Life in Yubeng is not so bad for the people, said Amu, 41, one of two appointed village chiefs, "but it's hard for the cattle, which can't find enough grass to eat." 
"I would never leave this place," he said. "I love the environment, and Kawagebo peak protects us." 
Mr. Amu noted, however, that Yubeng and neighboring villages had already clashed over rights to collect wood and mushrooms, that the valuable mushrooms were getting harder to find and that bears and deer stole a good share of the corn crop. 
Mr. Amu declined to count how many children have died in Yubeng, only saying "there have been many." When people get sick, he said, they usually "let it go the natural way," though in some cases -- if they can borrow enough from fellow villagers to pay the high fees -- relatives may carry patients to the hospital in the county seat of Deqin, a dawn-to-darkness ordeal over two high ridges. 
"Of course, all of us are looking forward to a better life," he said. "We need a road most of all, and we need a bigger hydropower station to give us steady electricity for cooking."
"We see tourism as our best hope," Mr. Amu said. "We welcome more tourists here, but those that bring destruction will not be allowed."

HEADLINE: As Biotech Crops Multiply, Consumers Get Little Choice 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 9 

 BODY:
Despite persistent concerns about genetically modified crops, they are spreading so rapidly that it has become almost impossible for consumers to avoid them, agriculture experts say.
 More than 100 million acres of the world's most fertile farmland were planted with genetically modified crops last year, about 25 times as much as just four years earlier. Wind-blown pollen, commingled seeds and black-market plantings have further extended these products of biotechnology into the far corners of the global food supply -- perhaps irreversibly, according to food experts. 
 "The genie is already out of the bottle," said Neil E. Harl, a professor of agriculture and economics at Iowa State University, speaking of genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.'s. "If the policy tomorrow was that we were going to eradicate G.M.O.'s, this would be a very long process. It would take years if not decades to do that." 
Most of the biotech fields are soybeans and corn planted in North and South America, the biggest food exporters. But biotech crops -- genetically altered to do things like release their own insecticide or withstand the spraying of weed-killing chemicals -- are being shipped or experimented with in many other countries, including China, India, Australia and South Africa. 
They are even turning up where people least expect them: in countries where they are banned but a black market has developed; in food supplies where they are forbidden or shunned, like organic products; even in fields that farmers believe are completely free of genetically modified crops. 
The rapid adoption and proliferation means that even as scientists and others debate the safety of altering foods' genetic codes to produce cheaper and bigger supplies, a large share of the world's population has little or no choice but to consume genetically modified crops. 
One indication came last year when Starlink, a variety of genetically modified corn not approved for human consumption, accidentally entered the global food supply, leading to extensive food recalls in the United States and Japan over fears it could cause allergic reactions. 
Starlink has not been shown to be harmful; indeed, there is little evidence that biotech foods are dangerous to humans. But the episode showed that seeds planted on less than 1 percent of America's corn acreage could easily spread from farm to farm, contaminate the nation's grain handling system and seep into global food supplies.
Seed companies, farmers, processors and food makers have spent more than $1 billion in the last six months trying to eradicate Starlink. But most experts agree that will take years. 
In the meantime, experts say the spread of biotech crops creates an entirely new set of trade, regulatory and legal problems: 
* Large countries with policies limiting the use of genetically modified crops may soon have to change course, because they will not be able to get enough nonbiotech crops to meet their import needs. 
* Regulators are under pressure to develop new standards to determine what is and is not genetically modified -- a situation complicated, as the Starlink episode demonstrated, by the commingling and cross-pollination of different crops. 
* Big food and agriculture companies are facing legal and public relations challenges, because some farmers and consumers believe their products have been contaminated.
Gene-altered crops are already ubiquitous in the United States, where the Food and Drug Administration has deemed them "entirely safe." But Europe and parts of Asia remain wary of the crops, and there have been moves in those regions to halt or slow their import. 
Skeptics say that tampering with nature could inadvertently alter species, harm wildlife and give rise to new problems, like herbicide-resistant "superweeds." They also worry about the long-term health consequences of eating foods that are armed with insecticides and foreign genes. And the critics suspect that the industry has intentionally flooded the world market with genetically altered seeds to pre-emptively settle the question of whether or not to adopt biotechnology 
Opponents expected Starlink to be a turning point in the fight against genetically altered crops. But while the episode helped stall the advance of genetically modified wheat, potatoes and sugar, it seems to have served as proof, over all, of biotech's inexorable spread. Most food makers in the United States continue to use biotech crops, insisting they are safe and far too pervasive to avoid; meanwhile, relatively few American consumers seem to care. 
Perhaps more important, the bulk of American grain sold for domestic and international use goes into animal feed, and thus far few farmers or big companies have opposed feeding biotech grain to livestock. 
Indeed, biotech industry officials believe the game is nearly won. The United States, Brazil and Argentina account for about 90 percent of the world's corn and soybean exports. Bulk shipments from the United States and Argentina are predominantly biotech. And Brazil is widely believed to have a black market in biotech soybeans. 
If Brazil legalizes biotech production, Europe and Asia -- the world's two biggest purchasers of soy -- would have almost nowhere to turn for adequate supplies of nonbiotech soybeans. Environmentalists in Brazil have protested biotechnology, and though the government there is split, industry officials in the United States say that Brazil is leaning toward allowing the use of genetically modified seeds.
"We are very hopeful that last domino will fall," said Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association, a trade group that supports the use of gene-altered crops. "That's why the environmentalists are putting up a stink down there in Brazil. They know if that goes, it's all gone." 
That would be a huge victory for biotechnology companies. Monsanto, Aventis, Syngenta and others have spent billions of dollars to create the crops, and some independent groups, including the United Nations, promote them as one answer to world health and hunger problems.
Andrew Cash, an analyst who follows the biotechnology industry at UBS Warburg, says that Europe already has little choice but to accept the crops, largely because Monsanto's Roundup Ready Soybeans, the primary biotech variety, are so widespread. 
"Europe is learning its first lesson in the 'beggars can't be choosers' world of agricultural reality -- it's G.M.O. beans or no beans," Mr. Cash wrote last January. 
Food companies are already having a hard time obtaining nongenetically modified crops. Grain handlers like Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill are charging extra to segregate and test crops to certify that they are nonbiotech. 
And that is becoming harder to do. Some agriculture experts say that cross-pollination of biotech corn and seed corn, as well as poor and imperfect grain-handling practices, have thoroughly scrambled crops in a global food chain that for decades shipped bulk supplies of largely undifferentiated products. 
Food makers around the world are finding traces of gene-altered crops in foods that were not supposed to be made with them; Midwestern farmers are complaining that wind is blowing pollen from gene-altered crops into neighboring fields planted with conventional corn. 
Even organic crops labeled "G.M. Free" are testing positive for genetic modification. Organic growers are now considering a class-action lawsuit against the biotech industry that would seek damages for the contamination.
"We have found traces in corn that has been grown organically for 10 to 15 years," said Arran Stephens, president of Nature's Path Foods, an organic producer of breads and cereals based in Delta, British Columbia. "There's no wall high enough to keep that stuff contained."
Some critics of biotechnology see a sinister plot at work, with the industry ignoring the implications of widespread pollen flow and perhaps even encouraging a black market in biotech crops. 
"They're hoping there's enough contamination so that it's a fait accompli," said Jeremy Rifkin, a longtime critic of biotechnology.
"But the liability will kill them," he said. "We're going to see lawsuits across the Farm Belt as conventional farmers and organic farmers find their product is contaminated." 
The world's biggest biotech seed companies acknowledge that some pollen may go astray. And they acknowledge that they cannot guarantee that even the conventional seed they sell is 100 percent free of genetic modification.
Agriculture, they say, is prone to mishaps. 
"By and large, where there are crops grown, and where G.M. materials are approved, the issue is with us," said Dean Oestreich, a vice president at Pioneer Hi-Bred, the world's largest seed company. "Our basic seed stocks are pure. But there's always adventitious presence, which means small amounts of unintentional presence through pollen flow and physical mixing." 
Because of all this commingling, the companies are calling on regulators in many countries to relax tolerance standards for crops, to avoid trade, labeling and legal problems.
Zero tolerance, said Jeanne Romero-Severson, a professor of agriculture at Purdue University, is simply not realistic.
"If your standard is 100 percent pure," she said, "you better stop eating right now."

HEADLINE: Jitters Over the Economy Guarantee a Long Run for the Budget Late Show 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 9 

 BODY:
Most years the battle over the state budget is long and ugly, but when Gov. George E. Pataki raised the possibility of a three-month emergency spending bill earlier this week, he signaled that the impasse this year is worse than most.
 Such a bill would have probably put off action on a new spending plan until September, later than any budget has ever been passed. The Democrats who control the Assembly rejected the idea immediately. 
 On the surface, this year's impasse seems to be about partisan politics. The governor, a Republican, accuses the Assembly Democrats of proposing irresponsible spending increases. The Democrats accuse the governor of trying to horde money to spend on popular programs during the election year. For the 17th year in a row, the Legislature missed the April 1 deadline and no progress had been made since then. 
Behind the political barbs flying between Mr. Pataki and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, there is genuine disagreement about the economy's future health. The main reason this budget may well not be passed until September is that it may take that long to see if the economy, and thus tax revenues, will rebound in the second half of the year.
"This whole budget debate is coming down to a single question: tolerance for risk," said Abraham M. Lackman, the budget director for the Republican Senate majority. "The governor has a low tolerance. Shelly Silver has a higher tolerance."
All sides agree that for the past eight years, the country and state have seen phenomenal economic growth and soaring tax revenues, much of it flowing from the millions made on Wall Street. Everyone also agrees the national economy hit a slowdown in late 2000 and has been sinking ever since. 
What the economists advising the governor and legislative leaders disagree on is, what happens next. Some economists predict the economy will rebound quickly in the second and third quarters, bouncing like a superball in the shape of a "V." Others predict a slower, longer recovery, shaped like a "U." Then there are economists who think the economy will bottom out and stay there, like an "L." Both Mr. Silver's advisers and Mr. Pataki's analysts are among the optimists. Both camps assume that there will be a V-shaped recovery this year, and that the national economy will grow about 2 percent. But they disagree on what that means for state tax revenues, which make up about half of the budget.
Republicans who control the Senate were initially more optimistic than the governor, proposing spending of at least $1 billion more than the governor. But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has recently said his conference may have to reduce its revenue estimate, bringing it closer to the governor's position in light of the faltering economy. 
The governor's aides point out that taxes on Wall Street profits and bonuses make up a much greater part of the state's revenues than they used to, accounting for at least a quarter of income taxes. They also note that the Nasdaq is down 60 percent from last year, which they say will take perhaps as much as $2 billion out of capital gains revenue.
They also worry that the deflating market will severely crimp the bonuses Wall Street executives get this year. Lower corporate taxes are also expected, since it is widely acknowledged that the manufacturing sector is in recession. To make matters worse, the Pataki administration has $1.8 billion in tax cuts passed in previous years that take effect this year.
The governor's aides calculate that if capital gains drop 10 to 15 percent and bonuses are down by 10 percent, the state's revenues will not grow beyond the $42 billion collected in the last fiscal year, even if the economy does grow by 2 percent. 
"To me, flat's starting to look good," one senior Pataki economist said. "It seems to us it's very conceivable that a flat revenue forecast for the year makes sense." 
The Democratic analysts, who do not believe tax revenues linked to Wall Street will be as depressed as Republicans do, are more optimistic. They project state revenues will grow by about 3.9 percent, or $1.4 billion, even if the economy lumbers along at about 2 percent. Not that that would be good, they say. It would still be far below the 10 percent growth in revenues last year.
The Democrats' analysts point out that the governor has underestimated personal income taxes every year for seven years. This spring, they say, at least $1.9 billion more came in than the governor predicted. Most of that flowed from bonuses paid to Wall Street executives.
The Assembly's economists are predicting that much of that $1.9 billion will come in again next year. The governor's aides regard it as a one-time windfall because the stock market has cooled off. Therein lies the rub. No one will know for sure who is right until next February. 
But there will be some earlier signs. In July and September, people who do not make most of their income from salaries, like entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, have to give the state an estimate of what their annual taxes will be. In the past five years, revenues from people who pay estimated taxes have risen 14 to 18 percent every year.
The question is how much they will rise this year. Both sides are waiting for those signals.
One problem for forecasters is guessing how much capital gains there will be. Last year, state residents reported about $60 billion, which meant about $4 billion in income taxes for the state. But it is hard to know in this year's bear market when the stocks being sold off today were bought. If they were bought in the past nine months, there would be few profits and thus little in income tax collected. But if they are stocks that have been held for more than five years, investors unloading them still may profit handsomely and would have to pay tax. 
The governor cannot afford to roll the dice. If his budget office's prediction of flat revenue growth is right, he will have to use some reserves just to finance the 3.2 percent increase in state spending he proposed in January. That would leave him about $3.2 billion in reserves going into the election year, his aides maintain, which fiscal conservatives argue is the very least a state the size of New York should have on hand.
The Assembly Democrats, on the other hand, are willing to bet state revenues will rise somewhat despite the slowdown. They have proposed spending $1.9 billion more in state revenues than the governor did, most of it for education. They like to point out that that amount is already in the bank in the form of a surplus because the governor underestimated revenues last year. 
"If you take this $1.9 billion in the bank, there is enough here to compromise," said Dean Fuleihan, the secretary of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee.

HEADLINE: Europeans' Rallying Cry: One Share, One Vote! 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
HENRI LACHMANN had a grand vision. By merging his company, Schneider Electric S.A., which makes electrical equipment for factories and power plants, with Legrand S.A., a maker of consumer products like plugs and dimmers, he would create a French mini-version of General Electric, with $11 billion in revenue.
 So earlier this year, Mr. Lachmann reached an agreement with the Decoster and Verspieren families, whose forebears acquired Legrand in 1944 and built it into a major supplier of electrical products, to acquire it for $7 billion in Schneider stock. 
 While the families own only 40 percent of Legrand's shares, they were vital to Mr. Lachmann's ambitions. Under a two-tier stock structure, they control 56 percent of the voting rights. So Mr. Lachmann agreed to pay the families 43.5 percent more for their shares than minority shareholders would pocket for their nonvoting ones. 
Until, that is, the French association for the defense of minority shareholders got wind of it. Backed by investment funds that own Legrand's nonvoting stock, the association, known by the French acronym ADAM, sued to block the deal -- and won. The struggle ended last month, when a court in Paris voided the takeover because it put a higher value on voting than nonvoting stock. The ruling forced Mr. Lachmann and the families that control Legrand to put forth a revised offer on Thursday that was more equitable to the owners of nonvoting shares.
A few years ago, the case might not have even made it into the courts. But these days activist shareholders appear to be all over Europe, where attitudes toward owning stock and exercising the rights of ownership are changing significantly. Mr. Lachmann's rude awakening illustrates how companies across the Continent are being pushed to adjust.
In Switzerland, the families controlling the Roche pharmaceutical group are under assault; in Sweden, the family that runs most of the country's industrial companies is cautiously watching an activist fund manager who recently doubled his stake in the the family's publicly traded investment company; in Italy, investors who took over the national phone company, Telecom Italia, are being challenged in court; and in Ireland, shareholders attending the annual meeting of the Jefferson Smurfit Group, a paper and packaging company with four Smurfit family members on its five-person executive board, chanted "Resign!" at the chief executive, Michael W. J. Smurfit.
"Society has undergone broad changes in this respect," said Walter Knabenhans, chief executive of Bank Julius Baer, one of a small circle of Swiss private banks with asset-management businesses that let them benefit from the new investor mind-set. "It is reflective of changed values at the shareholder level."
Encouraged by fund managers from the United States and Britain, European shareholders are catching the reform fever that took hold among American investors in the 1980's. Now, as then, corporate earnings growth is sluggish -- and so are stock prices. But the executives in charge remain entrenched, resistant to being held to account. Instead of paying greenmail or adopting poison pills to discourage corporate raiders -- as American executives did -- Europeans have so far relied more often on equity structures that give effective control of companies to small groups of insiders. The insiders own a relatively small number of shares, but their shares have extraordinary voting rights.
The surging number of shareholders in Europe, however, is changing this picture. In Germany, more than 12 million people, or 14 percent of the population, owned shares at the end of last year -- 50 percent more than a year earlier and double the 1997 total. That still trails the United States, where about half of all adults own stock, but as more Europeans have jumped into the market, the media have covered financial news more aggressively, giving investors a useful weapon and helping to spread American-style activism.
In Germany, change is expected to accelerate next year, when the government abolishes the 50 percent capital gains tax on share sales. That will free banks to sell the immense industrial holdings that some of them began accumulating before World War II -- thus making millions of shares of stock available to investors just as the country is encouraging individuals to save for their retirements rather than count on government pensions. And for years now here in France, big corporations, in part heeding shareholder demands for more focused investment, have been surrendering the cross shareholdings that historically tied together this country's system.
Last week, European leaders agreed on a law that will make it easier to carry out hostile takeover bids and more difficult for companies to defend themselves by selling shares to friendly shareholders, probably increasing the pace and likelihood of cross-border deals. Though it must still be enacted and would not take full effect until 2006, the agreement represents a turning point for European corporations: It enshrines the principle that shareholders rather than executives have the final say on hostile bids.
EVEN amid such pressure, shareholder rights in Europe are not yet anything like what they are in the United States. In much of Europe, multitiered share structures -- which either give extraordinary voting rights to a special class of shares or deny voting rights to most shareholders in exchange for a larger dividend -- continue to let small groups of investors, often families, control companies and insulate executives from the results of their poor performance.
(Multitiered share structures are not unheard-of in the United States, of course. Some formerly family-owned media companies, including The New York Times Company, use them to preserve journalistic independence.)
In the Old World, many companies consider it too chancy to surrender control to shareholders. Privileged families and financial institutions like banks and insurers have traditionally seen themselves as guarantors of long-term prosperity, a kind of financial aristocracy.
But fund managers and others, including some European bankers, say the changes of the last few years will accelerate as companies compete for capital.
No one may be more familiar with those changes than Roberto Colaninno. He took advantage of Europe's new access to the global capital market in 1999 to raise the $60 billion he needed for his company -- Olivetti, a former typewriter maker -- to buy the much larger Telecom Italia.
But earlier this year, when Mr. Colaninno tried to restructure the financing of Telecom Italia, activist investors blocked his proposed $10 billion share conversion and buyback plan because, they said, it would have primarily benefited Olivetti, of which he owns 30 percent.
ELSEWHERE, a group of rebel shareholders led by the French investor Romain Zaleski recently overturned a plan by the Mediobanca investment bank to have Montedison, a chemicals-to-power conglomerate, pay the Falck family the equivalent of 13 euros a share for its 20 percent stake in Falck S.p.A., an energy utility, after all other shareholders had agreed to tender their shares for 9 euros each.
Mr. Zaleski, a former French bureaucrat turned activist investor, and his allies asserted that the terms were too sweet for the Falck family and Mediobanca, which has historically used informal shareholder pacts to control Italian companies.
Not long ago, such shareholder rebellions were "looked upon as unsocial, wrong or damaging to society," said Kurt Schiltknecht, an investment banker at BZ Bank in Zurich, whose chairman, Martin Ebner, is a leader among European activist shareholders. Activists are no longer dismissed as misfits, he said.
"When we first started, there was enormous resistance," Mr. Schiltknecht added, "but in the meantime, the size of boards is being reduced, members are chosen for their competence, and they have accepted the idea of shareholder value."
The economic logic behind the change is simple. As European companies take on global competitors, the founders' families and banks can no longer finance them. So the companies are turning to capital markets, where individual and institutional investors demand performance and accountability -- and a say in how companies are run. If they are not satisfied, they can easily move their capital elsewhere -- potentially puncturing the stock price of uncooperative companies.
"In the post-cold-war period, debt and equity funding had to make itself acceptable to an international forum," said Guy Jubb, an expert on corporate governance at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh. "It is the large companies that are setting the pace. Over time, it trickled down to other tiers of business."
The new mind-set is hardly universal. Many European executives assert that tight control by a small group of investors, often a family, frees management from the threat of hostile takeover and assures the tranquillity needed for long-term investments. And they are willing to resist the pressure to change.
Roche, for example, won a protracted battle with Mr. Ebner over its two-tiered share structure, which lets the Hoffmann and Oeri families, descendants of Roche's founder, control 50.1 percent of the votes while owning fewer than 10 percent of the shares.
Franz Humer, Roche's chairman, defends the structure. "One big advantage of family-controlled companies is the fact that the majority shareholder is interested in the long-term success of the company," he said. In the drug industry, he added, "where you need 8 to 10 years to develop a new compound, this long-term perspective is vital."
Mr. Ebner, however, argued that Roche's structure served merely to insulate the company's managers from the consequences of poor performance. Over the last eight years, Roche's stock has risen an average 15.5 percent annually -- less than both the Swiss industry drug makers index, which has advanced an average of 20 percent a year, and Switzerland's biggest pharmaceutical company, Novartis (and its predecessor companies, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy), which gained 23.5 percent a year.
Moreover, Roche's numbers have worsened. In the last five years, the annual gain of its stock has slipped to 6.5 percent, half that of the industry index. In the last six months, Roche shares have declined 23.7 percent.
Unable to win a seat on the board or otherwise persuade the company to improve its performance, Mr. Ebner sold his remaining Roche stake, which had one-fifth of the voting rights, for $2.8 billion last month. But he may yet force change at Roche, because he sold the stock to Novartis, prompting speculation of a takeover by the larger company. Novartis's chairman, Daniel Vasella, dismisses the idea that traditional European corporate structures are desirable. "Even if you have family behind you," he said in an interview, "I don't think it's any proof that where you're going will bring long-term success."
MR. EBNER'S experience at Roche shows how resistant some companies are to surrendering share structures that give control to small insider groups. So, too, does the experience of Rene Braginsky this year at Sulzer A.G., a Swiss machinery maker.
Mr. Braginsky, 51, is a former banker who has become something once unthinkable in Switzerland: a corporate raider. In April, he made a $2.3 billion hostile bid for Sulzer. He was not battling a family, but rather entrenched managers who shielded themselves by capping the voting rights of all investors at 5 percent, regardless of how much stock they owned. That defense succeeded in fending off Mr. Braginsky, though the board accepted some of his demands and agreed to consider the "one share, one vote" idea next year.
Such setbacks have not discouraged the reformers. Mr. Braginsky is preparing for a wholesale consolidation in Germany next year, once the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of cross-shareholdings makes it easier for banks to sell their significant stakes in their corporate borrowers. Deutsche Bank alone owns $16 billion in stock. 
"The puzzle in Germany will be rearranged," Mr. Braginsky said. To make the most of the change, his investment company, Incentive Capital, enlisted as board chairman Karl Otto Pohl, once head of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank.
German bankers say the change will push the 30 blue-chip companies on the benchmark DAX index to buy other companies or risk being bought themselves. Those blue chips, including DaimlerChrsyler, the Bayer chemical group and the ThyssenKrupp steelworks, have long been largely owned or controlled by financial institutions.
Such structural change -- as well as the influence of the United States and Britain, which supply growing amounts of capital and the bankers to invest it -- are even pushing some of Europe's own institutional investors to beat the drum for better treatment by companies that they ostensibly own. For instance, First Eagle SoGen Funds, an asset-management arm of the French bank Societe Generale, ran full-page advertisements in French papers attacking Schneider for offering different premiums to ordinary and preferred shareholders in its bid for Legrand.
But other funds still prefer to let shareholder organizations carry the flag. One of the best-known groups is ADAM, the Association of Minority Shareholders in France, which asked an appeals court to overturn a decision by regulators to allow Schneider's offer. ADAM is run by Colette Neuville, an economist and lawyer who became a shareholder activist a decade ago when her stockbroker went broke; she operates out of a narrow pair of rooms in the shadow of the cathedral in Chartres, an hour southwest of here.
The group would not say how many members it has, but it has emerged in recent years as a challenger to giants of French business, tackling in court suits companies like Vivendi and industrialists like Francois Pinault, who owns the Pinault-Printemps-Redoute retail chain.
THE latest battle to pry open Europe's closed corporations may be the most difficult yet. After selling his 20 percent stake in Roche last month, Mr. Ebner doubled his stake in Investor A.B. of Sweden, to 7.7 percent of its capital and 10.2 percent of its voting rights.
Investor, a large Swedish holding company much like Berkshire Hathaway in the United States, is controlled by the Wallenberg family. Among Investor's holdings are large stakes in Electrolux A.B., the home-appliance maker; AstraZeneca P.L.C., whose products include the ulcer treatment Prilosec and the local anesthetic Xylocaine; and Ericsson, maker of network equipment for mobile-phone services.
Even before Mr. Ebner raised his stake, Investor had come under fire for its two classes of shares. At Ericsson, for example, a two-tiered share structure gives the Wallenbergs almost 39 percent of the voting rights, even though they own only about 7 percent of the company's stock. All Ericsson shares are traded publicly and enjoy voting rights, but some have more votes than others.
Mr. Ebner recently met Investor's chairman, Percy Barnevik, but as is his custom, he declined to discuss what they talked about. However, Mr. Ebner's associates have suggested that Investor, whose shares trade for 25 percent less than the market value of all of the stock it owns, should consider measures like buying back shares and then canceling them, or splitting the group into smaller investment companies.
Mr. Barnevik, who as the longtime chairman of the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB was known for backing the rights of shareholders, dismissed such radical changes in favor of pressing the companies that Investor controls to improve their performance. He believes that this will increase the value of Investor's shares. "I don't want to confuse the issue and dilute the company efforts by having a multitude of parallel goals," he said.
That may sound like old-school thinking, the kind that activist shareholders are trying to exorcise. But Mr. Barnevik says it works. Over the last 20 years, he said, Investor achieved an average annual return to shareholders of 27 percent, almost twice that of the OM Stockholm Exchange cumulative index.
Some experts believe that it is a matter of time before Mr. Ebner seeks a seat on the Investor board. Mr. Schiltknecht described Mr. Ebner as first seeking change through confidential discussions, and only then applying pressure through the media. "Executives pay more attention to newspapers than to investors," he said. "Vanity is a general phenomenon."
While investor activism is shifting the center of gravity toward American-style capitalism and its emphasis on shareholder value, the tug of European-style family capitalism lingers. "It probably goes back really to how European societies developed after the French Revolution, with a stronger preparedness to accept the concept of a certain shared interest," said Mr. Knabenhans, the Bank Julius Baer banker. Europeans may pay lip service to American-style capitalism, he added, "but when push comes to shove, the underlying reluctance is still rather strong."
STILL, the drift toward more responsive corporate governance, under American influence, has already brought change.
In Switzerland, where boards were once packed with 16 to 20 members, the average is now about 8 to 12, said Dr. Vasella, the Novartis chairman. Mr. Schiltknecht added that the practice of apportioning board seats on political, social or even religious grounds -- until recently, for instance, members of the Credit Suisse board could not be Catholic -- has yielded increasingly to competence as the sole criterion.
Mr. Schiltknecht quoted his boss: "As Mr. Ebner always says, 'No idea is as strong as an idea whose time has come.' "

Can Kraft Lay Enough Golden Eggs?

BYLINE:  By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
KRAFT is America's biggest food company by almost any measure. Its brands, including Maxwell House coffee, Oreo cookies, Jell-O pudding, Velveeta, Philadelphia cream cheese, Kool-Aid and Oscar Mayer hot dogs, are consumed in most American homes, and it dwarfs its domestic competitors. 
 But whether Kraft shares are a good deal for investors is likely to hinge on whether its earnings can be expected to increase faster than a typical food company's. 
 Philip Morris, the corporate parent of Kraft Foods, is selling 16 percent of its subsidiary this week, in what is likely to be the second-largest initial offering by an American company. The 280 million shares are expected to be priced from $27 to $30 a share. At $30, Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., would raise $8.4 billion. (The largest initial offering was AT&T Wireless in April 2000, at $10.6 billion.) At this price range, Kraft would have a market capitalization of more than $50 billion -- more than three times the size of Sara Lee, the second-largest domestic food company. 
People who believe that Kraft's shares will rise appreciably are convinced that the company can increase its earnings at a faster pace than its peers. They argue that Kraft has an advantage derived from economies of scale. And they say Kraft's earnings will be bolstered by improvements in its balance sheet and by acquisitions. 
"We think this belongs in the company of elite consumer-goods companies," says Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation in New York. 
Investors like Mr. Ghriskey, who put Kraft in the company of consumer giants like Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, are inclined to look at the midpoint of the price range, $28.50 a share, as a good deal. But those who place Kraft among food companies like Heinz, General Mills and Campbell consider this price rather rich.
A RESEARCH report on April 24 by Goldman, Sachs, which is not involved in the deal, compared Kraft with other food companies. According to Goldman's analysis, even the midpoint price would be high. Romitha S. Mally, the author of the report, told investors on April 27 that a fair price for Kraft's initial offering would be $25 a share. The Goldman report said that the stock should be priced at nine times estimated 2001 Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- and that it would be a good buy at up to $28 a share. 
At issue is how investors look at the company's ability to generate cash and to grow. At $28.50 a share, Kraft would be valued at about 10 times estimated cash flow for 2001, measured as Ebitda, analysts said. At 10 times Ebitda, Kraft's results would be in line with the average of other food companies.
Elite consumer-goods companies trade at 12 to 14 times Ebitda, Mr. Ghriskey said. Kraft's earnings will increase 15 percent a year on a cash basis, he said, if it can meet its goals, including a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in sales volume, improvements in its product mix and paying off its $18.4 billion in debt. 
"Those are aggressive numbers," he said, "but if they are able to achieve them, that puts them in that elite category." 
Terry Bivens, an analyst at Bear Stearns, which is not part of the deal, said that at $28.50, Kraft's value is in line with the average food company. But its prospects are "better than the average food company," Mr. Bivens said, noting that Kraft had seven brands that each had more than $1 billion in sales last year. 
Mr. Bivens said he thought that Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney, the investment banks charged with managing the initial offering, would price the shares "attractively." 
"From an investor's point of view," he said, "anything under $30 is a buy."
Goldman said there were several reasons that Kraft should be priced at $28 or less. First, it discounts Kraft's value by 5 to 10 percent because Philip Morris will remain the majority stockholder and will retain control. Second, Goldman said, shareholders are exposed to liabilities resulting from tobacco litigation involving Philip Morris. And third, Goldman is giving Kraft's offering a 15 percent discount to reflect the number of shares that have to be sold.
Merrill Lynch, which is not involved directly in the deal, also takes a cautionary view. "This, in my opinion, is a food company," says Leonard Teitelbaum, a managing director at Merrill. Cost savings from Philip Morris's acquisition of Nabisco almost a year ago could help Kraft's earnings for a couple of years, he said. After that, he expects Kraft's cash flow, or Ebitda, to increase at 8 percent a year.
At $27 to $30 a share, Mr. Teitelbaum said, the deal is a "a little high for my comfort zone." 
Philip Morris is spinning off Kraft largely to realize the full value of a business that, as part of a conglomerate, cannot be valued against its peers. In the end, Philip Morris will still own about 84 percent of Kraft as well as common stock with 97.7 percent of the company's voting rights.
Because Philip Morris shareholders already so much of Kraft, many of them will not think that they must buy shares in it, analysts say.
HIGH valuations of Kraft assume that the company will not only grow within existing product categories but will also expand into new categories and overseas, said Mr. Ghriskey at Dreyfus. Founded in 1914, Kraft was acquired by Philip Morris in 1988. It earned $2 billion last year, up 14 percent from a year earlier, and is still absorbing Nabisco's operations. 
Although strong in the United States, Kraft has a relatively weak international business. In fact, Goldman analyzes Kraft as effectively two companies -- Kraft North America and Kraft Foods International. And the management arrangement is unusual: each unit is run by a chief executive who reports to Geoffrey C. Bible, the Philip Morris chairman. Betsy Holden heads the North American unit and Roger Deromedi heads the international group. 
Overseas, Kraft is struggling. While operating profit overseas increased by almost 17 percent last year, Goldman is not convinced that this growth is sustainable. Kraft may use the proceeds from the stock offering to strengthen its international presence through acquisitions, but Goldman questions whether a merger target would want to be a large shareholder in a company that continues to be controlled by Philip Morris, with its tobacco legacy. 
Still, many investors point to Kraft's strength in the United States and have faith that it can continue to increase earnings at double-digit rates. 
"They have an elite management group that's been successful in a very difficult industry," said Art Cecil, investment analyst at T. Rowe Price Associates.

HEADLINE: The Decade Nobody Knows 

BYLINE:  By George Packer; George Packer is the author, most recently, of "Blood of the Liberals."

 BODY:
 THE SEVENTIES
The Great Shift in American Culture,
Society, and Politics.
By Bruce J. Schulman.
Illustrated. 334 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $26.
 Until recently, no one has quite known what to do with the 1970's. The years between Woodstock and Reagan seemed to dribble out in a long and tacky anticlimax that never announced any overarching theme. "Try to retrieve the 70's and memories crumble in one's hands, nothing keeps its shape," Irving Howe wrote in his autobiography, "Margin of Hope." "The decade itself lacks a distinctive historical flavor." Nixon's transcripts, Ford's golf shots, Carter's crazed rabbit, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Pryor, Squeaky Fromme, the Captain and Tennille, stretch-waist baseball uniforms, Rolfing: if all of this had any flavor, it was the taste of the absurd. Children of the 1970's, having inherited a reflexive cynicism toward authority without a cause greater than recycling or a sacrifice more painful than gas lines, learned early on to feel envy, shame and resentment. The last thing anyone growing up in the 70's imagined was that a great historical transformation was occurring.
But 70's teenagers became academics and journalists, and inevitably a small historical literature of the decade has begun to accumulate. It turns out that the 70's gave birth to the America in which we now live.
Anyone attempting a historical explanation is confronted with this paradox: the 1970's carried the revolutions and experiments of the 60's to their reductio ad absurdum, from the Symbionese Liberation Army and EST to the Ramones and Jonestown -- and somehow it all culminated in 1980 with the election of the most conservative president in over half a century. Did Ronald Reagan represent a reaction against the decade, or its fulfillment?
In "The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and Politics," Bruce J. Schulman essentially answers: both. The "great shift" is away from the public-spirited universalism that gave America the New Deal and the civil rights movement, and toward the sovereignty of the free market and private life. In other words, the 1980's began in the 1970's.
A similar argument appeared last year in "How We Got Here," by the journalist and current Bush speechwriter David Frum. But as a conservative Frum placed the emphasis on the decline of traditional moral values. What Schulman shows is how that decline went hand in hand with the freewheeling private enterprise that has remade American life in the past two decades. In this sense the change transcends the division between left and right: "This implosion of American public life and attempt to reconstruct the nation as a congeries of separate private refuges revealed itself across the traditional political spectrum and among all demographic groups." It was as much geographical as philosophical -- a movement of the nation's center of gravity away from the older consensus of the northeastern establishment, southward and westward to the Sun Belt, that freedom-seeking sprawl of subdivisions from Fort Lauderdale to Anaheim.
When Schulman, a historian at Boston University whose first book was "From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt," speaks of the "southernization" of American life, he isn't talking about Jim Crow and the blues. He means their milder reincarnations in the antiwelfare, Lynyrd Skynyrd-listening South that sloughed off its regional shame around the time Richard Nixon became president. Southernization was an attitude that spread north -- suspicion of government, antielitism, racial resentment, a highly personal religiosity.
If any one person can be said to have invented the 70's, it was Kevin Phillips. His 1969 book "The Emerging Republican Majority," which came out of his work on the Nixon campaign and explained how to effect a realignment of the parties, coined the term "Sun Belt" and described a new kind of American who would replace the core Democratic voters, the older northern urban ethnics: "The persons most drawn to the new sun culture are the pleasure-seekers, the bored, the ambitious, the space-age technicians and the retired -- a super-slice of the rootless, socially mobile group known as the American middle class." 
This thinking was more visionary than Nixon's appeal to "the silent majority" that had brought him to power in 1968. Those middle Americans were defined by opposition to student protesters and black militants, but they represented an older set of values: patriotism and duty and self-restraint. The new Americans of the Sun Belt, Schulman explains, would make their peace with all the things that had scandalized the heartland in the 60's. The counterculture would become the mainstream. But this didn't mean the triumph of utopian idealism, the "beloved community" of civil rights workers and antiwar demonstrators. By the end of the 70's, the self-liberations that had originated in the 60's were merely "lifestyle choices," and they easily fused with the Sun Belt spirit of individualism.
The cultural part of the 60's revolution turned out to be continuous with the economic part of the Reagan revolution. What joins them is the apotheosis of the free individual. The very things that began with liberal universalist dreams of common humanity ended up in fragmentation and skepticism. Watergate, for example: at the time it appeared to be a great triumph for the antiestablishment left, a boon to reform Democrats in Congress, proof that the institutions of government worked. But it's now clear, as Schulman argues, that the "the ultimate lesson of Watergate remained 'you can't trust the government,' " and that it therefore "gave a boost to conservatism and conservative Republican politicians." Similarly, the tax revolt, which most Americans would date to 1978 with California's Proposition 13, turns out to have begun in the early 70's with an anticorporate, populist campaign for equity, not mindless cutting. And the brotherhood dreams of the early civil rights movement crumbled into "diversity." 
The decade's odd figure out was Jimmy Carter. Victim of inflation and a crisis of confidence he himself diagnosed, he proposed a cure -- equal parts Baptist moralism and engineering expertise -- that was hopelessly out of sync with the times. Calling the energy crisis "the moral equivalent of war" was exactly the wrong appeal to make to an age far more inclined toward private self-fulfillment than collective self-sacrifice. Schulman's account of the Carter years is particularly illuminating in a book of shrewd historical analysis and clear anecdotal prose. 
When he turns to popular culture, his historian's judgment is less sure. To claim that Jackie Kennedy's decision to marry Aristotle Onassis "signaled the end of the optimistic, liberal 1960's" or that " 'The Jeffersons' marked the crest of the civil rights movement, the summit of its material achievements and the beginning of the end of the integrationist ideal" is a kind of reductio ad absurdum itself. Sometimes trash is just trash. And in yoking together so many characters and events and trends, from the New Age to the New Right, under the single heading "privatism" leads Schulman into a kind of zeitgeist determinism, blurring important distinctions and forcing unlikely connections, with feminists labeled as entrepreneurs and Francis Ford Coppola shoehorned in with Evel Knievel as 70's rebels.
But his central argument is utterly persuasive. On or about November 1968, American character changed. In the case of most Americans of Schulman's generation, much has been given and little asked, and it's easy to think that nothing short of "the moral equivalent of war" will snap us out of our separate commercial trances.

HEADLINE: New Milford Shows Off for the Cameras 

BYLINE:  By DAVID PARKER 

 BODY:
FOR nearly two weeks, downtown New Milford has seen life turned upside down by a heavily equipped 100-member occupying force.
 Most residents, despite the disruption, seemed to get a kick out of this development, as Columbia Pictures had converted downtown Bank Street into a Hollywood back lot for the filming of "Deeds," a feature starring Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder and Peter Gallagher, who all came to town. 
 Spectators from throughout the region gathered for a glimpse of the action as shooting began May 30. More than 300 locals, culled from several thousand who had answered a casting call, were waiting for their turn on camera as extras, or "background," in a crowd scene to be shot at the old Candlewood Farms airport. Downtown merchants sold the filmmakers everything from coffee and bagels to lumber. 
"It's very positive for the town," Mayor Arthur Peitler said.
It's not just the hundreds of thousands of dollars the production and its crew spend locally, he said, or the "ripple" effect of that spending in the local economy. The mayor spoke of "Deeds" giving the town a "good self image."
"They were saying what a nice place it must be to live and how accommodating the people here are," he said of the movie's crew, noting that one of the Columbia people asked him, 'How do you get all your drivers to stop and let people cross the street?' "
Bank Street was closed to traffic on the first day of filming. Camera booms, klieg lights, reflectors, sound equipment and other gear trucked in from New York were in place. Production assistants kept moving the crowd back beyond various sight lines as camera angles and street locales changed, telling them to keep quiet while the cameras rolled.
Even while being pushed about and hushed, people seemed to love it all. 
The film's crew and cast had already made their presence felt at the Bank Street Coffee House. "A lot of folks with headsets have been in here buying stuff," A.J. Farrell, who was working the counter, said. "The crew are great. They tell you all sorts of stuff about California and what it's like working with different stars."
Columbia had given Bank Street a major makeover. Trees in planters lined the formerly treeless street, stores were renamed for the duration, though all but one remained open for business. Slone Pharmacy bore a feed and grain store sign and had hay bales along its sidewalk. The weekly New Milford Times had become The Mandrake Falls Gazette. An instant park, with Civil War monument, materialized in a parking lot next to the Bistro. That restaurant was now Deeds Pizza, its interior made over as a pizzeria.
"Deeds" is a remake of the 1936 classic "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," directed by Frank Capra and starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. In this new version, Longfellow Deeds, a pizzeria owner and poet in Mandrake Falls, N. H., unexpectedly inherits $40 billion from the founder of a New York media conglomerate. Ms. Ryder plays the television tabloid reporter sent out to get his "real" story. Steven Brill is the director. The movie is scheduled for release sometime next year.
"Deeds" is the biggest film project to come to Connecticut since the 1997 production of "Amistad," according to Guy Ortoleva, director of the Connecticut Film Commission. It's the biggest yet in New Milford, but far from the first, according to Frank Weller, chairman of the New Milford Film Commission.
During the commission's first three years, he said, 12 projects have worked here, including small, low-budget independent films, commercials, the History Channel and most recently an MTV "reality" series that filmed at a local quarry. 
Japanese filmmakers liked the locale photos the commission gave them, "so flew all the way here and decided to film some episodes for a feature they were making," Mr. Weller said. "They did a car chase on one of our scenic roads and we loaned them a bank to rob."
The all-volunteer commission, backed by the town with a $12,500 budget, maintains a Web site of potential filming locales plus rosters of local talent and services. It networks, attends workshops and conventions and, "once a project decides to shoot here, we do everything we can to make things go smoothly for them," Mr. Weller said.
One of the region's lures for filmmakers, along with proximity to New York, is the large pool of actors, technicians, sound and camera people who live here, Mr. Weller said. Their availability helps keep costs below what they'd be if Columbia had to bring in everyone it needed from California or New York, he explained.
Harvey Hubbell, a community liaison for the movie industry and working for Columbia on "Deeds," is an example. Mr. Hubbell, who lives in Litchfield, said he often had to travel many hours to work on a production. "It's great for me to have a job on a project of this caliber 20 minutes from my house," he said. "I hear the New York guys complaining about their two-hour commute. Usually that's me."
Todd Corrigan of New Milford said he was happy for this hometown opportunity. Mr. Corrigan had been working as a volunteer production assistant, helping with crowd control and whatever else is required. A student in film courses at Emerson College, he said it was not a glamorous job, "but you get to talk to the right people and learn the kind of things you want to know."
At a local teen center serving as a "holding area" for extras during early shooting days, Screen Actors Guild members waited for their call to the set. Denis Lybe of Brookfield, dressed as a Mandrake Falls policeman, said that while he now earns his living as a courier, his passion as a 30-year union member remains work on a film set. The chance for two or three days' action on a major film so near home was wonderful, he said.
John Campbell, a college student from Trumbull, was ready for a brief appearance as a child on a bicycle pedaling down Bank Street.
Most New Milford residents "think it's fun and exciting to see a Hollywood movie being filmed here," said Art Cummings, editor of the weekly Greater New Milford Spectrum and a lifetime resident. "It's really festive out there today, and there's probably some long-term image building involved." 
But Mr. Cumming cautioned that some merchants and residents were growing unhappy about disruption of business and traffic and the crunch on parking space, especially as publicity drew more and more people downtown. The filming is scheduled to stop this week.
"On balance, it's a good experience for the town," he concluded. "But I don't know that you'd want to try doing it every week."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Government By Wish List

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN President Bush signed into law the tax cut he had championed since the start of the race for the White House a year and a half ago, it marked a political victory of the first order.
 But the significance of the formal signing ceremony in the East Room of the White House last Thursday extends well beyond scorekeeping or the details of the rate reductions. This bill is also a blueprint for governing -- one that, by giving taxpayers first dibs on a big chunk of the projected federal budget surplus, leaves all other claimants to fight over the what money remains. 
 "Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society," Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once said. And tax policy, historically, has been a reliable guide to what Congress and the president think a civilized society should look like. At its best, that vision represents a balancing of the books between the nation's hopes and its means. In this case, though, support for the tax cut may represent less a consensus that the size and role of government should shrink than a gamble that the country can have it both ways. 
This bill became law largely because politicians -- at a time when power is almost perfectly split between Democrats and Republicans -- could credibly argue that there would be enough money for tax cuts and for a long list of popular and expensive government-expanding initiatives.
Nearly all Republicans and many Democrats were eager to offer the voter tax cuts, and to do the faltering economy a favor in the process. But with the anticipated surplus so large, they could simultaneously promise increased federal spending on education, the creation of a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, more subsidies for farmers and military modernization.
This was the politics of prosperity at work -- even though prosperity, or at least the supercharged version of it that the nation was accustomed to, has taken a holiday. At a time when the economy appears to be generating more revenue than the government knows what to do with, fiscal policy, and by extension ideological clashes over the size and role of government, need not lead to either-or propositions. It can be win-win: tax cuts and a bigger, activist government.
Unless, of course, the anticipated surplus turns out to be illusory. In that case, the nation may have just committed itself to a decade-long course of tax cutting without a serious debate over the consequences. If this proves true, Washington may one day look back and ask why it accepted rosy budgetary projections and did not confront its responsibility to debate and set priorities.
Any such regret would be most profound among liberals, many of whom feel that Mr. Bush fooled moderates in both parties by deliberately playing down the bite that the tax cut would take out of government.
"There was a conscious effort to deal with priorities sequentially rather than together," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a critic of Mr. Bush's tax plan. "Had there been a full discussion of the amount that the administration would like to spend on defense, and would like to devote to education over the next decade, and a more realistic estimate of the costs of providing prescription drug coverage for the elderly, then inevitably the tax bill would have been much smaller."
The result, Mr. Reischauer said, was "a procedural triumph for those who would like government to be small."
Indeed, there was no hand-wringing about missed opportunities at the White House. To conservatives who want to check the growth of the government, and who see the solutions to social problems coming from an unfettered economy and private charities, pitting school spending against prescription drug benefits or military procurement would be a welcome development.
"This bill is more than just tax relief," Mr. Bush told a cheering crowd in Florida a few days before signing the legislation. "It is more than just preventing Washington from growing the size of government. This bill reflects a philosophy that says we trust the American people more than we trust government." 
Anyway, there is enough money for prudent investments in the future even after the tax cut, the White House says. And the administration points out that there is no firm evidence that the budget surplus is being diminished by the softer economy.
SUCH optimism, however, is not fully shared at the Pentagon, where officials are suddenly confronting the likelihood that the government may not be able to afford to upgrade the military the way Mr. Bush promised -- even if the surplus is as large as projected. And the difficult budget arithmetic will apply to nearly every function of government starting this summer, when Congress begins voting on spending bills for next year.
This means that, despite Thursday's bill signing, the fight over taxes is far from settled. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who last week became majority leader as Democrats took control of the Senate, has already promised to revisit aspects of the Bush tax plan. Conservative Republicans, meanwhile, have made clear they want more tax cuts. 
This is not a matter only of fiscal policy; taxes are the pivot on which a number of ideological debates turn, from the relationship between rich and poor, to the relative responsibilities of individuals and government. Bill Archer, the former Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal last month that only about 65 percent of working-age Americans have any federal income tax liability, creating the potential for class warfare between those who want government services and those who pay for them. (Because of credits and deductions, most low-income working families pay little or nothing in federal income taxes, although they pay payroll taxes.)
FISCAL conservatives in both parties think this tax cut will have the same effect as the last big one, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan nearly 20 years ago. It will ultimately weaken the country's fiscal health, they say.
"It's playing Russian roulette with the economy," said Warren Rudman, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire. 
Looking ahead two decades, the nation faces paying Social Security and Medicare benefits to a rapidly aging population, a challenge that would be difficult even if the current surplus projections prove to be correct, and perhaps overwhelming if the surplus evaporates.
"The American people may learn that even during good times, it might be prudent to broaden the horizon of public policy to incorporate down sides that at the time don't seem realistic," said Kim Wallace, a political analyst in Washington for Lehman Brothers, the investment firm. "That's a not very profound way of saying that even though Washington never finds a way to save for a rainy day, it rains often."
Maybe this time the rain won't come. Maybe the economy will rebound quickly and the budget surplus will continue to grow. Or maybe the surplus will turn out to be a mirage, and future Congresses and presidents will be forced to confront the tradeoffs that this Congress and president sidestepped.

HEADLINE: Obstacles to China's W.T.O. Entry Eased in Talks With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 9 

 BODY:
American and Chinese trade negotiators said today that they had resolved most of the remaining issues that have held up China's entry to the World Trade Organization, including the degree to which China can subsidize its farmers as a member of the trade group. 
 The agreement has revived hopes that China can join the global trade club within months and take part in rule-setting negotiations by the group's members that could start late this year. 
 "This is a breakthrough agreement with benefits for American farmers, American exporters and U.S. companies doing business with China," said the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, in a telephone interview from Washington after arriving there from negotiations in Shanghai. "It moves China toward W.T.O. membership this year and further along the path of economic reform and the rule of law." 
China's state media quoted Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng as saying the two sides had "reached full consensus" on the outstanding issues at meetings that followed a conference of regional trade ministers here. The final agreement came during talks between Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Shi that began late Friday night and lasted until 3 a.m. today. Mr. Shi then took the agreement to China's president, Jiang Zemin, who was visiting Suzhou, near Shanghai. 
China has been working for more than a decade to join the organization, which regulates trade among its members. It has signed bilateral agreements with all key members, except Mexico, which expects to conclude negotiations soon and promised not to block China's entry. 
But efforts to draft a document stating the terms of China's membership foundered early this year on differences between the United States and China over the degree to which China will be allowed to use subsidies to support its farmers. 
China is already facing an economic crisis in the countryside, where its vast rural population is being squeezed between rising costs and falling prices for crops. It wants to retain as much flexibility as possible in subsidizing that population, an important mechanism in keeping rural unrest in check.
The United States, meanwhile, worries that subsidized farm produce from China could undercut American farmers, who are already under pressure from imports. 
As part of an overall agreement on the use agricultural subsidies, China had wanted the freedom to offer its farmers subsidies worth up to 10 percent of the value of their output, the level set by the trade organization for developing economies. The United States wanted to limit that to a maximum of 5 percent, the same restriction it operates under as a developed economy. 
Neither the United States nor China released details of the agreement today, but senior American officials said the final agreement gives China some of the flexibility it wanted on some farm products while setting tighter limits on the subsidies on others. 
With the issue settled, efforts to draft the necessary comprehensive document are expected to make swift progress at the 16th session of the trade organization's working group on China's membership, which will begin June 28 in Geneva.
The United States and other members are pushing for the organization to begin a new round of negotiations to set rules for the group later this year. They would like those talks to begin when the group meets in November in Doha, the capital of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar.

HEADLINE: Mildly Ambitious 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Senator Joseph Lieberman has always been a Republican's idea of a model Democrat. When Al Gore selected Lieberman as his running mate last summer, George Bush's spokesman remarked that Gore "has chosen a man whose positions are more similar to Governor Bush's positions than to his own." That was campaign hyperbole, but Lieberman had long occupied the conservative wing of his party on issues like defense spending, tax cuts, school vouchers and, notoriously, the entertainment industry. When Bush won and set about trying to define a new ideological center, Lieberman was one of the Democratic senators expected to join him there, at least on a number of key policy items.
 But he hasn't. Unlike such Senate Democratic centrists as John Breaux and Zell Miller, the 59-year-old junior senator from Connecticut voted against Bush's tax cut and against his budget. And he has, in his gentle and soft-nosed way, criticized the administration for extremism. 
 The decision of Senator James Jeffords of Vermont to leave the G.O.P. has provided extra-partisan authority for that critique. Lieberman says: "I was struck that in his statement Jeffords said, 'I'm not a Republican by birth; I'm a Republican because the party shared my values -- moderation, tolerance, fiscal responsibility.' The fact that he concluded that he could no longer stay in the party was a stinging indictment of the way the Bush administration has conducted itself." Since Lieberman's politics are probably more like Jeffords's than they are like either Bush's or Gore's, he understood the Jeffords defection as a ratification of his own position.
There is a battle under way now in Washington over ownership of words like "moderation" and "responsibility." It seemed at first that Bush was winning that battle, since most of the self-defined centrists in the Democratic Party voted for the fiscal package that was his foremost priority. But the Jeffords switch has tilted the balance in the opposite direction, toward ever-so-slightly-left-of-center figures like Lieberman (who were right-of-center figures until the spectrum shifted rightward). And Lieberman, like other senior Democrats, now has the opportunity to actually do something about his views. With the Democrats holding the majority, he has just become chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Lieberman says that he plans to use his power to investigate the Bush administration's response to the energy crisis in California, as well as its decision to reverse several of the Clinton administration's major regulatory initiatives -- in a constructive, nonpartisan manner, of course, but with recourse to his subpoena power as needed.
What is at stake in this game is, most obviously, control of the agenda, or rather the ability to deflect or frustrate the Bush administration's agenda. But among themselves, the Democrats are playing a fresh round of "Who's Presidential?" Having emerged from the 2000 campaign with his reputation enhanced rather than diminished (the same cannot be said of Al Gore), Lieberman is a figure to reckon with inside the Democratic Party. He makes all the lists of potential presidential candidates and stands at the top of some of them. Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, says: "Other than Gore, Lieberman is the best known and the best liked of Democratic figures in the country. If you look at the realistic group of candidates, he's clearly the most popular." The speculation has advanced so far that Lieberman has stopped pretending that he isn't considering a run. 
I caught up with Lieberman recently at a child-care center near Hartford, where he had gone to announce a new piece of legislation. Lieberman is comfortable with little kids. His manner is Beloved Grandpa: squatting down on his haunches, he smiled and bantered and patted heads and talked softly and very slowly, as if he weren't quite sure that English was their first language.
Lieberman has that primal quality of almost all successful politicians -- he likes being around other people -- but he is at the far end of the spectrum from the proconsular, declamatory figures (think Fritz Hollings or John Kerry) who constitute the received image of the United States senator. Lieberman is a short man with the soft mouth and loosening jowls of a friendly basset hound. He has what must be one of the least compelling voices in the Senate, a whiny, crumbly textured, old-Jewish-man voice. He is, on the other hand, about as devoid of artifice and grandiosity as anybody you will meet on Capitol Hill. When he read to the kids, he was as gentle as Mr. Rogers.
After the event, we got into Lieberman's car. It was a few days after Passover, and the car had been victualed with a stack of matzos, an apple and a carton of kosher apple juice, which Lieberman now opened. I asked Lieberman about his vote against the budget resolution authorizing an initial $1.2 trillion tax cut -- the resolution that was later incorporated into the president's fiscal package. The measure had passed with the votes of 15 Democrats, including virtually all of the centrists and two potential presidential candidates (Evan Bayh and John Edwards). 
Lieberman pointed out that Bush had first proposed the tax cut during the campaign as a means to blunt Steve Forbes's yet more radical proposal for a flat tax. And though he did not, he said, want to question the president's motives, "here we are almost a year and a half later and this is the centerpiece of his economic and fiscal proposal to the Congress and the country. It learns nothing from the lessons of the immediate past. The most important thing we've got to do is to be fiscally responsible, to keep the government in balance, and a surplus if possible. The other part is, you invest in the seeds of the new economy -- education, basic research and development, job training. The Bush tax plan does the exact opposite."
This is, in a nutshell, the centrist, New Democrat position that Clinton championed -- anti-Keynesian, steeped in old-time Republican maxims about prudence, dedicated to achieving fairness through growth rather than redistribution. Lieberman would have happily voted for a $900 billion tax cut tilted toward the middle class rather than the rich and, unlike many Democrats, would have supported cuts in the capital gains tax as well as other taxes affecting investment. With Clinton gone, Lieberman is perhaps the most unabashed spokesman for this new, middle-class-oriented tax and fiscal policy. "One of the great thrills of the campaign," Lieberman says, "was to be speaking in front of a Democratic audience, a rally, and give a pitch for fiscal austerity and deficit reduction, and there would be enormous applause." This was probably not a rally taking place in, say, Detroit.
It was by no means obvious to Lieberman's colleagues that he would come down against the tax cut, and Republicans and even some Democrats are inclined to see it as an act of strategic repositioning. John Breaux of Louisiana, who has taken over the role of intraparty bridge that Lieberman himself might have filled, says with what is apparently meant to be sympathy, "Lieberman has a very difficult job now, being a strong potential presidential candidate and having to recognize that in order to get the nomination of the Democratic Party you have to run left of center." 
Lieberman does seem to be closing whatever space separates him from his party's leadership, sponsoring, for example, a Democratic education bill that does not include financing for school voucher programs. On the other hand, he seems persuaded that the Bush tax cut is reckless, and he argues that Democrats who voted for it are making a historic mistake on the order of those who voted for Reagan's tax cuts in 1981. Of course, it is fair to ask why a $900 billion tax cut is moderate and responsible and a $1.35 trillion tax cut reckless. Lieberman appears to be standing up for the economic principles of the first Bush administration against those of the second. But Lieberman, who has fine instincts in such matters, may have recognized that that is where the middle now lies. 
Joe Lieberman is moderate not only by conviction but by temperament. Life has treated him well, and he has returned the favor by being sunny as well as grateful. His father owned a liquor store, and Lieberman was reared middle class in an ethnically mixed neighborhood of Stamford. "There was a word you don't hear much any more," Lieberman said to me during a conversation in his office in Washington. "There were a lot of interfaith activities. Most of my friends were not Jewish. I didn't experience anti-Semitism at all. When I look back at my childhood, I feel like I was in 'Happy Days,' with the Fonz." Lieberman doesn't seem to have any anger in him at all, and so even at his most morally serious, he never seems particularly censorious. He is a creature of the New Testament rather than the Old, less Isaiah than the Rev. Billy Graham.
In late April, Lieberman, along with Senators Herb Kohl and Hillary Clinton, called a news conference to introduce the Media Marketing Accountability Act, a bill that would treat the practice of marketing violent or sexual material to children as a form of false and deceptive advertising. This is the issue that first gained Lieberman public attention; he was that rare Democratic politician able and eager to speak the language of personal values otherwise monopolized by Republicans. At the news conference, Lieberman repeated his usual criticisms of "obscenity-laced lyrics." Then, in answer to a question, he said that he had just returned from Los Angeles, where he had spoken to several Hollywood trade groups. "These folks are citizens and parents," he said, as if admonishing those of us in the media against undue severity. 
There is both a conservative and a liberal case that Lieberman is, at bottom, a pious hypocrite. The conservative case, which William Bennett, among others, loudly made last summer, is that he backs off when his principles get him in trouble with his party. In order to mollify the Gore people, he backed off on the critique of Hollywood, school vouchers and the partial privatization of Social Security. (Lieberman says that he continued to goad the entertainment industry, that he openly admitted that he and Gore differed on vouchers and that he had ultimately come down against privatization.) The liberal case is that Lieberman is a self-aggrandizing pol willing to attack his own party to burnish his moral standing. One senator says that he was disgusted by Lieberman's decision to denounce Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky as "immoral" in the well of the Senate. "I may feel strongly about the shortcomings of my neighbors," he says, "but I don't take to the pulpit to announce it."
Lieberman's problem, if it is a problem, is that he is a stern moralist with a gooey center. He believes devoutly in the politics of value now being propounded by groups like the Democratic Leadership Council, which he led from 1995 until last year; in his most recent book, "In Praise of Public Life," he inveighs against the "moral timidity" that prevents the secular-minded from criticizing destructive behavior. And thus, he says, he felt compelled to speak out against Clinton. But he is also the Fonz. He is inclined to think well of everyone and to think that everyone's better nature is their true one; he even told me that the reflective Tim Russert who appears on CNBC, rather than the pugilistic one on NBC, is the "real" one. 
Lieberman likes to mix it up politically, but he doesn't really have the stomach for combat. When, in 1995, he offered some rather equivocal praise for Proposition 209, the resolution banning affirmative action in California, the civil rights establishment came down on him like a ton of bricks, and Lieberman reeled in horror. "It was just about the first time in my public life that I was not on the civil rights side," he says. "Jesse Jackson spoke out against me." Lieberman quickly came to the conclusion that Clinton's "mend it, don't end it" policy met his concerns, though the policy had the effect of keeping the entire apparatus of affirmative action intact.
Lieberman's political prospects, his capacity for leadership, are bracketed by his Humphrey-esque enthusiasm on the one side and his distaste for combat on the other. Lieberman says that the one thing he didn't like about the presidential campaign was "the against part" in which he was instructed to lambaste the rich and the powerful. Lieberman, like his fellow New Democrats, doesn't have a problem with the rich and the powerful, and he plainly didn't like pretending otherwise. The script, he says, felt "too fixed, too 'inherent conflict,"' and he didn't deliver it very convincingly. 
Lieberman was a very happy warrior when he was working from a more congenial script, and he is widely credited with injecting life and even pleasure into a torpid campaign. Lieberman's supporters compare him to the ultimate athlete in the field, Bill Clinton ("in the good sense," they always add). But Lieberman lacks Clinton's inner drive, his passion, his genius for appearing fair-minded while he is sticking in the shiv. Lieberman really is fair-minded. There was that famously civil debate with Dick Cheney that Lieberman kicked off by saying that his mother had called him and said, "Sweetheart' -- as she is prone to call me -- remember, be positive and know that I will love you no matter what your opponent says about you."' This was classic warm-hearted Lieberman shtick, but it also amounted to unilateral disarmament. Lieberman seemed to be consciously offering a counterpoint to the growing bitterness of the presidential contest, which was not necessarily what the party needed. One former high-ranking Clinton aide, who professes the deepest personal admiration for Lieberman, says: "That was the night of Cheney's rehabilitation. Joe never said, 'How about those cop-killer bullets, Dick?' He should have taken the guy apart." (Lieberman says, and other campaign officials concur, that taking Cheney apart was not on the debate agenda.)
Lieberman and Al Gore made an odd couple -- perhaps anyone and Al Gore make an odd couple -- and with the campaign behind them they don't appear to be particularly close. The candidates and their wives had dinner a few months back; otherwise, Lieberman says, he and his former running mate "blackberry back and forth." But Lieberman says, rightly, that he would be just another senator if Gore had not plucked him from the ranks and that gratitude requires that he absolutely, positively, rule out a presidential bid if Gore decides to run. 
That, of course, is a great open question. Gore is already attending a series of non-fund-raising "thank you" events around the country, and he plans to establish a political action committee this summer. But many Democrats dread the prospect of Gore II and have encouraged the candidacy of virtually any Democratic senator with an idle presidential fantasy -- none of whom share Lieberman's sense of constraint. The current roster of wannabes and mightbes includes Senators John Kerry, John Edwards, Evan Bayh, Dick Gephardt, Joe Biden and Tom Daschle. One prominent Democratic fund-raiser and strategist puts Gore by himself in the first tier, Lieberman, Edwards, Gephardt and Daschle in the second, Bayh in the third and everyone else in the fourth. Others put Daschle in the second tier by himself, and still others take Kerry more seriously. The handicapping is all over the lot.
Lieberman's backers make the case that he is the one candidate who, like Bill Clinton, can hold on to the party's base and reach across to independents. He is a pro-business, pro-defense, pro-family-hour Democratic. For this very reason, Lieberman may have trouble with some of the party's interest groups. But his crossover appeal is unarguable, especially when it comes to matters of culture. As Al From, the founder and guiding spirit of the Democratic Leadership Council, says: "If you think about the liabilities the Democrats used to have running for president, it was always, 'Can't manage the economy' and 'Soft on crime.' Now one of the biggest vulnerabilities we have is that people who go to church regularly tend to vote Republican; married families with kids voted overwhelmingly for Bush. It's not the old economic issues; it's the new values issues. And that's Joe's strength."
Only a few skeptics believe that Lieberman's religion, or his religiosity, will count against him. Lieberman has a real gift, whether intuitive or conscious, for turning his supposed disadvantage to advantage. During the presidential campaign, he constantly repeated how very proud he was of the American people for taking an Orthodox Jew to their great Christian heart. This was, of course, transparent flattery, the idea being that the voter would be proud of him for being proud of them. Nowadays, he presents himself to audiences as a beneficiary of the great American tradition of tolerance for diversity, a man who stands on the shoulders of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy. I heard him tell a Jewish audience in Washington that his campaign "says to kids you don't have to hide who you are in order to be successful in America." It is sentiments like this that make even mildly ironic people wince.
Still, nobody ever got elected as the irony candidate. Lieberman is, in his own way, an all-American -- i.e., Christian -- character, earnest, hokey, friendly and sincere as all get-out. He is religiously Jewish and ethnically Fifties. If he has a drawback, it is probably not his religion; it is the Mr. Rogers thing. After all, nice guys don't always finish last, but they don't usually finish first either.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for GEORGE WARRINGTON; 
Amtrak, Pulled in Two Directions

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
AMTRAK is again in serious financial trouble, and last week, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta disclosed that the railroad was trying to mortgage part of Penn Station in New York to make ends meet until the next fiscal year begins in October. He suggested that the railroad consider giving up its national system and concentrate on the East and West Coasts, plus service from Chicago to Detroit, New Orleans and a few other cities. 
 George Warrington, Amtrak's president, was not thrilled to hear that from the secretary, whom President Bush is expected to appoint soon to Amtrak's board. Mr. Warrington has been pursuing an opposite strategy of adding service, while asserting for months that Amtrak should be free of federal operating subsidies by 2003. On Friday, he discussed some of his proposals. MATTHEW L. WALD 

Q. Why is Amtrak in bad financial shape?

A. For 30 years, Amtrak has suffered from mission conflict. From Day 1 it was undercapitalized, and it was directed and mandated by the Congress to run a national system. As Secretary John Anthony Volpe at that time indicated, it was expected to be profitable in a classic commercial sense in three years. Those expectations were always unrealistic. Overlayed on top of that in the late 1990's was an incompatible mandate from Congress of operating self-sufficiency. With those conflicting missions, all public policy makers have sidestepped the question of what they and America want from its intercity rail system.

Q. With the high cost of gasoline and the ordeals of air travel, this seems like a great opportunity for an expansion of train travel. Why hasn't this happened?

A. It's clearly happened in a number of corridors all across the country. We've had four consecutive years of record ridership and revenue growth.
There was a period of shrinkage in the mid-90's. One of the consequences of that was more revenue was lost than cost saved. We have worked very hard to transform both the service package, the image, the brand and the quality of train service, with very limited capital, with very little in the way of resources.

Q. Amtrak is preparing to mortgage Penn Station to raise the $300 million it says it needs to keep operating through the fiscal year. What are the risks of such a step?

A. There are no risks.
The structure of the transaction, which I can't discuss in detail, is very carefully designed to protect all interests, and those include all the users, the federal government, Amtrak and the investors.

Q. Will Amtrak have to go back to Congress and ask for more money?

A. No. We had a conscious choice we could have made a year ago: Would we behave like the old Amtrak and go back hat in hand and ask for a bailout to deal with unforeseen, or uncontrollable events, or would we behave in a much smarter and commercially successful way, and solve this problem ourselves? We made a conscious decision that Amtrak had a long history of expecting others to bail us out. Frankly, I made a decision that that's not the way we're doing business any more.

Q. What can be done to put Amtrak on the right financial track for good? And should it continue as a national railroad?

A. We spend about 1 percent of all federal transportation spending on intercity rail service. If you go to France or Germany, any of our global economic competitors, the share of domestic federal spending ranges between roughly 20 and 28 percent.
What we have urged is a 20-year plan that would raise that level of federal commitment from 1 percent, to 2.5 percent of all domestic federal spending on transportation infrastructure, to about $1.5 billion a year. Do we want to provide communities around America with essential rail service that links communities and provides choices, or some other sort of system, a handful of corridors, or some combination of both? Successive administrations and Congresses have basically sidestepped that question for many, many years. What I am urging is not only a discussion, but closure around what America wants and what policy makers want from an intercity system.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH/BOB COSTAS; 
For the Prudent Son, All Risky Bets Are Off

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
THERE is no way that the television sportscaster Bob Costas, at 5 feet 7 and 49 years of age, could compete on a basketball court against Shaquille O'Neal, the star center of the Los Angeles Lakers. But Mr. Costas once went one-on-one against Shaq in an investment contest. And lost.
 Or did he? 
 In an E*Trade promotion in 1998, each celebrity picked a hypothetical portfolio of six stocks, aiming for the best performance in a typical time horizon for a day trader: six weeks. Mr. O'Neal, who bragged that he was a "digital type guy," posted an 18.7 percent gain by picking Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell Computer, EarthLink, Amazon.com and SportsLine USA (now SportsLine.com Inc.).
That dwarfed the 1.2 percent that Mr. Costas mustered from his choices: Quaker Oats, General Electric, Anheuser-Busch, Monsanto (now part of Pharmacia), the Tribune Company and Lucent Technologies. 
"I picked 'em the way an old lady picks horses at the racetrack: by personal connection and by whim," Mr. Costas said in a recent interview.
Yet considered in a real-life, longer-term investment horizon, Mr. Costas's picks are doing very well, thank you. His conservative choices would have shown a 34.2 percent gain by now, compared with a 12.8 percent gain for Mr. O'Neal's portfolio, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Costas's approach to that contest says much about his attitude toward money -- a view heavily influenced in his childhood by a father who was an inveterate gambler. Mr. Costas, known for his preppy looks and astute interviewing skill, has avoided the speculative and flamboyant. He sought to minimize risk, invested for the long term and has been a disciplined saver -- strategies aimed at ensuring stability in his personal as well as his financial life.
As he built a national reputation in an industry where celebrity is mostly local, Mr. Costas amassed a fortune estimated at $15 million to $20 million -- neither he nor his advisers would discuss specific amounts -- more than enough to live a life of luxury anywhere in the world. Yet he lives with his wife and two children in a home built for the family in 1989 on an acre in Town & Country, Mo., an affluent suburb of St. Louis. That home, his sole residence, is probably worth about $2 million today.
Mr. Costas says he would not know what to do with a second home or with many of the other customary trappings of celebrity. Indeed, several years ago, he sold a vacation house in St. Petersburg, Fla., because the family used it so rarely.
Each year, he plows about 25 percent of his pretax income into investments. It is not that he is hoarding money toward an early retirement. He just wants to be assured of having the flexibility to make choices that are not dictated by money now, as well as of a comfortable lifestyle in the future.
That is where his father, John, who died in 1970, comes in.
One day last month, Mr. Costas recalled how, when he was 8, his father moved the family -- Bob, his younger sister, Valerie, and mother, Jayne -- from Long Island to Redondo Beach, Calif. To this day, Mr. Costas does not know whether they moved because his father got a new job as an electrical engineer or because he was fleeing angry bookies and gambling debts stemming from his obsession with betting on sporting events.
"There were times when we drove with my father to a doughnut shop in Brooklyn," Mr. Costas said during an interview in his unpretentious three-room suite in an office park here. "There, a guy named Al, trying to be casual, would slip a paper bag across the counter with $14,000 in it."
There were losses, too. Once, when Mr. Costas was about 11, he accompanied his father to a parking lot, where the elder Mr. Costas handed a man $5,000.
"I thought it was very weird," Mr. Costas recalled. "The guy was making small talk."
Mr. Costas recounted a boyhood that was punctuated by frequent moves and that lurched with the highs and lows of his father's wins and losses. He spoke with the blend of insight and professional distance that have made him one of the most successful and self-assured interviewers in professional sports -- a world filled with huge egos and hair-trigger tempers. It often seemed as if he had prepared as much for this interview as he does for his coverage of the Olympics, and yet his talk lacked the flashes of quick wit that characterize his on-screen persona -- perhaps because the topic made him slightly uncomfortable.
The financial swings in his childhood were clearly a source of tension. "My mother wasn't thrilled when you have to dip in to the family account to pay off some guys who don't like to be paid in installments," he said. "We always had food on the table and a roof over our heads, but there may have been some times when the bank account was spread thin, when we had to draw out a few grand out to pay off some guy named Lefty Luke."
Still, Mr. Costas and his father bonded over sports, and the family shared good times. "Growing up had anxiety and it was unsettling, but it was entertaining and colorful, and had a certain romance to it," Mr. Costas said. He expressed compassion for his father's obsession: "Gamblers say they are doing it for their family. They believe the family will be able to move to a better house. They will have additional security."
But his father never hit the jackpot, and he had been living so close to the edge that there wasn't much money left when he died of a heart attack at 42, when Bob was 18. He had to get several scholarships so that he could attend Syracuse University.
During summers, he worked at odd jobs; then, in his senior year, he snared one calling minor league hockey games on a radio station. That took some moxie: Lacking experience with hockey games, he sent off some tapes of himself calling basketball games, with the excuse that " 'I don't have any of my hockey tapes on hand at the moment,' " he said.
AS an investor, Mr. Costas is as patient and concerned with steady accumulation of investments as his father had been hooked on quick winnings. His strategy has centered on equities, broadly diversified to minimize cyclical market and economic risk. 
According to several people close to him, Mr. Costas now earns about $3 million a year, making him one of the highest-paid sportscasters in the nation. His income comes from his contract at NBC, where he is host for Olympics coverage and where he has recently worked on the Triple Crown and the N.B.A. playoffs, and from his 12-week HBO series, "On the Record With Bob Costas," first broadcast in February and scheduled to run next year as well.
Since 1985, his finances have been managed by Katherine Lintz. Ms. Lintz, who had worked with sports agents as a financial planner for their clients, founded Financial Management Partners, a St. Louis firm that specializes in advising athletes and other sports personalities.
Almost all of Mr. Costas's long-term investments are in plain-vanilla, liquid assets. Roughly 25 percent stays in blue-chip stocks like Cisco, Berkshire Hathaway, AOL Time Warner, Merck, Microsoft, Disney, Wells Fargo and Intel, Ms. Lintz said. His largest positions are in Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Qualcomm.
For exposure to other industries, an additional 20 percent or so is in mutual funds like ICAP Equity Portfolio, a large-cap value fund run by Institutional Capital, of Chicago. The diversification program also includes putting 10 percent of Mr. Costas's capital in Oakmark Select, primarily a midcap value fund; 10 percent in international funds like ICAP Euro Select Equity Portfolio; 11 percent into technology funds and private equity and venture capital investments, 20 percent into municipal bonds and 4 percent in cash.
In 1998, his investments rose by a weighted average of about 18 percent, Ms. Lintz said. A year later, the gain was 34 percent. But last year, on a weighted basis, the portfolio lost 7 percent, as Ms. Lintz suffered what she called her first down year in 11 years of investment management. Still, that was better than the 10.1 percent decline of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. So far this year, the portfolio is down 1.6 percent, while the S.& P. has lost more than 3 percent.
Mr. Costas said he was definitely staying with Ms. Lintz. "Over all, she's done a very good job," he said, "and I feel comfortable with her."
The sportscaster's relatively modest style of living, meanwhile, gives him a freedom he highly values: to work only on assignments he wants.
Doing something he loves has always been crucial to Mr. Costas, and early on, he knew that meant doing something involving sports.
As a child, he would sit in his father's car in the driveway, twisting the radio dial to catch a game. At night, he would often crawl under the covers and sneak a listen to whatever baseball games his transistor radio could pick up. Baseball, with its rich history, has always been his favorite sport.
Determined to become a sportscaster, Mr. Costas began his career in 1974 with stints at the student TV and radio stations at Syracuse, which is known for turning out top sportscasters like Marv Albert. Mr. Costas quit college one semester short of a degree to do basketball play-by-play for KMOX radio in St. Louis. ("I don't have a sheepskin," he acknowledged a bit ruefully.)
Barry Frank, then head of CBS Sports, recalled hearing Mr. Costas in 1976. "He was the eighth man in a seven-man rotation of sportscasters." Two years later, after Mr. Frank had moved to IMG, the sports management firm, he called Mr. Costas. "I think you are going to go places," Mr. Frank said he told him. "You ought to have an agent." The men have worked together ever since.
Mr. Frank negotiated a contract with NBC for Mr. Costas to do play by play for different sports. "The rest is history," said Mr. Frank, whose clients also include the sports commentators Jim Nantz and Greg Gumbel.
INDEED, Mr. Costas has a 66 percent recognition rating among American adults, compared with 32 percent for the average national sportscaster. In addition, 16 percent of those familiar with Mr. Costas rate him as one of their favorite personalities -- compared to the 11 percent on this "Q" score for the average national sportscaster, according to Marketing Evaluations/ TVQ Inc., a Manhassett, N.Y., concern that tracks the popularity of TV personalities and performers.
Though neither Mr. Frank nor Mr. Costas would be specific about earnings, several sports experts said that in Mr. Costas's early years at NBC, starting in 1980, he made about $300,000, rising to $500,000 in 1983. By 1987, Mr. Costas had passed the $1 million mark, and by 1993 reached an estimated $2 million. Today he is said to earn about $3 million.
Mr. Costas said it was not so much the size of his paycheck as the growing interest in his work by several networks that made him first feel financially secure. "It was when you began to feel that there will be another contract, because you always got to prove yourself worthy of another one," he said.
That happened around the mid-1980's. "Even if the people you work with value your services and believe in their own hearts they want to be fair, you need another bidder" when you get into negotiations, he said.
Mr. Frank said Mr. Costas paid very close attention, not so much to the money as to the terms of any deal he struck. "To him, the things he had to do -- the assignments -- were more important," Mr. Frank said.
Mr. Costas added: "I have never subscribed to the notion that he who dies with the most wins. If you have enough to, on the spur of the moment, do something that you would enjoy or people you care about would enjoy, then you would have enough.
"That does not mean I am offering my services for free," said Mr. Costas, whose agent is one of the toughest in the business. "It just means that money is not the thing that guides me."
When he was negotiating to write "Fair Ball," an analysis of and proposed solution for problems facing baseball, several publishers were rumored to be willing to pay him as much as $2 million for an autobiographical book with some of his sports experiences."But that was not the book I wanted to do," Mr. Costas said.
To do the one he wanted, Mr. Costas signed with Broadway Books, for a reported $400,000. "Fair Ball," published last year, quickly became a best seller, which most likely meant several hundred thousand more in royalties. Mr. Costas donated it all to the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps retired baseball professionals.
Mr. Costas says his heroes are "people who honor a contract and live it out." He points to Mark McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinals first baseman who hit 70 home runs in 1998, erasing Roger Maris's record of 61 set in 1961.
"He was making $11 million and now he is making $15 million," Mr. Costas said. "It is a crazy world where someone making $15 million is seen as self-sacrificing, but relatively speaking, he is. What you look for in a hero is not some vow of poverty, but some sense of perspective and proportion."
And generosity of spirit.
At the 1995 funeral of another of his heroes, Mickey Mantle, Mr. Costas spoke of the former Yankee's role in the American consciousness: "When he was hot, we felt great. When he slumped or got hurt, we sagged a bit too."
Yet in a conversation about Mantle with a reporter from The New York Times soon afterward, Mr. Costas said it was not only Mantle's baseball skills that touched him. He recalled seeing Mantle carrying a box of leftovers from a restaurant to a homeless man living in a box on Madison Avenue. "The guy appeared to be startled, and saw it was Mantle," Mr. Costas said. "His face softened, and it was clear he'd seen him before, and he said, 'Oh, hi, Mick.' "
Associates say Mr. Costas is also very generous. Aside from helping his mother and other family members, they say, he has endowed a scholarship fund at Syracuse for undergraduates with an interest in broadcast journalism. 
But Mr. Costas bristles when asked for details. He has a charitable foundation, the associates add, but it is not in his name, and he will not discuss it.
"No matter how innocently you talk about it, it can seem as if you are talking publicly," Mr. Costas said.
THOUGH Mr. Costas joined the big leagues long ago, he still lives here, in the home he built 12 years ago, because his wife's family is nearby. When taping his HBO program, he commutes to Manhattan, staying at a hotel.
The house is nicely appointed in casual country style, but it does not boast costly or formal antiques, and is clearly a home designed around a young family. Not that it could be mistaken for a starter home: It has more than 7,000 square feet and a swimming pool. Mr. Costas drives a BMW 750 while his wife, Randy, has a sport utility vehicle.
"I don't think twice about spending money" for things that he and his family enjoy, he said -- for example, a monthlong trip to Australia centered on the 2000 Summer Olympics.
His offices are relatively simple, with a staff of two -- an executive secretary and an executive assistant -- and unremarkable furnishings. The office's special character comes from the photographs that cover its walls, including one of Bobby Kennedy with Mickey Mantle and a 1927 team photo of the Yankees; the cases of baseball bats, one signed by Ted Williams and another by members of the 500 Home Run Club; and a collection of sports books that overflows from the bookcases to piles on the floor.
Still, for all his unpretentiousness, Mr. Costas is hardly oblivious to his public image. He objects when described as a preppy dresser, for example, arguing that his taste is simply conservative. And his friend Maury Povich, the talk-show host, with whom he shares a makeup person, said Mr. Costas was "very serious about his hair."
"We all try to hide our ego," Mr. Povich said, unable to resist the opportunity to kid his friend. "But in the makeup room, it all comes out."
Mr. Costas's choice of Ms. Lintz's firm as the family's investment manager also shows his seriousness.
Financial Management Partners makes its money by charging a relatively modest 0.5 percent annually of the value of a client's portfolio. It maximizes its fee income by insisting that clients commit to aggressive savings goals. Ms. Lintz said she presses her clients to invest 25 percent to 40 percent of their pretax income with the firm.
She has become tough, she explained, because so many athletes spend their money as soon as they get it, leaving themselves no chance for financial security.
"If a sportscaster makes $2 million, he or she should save $500,000, or 25 percent," Ms. Lintz said. "In addition, there are a lot of business expenses, including an agent fee of 10 percent and expenses in running an office. Take away taxes and charity, and a person with that income should have a target budget of about $200,000 or $300,000. You can't have lifestyles of the rich and famous and still be saving a bunch."
Of course, the pressure to save is greater with athletes than with sportscasters, whose careers tend to last a lot longer. But Mr. Costas still meets the firm's aggressive annual savings target, Ms. Lintz says.
HIS relative lack of interest in conspicuous consumption seems to be shared by his family. Mr. Costas met his wife, a former third-grade teacher, in 1980 when he came to speak at the Weber School, which has since closed, in St. Louis. After they married, in 1983, she stopped working.
She does have some interest in investing. "She belongs to a little investing club," is how Mr. Costas put it. "It is more of a social thing, but it only involves a few hundred dollars."
But when it comes to the family finances, Ms. Lintz said: "Randy is as involved as Bob, and she gets pleasure out of investing for their children. I talk to them both about broad issues. I will call Bob on the big accounts and Randy on the kid accounts. She is very conscious of educating the kids on the value of money."
Their son, Keith, who is 15, and daughter, Taylor, 11, both of whom attend private school, "get a modest allowance," Mr. Costas said.
"We don't make a big deal over the family's means," he added. "And to the extent that we talk about work and career, it is with the idea of work and career that they would find interesting, not the money involved."
Making decisions without worrying about money is, of course, a far cry from from his own childhood.

HEADLINE: The World: Mr. Putin, Meet Mr. Bush; 
Who Needs Treaties?

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TO speak about Russia, it has been said, is to discuss the future of the world. America resumes its historic dialogue with Russia on Saturday when President Bush sits down for his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, and it is a broad future indeed that they will consider.
 To the extent that their afternoon discussion marks the formal start of negotiations between the two leaders on missile defense, the meeting holds the prospect of revising, for good or ill, the entire way the world will think about nuclear security for the next generation. 
 Will it be based on the interwoven series of treaties written during the cold war -- treaties that gave Americans and Soviets whatever sense of security they had that nobody would pull a nuclear trigger one night and blow the whole world up? The cold war is dead, and with it the terror in the night, but does that mean the treaties no longer make sense? And if they don't, what replaces them? Are there new understandings that can be reached to prevent the emergence of a new rivalry and a new arms race?
All that will be potentially on the table next weekend in Ljubljana, Slovenia -- an interesting place for such a discussion, lying as it does between the old East and West, in a country that didn't even exist during the cold war. 
Formally, the discussion will be about the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, from which the Bush dministration has repeatedly said the United States should release itself. The 1972 agreement enshrined vulnerability as a virtue by barring both superpowers from building a credible national defense, and administration officials now say it should have been allowed to fall with the Berlin Wall; it was, after all, based on the notion that the only way to control cold war animosities was to make nuclear war a synonym for mutual suicide.
These days, President Bush is saying a missile defense would also allow America to make deep cuts in its nuclear arsenal, even perhaps unilaterally; this, at least is a goal welcomed by members of the arms control community who don't much like Mr. Bush's pursuit of missile defenses.
But in framing these proposals, the president is asking some remarkably challenging -- his critics might say dangerous -- questions about nuclear theology. They go far beyond the ABM Treaty, or even the relationship with Russia.
President Bush is imagining, and some of his senior officials are advocating, a new kind of security relationship with Russia, and other countries like China. Built not on a foundation of concrete arms control treaties, it would radically restructure how Washington and Moscow traditionally guaranteed stability and predictability and peace itself.
Arms control pacts, the administration argues, have inherent flaws: they freeze time from the day they are signed -- or from the moment negotiations begin. Many of President Bush's senior appointees have negotiated treaties for previous presidents, and believe the process is bulky, slow, prone to problems in the Senate and not responsive to America's current security needs.
These days, the officials say, arms treaties with Russia bring insecurity instead of certainty, because they seem to confirm a reality -- the balance of terror -- that no longer exists; because they don't let either side take advantage of new technologies to defend against missiles; and because they don't take account of emerging new threats to both signatories. 
That's the intellectual's argument, anyway. A brawnier complaint -- against allowing virtually any treaties, not just the old cold war ones, to frame America's security architecture -- is also heard in administration corridors and in Senate confirmation hearings. It says that in a world of proliferating weapons of mass destruction, and of the means to deliver them great distances, treaties only bind those who intend to keep them and offer legal cover to cheaters.
But critics of the administration's long-term strategy say those comments are disingenuous, that they shift attention from a campaign to create a world in which America is unbound from its line-by-line obligations, free to pursue its self-interests unfettered by treaty law.
These advocates of a treaty-based security regime point to decades in which arms agreements spelled out rights and responsibilities clearly enough to guarantee stable relations. Even if those laws now need updating, this argument goes, living under them is far safer than living in a world without any laws.
When they hear the Bush brief, the Russians and Europeans of course want to know: What would replace this aging arms control architecture? No administration official can say for sure, beyond a promise that it will be the subject of serious consultations in Moscow and NATO's capitals.
The administration, it seems, is imagining not negotiations on discrete arms control treaties, but separate meetings over months and years, bilateral and multilateral, on a range of security issues to lay down broad new rules of international relations.
IN a way, the meeting on Saturday will be the first test of that way of doing things, because a general understanding about missile defenses is the matter at hand.
Knowing how skeptical Europeans (and the Senate's majority Democrats) are, the administration has been drafting incentives for Russian cooperation on missile defense that really could become markers toward a broader relationship with Russia. They don't only focus on managing nuclear arms -- perhaps with some aspects of a missile defense built and operated with Russia -- but include language on halting proliferation, a grave Russian concern along its southern periphery; on resolving bloody regional disputes that dot Russia's outskirts; and on assuring a steady regimen of economic assistance. Some of the ideas are old. A few are fresh. Nobody expects them to be enough for Russia to dismantle the ABM Treaty, but administration officials say they are just an initial offering.
What begins Saturday, then, is a process of two presidents groping for new terms to define trust -- and if not trust, well, at least understanding, and if not understanding at least an agreed vocabulary for clarifying what both sides want and need.
THE language itself is interesting. The administration is consciously stepping back from the tone unilateralism it was using earlier this year. An attempt has begun at conversation with Russia -- and Europe -- about the trust that can be placed in America's management of the alliance's security relationship with Russia. 
At home, the tension between those who cite the stability brought by arms control treaties and those who challenge their usefulness was on display last week as the Senate Armed Services Committee reviewed some of President Bush's appointments to the Department of Defense.
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, argued that killing the ABM Treaty without Russian assent could prompt Russia to keep a large arsenal of multiple-warhead missiles. "Would that fact," he asked, "be worthy of consideration by us relative to the question of whether we'd be more or less secure?" He also suggested that China might further expand its nuclear forces. And he challenged Douglas J. Feith, nominated to be under secretary of defense for policy, over writings in which he had argued that the ABM Treaty ceased to exist with the death of the Soviet Union, and that described the Chemical Weapons Convention as "junk arms control."
Mr. Feith responded: "If we make agreements that we can't enforce and that we have good reason to believe are going to be violated and are going to be open to countries that enter them cynically and in bad faith, the overall consequence of that over time is to cheapen the currency that we should really be preserving the value of."
Whatever logic and accuracy are bundled into the Bush arguments, many in Europe and Russia hear the reprise of unilateralism. They fear a world in which the United States, or any nation, can brag of slashing its warheads because the balance of terror is dead -- and, therefore, so are the treaties that regulated it. That, they say, is also a world in which that same nation can rebuild its arsenal to any level, anytime it wants.
In any event, another question will also be carried into Saturday's meeting and beyond: whether the Bush and Putin administrations are capable of reaching a new understanding on security -- or whether the leaders will talk past each other over the din of shorter-term political considerations.
Is there an incentive for Russia to sign off on anything anytime soon? Not unless America can forge allied consensus on missile defense. Does Mr. Putin risk anything by withholding his answer for too long? Certainly, since missile defense advocates would describe Russian intransigence as the final reason to move ahead, and quickly.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Revising Energy Policy to Address Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
Barely three weeks after the White House issued President Bush's new energy blueprint, some top officials are backing away from its projections of how much coal, oil and gas the United States will burn in the years ahead.
 At the same time, they are preparing to announce new steps to address global warming, accepting the scientific evidence that warming is occurring because of human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels. The steps include spending programs meant to reduce energy consumption or increase the use of clean energy sources like wind and solar power. 
 Administration officials said the energy strategy, a 170-page document prepared over three months by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney, was a "statement of reality" rather than a vision of the nation's energy future. They said some of its most striking projections were intended to call people's attention to energy needs but not to predict how administration policies would ultimately affect energy production and use. 
The recasting of the energy policy is a response to criticism that it did not take into account the problem of global warming, a topic that European nations are expected to raise on the president's trip there next week. European leaders expressed alarm in March when Mr. Bush abandoned the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty intended to curtail global warming.
Mr. Bush plans to make a statement on Monday that reiterates his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol as "fatally flawed in fundamental ways," but promises to work within the framework of United Nations environmental negotiations to come up with "an effective and science based response," according to a summary of his statement that the White House circulated on Capitol Hill today. A copy was provided by the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group that favors the Kyoto agreement.
Mr. Bush will order cabinet agencies to develop "creative ways" of addressing the problem, "drawing on the power of markets and technology," the summary said.
I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, told environmentalists this week that the administration had miscommunicated some elements of the plan, said several people who attended a White House meeting to discuss the environment.
Mr. Libby noted that the administration had relied on "business as usual" projections from the Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, to describe a critical energy shortfall. An example is Mr. Cheney's often repeated estimate that the nation will need at least 1,300 new power plants by 2020. But the Bush team did not intend to suggest that it agreed with the same agency's business-as-usual estimates of how all those new power plants would affect concentrations of the so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
"Those numbers are sober projections," an administration official said. "They are bad numbers that make people realize that we have to do something. It's a statement of reality, not a projection of where we would like to take things."
This appears to be a significant shift. When they unveiled their energy strategy in May, Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and other administration officials did not describe its projections in that way.
A cabinet-level committee is still developing a global-warming strategy. But Mr. Bush's statement on Monday will reiterate that there are still some uncertainties in the science of climate projections, that developing countries must participate more fully in reducing emissions and that any plan must ensure continuing economic growth -- all signs of the administration's ambivalence.
Mr. Bush is expected to eventually propose new money for research and development of global warming-related technologies, going beyond the roughly $10 billion in projected spending outlined in the energy plan. He will also call for more research into global warming itself.
Some administration experts have also experimented with projections of future energy production and use to see how they would affect climate change. These include a potential doubling of nuclear power's share of electricity production, since those power plants emit no greenhouse gases, and a much greater emphasis on renewable energy, like wind and solar power.
The Energy Information Administration projects that without policy changes, emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping pollutant, will increase by about 35 percent by 2020. Though the statistics on energy production underlying that projection are scattered throughout the Bush team's energy report, the estimate of greenhouse gas emissions is not mentioned.
The report focused mainly on increasing domestic supplies of energy to meet demand at moderate prices. It embraced the use of coal-fired power plants, which emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. It supported the use of renewable energy sources but used the Energy Information Administration's estimates to conclude that they would at best account for a tiny proportion of energy output in 2020.
Critics argue that the strategy should have aggressively promoted new energy sources and conservation programs.
Administration officials said that although they relied mainly on the information agency's numbers, they had always intended to find ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions beyond what that agency projects.
They said that some recommendations in the energy report -- tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles and a push for more nuclear power, for example -- would reduce the use of fossil fuels below the projections of the energy agency.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Energy Crisis in Brazil Is Bringing Dimmer Lights and Altered Lives" (front page, June 6):
 Brazil's Congress invited me to speak recently regarding the electricity crises there and in California. 
Brazil is heavily dependent on hydropower, but its reservoirs hold as much as five years of supply, so drought is not the problem. Rather, onerous rules imposed by international lending institutions during a debt restructuring demanded privatization and forbade the electric system from building new capacity. 
 The need for additional generation was well understood, and the utility had the money to build. But the same private generators that are looting California won't build until guaranteed exorbitant profits with almost no risk.
Brazil's problem is not a drought but the policy of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.

HEADLINE: In America; 
Refusing To Save Africans

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Giving the back of his hand to the suffering of millions, a key Bush administration official is opposing any extensive use of the life-extending anti-AIDS drugs in Africa, insisting that the health care infrastructure is too primitive and that Africans, in most cases, are incapable of following the regimen.
 As head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Andrew Natsios is the administration's point man on foreign aid. In an interview with The Boston Globe, he said the money raised by a new global fund to fight AIDS should be used almost entirely for prevention services, not for the antiretroviral drugs that have been so successful in extending the lives of people infected with H.I.V. 
 Painting with a very broad brush, Mr. Natsios said attempting to get the drugs to Africans any time soon would not be worth the effort because of the difficulties posed by a lack of roads, shortages of doctors and hospitals, wars and other problems. 
According to Mr. Natsios, the problems extend to the Africans themselves. Many Africans, he told The Globe, "don't know what Western time is. You have to take these (AIDS) drugs a certain number of hours each day, or they don't work. Many people in Africa have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives. And if you say, one o'clock in the afternoon, they do not know what you are talking about. They know morning, they know noon, they know evening, they know the darkness at night."
This view of Africans as so ignorant they can't master the concept of taking their medicine on time has become a touchstone of the Bush administration. Back in April, The Times's Joseph Kahn reported on concerns voiced by an unnamed senior Treasury Department official: "He said Africans lacked a requisite 'concept of time,' implying that they would not benefit from drugs that must be administered on tight time schedules."
Africans may be dying by the millions from AIDS, but the brutal stereotyping of the Dark Continent lives on, encouraged by U.S. government officials who should know better.
Mr. Natsios's primary response to the epidemic that is roaring like a fireball across southern Africa is to just say no. "Just keep talking about prevention," he told The Globe. "That is the strategy we're using -- even though I'll be beaten up and get bruises all over me from the fights on the subject."
Mr. Natsios may not realize it, but just talking about prevention has failed. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 25 million people are infected with H.I.V., and more than 17 million have already died. In South Africa, which is being brought to its knees by this epidemic, the rate of infection for all people 15 to 45 years old has nearly reached 20 percent.
The United States, a rich and healthy nation, cannot close its eyes to suffering on such a colossal scale. There is medication available to ease the suffering and its cost is coming down. Now the steps must be taken to get the medicine to the people in need.
I spoke with Mr. Natsios last Thursday. He conceded that in South Africa and the country with the worst outbreak of AIDS in the world, Botswana, the health care infrastructure is, in fact, pretty good.
As for the difficulty Africans or anyone else might have following the daily antiretroviral regimen, now might be a good time to burst a widely held misconception. Antiretroviral therapy does not always require patients to take dozens of pills a day.
"Our patients take two pills in the morning and two pills in the evening. That's it," said Toby Kasper, an official with Doctors Without Borders, which recently established an antiretroviral therapy program for patients in a village in South Africa.
The trend in drug therapies -- in the U.S. and elsewhere -- is toward newer, more consolidated regimens that are easier to follow.
Mr. Natsios reluctantly acknowledged that some limited use of antiretroviral treatment in Africa may be O.K., and he said he didn't mean to offend anyone with his comments about African concepts of time.
The truth is that both prevention and drug therapy are desperately needed in Africa.
No one believes antiretrovirals can be effectively administered in countries that are at war, or in areas devoid of doctors and hospitals or clinics. But there is a role for antiretroviral therapy to play in the catastrophe in sub-Saharan Africa. And it would be to the everlasting shame of the United States if its officials proved to be a barrier to that kind of life-saving treatment.

HEADLINE: Air Travel's Next Generation 

BYLINE:  By James Fallows; James Fallows, national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, is author of "Free Flight: From Airline Hell to a New Age of Travel."

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration has announced a 10-year, $11 billion plan to modernize the air travel system and reduce snarl. The plan is great as far as it goes. It is an amalgam of dozens of incremental improvements. Many are already working on a trial basis, and each will do a little good. For instance, a new runway at a busy airport can add 1 percent to overall airline traffic capacity. The F.A.A. proposes building new runways at 15 busy airports. Together it says its measures should add 30 percent to total system capacity by 2010.
 Unfortunately, demand for air travel is expected to grow at least twice that fast in the same period. So if the F.A.A.'s innovations all work as advertised, we can look forward to crowds, delays and congestion even worse than today's. Hope for a more dramatic solution will rest on new ways of looking at commercial aviation and less publicized government initiatives now under development. 
 Most of the F.A.A.'s plan is a catch-up effort, deploying overdue technical improvements. For instance, while airlines plan their routes on a continental basis, figuring out the best course from Miami to Chicago, each controller administers a little sector of airspace. When plans change -- often because of thunderstorms -- there is no quick or easy way to adjust the flow of traffic. The computers that can route billions of data packets across the Internet can easily reroute a stream of airplanes, and the F.A.A. will make better use of them. Other computer-based sensors and improvements will allow planes to safely fly closer together than they do now. By the end of this decade the F.A.A. plans a shift from the clumsy voice-based air traffic control system to high-speed "digital data links," transmitting bursts of data like those in instant messaging systems. 
What the F.A.A. has not addressed is a deeper question: essentially, whether transportation can follow an Internet-style model of dispersed, rather than congested, activity.
The root of today's air travel problem is a combination of airline deregulation and airplane design. Airlines have learned that customers value cheap tickets more than anything else. For tickets to be cheap, planes must be full. And for large, modern passenger planes to stay full, they must travel hub-and-spoke routes, forcing passengers to go through Denver or Dallas when they want to get to Albuquerque.
The result is economies of scale for the airlines but congestion for the passenger. Seventy percent of airline traffic now goes through 31 airports.
An Internet-style solution would reduce congestion by using more of the several thousand airports in America that can handle all but the largest planes. What is needed are precision-guidance systems to allow bad-weather landings at more small airports, plus jet airplanes that are as safe, comfortable and fast as modern airliners -- but are small and cheap enough to operate profitably with a dozen or fewer passengers per trip. Expensive versions of such planes already exist: corporate jets.
For more than a decade, NASA has quietly supported the development of radically cheaper small jets that could serve as "air taxis," taking passengers nonstop from, say, Savannah to Dubuque. NASA's efforts are in line with its historic role as a sponsor of aviation research as well as space research. In fact, NASA evolved from the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, founded in 1917 to promote aviation.
At the Bush administration's request, NASA is now at work on a sweeping blueprint for future travel options, to be presented to Vice President Dick Cheney in September. The agency has been asked to identify the most promising new engine technologies, aircraft designs, guidance systems and other features that could allow a real escape from the ever slower hub-and-spoke travel system. Fulfilling this ambition could take the ingenuity, planning and teamwork of NASA's missions of the 1960's, but if the effort is approached with NASA's old confidence, the benefits could be immense.

HEADLINE: U.S. LOSING STATUS AS A WORLD LEADER IN CLIMATE SCIENCE 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In little more than a decade, the United States has fallen significantly behind other countries in its ability to simulate and predict long-term shifts in climate, according to a wide range of scientists and recent federal studies.
 This slide in status has occurred amid a growing scientific consensus that rising levels of heat-trapping emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes are warming the climate and could become the biggest environmental problem of the next 100 years. 
 President Bush plans to use a Rose Garden speech on global warming policy today to propose several ways to improve the situation, government officials say, including an increase in money for basic climate research and an effort to coordinate American climate-modeling efforts with those abroad.
But many climate experts say that the problems are deep-rooted, and that a clearer picture of the local and global impact of coming climate shifts will emerge only if there is a substantial shuffling of the scientific bureaucracy and permanent support for basic monitoring of climate-influencing factors like the ebb and flow of greenhouse gases.
American researchers have repeatedly had to go to Europe or Japan to find computers capable of handling their most ambitious climate analyses. The most recent international effort to assess links between global warming and human activities, completed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this year, relied mainly on European models. 
Over all, many experts conclude, advanced climate research in the United States is fragmented among an alphabet soup of agencies, strained by inadequate computing power and starved for the basic measurements of real-world conditions that are needed to improve simulations.
While Britain and Japan have poured tens of millions of dollars into computing centers focused on long-term climate research, budgets for similar efforts in the United States have been flat at best, and the work is done at dispersed research centers run by a variety of federal agencies.
"We have groups doing numerical weather prediction, hurricanes, climate, oceans, but in the international arena, countries have whole institutions doing the functions of these individual groups," said Dr. Ronald J. Stouffer, who designs and runs climate models at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., a top Commerce Department center for weather and climate work. 
Improving each aspect of climate analysis is essential, many experts say, if the country is to move from pondering what to do about a general warming trend to considering consequences for particular regions and the likely impact on agriculture, ecosystems and water supplies.
"What really matters to people is, does the wheat belt move north, how much does sea level rise, does California lose its water supply?" said Dr. Larry Smarr, a computer scientist at the University of California, San Diego, who helped establish the American network of academic supercomputing centers in the 1980's. 
But, he said, the limits on detail and power in computer models for American researchers are like those facing a "nearsighted person who's lost his glasses."
"Twelve or 13 years ago," Dr. Smarr said, "we took it for granted that the U.S. was in the lead on everything from weather prediction to climate modeling." Europe is leading in long-term and day-to-day forecasting.
"I've watched over the last decade in horror," he said. "It's almost like benign neglect."
The problems in climate science have been identified in a lengthening string of reports by the National Academy of Sciences, including the climate report completed for the White House last week. They were also highlighted for several senators and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on Friday by a separate panel of scientists from the academy.
"Here in the United States, with a gross national product perhaps 10 times that of England, we're spending less than they do on this sort of problem," said Dr. Edward S. Sarachik, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington who was an author of the report written for the Bush administration. He also led a separate science academy panel that issued a report in April on the weakness of America's most sophisticated computer climate models.
During the Clinton administration, the lack of American modeling leadership did not have a discernible impact on climate policy, various experts said. But it did prevent the United States from playing a more central role in writing critical sections of the Intergovernmental Panel's report -- particularly the part assessing the extent of human influence on the warming trend of recent decades. 
In computing power, Dr. Sarachik said, "our top two centers together don't amount to one-fifth of the European effort." 
American scientists still tend to dominate basic research on the physics of the atmosphere, many climate experts say. But they lag in the ability to plug that knowledge into computer models that provide society with the only meaningful lens on future climate.
Given the growing importance of the problem, the science academy has recommended the formation of a National Climate Service that would be similar to the National Weather Service but would focus on long-range trends instead of the evanescent day-to-day flickers of weather.
The lack of computer power has hurt the most at the pinnacle of climate science: the use of supercomputers to create detailed models simulating the interrelationships of the earth's atmosphere, oceans, ice caps, plants and other features that together set the global thermostat. 
These models are composed of several hundred thousand lines of computer code that divide the air, land and oceans into a grid of hundreds of interacting boxes. The best American models still lack sufficient resolution to capture critical features like the Rocky Mountains, which funnel humid Gulf of Mexico air over the heartland, or the Gulf Stream, which pumps tropical warmth north along the East Coast.
Researchers abroad, most notably at Britain's Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, can run simultaneous sets of climate simulations that compress 1,000 years of climate change into a day of computer crunching. 
"That is roughly 5 to 10 times faster than we can," said Dr. Jay S. Fein, the program director for climate dynamics at the National Science Foundation. "Some of our best scientists have been and will be attracted to work in Europe." 
But the gap does not just pose the threat of a brain drain, Dr. Fein and other experts say. They say there are potential economic and security problems if there are delays answering climate questions that are a priority for the United States -- like whether global warming will eliminate the winter mountain snows that supply California with three-quarters of its water in summer.
That problem was highlighted last year when the United States Global Change Research Program, a 10-year-old government office coordinating most climate work, published an assessment of the expected impact of global warming on areas around the country. The heart of the effort, which had been requested by Congress, was a series of modeling studies that had to be run on computers in Britain, Canada and Japan because American climate centers lacked the capacity to perform the calculations.
Those computers might not always be available to serve American needs, the experts say.
And the gap may soon widen.
Japan is poised to leapfrog past everyone in the quest for model power. Over the last three years, it has spent more than $400 million as it builds what it is calling an Earth Simulator in Yokohama, which will have a linked array of supercomputers calculating at speeds many times faster than the best existing modeling systems.
A typical computer array used for climate modeling in the United States can process about 20 gigaflops, or 20 billion floating-point operations per second, recent studies say. European centers are routinely running beyond 100 gigaflops. The Japanese machine's performance will be measured in teraflops, or thousands of gigaflops.
But better computers and organization are only part of the picture, the experts say. Better monitoring of conditions that influence the current climate is crucial, Dr. Sarachik's April study concluded.
For example, while policy makers have been debating the value of forests and farmland as a sponge for some human-generated carbon dioxide, the budget for a federal program monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide with instruments on aircraft and tall radio towers has remained at $1.4 million a year over the last nine years. But that budget has been so eroded by inflation that the operation could be cut in half without emergency financing from Congress, government scientists say. 
"If something doesn't happen, we're done," said Dr. Pieter P. Tans, chief scientist at the climate monitoring and diagnostics laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., which takes the carbon dioxide measurements. 
With budgets for science curtailed everywhere, Dr. Tans said, he knows it is a tough sell to seek support for work that is important but plodding. 
But, he added, "To really understand climate, we have to establish a high-quality record that can be trusted."

HEADLINE: A King Visits Queens, and Ghanaians Rejoice 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
The elderly men in summer suits leaving little Victoria Joy's christening party at Terrace on the Park in Queens on Saturday evening were not sure what was going on in the lobby. All marble and mirrors, it was, at this very moment, the epicenter of an eye-popping African ritual. 
 Granted, it isn't every day that King Otumfuo Osei-Tutu II, the asantehene of Ghana, the moral and spiritual leader of more than five million Africans, arrives at a banquet hall in Flushing Meadows, or anywhere on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. So, a little gawking and gazing by people attending other events did not seem like a royal crime. 
 The king's many New York subjects, who planned what was billed as a "gala banquet and fund-raising extravaganza," wanted to make sure he felt regal and at home.
That meant the akwadwam -- the drumming that is meant to welcome special guests -- began as soon as the king's entourage was sighted turning off 111th Street into the Terrace's circular drive. It was loud, to say the least.
It was also intoxicating, stirring several heavily jeweled, barefoot women dressed in draped kente cloth to dance on the cool floor, their images reflected countless times in the cut glass and mirrors around the room. Men, in sandals and traditional warrior garb, either clapped or shouted the king's praises in Twi, a language of Ghana, while others drummed or beat an instrument that looked like a banana-shaped bell.
Even the hall workers, who knew an African king would be arriving at some point, seemed taken aback.
"Amazing," one sighed as Randolf Gyasi, 50, an auto mechanic from the Bronx who was born in Kumasi, Ghana, explained the exuberance: "We appreciate him coming all the way down here. He doesn't have a lot of time to travel because there's so much to do at home."
The king, who aides said has taken an active role trying to improve his people's educational and economic systems, was on the second-to-last day of a near monthlong tour of the United States, a trip that took him to Newark, Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Washington, among other places -- and finally, to Queens. 
The king does not speak to reporters or allow himself to be quoted because, as his royal spokesman said, "some language is not meant for royal ears." At the same time, the spokesman added, the king's message sometimes needs "background and flair."
But through a spokesman, the king said his journey was a goodwill trip meant to promote an education fund, Ashanti culture and economic partnerships.
"Part of his campaign is also to influence his countrymen to look back home," said the spokesman, Nana Otuo Siribour. "He's also been urging them to be law-abiding, not to do anything to tarnish the good image of Ghana."
Once the royal entourage moved to the 15th-floor ballroom overlooking Shea Stadium and the old World's Fair grounds, the king, who is 52 and studied business in London, spoke sotto voce to an aide, who reiterated the monarch's Twi words into a microphone.
The king spoke about a lack of teachers and good facilities in Ghana, and urged Ghanaians living in New York to help. 
"If you are enlightened, look back and help others become enlightened, too," he said.
Over shrimp and noodles, beef, salad, sodas and wine, the king's compatriots broke into applause and shouted their approval.
"Our ancestors used bullets; we are trying to use education!" the king said, as translated by Becky Tandoh, one of the trip's organizers and a professor at Essex County Community College. At one point, the crowd was whipped into such a frenzy that a moment of chaos erupted, complete with shouts of praise to the king and some impromptu dancing.
"Please! Go back to your seats and sit down! Please be seated. Take your seats now!" the master of ceremonies pleaded. The event was running behind schedule.
But everyone seemed to be too happy. And the king, seated at the head table, seemed pleasantly amused. The celebration lasted until well after midnight.
The king will be leaving New York on Wednesday. This was not his first trip to the United States, but it has been his most extensive, aides said. So what did the king think of Queens?
"His impressions are generally favorable," a spokesman said. "He's been quite impressed by the cleanliness and the highway system, the infrastructure, and how welcoming the people have been rolling out the red carpets."

HEADLINE: Ways to Define A Diverse Campus 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The majority of America's universities recognize that no one set of criteria can be used for college admissions ("Confusion on Affirmative Action," editorial, June 4). It is only when race enters the picture that Americans find themselves in a pitched battle. 
Yet there are valid reasons to consider race along with undisputed factors like gender or athletic prowess.
 Our economy depends on education beyond high school. If we do not open the college doors to all races and ethnic groups, we condemn ourselves to failure. 
 Universities must help by broadening the student body and giving students a better understanding of other cultures. All professions, from medicine to law, will depend on knowledge of many cultures. Whether this is defined as racial preferences, fairness or just good business sense, it is central to the national agenda.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT FACING SKEPTICAL EUROPE ON TRIP THIS WEEK 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 10 

 BODY:
Across Europe, there is little love of America's new president and a growing perception that the United States, under his leadership, is looking out only for itself these days -- polluting the skies, breaking treaties and flirting with new arms races. 
 The German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung has dubbed him "Bully Bush." As a character on the French satirical puppet show, "Les Guignols de l'Info," he does not know who President Jacques Chirac is. 
 In Britain, The Economist, which endorsed George W. Bush for president, has been less than enthusiastic. The current cover, playing on the event of the president's venturing abroad, has the title "Mr. Bush goes to Europe" emblazoned over a picture of America's moon landing. 
So when Mr. Bush arrives Tuesday in Spain to begin a five-day trip to five countries, he will from the very start have a lot of ground to make up and will no doubt run up against more doubt, more skepticism and more anger than the United States has attracted from its closest European friends in years.
"We are definitely in a period of growing strains in the trans-Atlantic alliance," said Charles Grant, a political expert with the London-based Center for European Reform. "Both continents are changing in ways that neither understands or appreciates."
Some experts point out that few new American presidents have been quickly embraced by Europe, which traditionally dislikes change in the White House. Nor is Mr. Bush responsible for all things that annoy Europeans. France's farming activist, Jose Bove, was knocking down McDonald's restaurants to protest "American hegemony" long before Mr. Bush had even declared himself a candidate for office. 
But in just a few months, Mr. Bush's administration has managed to rattle its European allies profoundly, plowing ahead with decisions that just flat out make them nervous. 
And more and more, experts note, Europe and the United States seem to be parting company on a range of social issues that often makes it harder for them to understand each other, in what they describe as a growing gap in values. 
For one thing, in contrast to Mr. Bush's conservative agenda, Europe is dominated by left-of-center governments that hold fast to the notion that a compassionate state is needed to make sure that inequalities produced by a free market system do not get out of hand.
While the United States might be aghast at European tax rates and sneer at what they consider gumption-killing welfare benefits, Europeans look across at America and see a harsh society, with far too many have-nots.
They are particularly appalled by the use of capital punishment, and Mr. Bush is expected to face protests by death penalty opponents when he lands in Europe, a day after the scheduled execution of Timothy J. McVeigh. They are acutely aware that Mr. Bush was governor of Texas, the state that executes more prisoners than any other in America. 
Even events like the arrest of the Bush twins on charges involving underage drinking leave many Europeans perplexed. While America's media coverage of the event has focused on issues like the first family's right to privacy and Mr. Bush's struggle with alcohol, many Europeans are asking why 19-year-olds are not allowed to drink when they can vote, marry, have an abortion, buy property and otherwise function as full-fledged citizens.
Europeans are also puzzled by America's stand on the use of land mines, on abortion, on genetically altered foods, on the refusal to endorse an international court and, of course, the environment.
They were horrified and caught completely unaware when Mr. Bush announced that he was tossing out the Kyoto protocol, which would have committed industrial nations to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases. 
They have serious doubts about the administration's pursuit of a missile defense system and the scrapping of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. In addition, Mr. Bush's decision to freeze negotiations with North Korea was enough to prompt the European Union to go it alone in trying to prop up peace talks between the two Koreas.
Some experts say that behind this growing uneasiness lies the fact that both continents are evolving in ways that naturally incite friction. 
"As the only superpower, America is awfully tempted to get its way by bullying and occasionally trying to zap people into line," Mr. Grant said. "At the same time, Europe is becoming a coherent entity and wanting to be heard."
Just how serious the tensions are is still an open question. Mr. Grant and others warn that both sides need to be mindful of not letting things get out of hand.
For their part, Bush administration officials are playing down tensions. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations last week, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, rejected any notion of a serious rift. "The debate over a values gap or a strategic split ignores the fact that at a very fundamental level our economic interest and our security interests -- far from driving us apart -- are major factors in keeping the U.S. and Europe working together."
And even some European experts who see relations at a low believe that it is a temporary problem.
"We are in a period of adjustment," said Dominique Moisi, of the French Institute for International Relations. "You have a more confident Europe meeting with a new administration that is learning its way. Both sides have a lot of prejudices. This administration is a bit more arrogant, unilateral and abrasive vis-a-vis Europe, and we need to tell them we exist."
Still, such differences make it hard for the Europeans to accept America's leadership without question.
"There are a whole series of things that America has done lately that say: we decide what is good for the world," said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the leader of the 1968 French student uprising who is now a member of the German Green Party. "We don't even need to talk to anybody. But Europe has its own interests, its own ideals, and more and more there is a need to negotiate. We have some very different ways of looking at things."
Mr. Bush's style is also an issue. Many suggest that his tough talk sits poorly with Europeans who are busy trying to perfect the art of getting along with one other. His declarations that the United States will act unilaterally on issues like developing a missile defense has stirred a growing sense of indignation here. 
In the European Parliament, some members have even developed a series of preprinted postcards the public can mail to the White House objecting to a range of American domestic and international policies. 
Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, noted in an address during a visit to Washington last week that Mr. Bush was awaited in Europe "with a lot of curiosity and interest." He also expressed some relief that "each day that passes points to a slow re-engagement of this administration in international life." 
Mr. Bush will carry few specific proposals as he makes his rounds, visiting Spain to touch base with one of Europe's few conservative leaders, stopping in Belgium to meet NATO officials, joining European Union leaders at their summit meeting in Sweden, moving on to Warsaw with a speech on his vision of the American relationship with Europe and winding up in Slovenia, where he will sit down with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
Mr. Bush's visit is expected to prompt a series of protests all long the way, even in Spain, where his host will be the conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. 
In Madrid, some 10,000 protesters got started today marching through the streets with banners protesting Bush policies on everything from abortion to Cuba to the Middle East and energy. Another "Bush go home" march is expected to converge on the American Embassy on Tuesday during the presidential visit. 
Media coverage in Spain has not been favorable to the president, even in newspapers supportive of the Aznar government. On May 19, an editorial in the daily El Mundo took him to task for energy stands. "The only hope we have for the energy plan designed by George W. Bush is that it contains so many blunders that Congress will throw it out," it said.
Two days later the paper ran an opinion piece under the headline, "Biological weapons: Bush keeps ignoring his European allies."
In Spain, as elsewhere, one of the biggest anti-American issues has been the death penalty, and Mr. Bush's arrival happens to come only a week after the end of a case that has kept the Spanish enthralled for months.
After spending years on death row in Florida, Joaquin Jose Martinez, a Spanish citizen, was acquitted of murder last week during his re-trial. Once his parents had managed to raise nearly half a million dollars to pay top-notch lawyers, the prosecution's evidence was found to be full of holes, prompting an array of headlines like, "Paying not to die."
"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle," began an opinion piece in the conservative daily ABC, "than for a rich man to be executed in the United States."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about reactions abroad to President Bush and to American events that perplex Europeans misstated the action taken against his twin daughters recently under Texas liquor laws. The twins received misdemeanor citations; they were not arrested.
An article on June 11 about European perceptions of American leadership under President Bush misstated the political affiliation of Daniel Cohn-Bendit, leader of the 1968 student uprising in France and now a member of the European Parliament, who accused the United States of making unilateral decisions on behalf of the world. He is a member of the French Green Party, not the German one.

HEADLINE: Schumer Proposals Address Shortage of Office Space 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A blue-ribbon panel led by Senator Charles E. Schumer is set to unveil an ambitious plan today that will call for the creation of 60 million square feet of office space over the next 20 years for 300,000 new workers. The plan calls for a combination of condemnation, tax breaks, transit links and zoning changes to create expanded business districts in Downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City in Queens, and on the far West Side of Manhattan.
 New York faces a crisis, the group contends, because of high rents, a paucity of vacant space in existing buildings and a lack of development sites. If the city fails to create more office space, the group said, "New York City will miss out on hundreds of thousands of new jobs and increased economic activity in the next 20 years." 
 The panel, which is known as the Group of 35 and includes corporate executives, elected officials, labor leaders and academics, envisions new office complexes surrounded by parks, restaurants, hotels and shops along Willoughby Street in Brooklyn and around Queensborough Plaza in Long Island City, as well as in Manhattan west of Ninth Avenue between 28th and 42nd Streets. Members of the group were approached by Mr. Schumer after the issue surfaced repeatedly during his senatorial campaign.
Their strategy involves granting government broad powers of condemnation to assemble sites for development, an array of new and expanded tax breaks and zoning changes to encourage high-rise development in what are now low-scale neighborhoods.
Urban planners said the plan was ambitious, but elements of it have surfaced before in proposals by the Regional Plan Association and other groups that ultimately suffered quiet deaths. The report also proposes steps to protect the 2,400 industrial companies in Long Island City from being forced out by other development.
"We're trying to lay out a blueprint for where new businesses can grow in New York City and where existing businesses can expand," Mr. Schumer said in an interview. "It'll be ignored at our peril.
Mr. Schumer said it would cost about $500 million over 20 years to piece together development sites at the core of the three proposed districts. The report, however, did not estimate the value of the proposed tax breaks for corporate tenants and developers.
The Group of 35 also endorsed a series of major transportation proposals, including the $1.3 billion extension of the No. 7 subway line from 42nd Street to 33rd Street and building a new Long Island Rail Road station in Sunnyside, Queens, as part of a plan to connect the rail line to Grand Central Terminal.
"We have to induce companies to move to Brooklyn and Long Island City in order to get the critical mass of companies and amenities that will make it a neighborhood," said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate.
Mr. Schumer said he would do all he could to make the plan a reality, adding that the recommendations had the support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; Gov. George E. Pataki; Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary; Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman of American Express; and many others.
"The report fills an enormous policy vacuum by providing a long-term strategy for the city's growth," said Mitchell L. Moss, co-chairman of the Group of 35 and director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "It does a lot of homework for the next mayor."
Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding also expressed support for the plan, although he saw it as a more modest effort. "It clearly builds on what the Giuliani administration has been doing for the last seven and a half years," Mr. Harding said.
Mr. Schumer formed the panel 18 months ago, at a time when the average office rent in Manhattan had jumped 30 percent in a year and there were virtually no large blocks of space available. J. P. Morgan Chase, John Wiley & Sons, Cigna and 15 other companies moved part or all of their operations and thousands of jobs to Jersey City and Hoboken.
The real estate market has cooled since then and the flow of jobs to New Jersey has slowed. But Bruce Mosler, president of Cushman & Wakefield, said that when the economy picks up again companies will look across the Hudson.

HEADLINE: Candidate Hoping New York Is Newest Bloomberg Market 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
If New Yorkers know anything about Mike Bloomberg (and most apparently don't), it is that he is a really rich guy. A billionaire, maybe. A businessman who claims that he can run the city as mayor because he has run his own company.
 But if voters could somehow get inside the building on Park Avenue where Mr. Bloomberg made all that money (they can't -- security is tight), they would see a place utterly unlike City Hall and not very much like most major American corporations. And they might get a sense of how amazing his business achievement has been -- and how limited. 
 Amazing, because Mr. Bloomberg has created, from scratch, a profitable and fast-growing company, as he would be the first to tell you. In the business he is in -- providing financial news and data to Wall Street, the only other place he has worked as an adult -- he is almost without peer. 
Limited, because of the company's single-minded focus on its customers: the well-to-do, well-educated, mostly male trader types who lease the Bloomberg company's 157,000 very expensive computer terminals. The company does own some other media -- magazines, television programs, a New York City radio station -- that might seem geared for a broader audience. But they aren't (and they aren't very big).
Indeed, about the only thing Michael R. Bloomberg has ever tried to market to the masses is himself.
The suggestion that he has succeeded by serving people exactly like himself does not faze him. "We've been phenomenally successful in the world that has given me an opportunity," he said in an interview at his offices. "In the other world, I can be just as successful."
That kind of self-confidence is one advantage that entrepreneurs bring to political life, said James O'Toole, a business professor at the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California. A disadvantage, he added, is that people who start successful businesses are seldom good managers. An entrepreneur turned mayor "has to manage a bureaucracy, deal with labor unions and the like," Mr. O'Toole said. "They tend to be very impatient."
The basis of Mr. Bloomberg's entrepreneurial success is an idea he had in 1981, just after he and some other partners were forced out of Salomon Brothers, the high-testosterone Wall Street firm, during a merger.
In those days, traders had machines that could give them stock and bond prices and news headlines. But other information needed by traders was hard to come by, said Ludwig A. D'Angelo, a former trader who now works at KPMG Consulting. Traders needed price charts. They needed corporate information. And they needed easy ways to make a trade. Mr. Bloomberg put all this on the same computer with the news and the prices. And the Bloomberg terminal was born.
Today, each terminal generates at least $1,285 a month, 12 months a year -- $2.4 billion in 2000. That is money he uses to finance pretty much whatever he wants: his radio station, his magazines, his television venture (his houses in the city, Westchester and Bermuda, his London flat, his plane, his philanthropies, his parties).
Mr. Bloomberg remains chief executive of the company and is not taking a leave of absence to campaign, although he has turned over day-to-day responsibility to Lex Fenwick, who used to run Bloomberg's London office.
Mr. Bloomberg owns about 72 percent of the company; Merrill Lynch and some early partners own the rest. Last year, Forbes magazine valued his stake at about $4 billion, though he would get that only if someone bought the company, and he says it is not for sale. 
Some of his money has obviously gone into the Bloomberg offices in a black glass building at 59th Street and Park Avenue, where the company's employees now occupy 26 floors. By 2004, the company plans to move into a new building a block away. It also owns an office complex near Princeton, N.J., and some 80 smaller offices around the world.
The Park Avenue offices are fitted out with all sorts of high-tech gizmos; employees wear badges that not only unlock the doors, but also record their arrival and departure times (which are noted in a computer file for everyone to see). One of the many saltwater fish tanks is home to the fish cam, which sends piscine pictures to TV and computer screens throughout the building.
In the open main rooms, workers sit shoulder to shoulder at long desks, staring at the four Bloomberg screens in front of them. It looks, and feels, like nothing so much as a Wall Street trading desk. Wall Street's culture is notoriously competitive, impatient, abrasive -- about as far from politically correct as Mr. Bloomberg's offices are from City Hall's dowdy splendor. Traders are notorious for using profanity and telling off-color jokes, and Mr. Bloomberg is no exception.
Women have often felt unwelcome on Wall Street, and that has also been true at times at Bloomberg, according to several women who have complained that they were not treated fairly when they worked there.
In 1996 and 1997, the company was hit with four lawsuits filed by female employees accusing the company of sexual discrimination or harassment. The women who filed those suits either declined to comment or could not be reached.
Three of the lawsuits have been widely publicized. In the one that Bloomberg settled, Sekiko Sakai Garrison said that when she became pregnant, Mr. Bloomberg told her to "Kill it!" and that he and other managers at the company subjected women to lewd comments and behavior. Mr. Bloomberg denies all of this and says he passed a lie-detector test, though he has not released the results.
Another employee, Mary Ann Olszewski, said in her suit that "male employees from Mr. Bloomberg on down" harassed and degraded women. A judge closed the case in February after her lawyer failed to meet court-imposed deadlines.
T. Diane Winger, who claimed that she was unfairly demoted and that Mr. Bloomberg made advances to her, withdrew her suit after her husband, who also worked for Bloomberg, pleaded guilty in 1999 to stealing more than $1 million from the company. 
In the fourth suit, a reporter, Liz Roman Gallese, contends that she was fired because of her sex and age (she was in her 40's at the time). Bloomberg says her poor reporting did not improve despite the company's best efforts; its motion for summary judgment is pending before a federal judge in Boston.
Mr. Bloomberg said the company took misconduct allegations very seriously and investigated them thoroughly. He describes the cases as, "If you don't give me what I want, I'm going to make a fuss."
Mr. Bloomberg, who was divorced in 1993, has been prone to boasting that his hobbies include chasing women. Today, though, he says that he prefers long-term relationships with women of about his own age, 59.
Wall Street also has a get-it-done, to-hell-with-the-rules kind of culture, which Mr. Bloomberg appears to have brought with him, especially in the company's early days. In his 1997 autobiography, "Bloomberg by Bloomberg," he writes of installing his terminals in offices at night, "stuffing the cable through holes we drilled in other people's furniture all without permission, violating every fire law, building code and union regulation on the books." 
His management philosophy sometimes sounds eerily similar to that of the current inhabitant of Gracie Mansion (though Mr. Bloomberg swears that he does not have a ferret policy). Competitors, he has written, "are plotting to take the food from our children's mouths." People who leave his company are "traitors" who can never return.
Mr. Bloomberg can run things pretty much as he wants. Unlike most corporate executives, he has no shareholders to consider and, until March, no independent directors peering over his shoulder. Nor has the company had to deal with labor unions. 
Like Wall Street firms, Bloomberg has traditionally paid very well. Workers get bonuses if company sales increase. Employees praise the company's generosity during family crises, though they say they are expected to show up early, stay late and take phone calls at 3 a.m. Mr. Bloomberg has to approve any firing, and has never had any economic layoffs.
Matthew Winkler, who was hired in 1990 to create Bloomberg News, says his newsroom's hard-driving nature stems largely from its very newness. "The phlegmatic approach works best," he said, "at a more established place, with history and pedigree. We had none of that."
It does now. Over the past two decades, Bloomberg has trounced some long-established competitors, including Citicorp's Quotron and Dow Jones's Telerate. The only big competitor left standing is Reuters, which gets about $2.5 billion a year from its terminals, compared with Bloomberg's $2.4 billion, said John A. McConville, editor of Market Data Industry. While Bloomberg leads in the stock and bond businesses, Reuters dominates foreign exchange, and remains No. 1 in Europe and Asia.
Bloomberg sells only one service, a sort of private Internet that connects Bloomberg customers to Bloomberg information and to one another via a special e-mail system. Reuters sells a variety of services, at a variety of prices, to a variety of customers, including amateur investors. "Bloomberg sells a product at a price," said Devin N. Wenig, president of Reuters Information, "and it is in the Bloomberg world that you live."
The Bloomberg world sometimes has an insular feel. The company collects data from Wall Street and delivers it back to the same place; its reporters write about the very people who make up many of their readers.
Company executives say that their coverage is broad, including articles about education and sports, even horoscopes. Some articles do reach a broader audience when they appear on the company's Web site, or are picked up by other media outlets that lease its terminals, including The New York Times.
Company executives say they see their main audience -- those with Bloomberg machines -- as a diverse bunch, although three-quarters of them are men, and the average income is $335,000.
"This is a very cosmopolitan audience, the people who rule the world, the most affluent," Mr. Winkler said. "It's not a narrow group of people, it's very diverse. They drive markets, they determine whether Tony Blair will be prime minister again." But, he allows, they are not cabdrivers or subway conductors.
While Mr. Bloomberg helps set the hard-working tone of the newsroom, Mr. Winkler said, he never interferes in editorial decisions. Reporters in New York say they seldom see him on the floor where they work. 
Mr. Bloomberg's other properties are either experiments, or advertising for the terminals, or both, company officials say.
The company's all-news station, WBBR-AM 1130, attracts only 16,000 people in an an average quarter-hour of programming, said Tony Sanders, senior analyst of Duncan's American Radio. (1010 WINS, the city's largest all-news station, draws 91,300.) But because WBBR's listeners are so rich, it attracts advertisers willing to pay a premium to reach them.
Bloomberg also has a magazine division, but most of its titles are sent, free, to a limited group of people. About 325,000 subscribers pay for Bloomberg Personal Finance, but it is "unashamedly focused on higher-income people with close to $1 million in investable assets," said its publisher, David E. Wachtel.
Then there's Bloomberg television, whose format features a small talking head surrounded by stock tickers, news headlines, charts, graphs, and so forth. (It was actually designed to be watched with the sound off.) The company pays the USA network to carry its programming, but covers that cost by selling ads, Mr. Wachtel said; program production costs more. 
In an interview, Mr. Bloomberg said that if he failed in his quest to become mayor, he might go back to running the company he founded, but not on a day-to-day level. He is more likely, he said, to try to find some other way to channel his desire for public service.
What he will not do, he added, is spend more time preparing to run again, as Rudolph W. Giuliani did after he lost his first mayoral bid. "I have no intention of spending four years running for office," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Get serious."

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Global Realities Redefine Bush's Agenda

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
When President Bush announces on Monday that he will seek millions of dollars for new research into the causes of global warming, and will try to renegotiate an international accord on the problem, it will mark yet another example of how global and domestic politics have forced him to back away from the hard-line pronouncements of his first five months in the White House. 
 In retrospect, those months will likely be known as the anti-Clinton phase of the Bush presidency. Eager to show that the national enterprise is under new management, the president and his aides reflexively reached for positions that could be cast as the opposite of whatever came before. 
 Now, in the words of one senior administration official, "the realities of governing have begun to overwhelm the memories of campaigning." 
On the vexing question of how to deal with a bankrupt and paranoid Communist government in North Korea; on the tricky politics of bailing out economically failing but strategically important nations, and on the perpetual issue of when America needs to push along the peace process in the Middle East, Mr. Bush is suddenly trimming back, changing his emphasis, and, in the end, coming up with solutions that have shades of the ancien regime. 
"I wouldn't say we are changing our views," one of his senior national security advisers insisted over the weekend. "But it's fair to say that we are more careful in how we explain those views."
Perhaps so, but some officials say the change of tone also reflects an administration that is gradually learning the real-world complications of sole superpower status -- of what happens when allies push back, or demand American help. Mr. Bush himself, aides say, has been distressed by a stream of headlines and editorials suggesting that his call for a "humble" foreign policy is really camouflage for a president who expects the rest of the world to fall in line with his agenda. 
Mr. Bush is hardly the first president to discover that a president's options are not quite as wide as they appear while savaging the other party during a presidential campaign. 
Bill Clinton came to office denouncing former President George Bush's policy on Haiti, only to discover during his first crisis there that it made some sense. He accused the elder Mr. Bush of coddling dictators in China, and later became a far more articulate enthusiast of economic engagement with Beijing than his predecessor. 
That experience taught George W. Bush to tread lightly on economic engagement with China.
But during the presidential debates, the younger Mr. Bush lambasted the Clinton administration for unwisely bailing out countries that ran their economies into the ground, saying that such actions created a "moral hazard" -- market jargon for sending the message around the world that the United States would help bail out other countries that dug themselves into an economic hole.
In the first two cases that have cropped up -- economic crises in Turkey and Argentina -- the Bush administration decided to vote for bailouts at the International Monetary Fund. (It rejected pouring direct American aid into those countries, as Mr. Clinton did in the Mexican crisis in 1995.) The White House said almost nothing about the bailouts. But one senior official said that during the key meetings on the subject, Mr. Bush's new team came face to face with the question of what chaos in Turkey would mean to the political alliance against Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and what a meltdown in Argentina would do to Mr. Bush's hopes for a free-trade area of the Americas. 
Mr. Bush's statement on Monday on global warming, just a few hours before he leaves on his trip to Europe, is already shaping up as a classic example of saying the second time what the White House should have said the first time.
When Mr. Bush rejected the global warming pact known as the Kyoto Protocol in March, he said the treaty was "dead." His aides still think so -- the United States, they say, cannot abide a treaty that mandates reductions in American carbon dioxide emissions, especially at a moment that the administration is talking about building more coal-fired power plants to solve an energy shortage.
But Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, said he was unhappy with how the administration conveyed that decision. So on Monday, Mr. Bush will announce that he agrees with a panel from the National Academy of Sciences that concluded last week that global warming was a real problem and that it was getting worse. He will ask the Commerce Secretary, Donald L. Evans to step up studies of the problem and announce his fidelity to a 1992 United Nations treaty that commits the United States to negotiating a solution with the rest of the world. 
No doubt that will not satisfy the Europeans. "We just didn't have time to come up with specifics before the European trip," said one senior official involved in the cabinet-level review of the global warming problem. "Our message will be that the only way to make this work is to come up with an agreement that can include the United States and developing nations." All that raises the question of why Mr. Bush failed to express a willingness to revisit the issue urgently two months ago. 
A similar issue surrounds the North Korea policy review. Mr. Bush used a visit by South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, to make the point that he did not trust North Korea's mysterious leader, Kim Jong Il. The statement left the impression that the new president thought it was a waste of time negotiating an accord with an untrustworthy Communist leader.
The Republican right wing was overjoyed. Moderates, including former aides to the elder President Bush, were horrified, and began a lobbying campaign to convince Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and her boss that there were not a lot of choices in how to deal with North Korea -- and that providing it with economic incentives to restrain its missile and nuclear programs made a lot of sense. Japan and South Korea said the same thing, and the European Union began to intervene, playing the role the United States once played.
"It was inevitable that they would come out the same hole the Clinton folks did," said one senior career official involved in the announcement last week that, after a thorough review of Korea policy, Mr. Bush had decided to re-engage Pyongyang in talks on a wide range of issues. 
In the minds of many Korea experts outside the government -- and a few inside -- the decision put the new administration back to about where Mr. Clinton was in 1998.
"The goal posts on issues like this are only so wide," said the senior official, a veteran of Asian strategic issues, holding his hands about a foot apart. "You don't have as much running room as you think you do."
Ms. Rice defended the decision over the weekend, saying that "two months ago there was a lot of skepticism about re-engagement, and the only way to make a decision we were comfortable with was to thoroughly review what was on the table. You need time. It doesn't make sense to proceed until everyone is comfortable with that decision."
Now, as Mr. Bush heads to Europe, he will have other opportunities to rethink early positions. The Middle East, where he sent Central Intelligence Director George J. Tenet last week after months of eschewing the use of special envoys, is likely to demand more of his attention. So are the Balkans. As one of his aides said this weekend, "He's going to be making a lot of these decisions on the plane," between meetings with allies who are looking for reassurance that their views count, too.

HEADLINE: Israel's Business Climate 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Like the United States, Israel has been affected by the drop in Nasdaq, but interest in investing in Israel remains high (news article, June 6). 
 In the last few months, for example, two United States venture capital funds, Benchmark Capital and Sequoia, have established their first venture capital funds in Israel. 
They are seeking opportunities in Israel's high-tech sector, which continues to produce new start-ups at a rate second only to the United States. Mergers, acquisitions and partnerships between United States and Israeli companies are also taking place. 
Ikea has just opened its first store in Israel, and Starbucks is entering Israel's market through a partnership with a local company.
In addition, expectations for growth in the near future are positive. The International Monetary Fund has projected a growth rate of more than 4 percent for 2002.

HEADLINE: BOOKS ON HEALTH; 
Birth Control, From 'Womb Veils' to Lysol

BYLINE:  By Annette Fuentes 

 BODY:
"Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America," by Andrea Tone, Hill and Wang, $30.
 In 1992, Dr. Andrea Tone was finishing her dissertation at Emory University in Atlanta and volunteering at the Feminist Women's Health Center. While her academic labors focused on the history of industry, her work at the clinic provided an entirely different kind of food for thought, and eventually for research. 
 "It opened my eyes to the gap between the availability of contraceptive technology and the lack of knowledge about how to use birth control products," Dr. Tone said. "There are problems with medical access to good products." 
Nine years later, Dr. Tone, an associate professor of history at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is publishing the book that was inspired by her sojourn at the women's clinic. In her history of contraceptives, Dr. Tone goes where other scholars of birth control have not ventured by exploring the business and practice of contraceptives, especially in the era when they were illegal.
"I wanted to shift the focus away from doctors and lawmakers and political activists to ordinary people who used the devices and the people who made and distributed them, often in violation of the law," Dr. Tone said.
She describes an 1800's birth control industry that profitably marketed an array of products -- douches, medicated sponges, animal-intestine condoms and other items. Diaphragms were "womb veils," made of rubber or a cloth membrane and advertised as "the wife's protector."
One early entrepreneur was Edward Bliss Foote, a medical college graduate who believed in the then-radical notion that women should control their reproduction. Mr. Foote made a one-size-fits-all womb veil in the 1860's and sold it for $6 at clinics and through mail order. Charles Goodyear's discovery of the vulcanization process started a new chapter in birth control, with the first rubber "caps" for men in the late 1850's and full-length condoms a decade later. 
The federal Comstock Act of 1873, however, changed for the next century the contraceptive industry and Americans' ability to control their fertility. Passed in a climate of Victorian dismay over perceived immorality in the nation's growing urban centers, Comstock prohibited the manufacture and sale of contraceptives, along with a range of printed materials deemed obscene. Many states adopted similar statutes.
Once outlawed, contraceptives went underground, becoming a black market commodity no different legally from pornographic materials. But even the morality crusader Anthony Comstock couldn't extinguish the flourishing industry or the popular demand for devices to prevent pregnancy.
Dr. Tone found archived letters from 1874 between one middle-class couple, Violet Blair Janin and her husband, Albert, a lawyer, revealing how they willingly broke the law against buying contraceptives. 
Mrs. Janin feared she would die in childbirth and had relied on the unreliable rhythm method of birth control. Unwilling to forgo sex, Mr. Janin took charge and bought condoms in New Orleans, writing cheerfully to his wife: "I have managed to procure some things I have once or twice spoken to you about. Can you guess what they are?"
Such evidence showed that the need for contraceptives could not be legislated away and that men had played larger roles in birth control than was usually assumed. "When I went into this, I thought it would be a straightforward women's history," Dr. Tone said. "I found if you look at men's letters instead of just women's letters or diaries, you see that men often had just as much expertise and certainly as much interest in the process of controlling fertility as women."
Dr. Tone's research took her to the National Archives, where she exhumed records from the Federal Trade Commission and the Postal Service. Each agency played an enforcement role related to contraception: the F.T.C. investigated health quackery and fraud against birth control manufacturers; the post office policed the mail for "pornographic" material.
Among the many colorful characters populating the black market trade in contraceptives, Dr. Tone's favorite was Julius Schmid, a German immigrant who arrived in New York in the 1880's and began making condoms with surplus animal intestines acquired from his job at a sausage-casing company. Mr. Schmid's sideline became his main business, and in 1890, Mr. Comstock raided Mr. Schmid's home in Manhattan and discovered 696 "skins," as condoms were referred to, and "one form for manufacturing same."
Dr. Tone gleaned such details from the arrest ledger of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice at the Library of Congress. Mr. Schmid survived the Comstock era and by the 1930's, after condoms had been legalized, he headed a prophylactic empire selling Sheik, Ramses and Fourex brands.
"He'd undergone this remarkable shift from an immigrant who had one working leg and was forced to sleep on a park bench because he was unemployed, to this millionaire -- with condoms," Dr. Tone said.
By the 1920's and 1930's, Margaret Sanger, the birth control crusader, had also achieved some success. Her mission was to legitimize diaphragms as a physician-prescribed device, distributed through clinics and doctor offices for poor women.
But diaphragms were never popular -- they accounted for less than 1 percent of birth control sales in the late 1930's, Dr. Tone notes. It was the over-the-counter products that exploded in popularity, grabbing 85 percent of all sales of contraceptives by 1938.
Advertisers came up with the euphemistic term "feminine hygiene" to describe them, evading laws still in force against selling birth control. Jellies, suppositories, foaming tablets and antiseptic douches were promoted to women as modern, scientific, medical solutions to vaguely defined marital problems. Such advertising exploited women's anxieties about unplanned or unwanted pregnancies with such titles as "Calendar Fear" and "Can a Married Woman Ever Feel Safe?"
Lehn & Fink Corporation, makers of Lysol disinfectant, was one company that employed such ad strategies. Dr. Tone found that from 1930 to the 1960's, Lysol was the leading feminine hygiene product in the country. "If you actually look at the product guidelines from the 30's and 40's, they say, 'You can use this to gargle with, to clean your toilet or as an antiseptic douche,' " Dr. Tone said. Evidence that women were burned by douching with Lysol was in consumer letters she found in the Food and Drug Administration and American Medical Association archives. 
With the arrival of birth control pills and the toppling of laws against contraceptive sales and advertising, the 1960's brought a new era of birth control technology and popular use. Plastic IUD's that offered improvements over their 19th century precursors seemed to be good choices in the 1970's until the widely used Dalkon Shield proved to be dangerous to thousands of women. In the last decade, the chemical contraceptives Norplant and Depo Provera were introduced for women, offering longer-term fertility control.
Still, many Americans do not get the contraceptives they need, sometimes because they lack access to doctors and sometimes because their health insurance policies do not cover birth control prescriptions. The answer, Dr. Tone said, is a greater investment in research and development. 
"It will take a shift in our thinking about what our priorities should be, maybe even some general agreement about holding back on consumer litigation," Dr. Tone said. "I hate to say that because historically litigation has been one of the few recourses women have had. But as long as that threat is pending for companies with cash to invest in this, you're probably not going to see this as a top R. & D. priority."

HEADLINE: Diesel Engines Get Spotlight in Fuel-Efficiency Contest 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: MILFORD, Mich., June 11 

 BODY:
Each of the 16 Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicles in a barnlike garage at the General Motors vehicle testing center here is painted a different bright color and festooned with the logos of sponsoring corporations. But the Suburbans are here not for a road race but for a different kind of competition: to see which can emit the least amount of global-warming gases.
 Designed by students at the nation's top mechanical engineering schools with cutting-edge equipment supplied by the world's largest auto parts makers, the Suburbans are part of a contest, Future Truck, that has become an annual showcase for what might be done by automakers to address global warming. Because automobiles emit 19.5 pounds of carbon dioxide, a global-warming gas, for each gallon of fuel they burn, the contest has taken on new prominence as Washington has become increasingly interested in global warming and in whether fuel-efficiency rules should be raised. 
 The entries here showed a striking split that is also apparent within the auto industry: whether to switch to diesel engines. Eight of the Suburbans burned diesel, which gives excellent mileage and produces minimal emissions of greenhouse gases but tends to produce more soot and smog-causing gases. The other eight used a variety of fuel sources, including two demonstration models of fuel-cell vehicles that did not work well enough to participate in various tests, like towing a 7,000-pound trailer.
Two gasoline-electric vehicles already on the market are the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. G.M., Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler plan to introduce gasoline-electric hybrid sport utility vehicles within the next three years.
Diesel engines lack the sex appeal of fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen in a chemical reaction to produce energy to drive a vehicle's wheels. But diesels are technically feasible now, especially if their pollution problems can be fixed, and provide remarkable fuel economy. 
A diesel vehicle has nearly the same emissions of greenhouse gases as a gasoline-electric hybrid, said Robert Larsen, the director of transportation research at the Energy Department's Argonne National Laboratory. A diesel-electric does even better, with emissions of global warming gases almost as low as those of a fuel-cell vehicle, he added. Making hydrogen for a fuel cell requires some emissions of global-warming gases.
Preliminary figures showed that the Suburban that emitted the least carbon dioxide and other global-warming gases today was designed at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Mr. Larsen said. The diesel-powered, four-wheel-drive Suburban got 28 miles to the gallon on the fairly easy course here, which involved driving at speeds no faster than 60 miles an hour and minimal stop-and-start driving. An unmodified Suburban got 17.3 miles a gallon on the same course, several miles a gallon better than most drivers achieve.
The Suburban from the University of Wisconsin did well partly because it was a hybrid and partly because it used a lot of lightweight aluminum, including an aluminum underbody frame. Mass-producing aluminum frames is extremely difficult, but Audi is already doing it for some cars, and American automakers plan to start trying it in the next few years.
Julie Marshaus, a graduate student in mechanical engineering who led the University of Wisconsin team, said that choosing diesel had been easy. "We used a diesel engine because they're more efficient than any other internal combustion engine," Ms. Marshaus said.
But while her team's Suburban emitted less smog-causing nitrogen oxides than any of the other diesel vehicles here, the big vehicle's emissions were still not low enough to meet tough new government regulations that will take effect in the 2004 model year. And her team's Suburban failed miserably on the soot test today, producing emissions of tiny particles that were off the top of the chart for the contest.
The poor pollution performance of the diesels left it unclear today which engineering school had won the competition. The results of the tests here, which have been taking place for a week, will be announced on Wednesday evening in Washington. G.M. plans to announce separately its own progress on fuel cell vehicles in separate news conferences on Tuesday in Warren, Mich., and on Wednesday morning in Washington.
G.M. gives a Suburban and $10,000 to each of the nation's top mechanical engineering schools for the contest. The students then raise up to $250,000 more each from other corporate sponsors to design a Suburban that gets the best possible mileage with the least pollution and no reduction in driving performance. The Energy Department is co-sponsor of the competition.
Automakers are lobbying for less strict pollution standards for diesels, contending that the rules in 2004 will effectively ban diesels. But Mark Mayer, G.M.'s director of North American engine development, acknowledged that recent innovations in pollution-control devices "will probably get us there, at enormous expense."
Europe applies less strict pollution rules to diesels, and sales of diesel cars are soaring there, claiming a third of the market compared with almost none here.
Environmentalists dislike diesels. Jason Mark, the director of the clean- vehicle program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the real problem was that too many Americans prefer 5,800-pound Suburbans to cars, which get much better mileage with less pollution. Diesel engines are not the answer, he said, adding that "until they solve their public health liabilities, they shouldn't be in Suburbans and other vehicles."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Halfway through 2001, there are few signs that the media economy has hit bottom.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE first half of 2001 is drawing to a close with few if any signs that the weakening of the advertising and media economies will reverse itself anytime soon.
 The continuing softness was underlined yesterday when the Publishers Information Bureau in New York reported that ad revenue and ad pages for leading magazines fell noticeably in May compared with May 2000. The results for May contrasted with those for April, which had been somewhat better than expected given the cutbacks many marketers have been making in print ad budgets. 
 "We're damn near in the second half now, and there are not many months left for good news to come out," said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York. 
Mr. Coen, considered the leading industry prognosticator, said that he planned to reduce for a second time his estimate for this year's total ad spending when he gives a presentation scheduled for Thursday. His first forecast for 2001, made in June 2000, was that ad spending would rise 6.5 percent from 2000. He reduced that estimate six months later to an increase of 5.8 percent after witnessing the decline in ad spending in traditional media by the dot-coms.
Now, with substantially further erosion in that spending, Mr. Coen said, he would lower his forecast again. Even if results began to improve in November or December because of easier comparisons to ad spending in 2000, he added, "it would not be good enough to pull this year out." Universal McCann is the media services division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"Wall Street's perspective is that this is a lost year," said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York who follows the advertising industry. "The less said about it, the better."
"Last year, a rising tide lifted all the boats," he added, referring to the strong spending by the dot-coms along with Olympics and election advertising. "Now, a falling tide is bringing all the boats aground."
One such boat, clearly, is magazines, where the declines in ad spending and ad pages last month were most evident in several large, important categories.
Among them were: financial, insurance and real estate, down 21.5 percent in ad revenue and 32.7 percent in ad pages; media and advertising, down 24.9 percent in ad revenue and 36.7 percent in ad pages; retail, down 38.4 percent in ad revenue and 32.1 percent in ad pages; and technology, down 45 percent in ad revenue and 52.7 percent in ad pages.
"That's a lot of 'downs,' " said Joe Mandese, who left Myers Reports in New York, where he was editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter, to become editor of Media Buyer's Daily, a newsletter to be published by Brill Media Holdings in New York.
Weak ad spending by retailers has been crimping other media, Mr. Mandese said, like spot, or local, radio and television.
"Media go and in out of recessions at different rates," he added. "Now, you don't want to be retail-sensitive."
Another print medium, newspapers, is also suffering as a result of the belt-tightening by retail advertisers as well as other major spenders. For instance, Dow Jones & Company reported last week that ad linage at its flagship, The Wall Street Journal, fell 35.8 percent in May compared with May 2000, led by the financial category, down 36.1 percent, and general advertising, down 39.7 percent.
For magazines last month, according to the publishers' bureau, ad revenue totaled $1.5 billion, down 9.4 percent from $1.7 billion in May 2000, as ad pages fell 16.9 percent, to 22,368 from 26,928. Last month, the bureau reported that ad revenue in April fell 1.2 percent from April 2000 as ad pages fell 9.5 percent.
For the first five months of 2001, ad revenue totaled $6.7 billion, down 1.9 percent from the period a year earlier, the bureau reported, as ad pages totaled 101,990, down 9.4 percent.
"Like everybody else, we've seen a softer economy," said Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Magazine Publishers of America, the industry organization that administers the bureau.
"And while we don't predict," she added, "the messages we're hearing regarding spending in other media suggest the softness will continue."
A primary reason for the weakness, Ms. Oppenheim said, was the difficulty in making comparisons against the robust spending levels during most of 2000, which was "an unusual year in its strength," as she put it.
Another reason for the softness, Ms. Oppenheim said, was that "many advertisers are playing a waiting game," searching for signs that consumers are willing to resume spending before they commit scarce ad dollars.
That is also why the advance sale of commercial time for the 2001-02 season by the broadcast television networks, in what is known as the upfront market, is getting off to such a slow start.
"That's why the 'upfront' is so important," Mr. Russell said, "because it's a reflection in part on what 2002 will bring."
"If you don't have a value proposition," he added, referring to the ability of executives to present their media as sufficiently effective and efficient for marketers, "it may be difficult to come out of the current market with some vigor."

HEADLINE: Office Rents Fall for First Time Since 1993 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 11 

 BODY:
Office rents fell for the first time since 1993 in the first quarter as Internet, computer and technology companies laid off workers and gave up space, according to a study.
 Rents in the nation's downtowns fell an average of 0.52 percent in the first three months of the year from the end of 2000, according to the national real estate index, which is compiled in San Francisco. 
In the suburbs, rents fell 0.89 percent. 
 It was the first drop in rents since the second quarter of 1993, when the real estate market was starting to recover from recession.
"The dot-com meltdown is the main reason for the drop," said Jack Doyle, a spokesman for the index, which is managed by CB Richard Ellis Services Inc., the country's largest property broker. 
In the first quarter, the nation's office vacancy rate rose to 9.5 percent, its highest point since 1999. 
Rents for warehouse space fell 0.41 percent in the quarter, while they fell 0.38 percent for retail space. 
Apartments were the only type of commercial property to show an increase, Mr. Doyle said. Rents for the highest-quality apartments rose 0.465 percent, while apartments aimed at lower-income renters also had a gain, rising 0.66 percent.

HEADLINE: Tunnel Vision; 
Taking a Chance on Love and the No. 4

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Among good places for making a romantic connection, the New York City subway has long ranked down around the bottom of the list, just above jail or the proctologist's office.
 But along with the drop in crime, the rise in subway cleanliness and the herds of new riders who have discovered the trains over the last few years, there are signs that the subway as singles scene may also be having a renaissance. (The subway was once considered a place of romance, after all. Think of "On the Town," in which Gene Kelly spotted the love of his life on a subway beauty-contest poster.) 
 Examples of public transportation's newfound sexiness seem to be all over the place. A new television commercial in which a gang of D.J.'s commandeer a subway car and turn it into a dance club. Another in which a subway motorwoman stops her train to remark on the nice pants worn by the guy in the next train over. An article on the Web magazine Salon last year in which the writer bragged about how she and her friends were "collecting so many phone numbers on the subway these days."
The Tunnel Vision column began looking for a way to tap into this phenomenon, but it was a little awkward to interview people in the middle of hitting on each other. So it was decided that the best way would be to solicit letters from friends and acquaintances recounting their true tales of finding -- or even losing -- love on the subway.

Dear Tunnel Vision:
A good friend and I decided that reckless date-finding measures were in order, and so, on a mutual dare, we agreed that we would each accost and arrange a date with at least one stranger on the N.Y.C. subway. I was soon equipped with a business card on which I had written, "I swear I've never done this before, but call me?"
I never used the card because I ditched it after nearly passing it out at several important business meetings. Luckily, I was shortly thereafter caught kibbitzing on the platform at West Fourth Street by a woman more reckless than I. She had been ribbing her friend and noticed by my smirks that I admired her wit. The three of us began a jovial banter, and as I prepared to disembark at 23rd Street, the witty ribber said, "So how will my friend ever find you again?" I promptly produced a business card -- undoctored -- and slipped it into the friend's hand. Half an hour later I checked my voice mail and already there was a raucous message from the two of them, including a phone number for the promising ribbee.
She was only briefly promising, however, as subsequent communications revealed the existence of a "boyfriend" who, for whatever reason, had not merited previous mention.
Still, not bad for the subway. And, since it's essentially true, I now have another business card that says "I swear I've never done this before . . ."

ROBERT WOOD
Economist, 34

Dear Tunnel Vision:
I was on a train coming back home to Brooklyn and, at the Broadway-Lafayette station, I noticed a man who got on and sat near me. He was probably 19 or 20. I am 35, married and a mother. There was nothing flirtatious going on. You know how you get on the train and pick out those people who you think would be the ones who would help you if someone started to rob you? That's what I thought about this guy.
But as I started to get off, he jumped up and ran after me. I thought I had dropped something, but he handed me a card that said "Clean-cut kid." With a phone number. (Actually, he didn't look very clean cut. Maybe it's a generational thing.)
The card also said his name was Ben. Apparently, he was feeling a little Mrs. Robinson about me.

SARA GOODMAN
Film company employee, 35

Dear Tunnel Vision:
I was clutching at a string of hope. My boyfriend of six months, a lawyer, had just spent the night at my apartment. Now, on our walk to the Borough Hall train station, I was pondering things. Sure, we had our share of troubles, but we had fun together, and we had grown close over time. I was dreaming of a future.
But as the No. 4 train came screeching into the station, he was weighing the evidence: his idea of a holiday is Rollerblading across the country; mine is floating in tropical waters. His day at the beach is a triathlon; mine is a clambake. He is an exhibitionist; I am an extremely private person. As the car doors tried to close for the ninth time, he prepared his opening statement. An elbow jammed into my kidney as he listed the pros and cons of our relationship out loud. I heard a stomach grumbling behind me. I smelled someone's chewing gum.
Seemingly unaware of the commuters crushing around us, he kept building his case, telling me the reasons why it would never work out.
When he had convinced himself, he didn't bother with a closing statement. The No. 4 pulled into City Hall. As my boyfriend got off the train, he became my ex-boyfriend. I'd been prosecuted.

HEADLINE: Newark Arena Talk Spurs Anger Over Meadowlands 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 11 

 BODY:
When Gov. Christie Whitman, on her last day in office, unveiled a plan for a new sports arena for Newark, her successor, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, complained that the plan was doomed because it did not include a redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands, where the Continental Arena will go dark if the New Jersey Nets and Devils depart for Newark.
 Now, four months later, Mr. DiFrancesco has come up with his own plan. Critics, including many in his own party, are complaining that it is deeply flawed because it does not include a redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford. 
 Officials working on the project say Mr. DiFrancesco went public with his proposal last Wednesday because of pressure from the YankeeNets, the consortium that owns the Nets and the Devils, to come up with a firm arena plan before the legislative session ends this month. And they say Mr. DiFrancesco is trying to put together a proposal to turn the Meadowlands into a retail and entertainment destination accessible for the first time by commuter rail service.
The question now is what sort of assurances are needed between now and July 1 to persuade officials in heavily Republican Bergen County, which includes the Meadowlands, to support the Newark arena. In addition to the urban-suburban balancing between Newark and Bergen that is likely to be required in the Legislature, there is a north-south balancing act in which Mr. DiFrancesco will have to address southern New Jersey's quest for some kind of sports venue.
The Assembly majority leader, Paul DiGaetano, who represents the Meadowlands area, said that despite all the attention on the Newark arena, what happens with the Meadowlands will have a far larger economic impact.
"It's the tail wagging the dog, because the Newark arena is really the smaller of the pieces, and the Meadowlands has the capacity to be 10 times bigger," he said. 
Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal calls for a $355 million arena for the two sports franchises, financed with $190 million in state-issued revenue bonds that would be backed by an increase in the city sales tax to 6 percent from 3 percent. That tax would be charged by businesses within a newly created sports district in Newark. The YankeeNets would contribute $115 million to the cost of the 18,500-seat arena and be responsible for any cost overruns.
The proposal requires the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass legislation creating the sports district, the sales tax increase and a bill that would encourage hotel and other construction in the city.
The announcement outraged and baffled some Republicans, concerned that the acting governor was offering an economic development plum to heavily Democratic Essex County while ignoring the future of the Meadowlands in Republican Bergen.
But had Mr. DiFrancesco chosen, he could have given some tantalizing and perhaps soothing hints about what is in store for the Meadowlands.
Lewis Eisenberg, the investment banker and prominent Republican whom Mr. DiFrancesco put in charge of negotiating with the YankeeNets and planning the future of the Meadowlands, said that only the Newark part of the equation had a July 1 deadline.
But, he said, plans were progressing for a broad redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands -- a plan that envisioned its becoming a family sports, entertainment and retail destination. Progress was being made, he and others said, in talks with Nascar about the possibility of auto racing there, and the state had grown more serious about the prospect of giving the New York Jets a permanent home at the Meadowlands, along with the New York Giants, in a new stadium.
In addition, a nationally known planning firm has been hired to create a vision of a new Meadowlands complex. There is also broad agreement among Republican and Democratic officials to build a rail spur that would bring two of the region's commuter lines to the Meadowlands. "This means weaving the Meadowlands into the fabric of everyday life in the region," said Arthur Maurice, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, who has been part of the negotiations on both the Newark arena and the future of the Meadowlands. "It has always been viewed solely as an events location. But part of DiFrancesco's vision is that this can be a seven-day-a-week destination."
Over the last two years, two of the Nets' co-owners, Raymond Chambers, the philanthropist behind a host of city redevelopment plans, and Lewis Katz, have been the YankeeNets board members most committed to a Newark arena. But as talks dragged on and one proposal after another collapsed, others on the YankeeNets board have raised concerns that the teams would not have an agreement in time to meet their goal of a new arena by 2004.
Harvey Schiller, the president of the YankeeNets, said the teams "would not like to talk about deadlines," and refused to confirm that there was one. But left implicit in the negotiations was the possibility that if an arena could not be built by then, the two teams might leave the state.
One lawmaker, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, suggested that Mr. DiFrancesco may have been acting shrewdly in not revealing more about possibilities for the Meadowlands. First, he said, Mr. DiFrancesco realized that it would be easier to draw up a plan by letting others come to him with suggestions rather than putting one forward that could be picked apart. The lawmaker added that the possibility of a Democrat in the governor's office after November gave Republicans in Bergen extra incentive to work out a deal with Mr. DiFrancesco.
Still, Assemblyman DiGaetano said that it would have been helpful if he and others in Bergen had heard more about the Meadowlands' possible future amid the fanfare last week over the Newark arena.
For his part, the Bergen County executive, William Shuber, said through a spokesman that he was cheered by talk of growing support for the nearly 15-year-old idea of a rail route. But the spokesman added that it would take more than talk.
"He wants to see plans, a map with the routes delineated and written commitments of funding," said Tom Amerato, the spokesman. "It can't be pie in the sky and a someday thing. But I think it can be done before the close of the legislative session." 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 13, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about plans for a Newark arena and redevelopment of the Meadowlands misspelled the name of the Bergen County executive. He is William Schuber, not Shuber.

HEADLINE: More Falling Behind on Mortgage Payments 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With energy costs and unemployment rising, the number of Americans who are behind on their mortgage payments has increased sharply in the last year.
 The increase is particularly worrisome, housing analysts say, because it suggests that many of the new homeowners, who were part of a surge in house-buying during the last decade, may not be able to afford their current mortgages during slow economic times. Newly liberal lending standards, which often require only a small down payment, have in recent years allowed many people to buy their first house. 
 Over the last year, however, a growing minority of those homeowners have struggled to pay their bills.
In a popular government-insured program to help people buy moderately priced homes, the percentage of homeowners whose loan payments are more than 30 days late exceeded 10 percent for the first time ever at the end of last year, according to a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Even during the recessions of the early 1990's and the early 1980's, the rate did not exceed 8 percent. 
Over all, about 400,000 more families were at least 30 days late on their mortgages in the early months of this year than at the beginning of 2000.
Those statistics do not include "subprime" mortgages -- which generally go to people with low income or a spotty credit history -- and delinquencies among those homeowners have risen in the last 18 months, too, according to the Mortgage Information Corporation in San Francisco. Despite the wider availability of mortgages in recent years, subprime loans remain one of the only options for many minorities, studies have shown.
Foreclosure rates, which typically lag delinquency rates, remain low, but have increased slightly this year.
For the people who have been unable to pay their bills, the last few months have been a terrifying time, they said, in which they have begun to feel unsettled in the one place where they would expect to find solace: their home. 
"Never did I imagine I would be in a situation like this," said Alice F. Camp, who lives with her husband and three children in a two-story house -- the first she has owned -- near Atlanta. Last year, Mrs. Camp lost her job as a nurse shortly before learning she was pregnant, and the Camps quickly fell behind on their monthly payments of about $750. Their bank has threatened foreclosure twice this year.
"I've always been able to pay my bills, but I've just been kind of helpless," she said. "It's just been devastating."
The mortgage problems underscore one main reason many policy makers and economists are so concerned about whether the United States will enter a recession this year. In recent years, Americans have built up hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, and should the current slowdown worsen, many people could find themselves unable to pay their credit card, auto loan and mortgage bills, analysts say. Even those better positioned to ride out a downturn may be forced to cut back on spending to pay down debt, further weakening the economy.
The expansion of mortgage lending has happened as the federal government has pressed banks to make more loans available in poorer communities. On their own, bankers have also begun using sophisticated computer programs to identify new groups of potential homebuyers.
Between 1995 and the start of this year, the home ownership rate rose to a record 67.5 percent from 64.7 percent, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Between 1982 and 1995, it had fallen by a tenth of a percentage point.
But now, with companies eliminating jobs and overtime hours and with the costs of gasoline, heating and air- conditioning up sharply, many people who only recently grabbed onto the ladder to the middle class are struggling to hang on.
"This is the first time these loans have been tested," said Mark Zandi, an economist at Economy.com, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa. "The pace at which things have eroded reveals severe stress."
The level of delinquencies among the mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration is "outrageous," added Mark P. Vitner, an economist at First Union in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Vitner said that banks would probably become stricter about lending if it remained as high as 10 percent. "It is a very disturbing trend," he said. 
Mortgage delinquency is especially high, and has risen especially fast, in the Southeast, home to a large concentration of manufacturing companies, which have cut tens of thousands of jobs since last summer.
In addition, almost 50 percent of all new homes built in the United States since January 2000 have been constructed in the region, defined broadly as stretching from Maryland to Florida to Texas, according to First Union. 
In DeKalb County, Ga., where the Camps live, the population surged in the 1990's, and upturned red dirt and billboards advertising new houses remain a common sight. "In every nook and cranny, they're building houses," said Jimmy Bennett, the executive director of the DeKalb/ Fulton Housing Counseling Center, a nonprofit group that helps new-home buyers and people with mortgage problems.
Mrs. Camp and her children moved into their home in Stone Mountain in 1996 and quickly made it theirs. They threw a small party to celebrate. Since then, she has often invited friends and family over for corn pudding or baked spaghetti, talking to them while she cooked and they sat in the family room next to the kitchen. Her new husband later refinished the kitchen cabinets, vanquishing the "ugly brown," she said, and replacing it with a more textured look.
Beyond all the details, having the house has just felt good. "It's a sense of owning something, a sense of belonging, a sense that your money is going into something rather than going out and you never seeing it again," Mrs. Camp said. "It's having something you looked for with your children and you grow in. It's a place of comfort."
That comfort began to seem fleeting last year, when she became sick with complications from high blood pressure and her boss then fired her without giving her a reason, she said. When she lost her job, she was earning $54,000 a year as the director of nursing at a nearby county jail. 
Soon after, she found out that she was pregnant, and the bills began to pile up. Friends, relatives and her church have helped the Camps out, and the family made a $3,500 payment in March, the last time they received a foreclosure notice. Although they remain $1,800 behind on their mortgage, Mrs. Camp said she was hopeful. The arrival of summer should help her husband, a carpenter, get additional work. And with her son, who was born prematurely, getting stronger, she hopes she will be able to look for work again soon.
So far this year, Atlanta newspapers have printed an average of 384 foreclosure notices for DeKalb County each month, up from 300 last year, according to the county's Human and Community Development Department.
Across the country, a drop in energy costs helped the delinquency rate for Federal Housing Administration loans fall slightly, to a seasonally adjusted 10 percent in the first quarter, from 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday. But since the first quarter of 2000 the rate has climbed from 8.4 percent.
The delinquency rate includes all mortgages that are at least 30 days' past due. 
Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the F.H.A. loans, said some of the mortgage problems could be expected because delinquencies usually rose between three and seven years after loans were made. They also said the department was working with families to design payment plans that would prevent foreclosures.
The delinquency rate on conventional first mortgages was 4.4 percent last quarter, up from 3.7 percent a year earlier.
Despite the problems, few people question whether the increase in home ownership over the last decade has been worthwhile. With more people owning homes -- 69.8 million last year, compared with 59 million in 1990, according to the Fannie Mae Foundation -- more people have a reason to work to improve their neighborhood, housing analysts say. And a house is the only significant long-term investment that many low- and moderate-income people have, said Chris H. Morris, the director of DeKalb's community development department.
But housing analysts are starting to ask whether the boom in home ownership can survive the current downturn.
Mildred Akins decided she wanted to move out of her Atlanta apartment and buy a house about two years ago, when her landlord failed to repair a hole in her ceiling. She had little money for a down payment, but by enrolling in a counseling program for new-home buyers, she received a $5,000 grant.
In December 1999, she and her two grandchildren moved in to a single-level beige brick house on the west side of the city.
"We absolutely love it," Ms. Akins said. "I've got nice big open windows where the light comes in beautifully. We've got hardwood floors. We've got a fireplace."
"It's like a sanctuary," she added.
It has been in jeopardy, however, since Ms. Akins's secretarial job at a bail bonding company was eliminated. Failing to find a professional job despite her college degree and 20 years as a teacher, she earns $9 an hour as a customer service representative at a Publix supermarket, she said.
"This is something to keep me from going down the tubes," she said.
But it may not be enough.
"By the time they take out the taxes, there's not a lot to take home," she said. Unless things change soon, she added, "with two growing children and clothing and food, I will not be able to cover the mortgage."

Dr. Pangloss, I Presume?

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Explaining the Bush administration's enthusiasm for nuclear power plants, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently said: "If you set aside Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the safety record of nuclear is really very good."
 Mr. O'Neill has an ear for the Bushian dialectic, having recently spent a great deal of time beating the drum for the tax-cut package, which was a great idea if you set aside the fact that it wouldn't stimulate the economy and we couldn't afford it. 
 His boss is off on his first trip to Europe, where this administration is very popular, if you forget about questions of defense, foreign policy, capital punishment and the environment. The president is going to have to sell our allies on his plan for a missile shield, which is an exciting new vision for arms control except for the fact that we don't know how to build it. 
We are hoping that Europe works out well for Mr. Bush even though he is said to be planning to use the same diplomatic strategy there that he employed in California, possibly the least successful good-will trip since Dad dined in Japan. The president left Washington on a conciliatory note, acknowledging that the greenhouse effect is not a figment of deranged environmentalists' imagination and promising more money for research. The administration must have given up hope of finding a scientific panel that felt global warming was no big deal if you set aside the fact that the planet is getting hotter. Still, who knows what might turn up? Extensive, painstaking studies should always precede action, missile shields of course excepted.
At home, the Senate will be operating under its new Democratic leadership. To everyone's relief, Senator Strom Thurmond, the 98-year-old senior Republican, is no longer president pro tem and thus third in the line of succession to the presidency. The new president pro tem is Robert Byrd of West Virginia. This is a great improvement if you skip over the fact that Mr. Byrd is an 83-year-old former Ku Klux Klan member who recently used the n-word repeatedly during a bizarre television interview in which he claimed to be demonstrating how much progress the country has made in race relations. 
Congress, meanwhile, is turning its attention to the patients' bill of rights, which is to health care reform what a gnat is to aviation. The president and Congress are very close on this issue, except that Mr. Bush is threatening to veto it. Still, the president has to do what he thinks best. He's the guy with the mandate, if you set aside the irregularities in Florida and the fact that he lost the popular vote.
Mr. O'Neill is onto something. This is a linguistic construct for our time:
* If you set aside the divorce, the "Love Nest" headlines, the cancer and the term limits, New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani is in clover.
* If you set aside April and May, Jenna's been having a great freshman year.
* Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, a son of Robert Kennedy, dropped out of the Congressional race in Massachusetts yesterday. He had enormous political potential if you set aside an inability to read a prepared script, a tendency to giggle at inappropriate moments and an arrest record for an assault committed in the company of his cousin Michael Skakel, the current murder defendant. 
* Aside from the script and the actors, "Pearl Harbor" was one heck of a movie.
* A friend who had been watching the all-execution-all-the-time coverage on cable TV yesterday reported that someone had put in a good word for Timothy McVeigh by saying it was sad that a person's entire life would be judged by the worst thing he did. If you set aside . . .
Last month I wrote a column about Acting Gov. Jane Swift of Massachusetts, who was preparing to deliver twins and had to commute from the other side of the state because Massachusetts is the only state that does not provide its governor with subsidized housing. This was entirely accurate, except for the fact that Rhode Island, Arizona and Vermont don't either. 
Personally, I can see Rhode Island's point, but everybody else should think this through again. Really, you could just rent them a condo.

More People Falling Behind On Mortgage Payments
With energy costs and unemployment rising, the number of Americans who are behind on their mortgage payments has risen sharply in the last year.
 The increase in the delinquency rate is particularly worrisome, analysts say, because it suggests many of the new homeowners who benefited from more liberal lending standards may not be able to afford their mortgages during slow economic times. Page A1. 

Not All Will Receive a Tax Rebate
More than one-quarter of all American adults will not get a tax rebate this year, and altogether nearly 40 percent will not get the full amount of $300 for individuals and $600 for couples, according to a research group. A24.

No Resurgence Seen in Advertising
The first half of 2001 is drawing to a close with few signs that the weakening of the advertising and media economies will reverse itself soon. The Publishers Information Bureau reported that ad revenue and ad pages for the nation's leading magazines fell noticeably in May compared with May 2000. And Robert J.

Deutsch to Close Office in Boston

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Deutsch Inc. in New York, in its first significant contraction, said yesterday that it would close its Boston office, which has been open only since July 2000, on July 11.
 Because of the "overall softness in the Boston marketplace and tighter economic conditions," the agency said in a statement, executives thought it was best to "put our resources behind other areas and opportunities that present higher growth potential." 
 Deutsch will resign the Boston office's sole account, Homeruns.com in Burlington, Mass., an online grocery service with billings estimated at $3 million, and will try to place the office's nine employees at the Deutsch headquarters in New York; its Marina del Rey, Calif., office; or at agencies owned by the Deutsch parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Posts are also being sought for the two executives in charge of the Boston office: Kathy Kiely, 44, executive vice president and general manager; and Kristin Volk, 48, executive vice president and strategic planning director.
The closing comes as Interpublic is considering a substantial reorganization that may ally Deutsch with large Interpublic agencies based in the Boston area, like Mullen and Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, which could make a Deutsch Boston office superfluous.
"None of our current clients require a Boston presence, so there's no need for us to have a partnership or anything," said Vonda LePage, a spokeswoman for Deutsch. "If any of that changes, we would look into it."
The closing of the Boston office is an unusual setback for Deutsch, which experienced tremendous growth before it was acquired late last year for about $250 million in Interpublic stock.

Shares Decline as Outlook for Technology Stirs Concern

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday, pulled down by selling in the technology sector after two more companies forecast weaker-than-expected quarterly results, stoking investors' fears about the sluggish economy.
 The companies, Varian Semiconductor Equipment and DuPont Photomask, which make devices used in the production of computer chips, cited continued weakness in the semiconductor industry for their financial revisions. 
 The news came as many companies were beginning to project their quarterly results in what is known on Wall Street as the preannouncement season. Analysts said investors retreated because they were nervous about how bad the earnings forecasts might be. 
"I haven't seen any fundamental development," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at the Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company in Overland Park, Kan. "The market's run up, and it's some profit taking as people scratch their heads and think about, 'What now?' 'When's the economy going to turn?' and 'What's the Fed going to do next?' "
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 44.32 points, or 2 percent, to 2,170.78. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 54.91 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,922.09. And the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.57 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,254.39.
James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, said investors, who have been hit by a barrage of negative economic data and company reports, were developing a "growing pessimism again on how fast the economy is going to recover." 
"The stock market is sort of treading water against continued disappointment of the economy," Mr. Paulsen said.
He said that the weakened economy was likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut short-term rates by as much as half a percentage point later this month, which would be its sixth rate cut this year. But investors are getting mixed signals.
"The tug of war is between profits, which are likely to stay somewhat disappointing, and yield and interest rates, which are likely to continue to be accommodating," he said.
Shares of Varian fell $3.22, to $39.25, after company officials said its third-quarter revenue was expected to fall 30 percent to 35 percent. The company previously forecast a decline of just more than 25 percent. Executives also said that since Jan. 1, they had cut the company's work force by 20 percent. The company is planning to shut down for two weeks in July.
DuPont Photomasks dropped $6.03, to $45.97, after executives said they expected it to break even or post a profit of as much as 19 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts expected the company to earn 45 to 57 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The company will also eliminate about 120 jobs, or 6 percent of its work force.
Neiman Marcus, the specialty retailer, fell 56 cents, to $33.74, after it issued a warning about an unexpected loss. Officials said the company would lose 10 to 15 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Analysts predicted a profit of 10 cents a share. 
Shares of Juniper Networks, a networking equipment maker, slipped $2.69, to $35.33, after analysts from Credit Suisse First Boston and Robertson Stephens cut earnings estimates for the company. On Friday, the company projected that its second-quarter earnings would be lower than previously estimated.
Among other technology losers, Qualcomm fell $1.46, to $59.78; Microsoft lost $1.07, to $72.12; Ciena dropped $3.15, to $52.99; and Intel was off 34 cents, to $30.33, four days after the company said that its second-quarter sales would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index fell 22.70 points, or 3.4 percent, to 653.00. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Bond prices rose yesterday as signs that Japan's economy was flirting with its fourth recession in a decade touched off concerns that weak global growth could impede a United States economic recovery expected later this year.
"The pickup in growth globally is going to be a lot slower than people think it is," said James Jackson, a senior bond portfolio manager at Brinson Partners in Chicago, which manages $50 billion in fixed-income assets.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32 , to 97 26/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.29 percent from 5.36 percent on Friday.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32 , to 95 17/32 . Its yield fell to 5.69 percent from 5.74 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Citing Economy and Debt, Warnaco Files for Chapter 11

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The Warnaco Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday, blaming the economy and its heavy debt load, among other things, for its problems.
 Under the leadership of Linda J. Wachner, the chief executive, Warnaco was transformed from a $590 million underwear maker to a diverse $2.25 billion apparel company with a dedicated following in stores and on the stock market. 
 Brands like Speedo, Calvin Klein and Chaps by Ralph Lauren were part of the fold. The share price soared. 
Yesterday, as Warnaco sought bankruptcy protection, all trading was suspended in the New York-based company's stock, which had closed at 39 cents on Friday, down from a high of $44.44 in July 1998.
Mrs. Wachner, who owns stock and options worth 22 percent of Warnaco, intends to remain at the company's helm, and a spokesman said yesterday that Warnaco's troubles reflected the state of the economy, a soft retail environment and its heavy debts. Warnaco listed debts of more than $3 billion and assets of $2.37 billion in its filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York.
"She has the full support of the board," Warnaco's spokesman and general counsel, Stanley Silverstein, said, "and will continue to lead the company through these challenging times."
The company announced that it had $600 million in new financing from its banks, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase and the Bank of Nova Scotia, to help it pay its bills and continue operating. It was given immediate access to $375 million yesterday, and a hearing is scheduled on July 9, when a judge will rule on release of the remaining $225 million, the company's bankruptcy lawyer, Kelley Ann Cornish, said. 
But the future of Warnaco remained unclear yesterday. The company is expected to become smaller under its reorganization, selling some assets and reducing its debt over all. 
Its history over the last 15 years has included some complicated transactions involving Mrs. Wachner in various ways. She led an investor group that acquired Warnaco in a hostile takeover in 1986. Four years later, she organized a new company, Authentic Fitness, to buy the Speedo brand from Warnaco for $85 million plus debt. In 1999, Warnaco purchased Authentic Fitness for $418 million in cash plus the assumption of $150 million in debt. 
Just which assets will now remain with Warnaco is uncertain. Some analysts questioned whether Calvin Klein Inc. would continue its licensing contract with the company. "The franchise may go to someone else," said one, who asked not to be identified. 
Mr. Silverstein said the license agreements that Warnaco has would not change under bankruptcy protection. "We intend to continue to take full advantage of the licenses," he said.
A spokesman for Calvin Klein did not return telephone messages yesterday seeking comment. 
Warnaco has other large problems to address. "It's not just a matter of having had too much debt at the wrong time," said Catherine Guinee, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. "They used a lot of that debt to repurchase their own shares. It was unfortunate timing because the market turned. But if they had had the right products arriving on time at the right price point, and the right quality, it would have been fine." 
She added: "Their press release stated that the economy was bad, everything was wrong and outside their control. But that's not what tears apart a company. You have to be mismanaged first." 
Cutting ties to its chief executive could be costly for Warnaco, which is short on cash. Mrs. Wachner's contract calls for her to be paid five times the highest annual salary and bonus she received at the company, which would be about $44 million, some experts estimate. Warnaco has far less than that in its reserves these days -- about $11 million. 
Mrs. Wachner has lost still more as the share price plummeted, with her stake now worth a tiny fraction of what it was worth even six months ago. 
Burt Flickinger III, a retail consultant with Reach Marketing, predicted that despite the high price to Warnaco for a split with Mrs. Wachner, some board members and investors might want to start over with someone new. "The whole issue of whether Linda stays or leaves will be World War III in terms of this bankruptcy reorganization," he said. "The department stores are furious. There will be a posse." 
Analysts and retail experts said the bankruptcy filing was hardly a surprise, given the steep slide of Warnaco's stock in recent weeks. At the end of March, the company warned that it would not meet Wall Street expectations, which caused a 60 percent drop in the share price. A few days later, Warnaco released fiscal fourth-quarter results, saying that it had lost nearly $195 million in the quarter ended in March, and $338 million for the fiscal year. It said it would not be profitable this year, either. 
The slowing economy has hit the retail industry especially hard, and many stores and manufacturers are battling the sudden turn in their fortunes. Warnaco was hardly immune, and the company cited the economy, among other factors, for its bankruptcy. 
"This was a confluence of a number of things," Mr. Silverstein said. "The general economic conditions, the retail environment, the company's debt load -- all of these contributed to the filing." 
Mrs. Wachner, 55, has been criticized for her management style, with lavish pay for herself as well as perks like gold-colored limousines and a company jet, and poor relationships with other senior executives. Some divisions at Warnaco have had rapid top-level turnover in recent years, which some people trace to Mrs. Wachner. 
For years, Warnaco was a cash lode for investors, churning out big dividends and rising share prices. Investors like Sid Bass bought big stakes in the company, and pension funds like the California Public Employees' Retirement System invested as well. Even when the situation started to sour, Mrs. Wachner maintained a certain base of support. 
"People had a lot of patience with her, but ultimately when the money runs out, the patience runs out," Mr. Flickinger said. "When she's making three times more than the president of Wal-Mart, and Warnaco has pillaged its partners to a large extent, it's difficult to make a case for C.E.O. continuity." 
The company's debt has dug into its earnings. It borrowed money to buy back shares in the last few years, only to see their price dive. And it has struggled through a lawsuit in recent months brought by Calvin Klein, the designer whose Calvin Klein jeans are made and distributed by Warnaco to department stores and discount outlets. The two sides settled the suit in January, but Warnaco blamed the negative publicity in part for its slow sales in the fourth quarter. 
For some, Warnaco's bankruptcy seemed inevitable. "The bank debt has been trading at 30 cents on the dollar since the beginning of the year," an analyst said, "and you knew this was going to be a problem."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD: Toronto, That Familiar Screen Face; 
As Movie Production Booms, a New Vitality Is Tempered by Location Fatigue

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
Sylvester Stallone is working out in the health club at the Four Seasons Hotel. Down the street, the singer Bono is sipping cappuccino in an outdoor cafe. Sophia Loren is having a news conference at the Windsor Arms Hotel to talk about her newest picture, "Between Strangers," written and directed by her youngest son, Edoardo Ponti. At Trattoria Sotto Sotto on Avenue Road, Robin Williams, Michael Douglas and Liam Neeson are sitting at a corner table, eating pasta.
 "It used to be an extremely quiet city," said Marisa Roca, the owner of Sotto Sotto. "Not any more. Nowadays we stay open until midnight, even one in the morning. It's alive now." 
 The source of Toronto's new vitality is easy to discern. About 40 television and feature film productions are being made here, most of them set in New York, Chicago or other cities in the United States or Europe, an increase of nearly 40 percent in the number of television and film productions made from January to March last year. (One reason for the increase was the threat of strikes by writers and actors, which led networks and studios to rush productions.) Over all, about 300 American movies and television shows are made in Canada each year, with Toronto getting the largest share. 
The influx of television and film production from the United States because of tax incentives and the cheap dollar has plainly altered the city's hotels and restaurants and served as an economic boon to the city of 2.5 million. But some people see a downside to the boom and wonder whether Toronto hasn't overextended itself to accommodate film and television production companies.
"It's getting more expensive, said Ed Gernon, executive vice president for movies and miniseries at Alliance Atlantis, a top Toronto-based production company that has helped finance and develop numerous television and feature films. He added: "It's become a very savvy town, and that has its good and bad sides. Talented folks here are either unavailable now or you're bidding for their services. There's a certain end of innocence. The talent pool may have grown too quickly. We've had to bring in crews from Montreal and pay their hotel costs and per diem.
"And the city is getting to look familiar. On more and more movies that are set in New York or other cities, you can recognize the Toronto locations. It's become so photographed, it's hard to get a distinctive look."
Recently, for example, CBS and Alliance Atlantis executives were looking at the footage of "The Jenifer Estess Story," a true story about an Off Broadway producer who with the help of her sisters battled amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. "We were looking at the dailies, and suddenly we were all shocked to see trolley tracks in the middle of what was supposed to be a street in Manhattan. We had become so inured to the trolley tracks." The tracks were removed digitally.
Similarly, Tom Russo, senior vice president for long-form programming at Paramount Network Television, said he was watching "Exit Wounds," a recent Steven Seagal action movie in which there was a high-speed chase set in Detroit. The only problem was that the cars swirled past Pizza Pizza, a Toronto fast-food franchise, and a Tim Horton's doughnut shop, another Toronto chain. "I can tell most of the time when I see a feature film or TV movie if it's been shot in Toronto," Mr. Russo said. "Toronto is no longer a well-kept secret."
Even if local residents sometimes grumble about movie trucks and trailers disrupting their neighborhoods, Toronto seems alternatively blase and welcoming toward film crews. For one thing, several television and film executives said, people in Toronto are far more low-key, friendly and even pliant than New Yorkers or Angelenos in similar circumstances. Nonetheless, last October a 52-year-old woman was handcuffed, strip-searched and jailed overnight for whistling on the street in Kensington Market and interrupting the filming of "Claire's Hat," with Juliette Lewis and Gina Gershon. The woman has filed a civil suit against the film company and the Toronto police seeking 500,000 Canadian dollars ($330,000) in damages.
"There are certain areas that are more sensitive than others, but we really try to manage that," said Rhonda Silverstone, Toronto's film commissioner. "So if we get a request, and we know they're going to have trouble, we say: 'Look for something else. It's not worth pursuing.' " Similarly, Gail Thomson, a director of the Ontario Media Development Corporation, acknowledged that she had heard of "location fatigue" in some areas of the city. "Some neighborhoods that have certain unique characteristics are weary now of being visited and revisited," Ms. Thomson said. "Take period churches. We only have so many. We're not New York. Or take a great alleyway. We don't have a huge number of those. So we have to approach things in a careful way. We have to protect our resources." 
"We are a much smaller city than New York or L.A., but we do have the ability to be a chameleon, to dress ourselves up and be another city," said Ms. Thomson. "And we do have the creative talent and the crews because of our live theater and the CBC." The CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, has served as a training ground for performers as well as film and television crews.
"There are challenges in dealing with success that we have to face," she added. (Lately, additional financial help has been offered to filmmakers to make movies outside of Toronto.)
Certainly the residents of Toronto and the local government are aware of the economic benefits of film and television production here. Last year film and television production activity, as well as commercials, surpassed 1.3 billion Canadian dollars (about $856 million), an increase of more than 8.3 percent from the previous year. The city can also count on tens of millions of dollars from related expenditures on hotels, food bills, car rentals and other costs of doing business. Other Canadian cities, like Montreal (often used to replicate Paris and other European locales), Vancouver (used for Seattle and other northwest cities) and Halifax and Winnipeg have also expanded as filmmaking centers for American networks and studios.
The reasons for the shift northward over the last few years are entirely financial. A film costing $60 million in the United States can be made in Canada for $40 million in American dollars. American producers said that costs were at least 30 percent higher in the United States. The reasons are tax-credit subsidies granted here to foreign film and television companies as well as the cheap Canadian dollar. (One American dollar is now about $1.50 Canadian.) "We've seen growth every year: it's a great business and the city welcomes it," said Ms. Silverstone. "People have been learning their craft for 20 years. We see no reason why it can't continue growing."
Labor unions in the United States have reacted somberly to the flood of production into Canada. A Commerce Department report in January concluded that tens of billions of dollars in television and movie work, and 20,000 jobs had been lost to Canada. Jack Shea, president of the Directors Guild, has referred to the shift as a "grave threat to the future of film and television production in the United States." Those especially hurt are "below the line" people on television and film productions -- not the high-profile actors, actresses and directors and producers but the directors of photography, the art directors, boom operators, sound mixers, grips, costume designers, makeup artists and prop builders.
Seeking to curb the exodus of American filmmakers, a Congressional task force on the entertainment industry has proposed legislation giving tax breaks to American companies that remain in the United States to make films.
Toronto, meanwhile, has itself undergone something of a transformation because of the flood of entertainment-related business. Hotels like the Four Seasons and the Sutton Place -- where nearly 40 percent of the rooms are occupied by Americans and others making movies in town -- along with a number of restaurants that have become hangouts have turned parts of the city into a low-key version of Los Angeles or New York.
"It's sort of a Disney version of New York," said Mr. Gernon, of Alliance Atlantis, who lives in Los Angeles. "It's cleaner, it's more polite, it's better designed, and it's not overcrowded. What's not to like?"
Even by the live-and-let-live standards of Toronto, however, some requests by movie stars have amazed hotel managers. Klaus Tenter, the longtime general manager of the Four Seasons, said it was a "real misconception" that most movie stars were impossible people. But he did note that one actress (he declined to identify her) insisted that her bedsheets not be tucked in and that her teddy bears be placed on pillows a certain way every night. The most bizarre request came from the wife of a movie star; their young daughter had made a design with yellow Post-Its on the marble floor of their suite. She asked Mr. Tenter to rip up the floor and send it, intact, to the star's home in Los Angeles. Mr. Tenter declined.
Similarly, Nick Vesely, the general manager at the Sutton Place, said he had accommodated virtually every odd request, including that of a star who wanted a raw spinach sandwich at 4 a.m. But one plea was turned down. A movie actor wanted to bring a pet lion to the hotel. "We do a lot of animals," said Mr. Vesely. "Not lions. I said, 'Forget it!' "
Across the street at Bistro 990, Fernando Temudo, the general manager, said there were unusual hazards to serving all the movie stars that showed up at the restaurant. Recently Goldie Hawn had dinner there, and a crowd of paparazzi gathered outside. Ms. Hawn asked Mr. Temudo to escort her past the photographers and assist her across the street to the Sutton Place hotel. As they left, their photo was taken. Within days, an Australian tabloid had a big photo of Ms. Hawn and Mr. Temudo, who was unidentified but listed as the actress's new boyfriend.
"I showed the picture to my wife," said Mr. Temudo. "What did she say? Like any wife, she asked me how long it took me to get to the hotel and where did I drop Goldie off." He laughed. "Can you imagine? After 21 years of marriage, my wife still asks me questions like that."

HEADLINE: In President's Words: 'A Leadership Role on the Issue of Climate Change' 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Bush today on global climate, as recorded by the White House: 
 Climate change, with its potential to impact every corner of the world, is an issue that must be addressed by the world. 
 The Kyoto Protocol was fatally flawed in fundamental ways. But the process used to bring nations together to discuss our joint response to climate change is an important one. That is why I am today committing the United States of America to work within the United Nations framework and elsewhere to develop with our friends and allies and nations throughout the world an effective and science-based response to the issue of global warming. 
My cabinet-level working group has met regularly for the last 10 weeks to review the most recent, most accurate and most comprehensive science. They have heard from scientists offering a wide spectrum of views. They have reviewed the facts, and they have listened to many theories and suppositions. The working group asked the highly respected National Academy of Sciences to provide us the most up-to-date information about what is known and about what is not known on the science of climate change. 
First, we know the surface temperature of the earth is warming. It has risen by six-tenths of 1 degree Celsius over the past 100 years. There was a warming trend from the 1890's to the 1940's, cooling from the 1940's to the 1970's, and then sharply rising temperatures from the 1970's to today. 
There is a natural greenhouse effect that contributes to warming. Greenhouse gases trap heat, and thus warm the earth, because they prevent a significant proportion of infrared radiation from escaping into space. Concentration of greenhouse gases, especially CO2 , have increased substantially since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. And the National Academy of Sciences indicates that the increase is due in large part to human activity. 
Yet the academy's report tells us that we do not know how much effect natural fluctuations in climate may have had on warming. We do not know how much our climate could or will change in the future. We do not know how fast change will occur or even how some of our actions could impact it. 
For example, our useful efforts to reduce sulfur emissions may have actually increased warming, because sulfate particles reflect sunlight, bouncing it back into space. And finally, no one can say with any certainty what constitutes a dangerous level of warming and, therefore, what level must be avoided. 
The policy challenge is to act in a serious and sensible way, given the limits of our knowledge. While scientific uncertainties remain, we can begin now to address the factors that contribute to climate change. 
There are only two ways to stabilize concentration of greenhouse gases. One is to avoid emitting them in the first place. The other is to try to capture them after they're created. And there are problems with both approaches. 
We're making great progress through technology, but have not yet developed cost-effective ways to capture carbon emissions at their source, although there is some promising work that is being done. 
And a growing population requires more energy to heat and cool our homes, more gas to drive our cars, even though we're making progress on conservation and energy efficiency and have significantly reduced the amount of carbon emissions per unit of G.D.P. 
Our country, the United States, is the world's largest emitter of man-made greenhouse gases. We account for almost 20 percent of the world's man-made greenhouse emissions. We also account for about one-quarter of the world's economic output. We recognize the responsibility to reduce our emissions. We also recognize the other part of the story -- that the rest of the world emits 80 percent of all greenhouse gases. And many of those emissions come from developing countries. 
This is a challenge that requires a 100 percent effort, ours and the rest of the world's. The world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases is China. Yet China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. India and Germany are among the top emitters. Yet India was also exempt from Kyoto. 
These and other developing countries that are experiencing rapid growth face challenges in reducing their emissions without harming their economies. We want to work cooperatively with these countries in their efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions and maintain economic growth. 
Kyoto also failed to address two major pollutants that have an impact on warming, black soot and tropospheric ozone. Both are proven health hazards. Reducing both would not only address climate change, but also dramatically improve people's health. 
Kyoto is, in many ways, unrealistic. Many countries cannot meet their Kyoto targets. The targets themselves were arbitrary and not based upon science. For America, complying with those mandates would have a negative economic impact, with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers. And when you evaluate all these flaws, most reasonable people will understand that it's not sound public policy. 
That's why 95 members of the United States Senate expressed a reluctance to endorse such an approach. Yet America's unwillingness to embrace a flawed treaty should not be read by our friends and allies as any abdication of responsibility. To the contrary, my administration is committed to a leadership role on the issue of climate change. 
We recognize our responsibility and will meet it -- at home, in our hemisphere and in the world. 
My cabinet-level working group on climate change is recommending a number of initial steps, and will continue to work on additional ideas. . . . I also call on Congress to work with my administration to achieve the significant emission reductions made possible by implementing the clean-energy technologies proposed in our energy plan. Our working group study has made it clear that we need to know a lot more. 
The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change commences to stabilizing concentrations at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. But no one knows what that level is. The United States has spent $18 billion on climate research since 1990, three times as much as any other country, and more than Japan and all 15 nations of the E.U. combined. 
Today, I make our investment in science even greater. My administration will establish the U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative to study areas of uncertainty and identify priority areas where investments can make a difference. 
I'm directing my secretary of commerce, working with other agencies, to set priorities for additional investments in climate change research, review such investments, and to improve coordination amongst federal agencies. We will fully fund high-priority areas for climate change science over the next five years. We'll also provide resources to build climate observation systems in developing countries and encourage other developed nations to match our American commitment. 
And we propose a joint venture with the E.U., Japan and others to develop state-of-the-art climate modeling that will help us better understand the causes and impacts of climate change. America's the leader in technology and innovation. We all believe technology offers great promise to significantly reduce emissions, especially carbon-capture, -storage and -sequestration technologies. 
So we're creating the National Climate Change Technology Initiative to strengthen research at universities and national labs, to enhance partnerships in applied research, to develop improved technology for measuring and monitoring gross and net greenhouse gas emissions and to fund demonstration projects for cutting-edge technologies such as bioreactors and fuel cells. . . . 
Yet even that isn't enough. 
I've asked my advisers to consider approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including those that tap the power of markets, help realize the promise of technology and ensure the widest possible global participation.

HEADLINE: Warming Threat Requires Action Now, Scientists Say 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In his speech on climate yesterday, President Bush said that a basic problem with the Kyoto Protocol, the proposed international pact for curtailing global warming, was that it laid out a timetable for cutting releases of heat-trapping gases before the threat posed by a buildup of those gases was clearly understood.
 But while many scientists and experts on risk management agreed in interviews yesterday that much remained unknown about the potential impact of rising temperatures, they took issue with the idea that this uncertainty justified further delay in acting to limit climate change. 
 "There will be deep uncertainty in the climatic future for a long time," said Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, who directs climate research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "But if you wait until it's diminished to some threshold that you assign and then learn that the problem is severe, it may be too late to do anything about it." 
Indeed, to many experts embroiled in the climate debate, the question of how much warming is too much -- which has been at the center of international climate negotiations for a decade -- now constitutes a red herring. They say it is more important to start from the point of widest agreement -- that rising concentrations of heat-trapping gases are warming the atmosphere, and that adding a lot more is probably a bad idea. The next step, they say, is to adopt policies that will soon flatten the rising arc on graphs of global emissions while also pursuing more research to clarify the risks. 
Many note that recent studies suggest a fairly high risk of significant ecological harm from a global temperature rise of less than 1 degree Fahrenheit and of substantial coastal flooding and agricultural disruption if temperatures rise more than 4 or 5 degrees in the new century.
Global temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 50 years; since the last Ice Age, they have risen about 9 degrees.
The risks are clear enough to justify some investments now in emissions controls, they say.
They say that the general quandary is no different from the kind faced by town officials who must judge how much road salt to buy based on uncertain long-term winter weather forecasts, or by countries deciding whether to invest in a missile defense system that might not ever have to shoot down a missile.
"It's silly to expect that we can resolve what the future is going to be," said Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a mathematician and political scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "That's like trying to do economic policy by asking competing economists what level the stock market is going to be at 20 years from now."
World leaders, he and other experts say, would do better to embrace the notion that the future holds a murky mix of risks, both environmental and economic, but both can be lessened by actions taken now. 
Increasingly, experts with diverse viewpoints on the extent of the climate risk agree on a general solution: policies that reduce emissions, coupled with intensified climate research and monitoring, and policies created with sufficient flexibility that they can be intensified or relaxed as the warming trend's causes and consequences become clearer. 
"This is such a big problem, it's so long-term, with uncertainties that are so substantial, that at every stage you have to learn and adjust," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist for Environmental Defense, a private conservation group.
A similar view is held by Dr. Robert J. Lempert, a senior scientist and expert in risk analysis at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institute based in Santa Monica, Calif., that has for decades studied risk strategies for the Pentagon and other government institutions. 
"Scientists aren't any time soon going to give politicians some magic answer," he said. "Policy makers for a long, long time are going to have to deal with a situation where it's not clear what the costs and benefits are, where lots of people disagree about them, and they can't wait until everything is resolved."
There is plenty to study in the meantime about aspects of the dizzyingly complex puzzle that is the atmosphere, many scientists said.
They said Mr. Bush was correct to allude in his speech to the idea that atmospheric temperatures might have been altered because of efforts to reduce pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes, most notably particles of sulfur dioxide, which contribute to acid rain, and of soot. 
"We're clearly interfering with climate in a variety of ways, with aerosols on the one hand and gases on the other," said Dr. James E. Hansen, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a climate modeling center in Manhattan run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Dr. Hansen has briefed the Bush administration twice on the issue, focusing on the possibility of cleaning up releases of soot and methane, which both have a warming influence on the atmosphere, first, and moving to cuts in carbon dioxide, which is released by burning oil and coal, when technological advances make that change cheaper.

HEADLINE: The Regulatory Signals Shift; 
F.T.C. Serves as Case Study of Differences Under Bush

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
Timothy J. Muris, the new chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, watched with his newly assembled staff from the back of the crowded room last week as his predecessor, Robert Pitofsky, delivered his valedictory address after six years leading the agency.
 "What is it about this small agency that attracts superstars from law schools, Supreme Court clerks, partners at great law firms?" Mr. Pitofsky asked hundreds of officials and friends gathered for the occasion. "There is at this agency a willingness to challenge the most powerful companies in the world, when those companies have done wrong, in the name of the less powerful." 
 Mr. Pitofsky, after a tenure widely viewed as one of aggressively enforcing antitrust and consumer laws, appeared to be delivering a subtle message to Mr. Muris. Many Democrats and Republicans, consumer groups and corporate chieftains see the change in leadership at the commission as a case study in the differences between the Clinton and Bush administrations on fundamental areas of regulation. 
Mr. Muris, a senior trade commission official for five years during the Reagan administration, criticized the agency during the Pitofsky era for not being sympathetic enough to the economic benefits of large corporate mergers and for bringing monopoly cases like the ones the agency filed against the Intel Corporation and Visx, a maker of laser vision correction equipment.
Since assuming the leadership this month of the 1,000-member agency charged with enforcing antitrust and consumer protection laws, Mr. Muris, 51, has maintained that he intends to follow in Mr. Pitofsky's footsteps. Moreover, officials at the agency say Mr. Muris has told them that he is looking for some big proposed mergers and other cases to demonstrate that he will be a tough antitrust enforcer.
"It's important that I establish I'm a prosecutor, and I'm comfortable being a prosecutor," he said in an interview last week. "People may read things and see a shift and bring dumb mergers. And if they do that, we'll stop them."
But in his first days in office, Mr. Muris has been criticized for giving top positions to two former economists who worked for the tobacco industry as it came under legal attack by the Clinton administration. In addition, Mr. Muris has appointed as general counsel a law professor who once said that three of the current trade commissioners were a "national embarrassment."
He has changed the agency's direction on online privacy. Under Mr. Pitofsky, the commission asked Congress for a law giving the agency more authority to police privacy violations. Mr. Muris says he needs more time to study the issue.
And shortly before joining the agency, he argued on behalf of a credit rating agency that the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which has been used by the trade commission to challenge the sale of confidential information for marketing purposes, was unconstitutional, a view rejected two months ago by the United States Court of Appeals here.
Mr. Muris's initial decisions have raised concerns inside the agency and among consumer and other groups that he will be returning the agency to the ideology of an earlier era.
The fears among consumer advocates and some longtime staff members have been stoked in part by the senior staff assembled by Mr. Muris. The new head of the consumer protection bureau, for instance, is J. Howard Beales III, an economist who has asserted that there is no link between cigarette advertisements and smoking among teenagers.
Agency officials said they thought that Mr. Beales would be the first nonlawyer to head the consumer protection bureau and that his background would bring a more market-oriented approach to the job.
David Scheffman, another economist who has worked for the tobacco industry, has been appointed to head the agency's bureau of economics. Mr. Scheffman has testified on behalf of the tobacco industry that cigarette makers never conspired to suppress the development of healthier products.
Internal turmoil over the changing of the guard surfaced in a memorandum circulating late last week that was written by the agency's two Democratic commissioners, Sheila F. Anthony and Mozelle W. Thompson. 
Mr. Muris had planned to have the five-member commission vote last week on the new appointments. But he put it off after becoming concerned that the vote would be 3 to 2, an inauspicious beginning since staff appointments typically are approved without dissent. A close vote, officials said, might have been seen as troubling by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, the new chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the commission.
Officials said Ms. Anthony and Mr. Thompson, the two Democrats, ultimately agreed not to vote against the appointments after extracting commitments from the new staff members to cast aside their previously held views on certain issues, which the commissioners described in the memo as "inconsistent with the consumer protection mission" of the agency. 
The Democratic commissioners were also described as being troubled that Mr. Muris had selected William E. Kovacic as general counsel. 
Mr. Kovacic, a law professor from George Washington University, said in an interview in 1998 with Bloomberg News Service that he viewed three commissioners appointed by President Clinton -- Ms. Anthony, Mr. Thompson and Orson G. Swindle III, who fills one of the Republican positions on the panel -- as a "national embarrassment" for not knowing enough about antitrust law and for being "three smart people who are learning on the job."
Defending his appointments, Mr. Muris insists that he will continue most of the policies put in place by Mr. Pitofsky and that there are few issues at the agency that are truly partisan. 
"Ralph Nader used this agency to make his case that the difference between Bush and Gore was like the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee," said Mr. Muris, who during the campaign and in the first few months of the new administration had been an economic adviser to President Bush. 
But he has also acknowledged that he will be more sympathetic to the economic efficiencies used to justify large corporate mergers, and that he is less inclined to bring some of the monopolization cases brought by the Clinton administration. 
Mr. Muris has said, for example, that he would not have challenged the proposed merger that reduced the number of baby food makers from three to two because it also presented significant benefits for consumers. 
His view of that case, which was shaped both out of his antitrust views and as a lawyer working for one of the companies, was rejected two months ago by a unanimous three- judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
"There will be differences at the margins," Mr. Muris said. "These margins are important."
To some consumer groups, the differences cut to the core of the agency's mandate.
Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that the difference between Mr. Pitofsky's tenure and the views reflected by Mr. Muris's staff "is the difference between consumer protection and nonconsumer protection."
"While serving as a consultant to R. J. Reynolds, Howard Beales expressed the views that tobacco advertising, no matter how egregious, doesn't impact children and therefore shouldn't be subject to regulation," Mr. Myers said. "A person with that kind of longstanding affiliation with the tobacco industry and views so far outside of the mainstream about the impact of tobacco marketing on children is unlikely to be an aggressive protector of our nation's kids."
The agency's new spokeswoman, Cathy MacFarlane, said Mr. Beales would not comment on the issues surrounding his appointment.
Conservatives and some business executives say Mr. Muris, bringing a far more limited vision of the agency and greater reliance on the marketplace, will play a more constructive role than Mr. Pitofsky in helping companies attract capital.
"Muris is less quick to jump to the conclusion that markets have failed," said Randolph J. May, a senior fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a conservative research organization. "He would sooner sit back and wait and see whether regulation is really needed more as a last resort rather than a first resort."
But others say that vision could be detrimental to consumers.
Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said the appointments "send a signal that large corporate entities don't have to worry too much about tough enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and that's a significant concern."
"It appears to be a green light," Mr. Kimmelman said, "to the business community that the cop is not actively policing the beat." 
Mr. Muris said that his views on cigarette advertising were not significantly different from those of Mr. Pitofsky's, producing a 1977 article by Mr. Pitofsky in which he said that advertising fraud cases require reliable data, not some "theoretical effort to achieve truth."
He also said Mr. Beales would not be involved in cigarette advertising cases.
After the commission, under Mr. Pitofsky, filed a complaint asserting that R. J. Reynolds was engaged in deceptive advertising, the company agreed to retire Joe Camel and his brethren cartoon characters, which include Buster, Max and Floyd.
Mr. Muris said that the agency now spent very few resources on tobacco matters and the issues, while important, were a relatively minor part of the agency's portfolio.
But Mr. Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said that the agency had a complaint before it challenging claims by Reynolds Tobacco that its new Eclipse cigarettes might be less of a health risk.
"This is precisely the kind of issue," he said, "that the F.T.C. should be weighing in on."

HEADLINE: Hughes Warns of a Slower Rate of New Subscribers for DirecTV 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The Hughes Electronics Corporation, the unit of General Motors that owns the satellite broadcasting service DirecTV, warned yesterday that it was adding new subscribers at a considerably slower rate than it had previously forecast.
 Hughes's chief executive, Jack A. Shaw, attributed the poor performance in part to the amount of attention that the company's top officials have recently paid to sorting out the details of a possible takeover bid by the News Corporation, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. 
 Calling the negotiations "a major distraction" that "negatively impacted our financial performance," Mr. Shaw told analysts that "our performance is not satisfactory and is unacceptable to ourselves and to all Hughes shareholders." 
He added, "We will not let it stand."
The announcement was the second such warning in two months for Hughes, which yesterday cut its forecast for new satellite subscribers to about 175,000 from the as many as 350,000 it had promised for the second quarter. Hughes said that for the full year it expected about 24 percent fewer new subscribers than it had forecast to analysts several weeks ago.
The revised forecasts come at a precarious time. As negotiations with the News Corporation continue, analysts said that Hughes's lower projections gave G.M. less bargaining power.
G.M. has struggled to sell Hughes, getting a much lower offer for the business than it had originally expected. G.M. is particularly eager to sell Hughes to raise as much as $9 billion in cash, a figure that most analysts suggest is still too high. G.M.'s effort to get that much cash is hampered by the fact that the News Corporation is so indebted that it cannot afford to pay cash for Hughes. Mr. Murdoch's company is expected to offer a combination of its own stock and cash contributed by partners like Microsoft, analysts said.
Besides focusing too much attention on reaching a deal with the News Corporation, Hughes, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., said it was struggling to keep customers who had already signed up. The company blamed the problem on the weak economy and lackluster retail sales, especially in rural areas.
Hughes said that it planned to revise its strategy to focus on courting existing cable customers who have "experienced large rate increases or poor performance." The hope is that by aiming at consumers who are more likely to stick with DirecTV, Hughes will spend less to attract and keep each customer.
Despite forecasting fewer new subscribers for the second quarter, Hughes said that it had not changed its projection of $2 billion in revenue for the quarter. However, Hughes said that revenue for 2001 would increase only 20 percent instead of its previous forecast of 20 to 25 percent. The company said it expected to have 10.8 million customers this year, down slightly from an earlier forecast of 11 million to 11.2 million.
The EchoStar Communications Corporation, Hughes' main competitor, said that it drew a million new customers in the last seven months and had a total of six million subscribers. Echostar, which has said it is considering making its own bid for Hughes, said that it hoped to add a total of 1.7 million customers this year.
Shares of Hughes dropped 50 cents yesterday, to $22.60. Hughes made its announcement after the markets closed.

HEADLINE: Bush to Insist on Ethanol Use in California 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has decided to force California to use ethanol as an antipollution fuel additive, a move that the critics say could result in an increase of at least 5 cents a gallon at the pump this summer in that state. 
 California had asked the federal government to be exempted from a Clean Air Act requirement to use fuel additives like ethanol to cleanse its gasoline, arguing that cheaper technologies were available. 
 Administration officials said today that the government would issue a decision on Tuesday denying the request.
Last Friday, in a speech in Iowa, Mr. Bush hinted at the decision, saying he supported the use of ethanol "not only to reduce dependency on foreign sources of energy but secondly as a way to clean the air." 
Several Democratic senators from farm states, including Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the new majority leader, and Tom Harkin of Iowa, the new chairman of the Agriculture Committee, saw a favorable decision as a huge boon to their states' economies and had urged Mr. Bush to deny California the waiver.
It was Mr. Daschle -- and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas -- who began the push for ethanol a decade ago by inserting in the Clean Air Act an amendment that required 2 percent of cleaner-burning gasoline to contain oxygenates like ethanol.
The act required that it be sold in cities with the worst smog: Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Sacramento and San Diego.
Some California fuel has oxygenates throughout the year, but in most Northeastern states the additives are used only in the winter months to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide.
The decision opens up the biggest market in the country to corn producers and, in particular, could benefit the Archer Daniels Midland agribusiness, a major Republican contributor, because it is one of the few ethanol producers able to transport ethanol to the West and East Coasts.
But environmentalists say there are now less expensive, less complex ways to reduce such pollution than adding ethanol.
And they contend that Mr. Bush's decision is intended to solidify his support in the farm states that he won in the last election and help him make an important overture to Iowa, which he lost.
Several Northeast states were waiting to see whether California received its waiver before applying for their own, but a spokesman for a consortium of those states said today that they would not apply and without it would expect to see an increase in gasoline prices.
Gov. Gray Davis of California, who has already clashed with the White House over its energy policy and its refusal to place price caps on electricity, said the decision could cost Californians, who already pay the highest gas prices in the nation, an additional 6 cents per gallon, or about $450 million a year for the estimated 580 million gallons of ethanol that will be needed annually.
Janet Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, with a specialty in fuels and vehicles, said the decision "means that the whole country has to use ethanol in every gallon of reformulated gas, which means suddenly a lot of demand has to chase a limited supply, which always means prices go up."
Ms. Hathaway added, "It's not necessary to use ethanol to achieve the same environmental results."
There are basically two widely available additives, or oxygenates, that help cleanse gasoline -- ethanol and M.T.B.E. (methyl tertiary butyl ether). But M.T.B.E. has been found to contaminate drinking water and is being phased out in 11 states, including California and much of the Northeast.
The administration's expected decision would force those states instead to use ethanol, an alcohol made by the fermentation of sugars from corn, which last year constituted two-thirds of 1 percent of the gasoline produced in this country.
California argued two years ago to the Environmental Protection Agency that it wanted a waiver from such a mandate because refiners had other ways to blend gasoline that were cheaper and cleaner.
The agency under the Clinton administration decided to grant the waiver, concluding that it would reduce emissions, but President Bill Clinton never completed action on the matter.
David Uchic, a spokesman for the National Corn Growers Association, said he doubted California's claim of cheaper, cleaner blends.
"If you want to tell us you can refine a gas that meets the Clean Air standards and is cheaper than ethanol-added enhanced gas, go ahead," Mr. Uchic said. "Let's see the numbers." 
In addition, he said the Bush decision was a flat-out victory for his industry, which hopes to triple ethanol production over the next decade. 
"This will spur new investment in ethanol plants and in expanding existing facilities, and we just see production going up, up, up," Mr. Uchic said.
Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a consortium of state agencies, said the administration's decision was ill-conceived and potentially harmful. "We will be paying more money for higher-polluting gasoline," Mr. Grumet said. "This is a decision that will profoundly benefit a couple of multinational agribusinesses at the expense of the environment, drivers and the small farmer."

HEADLINE: Bush Will Continue to Oppose Kyoto Pact on Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
President Bush made clear today that he had no intention of reversing his opposition to a global warming accord supported by the European leaders he will meet with this week. And he strongly suggested that any new accord would have to bind developing nations, especially China and India, to the kind of commitments that would be made by the United States.
 In an effort to mollify his European critics in the hours before he left for Spain tonight on his first trip to Europe as president, Mr. Bush acknowledged the severity of the global warming problem and said the United States would "lead the way by advancing the science on climate change." He described several new research initiatives that could mark a potentially significant focusing of American climate study. 
 But while suggesting a new approach to the issue of global warming, Mr. Bush remained firm in rejecting the 1997 Kyoto accord, noting that it set no standards for major emitters of greenhouse gases, like China and India, while creating mandates for the United States that could prove economically crippling. His aides further argued that the accord -- aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels -- was written to make it easier for Europe than for the United States to meet the goals. 
Mr. Bush's outright rejection of the treaty two months ago led to an uproar in Europe. While unapologetic about their decision to back away from the accord, White House officials concede that they did a poor job of explaining their objections or their approach to the problem of reducing heat-trapping gases.
So today, Mr. Bush stepped into the Rose Garden with several of his cabinet members and publicly embraced a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences that concluded that temperatures are rising because of human activities. At the same time, he insisted that his rejection of the Kyoto protocol "should not be read by our friends and allies as any abdication of responsibility."
"We will act, learn and act again, adjusting our approaches as science advances and technology evolves," he said. Excerpts, Page A12. 
In essence, Mr. Bush was arguing that the market should be allowed to solve the problem, with the United States pushing along research "consistent with the long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere." 
While advocating an attack on the problem of the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the president once again rejected the mandates in the Kyoto treaty that the United States and other developed nations cut their emission levels of those gases to well below 1990 levels, a move he said would be economically disastrous for the United States and the world. He offered no concrete alternatives to the Kyoto cutbacks, however, beyond research and the gradual application of new technology. And he reiterated his longstanding pledge that he would not agree to any accord that exempts the developing world. "The world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases is China," Mr. Bush said, with Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at his side. "Yet China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto protocol. India and Germany are among the top emitters. Yet India was also exempt from Kyoto."
Mr. Bush omitted any direct criticism of Europe, even though his aides have been saying, publicly and privately, that the members of the European Union have deliberately manipulated the debate -- and unfairly caricatured Mr. Bush as an enemy of good environmental practice -- to cover up their political problems coming into compliance with the Kyoto mandates. 
Andrew Card, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, told reporters over lunch here today that the target of cutting greenhouse emissions to below 1990 levels was picked with "Machiavellian intent" because it enabled them to count in East Germany just before its economy was collapsing. One result is that Europe must now cut its emissions far less than the United States does, he argued. 
Mr. Card argued that Mr. Bush had taken a courageous position that other nations would eventually come to appreciate. "The emperor of Kyoto was running around the stage for a long time naked," he said, "and it took President Bush to say, 'He doesn't have any clothes on.' "
Mr. Bush's statement today only seemed to fuel his disagreements with Europe, even as it was intended to tamp them down. "Everyone will be polite this week, I'm sure," said a senior European diplomat here, "but the standard everyone will be holding him to is how this stacks up against Kyoto. Where is the target? What is the U.S. timetable?"
Moreover, he has probably re-ignited the dispute with the developing world. China, for instance, has managed to reduce its emissions significantly in the last few years, and it argues that the United States has done comparatively little. Chinese officials have already said they view efforts to force stricter controls as part of a move to contain Chinese economic power. 
Just as China and India have rejected limiting their economic potential by imposing strict environmental standards, Mr. Bush made clear today that he would not agree to any environmental limits that would slow the economy of either the United States or the world. 
"We account for almost 20 percent of the man-made greenhouse emissions," he said. "We also account for about one-quarter of the world's economic output. We recognize the responsibility to reduce our emissions." 
But he added that "we also recognize the other part of the story," saying the targets in the Kyoto treaty would "have a negative economic impact, with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers."
Mr. Bush's statement was dismissed by a range of environmental groups as an effort to evade the issue by promising new scientific initiatives, but leaving unclear how much he was willing to spend, or how long the studies should take.
While Mr. Bush called for a "national climate change technology initiative" today, former members of the Clinton administration said it bore great resemblance to a $4.5 billion, five-year program they proposed four years ago. Congress never fully financed it, and Mr. Bush's recent budget did not support it.
"It's very weak tea," said David B. Sandalow, the former assistant secretary of state for oceans, environment and science and one of the negotiators of the Kyoto protocol in the last administration. Mr. Sandalow, now a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, said, "If you were trying to develop a strategy to make sure China and India would not cooperate, you couldn't develop a better one than what Mr. Bush announced today."
What was striking about today's statement, though, was Mr. Bush's extensive discussion of the issue, and his commitment to do something about it -- even as he swathed the specifics in a cloud of ambiguities.
He characterized global warming as a serious long-range problem but one whose dimensions were still too little understood. 
He tacitly acknowledged that the United States' rejection of the Kyoto accord had estranged the United States from many nations with which it has good relations generally.
Accordingly, Mr. Bush said he would push for new efforts to study global warming and more coordination among research institutions. He called for more money to pay for research into ways to control greenhouse gases.
If some of the president's statements today about technology and America's own advances sounded familiar, it may be because it had echoes of his father's speech nine years ago this week at a major environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro that set the stage for the Kyoto negotiations.
"Let's face it, there has been some criticism of the United States," the first President Bush said at the time. "But I must tell you, we come to Rio proud of what we have accomplished and committed to extending the record on American leadership on the environment. In the United States, we have the world's tightest air quality standards on cars and factories, the most advanced laws for protecting lands and waters, and the most open processes for public participation."
He added, "Now for a simple truth: America's record on environmental protection is second to none."
In the years since, the United States has continued to support research and new technology and to push for limits on automobile exhaust and factory emissions.
By repeating his fidelity today to negotiating with other nations under the 1992 climate treaty signed by his father, Mr. Bush is essentially trying to reset the clock, arguing that Kyoto should be scrapped in favor of a new, market-based accord that did not impose such an onerous economic cost.
But it is far from clear that he can win any converts to that position. Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a nonpartisan group that works with many large corporations seeking to scale back their emissions, said today that she was "confused" about Mr. Bush's political goal.
"He is meeting with Europeans who are doing some very ambitious things to reduce emissions," she said. "Yet what we don't have from him is something that talks about how you go about reducing emissions."
Some of that, Bush administration officials said, is contained in his energy report, issued last month. Mr. Bush, for instance, called for the increased use of nuclear power, because it emits no greenhouse gases. In a sign of how far apart he and the Europeans are, Germany today reached an agreement with its utilities to phase out the use of nuclear power, in part because of the growing problem of disposing of nuclear waste.
Although this will be Mr. Bush's first trip to Europe since taking office, White House aides said today that the president, who critics have said has had little exposure to foreign countries, has made several previous trips to the region.
A White House spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said Mr. Bush had been to the Britain at least three times, most recently in 1990, when he also visited Spain, Portugal and Morocco. He also said Mr. Bush had visited France, though no date was provided.

HEADLINE: Tax Rebate Will Bypass Many, Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
More than one-quarter of all American adults will not get a tax rebate this year. Altogether, nearly 40 percent will not get the full amount of $300 for individuals and $600 for couples.
 The main reason is that after deductions, exemptions and credits, these people owed little or nothing in income taxes, even though most of them paid Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
 The calculations showing the large number of taxpayers who will not get a rebate were made by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal, nonprofit research institute that has the only computer model outside the government that can figure what the tax law signed last week by President Bush means for people at different income levels. 
No one in the government disputes the organization's findings, although Mr. Bush, other administration officials and Republicans in Congress have been promoting the benefits of the law to people of modest means.
The tax rebate was intended to give a quick boost to the economy and to buy political support for the $1.35 trillion tax reduction legislation that President Bush signed into law on Thursday.
On a visit to a farm in Iowa on Friday, Mr. Bush declared, "Tax relief is going to be evident pretty quickly, when married couples start getting a $600 check this summer."
The Citizens for Tax Justice study shows that 339,771 adult Iowans, about 25 percent of the total, will get no rebate, and that another 193,885 adults will get only a partial rebate.
Nationally, the study shows, 34 million American adults, or 26 percent, will get no rebate, and another 17 million, or 13 percent, will get less than the full rebate.
These are mainly people with incomes below $25,000.
"It's working families who are counting on a rebate the most who are the most likely to get nothing this year," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Under the law, a single person must have $6,000 in taxable income -- after deductions, exemptions and credits -- to be entitled to a full refund. A couple must have $12,000.
The rebate is based on the taxes people paid on their income in 2000. A couple with two children and a total income of $25,000 owed no income taxes and would get no rebate.
Here is why: The couple was allowed a standard deduction of $7,350 and four personal exemptions of $2,800 each. That reduced the couple's taxable income to $6,450. The couple was in the lowest tax bracket, 15 percent, and 15 percent of $6,450 is $967.50. The couple was also entitled to a tax credit of $500 for each of the two children, and that reduced the tax liability to zero.
But assuming that all the income was from wages, the couple paid 7.65 percent, or $1,912, in Social Security and Medicare taxes and their employers paid another 7.65 percent, for a total of nearly $4,000.
Payroll taxes were not part of the debate on taxes in Congress this year. But three-quarters of all taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes.
For people who owed some taxes but had taxable income of less than $6,000 ($10,000 in the case of a single parent and $12,000 for a couple) the rebate will amount to 5 percent of their 2000 tax bill. 
Another group that will not get the rebate are people who earned enough to pay taxes but were claimed, or could have been claimed, as dependents by another taxpayer.
Although the rebate is based on taxes paid on income in 2000, it is actually a reduction in 2001 taxes. It is predicated on the part of the law that, beginning in 2001, reduces the tax rate to 10 percent from 15 percent on the first $6,000 of an individual's income, the first $10,000 of a single parent's and the first $12,000 of a couple's. 
The Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee has calculated that as many as five million low-income households with children will not get a rebate, although in later years they will be able to take advantage of the 10 percent rate.
Taxpayers who do not get the full rebate based on their 2000 taxes but earned more in 2001 will be able to claim whatever else is owed them when they pay their 2001 taxes early next year. But those who owe less in taxes in 2001 than they owed in 2000 will not have to repay the difference.
The Internal Revenue Service plans to send taxpayers letters in mid-July telling them the amount of the rebate they can expect and the week it will be mailed. All the checks will be sent by the end of September. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 13, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about tax rebates this year misstated the amount to be received by those entitled to only a partial rebate -- that is, people who owed some taxes but had taxable income below $6,000 (below $10,000 in the case of a single parent or $12,000 for a couple). The check will be 5 percent of their taxable income for 2000, not 5 percent of their 2000 tax bill.

 The pound fell to a 16-year low against the United States dollar despite assurances by the government that its policy with regard to the euro had not changed. Jack Straw, left, Britain's new foreign secretary, said the country's euro policy remained unchanged, producing a brief recovery in the pound from a 15-year low set last week after the re-election of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Blair has said the government will decide within two years whether a referendum should be held on scrapping the pound. By the end of London trading, the pound had weakened once again and fallen to $1.3755. The moves reflected a trend among investors to link the pound to the euro in dollar-trading.

Bush Maintains Opposition To Global Warming Accord
President Bush made clear that he had no intention of reversing his opposition to the Kyoto climate accord supported by the European leaders he is to meet with this week. And he strongly suggested that any new accord must also bind developing nations, especially China and India, to the kind of commitments that would be made by the United States. A1

Israeli-Palestinian Talks
Security officials from both sides met for four hours but failed to reach an agreement on an American proposal that would extend the fragile and partial 10-day-old cease-fire, according to a Palestinian official involved. The official also said that C.I.A. Director George J. Tenet, who mediated, had told negotiators that he was uncertain that he would be willing to continue the talks. The toll of the violence rose with the death of a 5-month-old Israeli, Yehuda Haim Shoham, who was injured last week by Palestinian stone throwers. A10

High-Tech Snooping Barred
The Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that police use of a thermal imaging device to detect patterns of heat coming from a private home is a search that requires a warrant. The court said the requirement would also apply to any systems that let the police gain knowledge that in the past would have required physical entry. A1

HEADLINE: BUSH'S COMMISSION ON SOCIAL SECURITY MAY PROPOSE CAPS 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The co-chairmen of President Bush's Social Security commission said today that they would probably have to propose politically difficult steps like raising the retirement age and reducing cost of living adjustments when they make recommendations to the White House for restoring the system's long-term financial health.
 Mr. Bush created the commission to come up with a plan for adding personal investment accounts to Social Security. But the panel's co-chairmen, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former Democratic senator from New York, and Richard D. Parsons, a Republican who is co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, said they expected their recommendations to also encompass other, more contentious changes needed to put Social Security on sound footing. 
 Any such recommendations could force Mr. Bush either to embrace a position that could carry heavy political cost or to disavow the work of his own, hand-picked advisers. 
Mr. Bush has pledged not to cut benefits for current retirees or for people nearing retirement, but he has always sidestepped questions about whether he could support scaling back the guaranteed benefit for future generations of retirees.
Mr. Moynihan has long advocated raising the age at which retirees can claim benefits and trimming back the rate at which benefits are adjusted for inflation. Asked in an interview whether those steps or others like them would be included in the commission's final report, Mr. Moynihan said no decisions had been made but that it would be difficult to address the system's problems without taking some politically unpopular actions.
"I would expect that's the only way we're going to get where we're heading," Mr. Moynihan said today during a break in the commission's first meeting. The panel is scheduled to send its recommendations to Mr. Bush in the fall.
Mr. Parsons said the current system is unsustainable, and that assuring its long-term solvency would involve some difficult tradeoffs.
Mr. Parsons said that "there will be those who feel their ox is being gored."
Several other members of the 16-person panel, all of whom were selected by the White House, agreed in interviews that the commission would have little choice but to push for steps that the president and Congress might find politically explosive. 
"Personal accounts alone will not solve the Social Security problem," said John F. Cogan, a commission member who was one of Mr. Bush's economic advisers during the campaign.
Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House, said Mr. Bush "appointed a commission to address the critical issues facing the Social Security system, and we are not going to prejudge what the commission will find."
If no changes were made, Social Security would start running short of money to pay all promised benefits over the next few decades, according to projections by Social Security's trustees. 
By 2016, the payroll taxes that finance the system would no longer cover benefits, forcing Social Security to begin redeeming the government bonds it holds. By 2038, the bonds would be gone, leaving the system able to pay less than three-quarters of benefits.
Mr. Bush made allowing workers to invest some of their Social Security money in the financial markets one of his top campaign promises. He has indicated that he will begin pushing the issue in Congress late this year and next year, after the panel provides him with proposals for how to carry out what would be the most far-reaching overhaul of the system since its founding in the New Deal.
To supporters of private accounts, the fact that Mr. Bush is in the White House is evidence that politicians no longer have to fear tampering with Social Security. Polls show there is substantial support, especially among younger people, for allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.
But critics of personal accounts say Mr. Bush has never explained how he would pay for his plan and never acknowledged that it would involve tradeoffs that might make it less attractive. Most Democrats in Congress oppose personal accounts, and liberal groups promised to fight the commission and the president through every step of the debate.
The administration is taking "the first steps to partially dismantling the Social Security system in ways that could make it less secure," said Roger Hickey, director of the New Century Alliance for Social Security and Medicare, a liberal advocacy group. 
Robert Greenstein, the director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, said any plan that diverts payroll tax revenue into private accounts would require large infusions of money into the system out of the general government budget. But after Mr. Bush's tax cut, he said, "there is nothing left."
The commission has not yet begun debating in detail the various approaches to creating private accounts. 
Asked at a news conference today whether the commission could promise that the combination of personal accounts and the guaranteed benefit would be at least as much as the current guaranteed benefit, Mr. Parsons remained silent and Mr. Moynihan did not provide a direct response.
"We have the president's instructions, and we will follow them," Mr. Moynihan said.
Mr. Parsons said the commission would leave the politics to Mr. Bush. And Mr. Moynihan said that previous Congresses and presidents have been willing to take unpopular steps when necessary to keep Social Security financially healthy.
"That's what grown-ups sometimes have to do," Mr. Moynihan said. 
The age at which retirees can claim their full Social Security benefit is already scheduled to rise gradually from 65 to 67 over the next several decades.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS; 
Mining Firms Reap the Benefits of Being Late Adopters

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
ANDY FULTON works in a business that is as old-school and basic as you can get. As vice president of the international division of ME International, he sells what are called cast wear parts for stone crushers at mining sites. Ore mixed with stone is pulverized by these large crushing machines, and after a while the coverings of the crushing machines wear out. That is where ME International comes in with its custom-made parts for worn machinery.
 "The mining industry is a bit conservative," Mr. Fulton said. "We do big things, and people like the way they have been doing them for years." 
 Even so, Mr. Fulton is starting to warm to the Internet as a place to do business.
"I can't tell you how much easier it is to deal with someone in Indonesia, where it might be the middle of the night, via the Internet," he said. "We're no longer waiting just for the mail. We don't have years, or even months, of experience with electronic commerce, but we clearly see as buyers and suppliers look to control costs, it will be how we will be doing business."
On one hand, the stereotype of the miner comes from John Henry and other brawny characters, and on the other hand are the mercurial gold-rush barons. Neither seem the type to cuddle up to the new-economy virtues of the Internet.
But even in this tough business, e-commerce has a toehold. There are nascent Web-based businesses for the trading and auctioning of metals like copper and aluminum, and there are others bringing together materials suppliers like ME International and mining companies like Alcoa, Newmont and DeBeers.
Among the latter is Quadrem (quad for four corners of the earth and rem for resource e-marketplace), which was founded by a consortium of mining companies in October 2000 primarily for buying equipment.
Oddly enough, it may be because the mining business has tended to be plodding and conservative that Quadrem has the chance to succeed where many business-to-business Web sites have floundered. Executives at the mining companies say they are wary of spending too much time and money trying to master Web-based transactions, and that they are determined not to forget the business in e-business. They are also not expecting the Internet to revolutionize their business, an attitude that has helped them set smaller, more achievable goals.
"Mining companies have tended to be middle-to-late adopters in technology, so we were all cautious, but I think we have the right model," said John Huber, the director of e-business at Newmont Mining.
Dan Miklovic, an analyst at the Gartner Group, a technology research firm in Stamford, Conn., said that Quadrem's limited scope and lack of direct competition among the buyers in the consortium helped its chances for success.
"Quadrem did several things right," Mr. Miklovic said. "First, it concentrates on materials procurement. Second, it has competitors which don't really compete. DeBeers is primarily diamonds, for instance, while Inco is mostly nickel. 
"They also created multiple market sites, so that the whole world isn't serviced in one place. Suppliers tend to be regional. You need to buy lubricant and small parts, but you don't want them always shipped from Australia to Africa."
Also emerging are electronic metals marketplaces where, for example, if your company has a load of bauxite or some finished metals product for sale, you put it on the electronic bulletin board and see what price you can get. Emetra is a new site for nonferrous metals, while Aluminium.com and Metalsite.com provide exchanges for aluminum-bauxite and surplus steel.
"How many of these guys are getting traction? It's too early to tell," said E. Russell Braziel, the chief executive of Netrona, a consulting and software company for the energy and metals exploration industries. "Fortunately for them, the mining business moved a little more slowly. Other places, e-commerce folks assumed they could change an industry too quickly and too radically. To change the behavior of buyers and sellers is not an overnight thing. It's not about throwing a Web site up there and saying how cool it is."
At Rio Tinto, a mining company with diversified interests in diamonds, copper and zinc, and a partner in Quadrem, the head of procurement, John McGagh, keeps his sights low in regard to e-commerce, figuring it is only the next step in communications. 
"Look, in a lot of ways, what we are seeing with e-commerce is just an evolution of doing business," Mr. McGagh said. "It took people dozens of years to get used to using the telephone and maybe even 50 years for radio to reach saturation. We're moving cautiously, we think, and even then, we're talking about everyone having to get used to e-commerce in a couple of years. Why, in the mining business, that is a blink of an eye."
But if some companies take too many blinks, they may be left too far behind.
"As deliberate as the mining business is, it is doing pretty well at catching up in e-commerce," said Charles Gounaris, a consultant for I.B.M.'s global services division. "Especially for companies that have waited this long, they feel there is a lot of hype out there about e-commerce and are hesitant to replace how they have worked in the past. But companies are moving this way, and those that lag too far behind are, at best, going to lose the margins and cost-efficiencies Internet commerce brings."
Mr. Huber of Newmont Mining said that people at his company laugh at how late they were to use e-mail.
"We actually made that decision because we wanted to cut down on fax expenses -- you know, using too much toner and silly things like that," he said. "But the benefits that only a few years ago our company couldn't even conceive of with e-mail are fantastic. We have great engineers, say, in South America who can now comment on jobs in Uzbekistan on an immediate basis. It is the primary mode of communication in a global business such as ours.
"Now we in mining are finally getting around to e-commerce," he continued. "And I have to believe that five years from now, we will see that the real value of it will be something we can't even predict today. You've got to be excited about that."

It's Lights, Camera, Economic Analysis!

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
FROM where Kate Bohner was standing, E*Trade Group did not appear to have reinvented electronic communications.
 Ms. Bohner, a former reporter for the financial cable channel CNBC, was poised on a large black box in front of a television camera in the lobby of E*Trade's branch office in New York, taping a segment about a failed merger, to be shown later that day on financial Web sites. 
 Half an hour before, Ms. Bohner was seated at a cafe table near the coffee bar upstairs, previewing the day's action in the stock market for "E*Trade On Air," an hourlong program that can be heard live weekday mornings on E*Trade's Web site. 
The makeshift setup is the first stage of a "digital financial media strategy" envisioned by Ms. Bohner's boss, Christos M. Cotsakos. Mr. Cotsakos, the chairman and chief executive of E*Trade Group, the online brokerage and banking company, is no conformist.
He insists on calling Ms. Bohner's workplace, a four-level storefront on Madison Avenue at 55th Street in Manhattan, a center rather than a branch. And he says what he plans to create with the cameras and the studio under construction several feet from Ms. Bohner's stand will not be anything as 20th century as television.
"This is not TV for us and we're not a broadcaster," Mr. Cotsakos said. "The audience is changing dramatically in how they view how they get their information."
He is not alone in that idea. Suddenly, the race is on among financial firms, including E*Trade and Fidelity Investments, to enhance their Web sites by adding video clips of interviews with executives, stock analysts and mutual fund managers. They are also transmitting newscasts provided by financial Webcasting companies like WebFN, JAGfn and ON24.
"Look at these things as stages," said Keith Savitz, the founder of a markets-data Web site, B4Utrade.com. "In the current stage, you've got to have streaming, real-time stock quotes; the next stage will be to add streaming video."
These efforts come as the big names in financial media are grappling with tougher times. Advertising revenue on TV business programs is expected to fall at least 10 percent this year as online brokerage firms and other Internet-based companies have cut spending. 
Mr. Savitz was so hungry for financial news last year that he agreed to pay more than $15,000 a month for all available segments of CNBC's daily programming, he said. B4Utrade has been running them in the upper right corner of its site, effectively rebroadcasting CNBC with a delay of about 15 minutes. Still, Mr. Savitz said, he would prefer a live video feed.
E*Trade has already ventured into Webcasting. It hired Ms. Bohner earlier this year and teamed her up with two commentators in Chicago, Jonathan Hoenig and Tom Hudson. E*Trade then hired John Metaxas, formerly a financial reporter for CNN, to be its chief communications and government affairs officer.
So far, visitors to E*Trade's Web site can hear "E*Trade On Air" only from 9 to 10 a.m. That program is produced by WebFN, a Chicago company operated by a former CNBC producer, Bob Reichblum. WebFN produces an advertising-supported financial Webcast 12 hours a day, which can be viewed on the Web sites of E*Trade and Fidelity.
By midsummer, E*Trade hopes to finish building its broadcast studio and to add video, giving visitors to the company's Web site an alternative to watching CNBC on a TV screen. Mr. Cotsakos said the programming would help give E*Trade a voice and allow it to tailor news and information for its audience of individual investors. Though Mr. Cotsakos said he had no intention of trying to compete with CNBC, he has told people that he wants an alternative that is simpler and more relevant to his customers.
Mr. Reichblum hopes to sell WebFN to other brokerage firms. The stock market's slide last year caused financial companies to rethink production of their own video content, while it increased investors' appetite for information on which they could base decisions, he said.
Mr. Cotsakos sees a future in which financial news and information are on the same screen that a customer uses to buy and sell stocks and bonds, pay bills and transfer money from checking to savings accounts.
"Actionable content," as Mr. Cotsakos calls it, could attract more people to E*Trade's site. The longer they stay, the more likely they are to make purchases and the more E*Trade can charge advertisers for space.
E*Trade has already signed up some corporations, including Toyota and I.B.M., as advertisers for "E*Trade On Air," Mr. Cotsakos said. WebFN sells ads in the programming that it produces for E*Trade and Fidelity, Mr. Reichblum said.
But not every financial firm wants some form of newscast flickering away in a corner of its Web site, said Sharat Sharan, the chief executive of ON24, a company in San Francisco that provides streaming video and video clips to financial sites.
"Our sense is if you wanted to see a broadcast, then CNBC is very good for that," Mr. Sharan said. "We have no intention to compete with that. They have very deep pockets."
That view, widely shared, begs the question: Why not just rebroadcast CNBC instead of trying to recreate it?
Because it is not available. Mr. Reichblum said that CNBC's cable contracts precluded the network from selling the same programming, in full, for Web sites. 
So financial Web sites are searching for the next best thing. Bloomberg, the financial news service, has a broadcast on its cable channel and Web site but has refused to sell it for use on other sites, Mr. Savitz said. Reuters is contemplating its own Webcast, he added. 
Jaime Punishill, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the spread of video on brokerage firms' Web sites was a prime example of the "collision of content and commerce" that he had been expecting. "People want their content and commerce right next to each other," he said.

No Shortage of Places to Find Talking Financial Faces

E*TRADE GROUP'S plan to add streaming newscasts and information about stocks, bonds and markets is not the first attempt to combine Webcasting with financial services. Several other Web sites and Webcasters have tried, with varying degrees of success.

YAHOO FINANCEVISION: In the financial section of its portal, Yahoo transmits its own newscast called FinanceVision. Anchored by young, casually dressed reporters, it includes interviews with analysts and corporate executives interspersed with regular updates on stock indexes. Advertisers include Cadillac, The Economist magazine and CellularOne.

ON24: Not a believer in the usefulness of streaming newscasts on financial Web sites, ON24 produces interviews with corporate executives, stock analysts and professional investors that are available, on demand, to customers of firms that provide financial services and information. ON24's clients include Merrill Lynch, Fidelity and Morningstar.

WEBFN: A venture of Weigel Broadcasting, a Chicago-based owner of television stations, and the Bridge financial news service, WebFN produces custom newscasts that are transmitted to the Web sites of clients like Fidelity, E*Trade and B4Utrade.com.

JAGFN: Devised by the creators of JagNotes.com, a Web site that traffics in rumors about stocks and is aimed at active traders, JAGfn produces an advertiser-supported financial newscast for Web sites. Under new ownership and managed by Jack Reilly, who once ran CNBC, JAGfn is available on the Lycos portal. PATRICK McGEEHAN

If You Hate Web Ads, You Can 'Just Say No'

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
HATE Internet ads? Are those pushy pop-ups increasing your annoyance level? There is a way to fight back.
 Software that stops advertisements from appearing on screens is free to any home user who chooses to download it. And as ad styles change from the placid banners to the intrusive pop-ups and interstitials, the software providers are pushing their way into the marketplace as never before, contending that their time has at last arrived. 
 The ad-blocking programs have names like Junkbusters, AdSubtract, WebWasher and Guidescope. Most work as proxy browsers; that is, they examine a Web page before it is sent to a user's browser and remove the ads before sending it, leaving blank spaces on the page where the ads once appeared. 
According to Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters, the programs recognize the ads because they are matched to a list of known ads, because they come from a specific source like DoubleClick or because they conform technically to certain patterns within the ads.
Mr. Catlett is something of an evangelist when it comes to ad-blocking, consulting worldwide on privacy issues, including, as he put it, "junk mail, junk e-mail and junk phone calls." But while Junkbusters has been around since 1996, its success and that of the other programs has been fairly limited, at least until now.
After all, consumers are used to ads, said Jim Nail, an online marketing and advertising analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. In addition, he said, computer users are often afraid to download software even if it is free. Until last year, he said, he probably would have laughed if anyone had suggested that ad-blocking software might present a threat to online advertising.
And today?
Times change. During the last year or so, advertisers have been questioning the effectiveness of their Internet advertising, especially banner ads. Many are paying less for banners or discontinuing their use. 
As a result, Internet ad revenue plummeted. Ad-supported Web sites closed. Internet ad agencies laid off employees or shut down. And, in the general panic, those who place ads and those who depend upon them for revenue began looking for salvation in ever bigger and ever more intrusive Internet ads: the so-called pop-ups and interstitials, for example, which are ads that appear between pages during the course of an Internet session.
That has changed the calculus, according to Mr. Nail. "Ads are becoming these really annoying, in-your-face things," he said, unlike banners, which are easier to ignore. And though, in his "heart of hearts," he still think ad-blocking software probably will not matter, he is not completely sure. "Now that the annoyance factor is increasing," he said, "so is the incentive of consumers" to use it. 
That is what the program makers think, too. Ed English, the chief executive of interMute Inc., based in Braintree, Mass., which markets AdSubtract, said that downloads of his company's product had been "ramping up" over the last several months because of increasingly intrusive Internet advertising.
WebWasher's chief executive, Horst Joepen, agrees; his company's software "meets a very basic user need," he said, by "correcting" the ability of content providers to "push whatever they want at people."
WebWasher, founded in Germany in 1999 as part of the electronic giant Siemens and then spun off, says it has four million users worldwide. Mr. English said that half a million people have downloaded and used AdSubtract's free software since it first became available a year ago February.
Both companies expect to grow even more. AdSubtract has entered into a number of deals with modem manufacturers like Zoom, which will be giving the software to their modem customers. And WebWasher, which seeks paying corporate customers, has just signed HypoVereinsbank of Germany in a 46,000-user deal, Mr. Joepen said. Other corporations are likely clients, he said, because they want to free up the bandwidth now wasted by unsolicited ads and to better control what employees see and do on their computers.
That alone should be enough to strike fear into the hearts of those in the Internet advertising industry, because many of the "impressions" made by ads are by Web surfers who view them while at work. Still, Internet ad professionals say they are not worried.
They doubt that most people want ads removed, however intrusive they may be, and compare ad-blocking software to the recently introduced computerized television recorders like TiVo, which were supposed to -- but thus far have not -- result in large-scale ad-zapping by television viewers.
"People like ads," said Allie Shaw, the vice president of worldwide marketing for Unicast, based in New York, which creates large superstitial ads that are "intentionally intrusive," appearing when a user's browser is otherwise idle.
Those in the Internet ad industry also think that, if necessary, ad companies can develop the technology to "find a way around" programs that detect ads, as John Bohan, the president of L90, an ad sales and ad network based in Los Angeles, put it. And they question whether ad-blocking software is really quite as popular as its advocates say it is. 
At companies like DoubleClick, generally regarded to be the nation's premier Internet ad network, almost all of the ads do get served, according to a spokeswoman, Jennifer Blum.
So will ad-blocking software have no effect at all?
Mr. Bohan, whose company's clients include the PBS and Esquire magazine Web sites, concedes that ad-blocking programs may "make advertisers run more effective advertisements," or explore new avenues for promotion, like product placement. But he said that these trends were well under way anyway, a result of market forces and the evolution of the online ad industry.
In the future "ads will have to be highly targeted," he said. 
Which is precisely what Thomas Matheson thinks will happen. He is the president of Guidescope, an ad-blocking company. About 100,000 people have downloaded Guidescope since it was first offered last year, he said, and 25 percent to 50 percent of them have chosen to receive some promotional ad offers.
"We think this is the right model," he said, dismissing the notion that ad-blocking software might "take over the whole Internet" and eliminate ads completely.
"This way people choose the things" to which they want to pay attention, he said. "And that makes the Internet a lot more like real life."

How Big Is Our Endowment? Ask Me at the End of the Month

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
AS the director of trusts and investments administrator of Berea College in Kentucky, Barry D. Poynter has a lot of money to invest, almost $800 million. But do not ask him exactly how much his portfolio is worth. He finds that out once a month through the mail.
 Mr. Poynter and his peers -- investment directors of what are considered midsize institutions, like hospital foundations, smaller university endowments and private pension funds, are by and large a buy-and-hold lot, wedded to tradition. Even so, their patience is wearing thin. 
 After all, far smaller investors, and bigger institutions, have such information at their fingertips through the Internet. For individual investors, a raft of sites put trades and data at their beck and call. Institutional investors holding a billion dollars or more plus public and private retirement funds, which often manage their own portfolios, have for years tapped the Internet to make trades and check values without waiting for a monthly statement. 
The luxury of real-time information is only reaching many medium-size institutional investors, those with less than $1 billion in assets. A small foundation's trading orders are still generally executed in a blizzard of faxes and phone calls to money managers. One index fund manager alone can receive 200,000 orders a year, most involving a score or more of transactions.
In the next three years, analysts expect a change to occur as more investment managers offer clients the conveniences that individual investors now expect. 
Just as brokers like Charles Schwab and E*Trade stepped up to help individual investors trade online, new Internet competitors are emerging to serve institutional investors. These competitors are taking on old-line consultants that advise institutions on how to invest and with whom. 
The stakes are high. The top 20 consultants represent institutions with assets of $6.2 trillion, according to a pension consultant survey by Nelson Information, which tracks investment management firms.
The biggest repercussion may be cultural: better informed pension and foundation investment officers may demand more of consultants and money managers.
It is easy to see why institutional investors want to jump online. 
Mr. Poynter's portfolio -- the college's $791 million endowment, which provides 75 percent of the institution's budget -- is divided among several investment managers, as are the holdings of most midsize institutions. Four times a year, Mr. Poynter receives a complete picture showing how markets are affecting holdings. Then, he receives a quarterly report from Berea's pension consultant, who consolidates results from the various investment managers and provides comparative results. The rest of the year, monthly updates on each manager's results must suffice.
The exception is Barclays Global Investors, which introduced Web-based accounting last fall and limited online trading in January. 
"I can't get intermonth totals from any other managers," Mr. Poynter said. "It would be useful to have. I feel more comfortable being in control, rather than waiting until I get a paper statement. I would suggest other money managers might move in that direction, but we're not too pushy."
More pressure is coming from Washington. By 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission is pressing the industry to settle transactions within 24 hours instead of the three days now allowed.
Online accounting is a step toward that goal, but progress is piecemeal. 
Douglas J. Gorence, the chief investment officer for the University of Minnesota Foundation, would welcome more online tools to avoid clerical errors that can be introduced when rebalancing the foundation's $750 million portfolio. 
Just one of the foundation's 12 money managers provides online account access and trading. "We know more about what we own and don't have to wait for Fedex," Mr. Gorence said, of the $50 million in index funds that can be reviewed online.
So far, the foundation has not traded online, which reflects the divergent investing styles of an institution with fiduciary responsibility, in contrast with the more trigger-ready individual investor. It also suggests that online access by institutions is not likely to result in a raft of day-trading by pension fund managers.
For many funds, the crucial decision is not what stock or bond to buy, but which investment managers to divide its holdings among. 
Typically, a pension fund or foundation hires a consultant to suggest a portfolio strategy and select a team of money managers to carry out different investing assignments, like hedge funds or real estate. Annual mean consulting fees for medium-size institutions are about $100,000, according to William Slocum, a spokesman at Greenwich Associates, a financial research consultant in Greenwich, Conn. Money managers earn fees based on a client's assets and can range from 0.09 percent for passive funds to 0.88 percent in emerging markets.
Most institutions trade quarterly to rebalance holdings. "We set our allocation and stick with it," Mr. Gorence said.
Only the small and midsize institutional investors of less than $1 billion are still consigned to the old economy partly for cultural reasons, said Robert M. Hegarty, the research director of TowerGroup, a financial services consultant, in Needham, Mass. "They hire investment managers to do everything for them." 
Yet, those traditionally passive managers see the Internet putting tools within reach and undercutting the expertise of their consultants. "The old line that wants direct access is a very big shift," Mr. Hegarty said, referring to pension managers who once let consultants handle the administration of investment portfolios. 
For asset managers like Barclays, the transition to online trading and reporting should result in savings and the ability to serve smaller clients.
Late last year, institutional clients of a Mellon Financial Corporation unit were able to receive a real-time look at their bond holdings. Now, about half of Mellon's equity funds are online and the rest will soon be, said Ronald P. O'Hanley, the president of Mellon Institutional Asset Management. 
Clients of the Northern Trust Corporation want the same, said Arch King, a senior vice president and director of the company's e-commerce investment management. To accommodate them, Northern, which is based in Chicago, recently started subscribing to a multimedia site that permits investment managers to provide real-time performance updates. 
But Mr. King said that in his opinion, "it's not that burdensome to work with them with old economy solutions of fax and letter."
That view is apparently widespread. Only half of the nation's institutional investors subscribe to online analytic services, a tool for adjusting portfolios, said William C. Pryor, the chief executive of Russell/Mellon Analytical Services in Tacoma, Wash.
A different strategy for the more hands-on institutional investor was introduced in November by Investorforce.com in Wayne, Pa., whose financial backers include Mellon and the California Public Employee Retirement System, known as Calpers. 
Its plan is giving institutional investors a way to track financial results online by integrating data from different investment managers. Managers, particularly smaller time-pressed shops, seem willing to provide their data and even pay a fee to be included in Investorforce's online database of money managers. (This is used by institutional investors to compare managers' performance.) 
"Money managers reach large plans, like Calpers and G.M., easily," said Jim Morrissey, the president and chief executive of Investorforce.com. "It's easier to focus on the elephants. But it's very expensive to reach smaller ones." 
Still, performance charts are no substitute for body language and eye contact, said James Normandin, the vice president of the Memorial Medical Center Foundation in Long Beach, Calif. 
"My investment committee likes it when the investment manager defends what they buy and sell," Mr. Normandin said. In his view, the Internet is a second-rate substitute for a consultant's ability to select compatible managers.

New Tools Are Born To Orbit Around EBay

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN MIHM 

 BODY:
THE exponential growth of the auction company eBay remains, even in the wake of the Nasdaq crash, one of the more notable success stories of the new economy. Less well known, however, are the many companies that have profited by supplying eBay's customers with everything from imaging services to insurance to appraisals.
 In some cases, these companies, having been bought or acquired by eBay, serve the auction house's clientele exclusively. Others, like SquareTrade, an online dispute resolution service based in San Francisco, serve multiple partners. Still, as Steve Abernethy, the president and chief executive of SquareTrade, said, "EBay was our first and only customer when we launched." 
 Thanks to that affiliation, he said, particularly eBay's decision to make SquareTrade its exclusive dispute resolution service, "we've expanded to a much broader base of partners." As he explained, "Other markets emulate eBay, they look to them as the biggest marketplace. So if eBay adopts something, other markets and businesses will adopt those practices and tools as well."
Munjal Shah, the president and chief executive of Andale, an auction-services company in Mountain View, Calif., agreed. "Our original beachhead was auctions on eBay," he said. But he hopes the company can expand to other markets.
Here's a sampling of the different types of companies that have emerged to service the buyers and sellers on eBay -- and beyond:

PICTURE SERVICES: No one wants to bid on something sight unseen, but posting pictures can be cumbersome. That is why several companies have sprung up to offer what is called dynamic imaging. The oldest company is Pongo, which has been marketing image hosting to eBay users since 1996 for 50 cents a picture. More recently, Ipix has entered a strategic alliance with eBay, offering sellers the option to "drag and drop" images from their desktop to their listing for a small fee.

COUNTERS: Other companies offer eBay merchants additional tools like counters, which keep sellers apprised of how many bidders have viewed their items. The most ubiquitous is an "honesty" counter distributed by Andale. "We offer the counter for free to get people to try our other services," said Mr. Shah of Andale. Another popular counter is sold by Andale's competitor, AuctionWatch.

APPRAISALS: A number of appraisal companies market their services to buyers on eBay, many of whom are not certain how much they should bid for, say, an antique ottoman. Eppraisals.com has emerged as the premier provider, thanks to its status as eBay's principal online appraisal service. The company, which taps more than 1,000 experts in antiques, fine arts, coins, stamps and other collectibles, gives online estimates of items up for auction for $20 each.

SNIPING: Not all the companies that feed off eBay's transactions have formal partnerships with the company. So-called "sniping software," available from WinningBid Pro! (www.umklaydet.com) and iSnipeit.com and others, helps buyers by automatically submitting the winning bid within seconds of the auction's completion. ISnipeit says that its software "allows you to rest easy knowing that your competitors will have literally no time to react to your bid." While eBay is neutral on the subject of sniping, its use by auction sophisticates has stirred debate in eBay chat rooms.

ELECTRONIC CHECKING: Since eBay's inception, several companies have marketed a variety of electronic payment services. For several years, PayPal has been the most popular service, charging a small fee to sellers in exchange for vetting and processing the buyer's payment by credit card or by check. More recently, eBay has instituted its own electronic-payment service by acquiring Billpoint, thus joining forces with Wells Fargo, which also bought a stake in Billpoint. The new service, prominently featured throughout the eBay site, offers many of the same services as PayPal, but with the eBay imprimatur.

ESCROW: Other companies market escrow services, promising to keep buyers and sellers honest. Ebay's preferred provider is Tradenable, which for a small fee holds the buyer's payment until the seller meets certain conditions, like shipping the item in one piece. If you are shipping something big -- a car, for example -- Escrow.com markets itself on the home page of eBay Motors.

SHIPPING: Assuming that everything works out and the check clears, the seller inevitably looks for an appropriate shipper. Several companies meet that need. The most prominent is United Parcel Service, which eBay has integrated into its site, enabling buyers and sellers to calculate rates in advance. Other shippers include Simply Postage, which enables users to print their own postage; IShip, which provides shipping estimates; Mailboxes Etc.(www.mbe .com); and E-Stamp.com.

MEDIATION: A final subindustry has marketed itself to eBay users who find themselves enraged when, say, the dish they ordered arrives with a crack down the middle and the seller refuses to refund the money. SquareTrade, an online dispute resolution service, has emerged as eBay's primary provider of such services. Customers can use an automated service that allows each party to establish how far it is willing to go to settle the problem. If that does not work, the disgruntled party can request a professional mediator for $15, drawing on the company's network of 250 professional mediators worldwide.

HEADLINE: ON A SHOESTRING; 
Skip the Climbing Wall: This Start-Up Just Wants to Hang On

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, Michael Hejtmanek sat in the tiny conference room of his fledgling company -- the same room he shares with two other companies -- and talked about timing. He shies away from calling his lousy.
 "There's no more funding for two guys and a business plan," he said quietly. "It's just not there, so starting when I did was rocky. It was definitely tough." 
 What Mr. Hejtmanek did was quit a high-paying job at BackWeb Technologies to create a wireless software company called Enterprise Air. This was in November, several months after the stock market began suffering 100-point drops and a full two years after many of his entrepreneur friends captured and then lost their digital gold mines. In November, he knew that potential investors and employees would be skittish. He also knew that office space -- even without Foosball and climbing walls -- would be expensive. 
Still, Mr. Hejtmanek, 32, blue-eyed and well-spoken, decided it was time to tackle the technology industry. Since then, his efforts typify the new-style start-up. He maintains a shoestring budget. He rents two workstations in a sunny office on West 27th Street in Manhattan, though he often works in his Upper West Side apartment. He spends hours talking on the phone with advisers and he searches everywhere for financing, venture capital or otherwise. He compensates his six full-time staff members with small salaries and big pep talks. He prints his business cards at home.
"We would be happy if it were two years ago and people were throwing money at us, but maybe this will be better," he said. "Now, we're only dealing with serious people, the ones who really have the wisdom and the chutzpah to make it happen."
Gone are the days when investors thought the Internet was touched by Midas and amateurs could start wireless companies, said Christopher Mutkoski, the founder of Angel Alliance, a New York-based consortium that invests in early-stage companies. Today, a start-up must be operated by an experienced technologist, he said.
Mr. Mutkoski said that $5 million was now a common first-round investment. "We used to invest in the $40 million range -- it was amazing," he said. "Companies were getting cranked out and we were getting locked out of deals. Now, the climate is negative, but good people with good ideas can find money. I'm still optimistic."
So is Mr. Hejtmanek. His idea is to make business applications for wireless devices, like Palm organizers, that do not have to connect to the Internet. That way, people working outside the office, for example, will not have to endure time-consuming downloads to send orders or messages to company headquarters. (CodeWarrior by Metrowerks and ScoutBuilder by Aether Systems use similar technology.)
Mr. Hejtmanek came up with the idea for Enterprise Air in September, having spent several years developing and managing software in Switzerland for the Bossard Group, a tool manufacturer, and Oracle, the software company. He moved to New York in 1997 to attend Columbia University School of Business. He joined BackWeb Technologies after graduation in 1999.
"Those were the industry's golden days," Mr. Hejtmanek said, recalling how BackWeb's sales jumped to $40 million from $8 million almost overnight. He traveled constantly and kept apartments in New York, Toronto and San Jose, Calif. "It was exciting," he said, "to get a product together, release it and -- boom! -- watch the dollars roll in."
Today he is a salesman, fighting for every cent. He left BackWeb in September 2000 with $100,000 in his savings account. Since then, he has been spending about $20,000 a month of his own money building Enterprise Air. Much of it pays the four software engineers, including his chief technology officer, Michael Uffer, who was formerly the director of technology at Rare Medium.
Mr. Uffer is 49 and has spent nearly 20 years in the software business. He lost his job at Rare Medium in October and then joined Enterprise Air. He agreed to a 40 percent pay cut, he said, because he needed the work and he believed in Mr. Hejtmanek's dream. "It's a sacrifice," Mr. Uffer said. "But it's also exciting to be here early on, to feel an ownership."
Mr. Uffer and the rest of the staff work mostly from home and could command salaries above $200,000. Instead, most work for $40,000, with equity and options. They all agreed to the salary because they have bought the dream, he said. (There are also some unpaid interns.) Twice a week, they gather in the conference room on West 27th Street to talk and plan.
They leave the financing to Mr. Hejtmanek, though, and this search fills his days and nights until 2 a.m. He needs $600,000 in seed money to keep the company running through August, and for this he looks to business competitions, angel and student investment groups, and, soon, venture capitalists. He has called on Columbia alumni and peddled his plan in five business competitions, once traveling to Amsterdam, where his presentation won second place. More recently, he won $16,000 from the Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs and was given $50,000 by the Eugene M. Lang Center for Entrepreneurship at Columbia.
The windfalls will grant Mr. Hejtmanek entry to what he calls the "tweed coats," the angel investors who give money to new companies. But Elaine Gilde, a member of the New York New Media Association's angel group and president of Grove Street Capital, said such access no longer guaranteed millions anymore.
"Right now, a lot of people are pretending they are investing but aren't really putting out a lot of money," Ms. Gilde said. "They're just a little gun-shy. But if you can find a business application that cuts cost and saves time, it should be a good investment."
Streamlining the inefficiencies of the digital world -- this is what most new-style start-ups are trying to do, including Enterprise Air. The profile is lower, and the need for high-dollar advertising almost nonexistent. But if such a company can help much larger companies make sense of all the new technology, investors say both are more likely to survive the economic tremors.
For Mr. Hejtmanek, this also means wooing customers. He made a list of 300 potential partners in April, winnowed them to 10 -- he wanted small companies based in New York -- and began meeting with several of them regularly, starting in May. All he needs is one or two to commit, he said, and his company's footing will feel more assured. Until then, he keeps at it. He recently scheduled a presentation for the day before his wedding, planned for June 30. He has yet to tell his fiancee. He hopes she will understand.
Michael Meyer, one of Mr. Hejtmanek's advisers and a creator of a defunct e-business called Snickelways, said this determination was necessary at all new start-ups. "You can never foresee the future," Mr. Meyer said. "That's what makes an entrepreneur: he has a vision and he fights for it against all odds."
Mr. Hejtmanek said he called Mr. Meyer nearly every day, seeking counsel. They talk about the possibility of renting a bigger office. They also talk about the software prototype, and about not making mistakes. The conversation always ends the same way. 
"So are you still having fun?" Mr. Meyer will ask.
"I'm really tired," Mr. Hejtmanek will reply, "but, yeah, I'm having fun."

Direct to You From Rajasthan

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
LOVE the sound of Panamanian molas, those colorful fabric panels with their handstitched charms? Like the idea of Haitian tin sculptures? African carved soapstone dishes? Indian beaded necklaces?
 International crafts, with their one-of-a-kind aura, have joined the Internet marketplace. But like swiftly shifting sands, the final shape of these sites is still not clear: while a handful of sites, like Novica.com and eZiba.com, are still open to consumers, others have become wholesalers, and at least one has gone out of business. 
 The idea behind the sites is appealing: a chance to buy crafts directly from artisans around the world, bypassing the limited selection (and markup) of importers. 
Then there are the pledges from the sites to not just make money but to do good: they say they are helping to keep the artisans out of factories and sweatshops -- and endangered habitats. For instance, a small site that sells woolen hats and gloves, Irbis Enterprises (www.irbis-enterprises.com), has made a deal with the Mongolian villagers who make them that their wares will be sold internationally and, in return, the villagers will not kill the snow leopards that eat their sheep.
Despite the idealistic intentions of many of the people involved, questions remain about the amount of money the artisans are paid. These sites also face a problem that has been bedeviling other e-tailers: selling handmade products when there is no way to touch the goods.
Evie Black Dykema, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said there was "obviously a significant demand for crafts that is not being met." And whether it is necklaces from Indonesia or plastic scrimshaw from Spain, a craftsman has the potential to earn "70 times what he could make working in a local factory," Ms. Dykema said. But for now, the international crafts scene on the Web is so small, "it's under the radar screen," she said.
Ms. Dykema and others in the crafts market point to several issues, including the margins between an object's selling price and the amount paid to the craftsman: is he getting a fair price? For the consumer, there are questions of quality, especially with handmade objects, which do not always match their pictures, as well as concerns about international credit-card security.
Most of the sites push their mission to "empower" the world's poor artisan, but it is hard to judge who is really doing good.
"Yes, the perception is that there's a lot of stuff out there and you don't know what's behind it," said Amber Chand, a co-founder and "vice president of vision" at eZiba, a major site for crafts. "But eZiba is committed to fair practices and exemplary trading; we build alliances with respect."
Ms. Chand, an anthropologist, concedes that things are not cheap on eZiba. "Why should we be cheap?" she said. "It takes months and months to make a good basket."
Novica.com, another well-known crafts site, had been struggling but received an infusion of support in December, when the National Geographic Society bought a 19 percent stake in the company. At Novica, Rob Milk, a founder, asserted that his site's prices were lower than those of other sites: the company's dozen regional offices, he said, make it easier for artisans to mail and store their objects.
Other sites are finding their way, said Rochelle Beck, the director of the Artisan Enterprise Network, which a year ago was awarded a grant by the World Bank to combat poverty through marketing indigenous crafts. The network uses the Internet to educate artisans. 
The task is huge. "We're teaching them about trade shows, retail outlets, the laws that affect international property rights -- after all, they're exporting goods overseas," Ms. Beck said. "If we're nervous about sending our credit-card number to a site in the United States, imagine people worrying about sending their credit-card number overseas."
Ms. Beck's group is developing an entrepreneurial curriculum for the workers. "How to run their business better," she said. Recently, the Artisan Enterprise Network set up a craft fair in La Paz, Bolivia -- the city's first, Ms. Beck said.
The Enterprise network and other, more profit-oriented middlemen -- eZiba and Novica, among them -- are also coaching artisans on what sells in the United States. "You and I might like some of the crafts the way they are produced, but many others have different taste," Ms. Beck said. Some Americans and Europeans might like brighter colors -- or conversely, less bright colors, depending on the country.
"It's a very sensitive issue that must be considered case by case," she added. "When we're dealing with old cultures -- to ask for blue instead of beige would be a travesty."
But some crafts workers in certain cultures do not have the same creative flair as others do, Ms. Beck said. Their items might not sell at all in America. 
"Do they stop making crafts and go to work in a factory?" she asked. "Or do they use their skills to make something more salable? You don't choose for them."
That approach has its drawbacks. "It's an age-old problem," said Caroline Ramsay, the president of the Crafts Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse for technical assistance and information. "You want them to continue their work without compromise, but that must be weighed against the realities of the marketplace."
THEN there is the question of labor standards. For instance, do the artisans use children to help, Ms. Ramsay asked, "or are they using sewing machines?" (Consumers generally prefer hand-sewn items.) EZiba, Ms. Chand said, checks every supplier and has a strong policy against child labor. But not all sites may be as cautious, Ms. Ramsay said.
The money is tempting to villagers. Although they receive a fraction of what the items sell for, it might be as much as they could make in a month, or even a year, selling locally.
With an item selling for $200, the artisan -- the worker sitting on the ground making a terra-cotta pot, say -- gets an average of $25, Ms. Beck said.
"Let's say it is a big ceramic, fragile pot," she said. "It will cost another $25 to pack and ship it. The wholesaler wants to double his money so he'll charge $100. The retailer will tack on another $100, so that's $200. That's standard in the field. A lot of people don't understand that. They think if they could only get rid of the middleman, they could get it for $100."
But the middleman may find financing for the craftsman and obtain a credit line so he can buy supplies, she said. The middleman also handles bookkeeping chores -- paying the exporting duties, taxes and advertising, fielding complaints.
Those numbers help explain the recent shakeout, and why several of the larger sites have gone from selling retail to wholesale: if you don't own a business (like a shop or museum gallery) don't bother signing in. Viatru.com, one of the best-known crafts sites, began in retail, switched to wholesale and is now out of business, though it hopes to return as a nonprofit entity, said Michelle Long, one of the site's founders.
As Ms. Beck said: "There are advantages and there are risks to selling handmade articles. A lot of companies feel more comfortable just dealing wholesale."
In a quest to discover the vagaries of shopping for handmade crafts on the Internet, this reporter ordered items to judge delivery times, service and quality of the merchandise. Orders were placed with Novica, Global Crafts (www.net-kenya.com /globalcrafts/) and Peoplink (www. peoplink.org). I ordered a pair of handblown Mexican vases from Novica, jewelry from Peoplink and two soapstone covered dishes with carvings from Kenya from Global Crafts.
They all arrived quickly. The vases were said to have up to three-weeks' delivery time, but they came in three days. The other items came almost as promptly. All were in great shape.
It was hard to judge the quality, however. The vases, unfortunately, were not the greenish-yellow in the picture but brownish-yellow. Asked about the problem, representatives of the sites blamed the computer screen or the transmission. The jewelry looked a little cheaper, less well made than the pieces in the photographs, but there was not enough difference to complain about. The soapstone dishes turned out to be my favorites: the carved images on the lids are primitive and unusual, different from anything I have ever seen. 
Even though I was ordering these items for a newspaper article, I chose crafts that I might order for myself. I also noticed during my shopping that there were a lot of overpriced wall hangings and other useless objects for sale.
But those just may be the items designed with Americans in mind.

BYLINE:  By ANDY WANG 

 BODY:
THE financing dried up, Web advertising was not generating enough money, and there were no potential investors in sight. So I did what all good Americans should do in time of need: I begged. Almost anybody with a Web site can do the same.
 Just go to Amazon.com and sign up for its Honor System, which allows visitors to donate money to participating Web sites with their credit cards. Since the service started in February, several thousand sites have signed up to receive money, according to Jonathan Leblang, the director of the Honor System at Amazon. 
 Being on the receiving end of this service is a bit like being a panhandler with a high-priced agent, because Amazon gets more than 15 percent of each transaction. Still, it is found money. And the donations have definitely been put to good use. 
Starting a daily, advertising-supported online magazine seemed like a smart idea when I founded Ironminds.com in August 1999. At the very least, I thought, it would be a way to make a living while publishing what I wanted.
Ironminds still seemed like a great idea in March 2000, when the site was acquired by an Internet media company. After the acquisition, I stayed on as editor in chief. In April of that year, the Nasdaq imploded, and much of the Internet industry, including the new parent company, followed suit. I bought Ironminds back last August, five months after it was acquired and two months before the parent company went out of business.
Ironminds continues to publish, thanks to the kindness of the magazine's contributors, who are now working without being paid. Web hosting and other costs are paid by me, which is where the Honor System has come in handy.
Within two days of signing up for the system and publishing an editor's note asking readers for money, I got $400 in donations. For a moment, I (almost) forgot all the long hours and money I had poured into the site. While the money I was making through the Honor System was nowhere near the amount I have put into the site, I was elated.
Matt Haughey was similarly pleased when he used the Honor System. The owner of Metafilter.com, a collaborative Web log in which members post interesting links they have found, Mr. Haughey was used to spending a couple of hours each day working on the site for little more than the gratitude of visitors. He signed up for the Honor System and raised $700 the first day. His reaction was "total surprise," he said. "It was just so much so quickly for something I've always done for free."
The Honor System, however, is not really a viable way to finance a business. It is primarily useful for a one-time cash infusion, according to Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "It's better than nothing, I suppose," Mr. O'Brien said. "But it's not really contributing to a sustaining flow of revenue."
Still, Mr. Haughey, who has also used the Honor System to create a college scholarship fund, is not complaining. His site, like many that use the Honor System, is a labor of love and not an actual business. Mr. Haughey, a programmer in Silicon Valley who worked on Blogger, the Web-log publishing service, said he started Metafilter.com to learn a new programming language and did not consider the notion of making money from the site until it started consuming his life.
Some sites are more ambitious, with results that are still uncertain. Perhaps the best-known Honor System participant is Andrewsullivan.com, the commentary site-Web log of the writer Andrew Sullivan. Visitors have the option of contributing through the Honor System or through the mail. Since it signed up with Amazon in March, the site has raised more than $7,000 through the Honor System and several thousand dollars through the mail, Mr. Sullivan said. (Mr. Sullivan is also a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.) 
"I really didn't know what to expect, but the enthusiasm from my reader e-mails suggested we'd do well," Mr. Sullivan said. "The sums we raised gave us leverage to redesign the site and upgrade it -- so that we can now go to advertisers. I'm determined not to lose money on this thing."
Breaking even sounds good to Al Sacui, a Philadelphia artist who fell victim to his site's popularity. Mr. Sacui created a cat animation and put it on his site, Nosepilot.com (visitors are now redirected to Gisol.org). Many people shared his feline fixation, and he soon found himself with a Web hosting bill of more than $16,000. That bill is in dispute, but to help pay for future Web hosting and animation costs, Mr. Sacui is asking visitors to the Gisol.org site to make donations through the Internet payment service PayPal or the mail. So far, he has raised more than $3,000.
Mr. Sacui's predicament, unheard of during the dot-com boom, is now increasingly common. Not long ago, huge traffic numbers were considered a road to financial success. Now, they can lead to an unmanageable bill for a project like Mr. Sacui's, which generates little or no revenue. In such cases, asking for donations seems suitable, especially when the goal is to remain noncommercial.
"There should be a safe haven from advertising," Mr. Sacui said. "If art can't be there without advertising, then there really isn't anything out there."
Which is not to say that Mr. Sacui is oblivious to financial concerns. For his next major piece of online artwork, he plans to ask viewers for a $1 donation. 
Mr. Sacui said he had considered using the Honor System but that he "sort of has a problem with the fees." Amazon charges 15 percent of each donation plus 15 cents. PayPal charges 30 cents for donations under $15; for larger sums, it charges 2.2 percent of the transaction plus 30 cents. Of course, there is a much larger base of potential online philanthropists at Amazon, which has about 32 million registered users, compared with about seven million at PayPal.
In defense of Amazon's fee structure, Mr. Leblang said: "The money that people are receiving to support their Web site is, in my opinion, incremental money. It's the money they wouldn't have had before. We think we're offering a valuable service for the additional few percent we're charging." Mr. Leblang added that the service could handle small transactions.
For now, Mr. O'Brien of Forrester Research does not envision the Honor System transaction fees generating major revenue for Amazon. "They'll start to make significant money if people pay every month," he said. "And I don't see that built into the system."
While generating revenue through donations has limitations, for some sites (mine included), it has meant an injection of much-needed capital at a crucial time. Sean Forman, a math teacher at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, who runs Baseball-reference.com, an online baseball encyclopedia, found himself in a crunch in April. His site was taken down by its Web hosting service after traffic spiked at the start of the baseball season and after the site was mentioned in Sports Illustrated.
Mr. Forman explained his financial situation to his readers, who donated about $1,500 through the Honor System and PayPal. Baseball-reference.com is back on the Web, with an upgraded hosting service. 
"I've been pleasantly surprised," Mr. Forman said. "I knew I had a site that people enjoyed using. I just wasn't sure people were willing to pay."

HEADLINE: No Hype: Four Web Tools That Work and Save Money; 
Flying Higher In Cheap Seats

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IN the three years since SouthTrust Bank's most frequent travelers began booking their corporate travel online, the company has enjoyed what it described as "significant savings." And three months ago, after allowing -- encouraging, actually -- those employees who travel on business to book online, the bank, based in Birmingham, Ala., found that the percentage of those who used the service soared to about 40 percent from about 1 percent. 
 More to the point, at a time when corporate America is scrambling to rein in expenses by cutting back on all but essential travel, SouthTrust, with 14,000 employees in nine states, has been able to cut as much as 30 percent from its multimillion-dollar travel budget, said Katie Bearden, the bank's corporate travel manager. 
 The Xerox Corporation, with 90,000 employees worldwide, is also using the Internet to cut costs. In addition to reducing the number of employee trips, the company has required since last fall that domestic travel be booked through Xerox Travel On-Line, its proprietary Web-based system that allows employees to check, schedule and book flights electronically. And by using the Internet and telephone conferencing, it has pared by 25 percent the number of sales and training meetings for employees. 
In the process, said Bill McKee, a company spokesman, Xerox reduced travel spending 26 percent in the first quarter over the same period last year, thereby contributing handsomely to the $22 million that the company plans to save in its travel budget this year. 
Like a growing number of corporations, Xerox is economizing in other areas as well, including requiring employees to buy airline tickets 21 days in advance when possible, to obtain the lowest fares. Some corporations no longer allow employees to fly business class on flights less than nine hours, while others decree that employees take connecting flights instead of nonstops, which are usually more expensive. And many companies insist that employees fly low-fare airlines like Southwest and Frontier.
Corporate travel departments are doing what Xerox, South Trust and others are doing -- turning more to Web-based programs, where they can negotiate discounts with airlines, hotels and rental car companies in return for guaranteeing a certain number of bookings over a specified period. 
Some Web-based programs alert corporate travel managers by e-mail if employees insist on booking other airlines, staying at other hotels or renting from other rental car companies. But most companies monitor noncompliance by examining the monthly reports generated by the programs.
Corporate travel is an especially inviting target for the budgetary knives, because it is widely said to be a corporation's second-largest controllable expense, after salaries. Last year, for example, businesses spent $185 billion on travel and entertainment, including a relatively piddling $4 billion booked on the Internet.
But Internet bookings are almost sure to increase. According to a forecast in April by Jupiter Media Metrix, which measures online audience data, Web-managed business-travel bookings will soar to $32 billion in 2006.
Much of that growth will come from small businesses, like C/A Communications, a 31-year-old Dallas company that integrates data communication equipment. With about 8 of its 19 employees traveling regularly, the company recently joined the American Airlines Business ExtrAA for small companies. For every $10,000 spent on flights during a quarter, companies receive 1,000 of the 2,000 points that can be exchanged for an economy class ticket for travel in the continental United States, Canada or Mexico.
"By booking online," Jerry Brown, the president of C/A, said, "our employees get to keep their frequent flier points and the company also gets 1,000 points. So when we have to send somebody to New York at the last minute, instead of having to pay $1,700 we can use 2,000 of the points we've accumulated to get a free ticket." EDWIN McDOWELL

HEADLINE: Dress-Down Is Down if Not Quite Out 

BYLINE:  By AMIE PARNES 

 BODY:
At the height of the dot-com boom, Raymond Nasr felt like a fashion misfit. Everyone else at work seemed to be wearing jeans and sports shirts, and there he was, resplendent in his blue double-breasted jacket, dress shirt with knotted cuff links, dress slacks and red bow tie.
 "It was out of the norm," said Mr. Nasr, 38, director of government affairs at Novell, a provider of networking software in San Jose, Calif. "But I think people liked it because I looked refreshing." 
 These days, fewer colleagues are ribbing him and more are emulating him. As the economy sours, they are rediscovering an old-economy truism. Formal dress often makes a better impression than casual wear on the people who matter most in their careers: customers and bosses.
Mr. Nasr, whose clients range from state governors to heads of foreign governments, says he never lost sight of that rule. "I guess you could say I appreciate the importance of presentation," he said. "Now I look around and there are many more people who look like me."
The demise of so many Internet start-ups that flaunted a do-your-own-thing workplace culture has robbed casual dress of its cachet, experts say. "Looking like a dot-comer was very fashionable once upon a time," said David Wolfe, the creative director for the Doneger Group, a New York fashion consulting firm that analyzes retail trends. "It's obviously not fashionable anymore."
More important, many managers view casual dress as a failed experiment that is more likely to foster laziness than creativity. In a recent poll by Jackson Lewis, a national employment law firm, 45 percent of human resource managers said casual attire contributed to employee tardiness and absenteeism, 40 percent thought it promoted workplace laxity and 25 percent said it encouraged flirting.
"Casual has become misinterpreted as sloppy and unfocused," said Eric Hertz, president of the Fashion Association, a trade group in New York. "Company managers got annoyed by the laxity in the workplace. It's gone as casual as it can go, and now this is the beginning of the trip back."
The dressing-down trend probably peaked in 1999, when 95 percent of the companies polled by the Society for Human Resource Management, a trade group in Alexandria, Va., said they allowed some form of casual attire. Last year, that dropped to 87 percent, the society said.
Since then, George W. Bush has become president and instituted a strict dress code for members of his administration. "It was driven by a sense of decorum that honors the tradition and majesty of this place," said Tucker Eskew, deputy assistant to the president for media affairs. Fashion experts say the presidential example exerts a powerful influence on popular culture.
But the biggest factor in the return to workplace formality is probably the economic downturn, which has driven many people back to ties and pantsuits as armor against job insecurity.
Take Nick Goodman, 27, director of business development at Tutor.com, a homework help and tutoring Web site in Manhattan with 20 employees. He has been with the company for just a year and a half.
"I do see many more people wearing blazers and ties in our office, sometimes even suits," Mr. Goodman said, even though Tutor.com has no dress code. "I think a lot of people want to position themselves as edgier, and more professional. They're taking a back-to-business approach."
So is he. "More often than not, I dressed more casual in the beginning," he said. "Now, I wear a blazer, khakis and a pair of loafers. We have spur-of-the-moment meetings with libraries, universities and colleges, and I need to be dressed appropriately."
Some people are actually revolting against their laid-back dress policies at work. Garri B. Hendell, 31, a lawyer in Toronto, says he wrote a letter to his firm's senior partners last summer protesting their new anything-goes dress code. "Credibility is a suit," he said. "Since I am a lawyer, I depend on the audience, and I know the audience would prefer I wear a suit and tie. So if I am meeting with clients, I wear a suit."
On the other hand, he adds, he is a team player, and because the new policy remains in force, he goes along. When he is not with clients, he said, he cuts loose. "I'll wear a dress shirt, dress pants and some pretty funky shoes," he said.
For retailers, the turn back to tradition is good news, especially in a softening economy. Sales of men's dress shirts rose 4.2 percent last year, to 107.4 million, reversing a decline of 2 percent in 1999, for example, while sales of men's dress pants shot up 11.6 percent, to 62.1 million, in contrast to an 11 percent drop the previous year, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
"We've seen a definite increase in suits," said Jim Dowling, a sales associate at Joseph Scafidi Inc., a custom tailor and shirtmaker in Cleveland. "Suits and ties are definitely on the comeback. I think people are starting to realize that there's a global economy now and you gain more respect and credibility for looking sharp."
That is music to the ears of the fashion-conscious Mr. Nasr of Novell. "A pair of khakis and a short-sleeve polo shirt just doesn't cut it anymore," he said. "Now, in the last year, I see people lining up at Nordstrom and making trips to the airport just to get their shoes shined."
To be sure, America is not returning to the conformism of the Eisenhower years, when dark suits, black wingtips, white shirts and dark ties were de rigueur in the mostly male white-collar work force. For one thing, business suits today are more comfortable, lightweight and not as stiff-looking as those made just a few years ago.
And experimentation -- for example, mixing an expensive suit with a polo shirt or turtleneck sweater -- remains an option for even the most fastidious dressers. "Elements of both dress and casual are coming together," Mr. Wolfe of the Doneger Group said. "What we did is learn how nice it is to dress up and still be comfortable in our clothes. It's the new era of smart-casual."
Even so, he expects the shift to start to accelerate. "We never hear about the term 'interview suit' anymore, but we will," he said. "Interview suits will be back in our vocabularies and in our closets."

I.B.M. Plans To Expand An Alliance In Germany

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
International Business Machines and SAP, the German business software giant, are planning to substantially broaden their longstanding, if not always smooth, partnership over the next three years.
 The new links, which will be made public today at an SAP-sponsored trade show in Orlando, Fla., include an I.B.M. commitment to train more than 5,000 of its service employees on the entire suite of SAP products that support business activities on the Internet. In the past, I.B.M.'s work with SAP had been heavily focused on SAP's popular enterprise resource planning, or E.R.P. software, an integrated package of basic business software programs for traditional corporate computer users. 
 In addition, the new agreement calls for crosslicensing and software development efforts by both companies that will integrate SAP more closely with Websphere, I.B.M.'s package of so-called middleware programs that help server computers play host to business applications on the Internet. And SAP will tell customers that I.B.M. Global Services is qualified to act as host and to maintain their SAP applications in its computer centers. 
I.B.M.'s relationship with SAP products helped generate more than $2 billion in sales of I.B.M. hardware, software and services to SAP customers last year, said Steven Mills, I.B.M.'s senior vice president for software. I.B.M. was involved in one way or another in roughly 26 percent of all of SAP's sales. Mr. Mills said the new links were expected to add five percentage points to that share over three years, generating more than $400 million in new revenue.
Mr. Mills and Stephan Rossius, SAP's vice president in charge of alliances, said in a joint telephone interview that the expansion of their partnership was driven by demand from customers for complete solutions to the complicated task of moving business activities to the Internet. "It's reinforced to both companies the need to reinvest in our relationship," Mr. Mills said. 
SAP, which had revenue last year of 6.27 billion euros, is based in Waldorf, Germany. It has been working with I.B.M. since the late 1970's, but the relationship was strained during the 1990's when I.B.M.'s software group was trying to sell products that competed with SAP's. In recent years though, I.B.M. has sold off or dropped much of its software portfolio and concentrated on forming partnerships with leading software vendors. 
I.B.M. has enlisted more than 50 software vendors in its strategic partner program, which is based on three-year deals that set specific growth targets and investment requirements for both parties. SAP's products compete with many of them, though, which could create new tensions for I.B.M. managers overseeing partner relationships with companies like Siebel Systems, which is best known for customer management software; Ariba, a procurement software vendor; and I2, a major I.B.M. partner in the supply chain management sector.
"This represents a new dimension in the SAP relationship," said John Madden of Summit Strategies in Boston, one of several analysts I.B.M. informed of its planned announcement. "I.B.M. has good intentions but some partners will be worried."
Some customers may also be a bit confused. Through its partnership program, I.B.M. has been championing the idea that customers should buy "best of breed" software programs from different vendors that I.B.M. or other consultants can then help them integrate. SAP's sales pitch that customers are better off with a broad suite of products designed by one company to fit together sounds much more like the approach of Oracle, an archrival of I.B.M. in the database sector.
"It's a validation of our strategy," said Mark Jarvis, chief marketing officer at Oracle.
Analysts say the clearest benefit of the new links for I.B.M. will be the added support for Websphere. The Websphere family of products is growing rapidly but still trails BEA Systems, based in San Jose, Calif., in the lucrative market for software that provides the underlying infrastructure for e-business applications. 
SAP also stands to gain on the e-business front. "The conventional wisdom is that they were slow to embrace e-business," Mr. Madden said. "They've turned the corner and this will push them further along."

HEADLINE: Europe's East Sees AIDS On the March 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: DEBE, Poland, June 9 

 BODY:
It did not seem pleasant for Krystyna Sokolowska to put her life on display -- the youthful year of heroin addiction that led to catching the virus that causes AIDS, to shuffling around homes for the infected that were never popular with scared neighbors. 
 But she agreed to do so at a conference here as an early example of a trend that is alarming health officials in the region: How intravenous drug use is driving an epidemic of people becoming H.I.V. positive in Eastern Europe, and especially in the countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union. Nowhere else in the world is the virus that causes AIDS spreading so quickly, and this is the only place where the sharing of needles during drug use is the major route of infection, United Nations experts say. 
 When Ms. Sokolowska found out she was H.I.V. positive, in October 1989, AIDS was hardly known in Eastern Europe, except as a disease of gay men in the United States. 
"Well, it definitely did not make me feel American," said Ms. Sokolowska, now 32, who lived at the time in Silesia, in southwestern Poland.
But changes since the collapse of Communism -- say health officials who gathered here, just outside Warsaw, at the first regional conference on AIDS -- have created conditions ripe for the spread of the virus: Borders opened, burrowing out nearby trade routes from the major supplier of heroin, Afghanistan. Police control, which brutally curbed prostitution and drug use in the past, receded. At the same time, the economic troubles in the transition out of Communism have left many young people without jobs. 
Now the number of people becoming H.I.V positive has been rising steeply. Thought to be first in the region were two brothers in Ukraine, businessmen who traveled and dabbled in drugs, health officials said. The first sizable number of people found to be H.I.V. positive occurred in late 1995 in the Ukrainian port cities of Odessa and Nikolayev. 
Now, in Ukraine, there are 38,632 people registered as H.I.V. positive -- two thirds of them drug users -- while there were fewer than 300 before 1995. In Russia, 58,000 people were reported to be H.I.V. positive in 2000 -- triple the number in 1999 and two times all the cases reported since 1987, according to Russian health officials here. 
And while in some countries, like here in Poland, the numbers are relatively flat, many others show similar increases.
"It looks much more like a regional pattern," said Dr. Karl L. Dehne, the United Nations AIDS program's coordinator for Central and Eastern Europe. "All regions in Ukraine are affected. Most regions in Russia. The Baltics are affected. Now the first outbreaks are happening in Central Asia. 
"In intensity and geographic spread, it's evolving," he said. "It's worrying." The overall rates of infection in the region are still low when compared with Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is by far the worst, according to United Nations officials. While the number of pregnant women who test positive in some African countries is near 25 percent, the number is less than 1 percent in Ukraine, one of the worst-hit former Soviet states. 
But people at the conference said the limited scope has, in some ways, made containing the virus's spread more difficult, because the problem is perceived to be confined to small groups of social outcasts like drug users. The H.I.V. rates have also been creeping up among prostitutes, especially in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. And drug use in prisons is high. 
"Intravenous drug users and commercial sex workers are blamed for spreading the epidemic, so there is a backlash," said Robin Montgomery, an official with AIDS Infoshare, a group in Russia that works with prostitutes, among others. 
But health officials here said there are early signs of the disease spreading beyond drug addicts and prostitutes. Dr. Olena Purick, a consultant with the International H.I.V./AIDS Alliance in Ukraine, said she is seeing more cases of the virus being transmitted not by drug use but through sexual contact -- from men who are drug users to wives or girlfriends who are not. 
"These were absolutely normal women," Dr. Purick said. "That was a new phenomenon in Ukraine. In maybe Africa or Asia you have the same thing. But it was new for us."
The conference, which attracted health officials from 27 countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet states, was sponsored by several groups that support containing the virus that causes AIDS through what is known as "harm reduction." In theory, this approach aims less at law enforcement than at finding ways to improve the health of people who use drugs or are H.I.V. positive and to check the virus's spread.
Other countries, they said, do not support initiatives like needle exchange or methadone treatment because such programs are perceived as helping drug users in their habits. 
"It's not about needles," argued Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch, director of the International Harm Reduction Development Program, part of the Open Society Institute, a sponsor of the conference. "Needles are part of a bigger package to help incredibly mistreated, marginalized drug users."

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Wednesday with an article about the spread of HIV infection among intravenous drug users in Eastern Europe carried an erroneous figure for Russia. While statistics vary, the latest United Nations estimates suggest that intravenous drug users account for 50 percent to 80 percent of new infections in Russia, not 11 percent.

HEADLINE: A City Parks Revival 

 BODY:
With great fanfare, Madison Square Park reopened yesterday, offering a quiet and elegant refuge in Manhattan's bustling Midtown. The facelift for this 19th-century oasis is a credit to civic-minded neighbors and corporations, which raised enough money and pushed enough of the right levers for a quick and thorough restoration of the six-acre park near the old Flatiron Building. But the revival of Madison Square is also a vivid reminder of the shabby state of many of the public parks elsewhere in New York City. The restoration of these vital public spaces is an issue that ought to rank much higher on the agenda of every mayoral candidate. 
 The percentage of the city budget spent on the maintenance and operation of the city's 1,700 parks has dropped dramatically over the last 15 years. Private donations have grown, but two-thirds of these have gone to two parks in Manhattan, Central Park and Bryant Park. For those parks without angels, the city has been an exceptionally stingy custodian. After years of cuts, there is now only one park worker for every 43 acres of parkland, one gardener for every 1,000 acres. Since 1970, full-time park staff has been reduced by two-thirds. 
 An advocacy group called Parks 2001 has undertaken in recent months to define the scope of the problem in an effort to persuade the political structure to give the parks the attention they deserve. Photographic evidence assembled by the group presents a devastating portrait of a system in crisis -- broken water fountains, soccer fields littered with trash or huge stones, locked rest rooms, piles of garbage. An oily stream oozes along the entrance to Red Hook Park in Brooklyn. An abandoned homeless camp litters Claremont Park in the Bronx.
The parks are not, as many politicians believe, a frill. They are the city's lungs, essential components of its health and quality of life -- cleaning the air, breaking the heat, breathing life into a neighborhood. They can provide recreation and a crime-free environment for schoolchildren and their families, an avocation for gardeners caught in their boxy apartments. Safe and improved parks can also improve surrounding real estate values, which in turn improve city revenues.
With the city electing a new mayor and City Council this fall, parks now belong high on the political agenda. Education, public safety, the economy -- all are obvious priorities. But what the politicians overlook is that healthy, attractive parks can help the city make good on all three of those goals. The parks, finally, deserve their due.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Outlast an Early Sell-Off to Close Little Changed

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The stock market recovered yesterday from an early sell-off. The main gauges ended little changed, as investors regained their footing after Nokia became the latest technology company to warn that its second-quarter earnings and revenue would be weaker than expected.
 Some analysts noted that stocks had picked up strength after William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech that the economy was likely to improve in the second half of this year and in 2002 and that inflation was not a matter of concern now. 
 "Even though the numbers don't show up, and certainly the earnings are not anything to talk about and the economic numbers remain dismal, the fact is that the first rate cuts that we got back in early January, the 50 basis points, should now begin to kick in," said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments. "The fruits of the lowering of interest rates should begin to show up." 
After falling as much as 3 percent yesterday morning, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed down just 0.8 point, at 2,169.95. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,948.38. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,255.85. A surge in General Electric helped lead the Dow and S.& P. higher as investors speculated that its planned acquisition of Honeywell International might be in trouble.
Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, unnerved the stock market yesterday after it projected that its sales growth would be slightly below 10 percent, instead of the expected 20 percent. It also lowered its second-quarter earnings forecast. The American depository receipts of Nokia fell $5.45, to $23.26.
Nokia's disclosure came in the heart of the earnings preannouncement season, when companies provide projections of their financial results ahead of the end of the quarter. Several companies, including Juniper Networks, have cut their forecasts in recent days, raising investors' concerns about weakening corporate profits.
Shares of Nokia's competitors dropped as well, with Ericsson falling 20 cents, to $5.30, and Motorola slipping 86 cents, to $14.
G.E. gained $1.37, to $48.77. The European Commission is evaluating the proposed G.E. takeover of Honeywell, and there was speculation that the commission's demands might be too stringent. Honeywell fell $1.78, to $43.47.
Shares of Affymetrix, a maker of gene chips that are used in biotechnology research, plummeted $14.94, to $26.01, after executives warned that its revenue would be below previous estimates. 
Biotechnology companies were mixed yesterday after the Food and Drug Administration rejected plans by two drug makers to develop a medicine to treat prostate cancer. Amgen gained 17 cents, to $66.92, but Praecis Pharmaceuticals dropped $6.04, to $16.55. 
Analysts said investors would continue to be skittish in their trading until the economy showed signs of sustained improvement. 
"We're going to do this for a while -- up and down and up and down and up and down -- until we get some clear information one way or the other that things are picking up or that they are not," said Mary Lisanti, chief investment officer at ING Pilgrim Investment. "They will pick up, but the question is do they pick up in the fall or do they pick up in the summer? That's the issue."
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices rose yesterday on speculation that falling corporate profits will prolong the economic slowdown and prompt at least two more Federal Reserve interest rate reductions this year.
Investors are "pushing the recovery to later this year, or even the first quarter" of 2002, said Keith Karlawish, who oversees $3 billion at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. That helps bonds because the Fed is set to cut its target rate to as low as 3.5 percent from 4 percent, he said.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 98 4/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.29 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 96 2/32. Its yield fell to 5.65 percent from 5.69 percent.

HEADLINE: Nokia Lowers Forecasts; Its Shares Dive 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 12 

 BODY:
Nokia of Finland, the world's leading maker of mobile phones, warned today that its sales and earnings would fall short of estimates in the second quarter, surprising investors and sending the company's stock down more than 22 percent.
 For a time, markets in Europe and the United States fell broadly in response, then recouped much of their intraday losses. 
 The warning by Nokia, whose fortunes were once seen as almost impervious to a global economic slowdown, illustrates the depth of the troubles threatening Europe's vaunted lead in wireless technology. Many of the leading telecommunications companies are struggling with huge debts from last year's auctions of wireless licenses and grappling with delays in introducing a new generation of wireless technology. Their troubles are now being felt throughout the industry, from producers of computer chips to makers of network equipment and handsets. 
"These are the kinds of earnings shocks we're going to see a lot more of out of Europe over the next few months," David Bowers, chief global investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, said on the CNBC cable channel. "There's no doubt in my mind that the European economies are slowing very, very fast, and we don't think the technology sector in Europe is immune to what's happened in the U.S."
In a clear sign that the expansion of wireless technology has been reined in, British Telecommunications and Deutsche Telekom, huge former state monopolies, announced a deal today to cut the costs of building new networks by sharing base stations, masts and antennas and save as much as $4 billion over the next 10 years.
The announcement followed a statement by German regulators last week that phone companies would be able to share parts of the networks for so-called third-generation phones and other mobile devices that are linked to the Internet at much higher speeds than are currently possible.
Adding to the troubles of technology stocks, shares of the Vodafone Group, the world's largest wireless operator, slid to a 30-month low here today as "lock-in agreements" with KPN Telcom of the Netherlands and Telia of Sweden expired, meaning that the two companies might now sell some 366 million Vodafone shares they are holding. The possibility of shares flooding the market sent Vodafone stock down 3.7 percent, to $:1.680 -- less than half its record high of $:4.015 in March 2000.
But that drop paled in comparison with the plunge in Nokia shares after the company halved its previous forecast that second-quarter sales would grow 20 percent. Nokia shares closed down 7.87 euros in Helsinki, to 26.52 euros, or $22.62. In New York, its American depository receipts -- each representing one share of common stock -- fell $5.45, or nearly 19 percent, to $23.26.
Just a year ago, Nokia reported a 55 percent surge in second-quarter sales, cementing a reputation as one of the few telecommunications companies strong enough to reward its investors consistently.
Today, it reduced its earnings forecast for the second quarter, to the range of 0.15 to 0.17 euro a share, compared with a previous expectation of 0.2 euros. In the corresponding period of 2000, each Nokia share earned 0.21 euro.
"Events catch up even with the best companies," said John Tysoe, an analyst with WestLB Panmure here. "It would have been increasingly difficult for them to buck the trend."
Nokia explained its troubles by saying that "the general economic slowdown in the U.S. has recently shown signs of extending to other regions and to the wireless communications industry as a whole." In a statement, its chief executive, Jorma Ollila, also blamed the wireless industry's faltering efforts to harness the Internet for mobile use and less aggressive marketing by mobile communications operators.
Nokia controls some 35 percent of the world market for wireless handsets. In April, it estimated that 450 million to 500 million handsets would be sold this year compared with 405 million in 2000, but it toned down that forecast today to say that growth would be "very modest."
Nokia is vulnerable because, like other manufacturers, its sales rely on customers' regularly upgrading old models and trying innovative new phones. But many customers now say that they are holding on to their old handsets as they await more advanced technology providing a wider range of services and speedier Internet access.
Beyond that, in the heyday of mobile phone growth until a year or so ago, producers effectively subsidized the cost of new handsets as they scrambled for market share -- seeking to lure customers onto their networks and their billing systems by offering handsets at discounted prices, sometimes as low as $30. But, as companies like British Telecom confront huge debts and slowing business, they are less prepared to subsidize such costs, further reducing the demand for new handsets from Nokia and its chief rivals, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola of the United States.
Shares of Ericsson fell 5.7 percent today in Stockholm; in New York, Motorola declined 86 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14. British Telecom and Deutsche Telekom closed modestly higher after announcing their agreement to share parts of their new wireless networks. Both have suffered large losses in market value in recent months.
Some analysts viewed the deal as a sign of weakness after the two companies and other European telecommunications carriers incurred huge debts, bidding some $100 billion for the third-generation licenses -- only to find that they had overpaid for the permits long before they acquired the technology to exploit them.
In the last few months, British Telecom and NTT DoCoMo of Japan have been forced into embarrassing delays in introducing ballyhooed third-generation projects, and most companies say that the networks are unlikely to be up and running commercially before 2003.
European regulators initially opposed shared networks because the savings could give operators an edge in the price wars that are likely to erupt as these companies seek to recruit third-generation customers.
Today's agreement means that British Telecom's Viag Interkom unit in Germany will share masts with Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile, while Deutsche Telekom's British unit, One2One, will share equipment with British Telecom's BT Cellnet. 
"This deal doesn't threaten either of them," Mr. Tysoe of WestLB Panmure said, because Deutsche Telekom is much bigger than Viag Interkom and BT Cellnet is aiming at a richer customer base than One2One. "Both sides of the deal are positive." BT Cellnet is the No. 2 wireless operator in Britain while One2One ranks fourth. Similarly, T-Mobile is Germany's second largest while Viag Interkom is fourth. Vodafone is the leader in both countries.
The deal with Deutsche Telekom raised questions about how Vodafone would respond. The company declined to comment. Vodafone thinks that it "can build their networks without compromise to optimize those networks for their own customers," Mr. Tysoe said.

HEADLINE: Japan and Tobacco Revenue: Leader Faces Difficult Choice 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June l2 

 BODY:
For pushing through an ordinance banning cigarette vending machines from the streets of his tiny town a few hundred miles north of Tokyo, the World Health Organization wanted to bestow an award on the mayor of Fukauramachi in honor of No Smoking Day last month. 
 But the mayor refused it. The law, the first in a country where cigarette vending machines are as common as water fountains, does not take effect until Oct. 1 and includes no penalties for violators -- but some vending machine owners are still fighting it. 
 "Until the end of September, we don't know what the consequences of the ordinance will be, and I would say it lacks a soul until then," said Mayor Takayoshi Hirasawa. "So it's still not the time to receive any kind of award." 
The tobacco industry is politically and economically powerful the world over. But as the mayor knows, in Japan the industry's muscle is perhaps mightier than anywhere else because cigarettes are the largest source of government revenue.
In a country faced with a mountainous pile of debt, tax revenues mean a lot, which explains one of the oddities of Japanese government: antismoking measures proposed by the health ministry have been blocked by the ministry in charge of finances.
Thus, smoking presents the fledgling government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi with one of its hardest choices. He can give teeth to Japan's weak antismoking programs and eventually reduce a much-needed source of funds or sacrifice public health in the interests of public finance.
How and even whether Mr. Koizumi will choose is unclear. But anti-tobacco groups are heartened by Mr. Koizumi's past. He quit smoking 20 years ago, recently banned ashtrays from the cabinet meeting room and passionately dislikes secondhand smoke.
Also, as health and welfare minister in 1997, he pushed through a white paper containing six toughly worded pages on the health implications of smoking over the strong objections of the powerful Finance Ministry, which has historically vetoed even the most timid attempts to raise public awareness about the risks of using tobacco.
No other health minister before or since has dared to challenge the Finance Ministry, but Mr. Koizumi seems most comfortable being contrary. "We are hopeful that he will show a similar interest in his current capacity as prime minister," said Derek Yach, executive director of the World Health Organization's Tobacco Free Initiative. 
Japan is a haven for smokers and tobacco companies alike. Low prices and modest, although increasing, public recognition of the health risks of smoking place the country fourth in the world in its percentage of adults who smoke -- after South Korea, China and Russia -- according to the American Cancer Society. Smokers here light up more cigarettes each year than in any other industrialized country, the equivalent of a pack a day for every person. 
In a nation with 666 trillion yen of government debt, or $5.6 trillion at current exchange rates, sales of cigarettes generate more than $18 billion in tax revenues annually. Roughly half that amount is passed on to Japan's cash-shy local governments, many of which are in effect bankrupt.
Some $638 million more comes from corporate taxes paid by Japan Tobacco, the former state-owned monopoly, which makes and distributes 75 percent of the cigarettes sold here. On top of that, the government earns roughly $76 million in dividends from its remaining 67 percent stake in the company. 
And those are just the financial benefits. The government also benefits in a perverse way from the effects of a society that loves tobacco: people die earlier than they otherwise might.
That puts less strain on the nation's severely underfinanced public and private pension systems. In a country with a rapidly aging population and a falling birthrate, promoting smoking, or at least only mildly discouraging it, would seem like smart public policy. 
"The Japanese government gets far more benefits than the damage that is caused by smoking," said Takuro Morinaga, senior analyst at Sanwa Research Institute and himself a chain-smoker who jokes that he deserves a government reward for his habit. "That may sound drastic, but from a fiscal point of view, smoking is a good thing."
More and more Japanese are realizing that public finance takes priority over public health, and some are suing the government and Japan Tobacco. "I blame the government and the Ministry of Finance for my problems," said Teruo Araki, a 74-year-old former dentist whose 34-year-old habit of smoking three or four packs of cigarettes a day cost him a lung 20 years ago. 
The government and tobacco seem to go hand-in-hand. Until last year, the gift bags distributed annually to workers in the Imperial Palace in honor of the emperor's birthday contained cigarettes, and Japan Tobacco donated 15 million cigarettes to nursing homes in honor of Respect for the Aged Day.
Then there is the wording on the warning labels on cigarette packages here: "Since smoking might injure your health, let's be careful not to smoke too much." 
That "now, now" admonition comes not from the government's chief doctor, but from the Finance Ministry, which is responsible for budgets and taxes. Similarly, a 103-year-old law orders the ministry to look after the welfare of the tobacco business. 
"We think health issues related to tobacco should be addressed by the officials responsible for maintaining people's health," said Michinobu Omori, director of the tobacco and salt industries office at the Finance Ministry. "We really don't have a big say, even though we own the stock of Japan Tobacco." 
But when asked about why warning labels on cigarette packs here are so timid, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare deferred to the Finance Ministry. "Our ministry is not in a position to comment on that," said Nobuyuki Takakura, director of the Health Ministry's office for life style-related disease control.
Legally, he is correct; the health ministry lacks a mandate to advocate strongly a policy on tobacco in the interests of public health.
Nor does it have nearly the influence that the Finance Ministry does. "Our mission is to promote public health, and we are doing as much as we can under the current distribution of authority," Mr. Takakura said. 
The ministries' conflicting roles mean that Japan's tobacco policy is a welter of contradictions. Mr. Takakura himself represents one conundrum. His previous job at the ministry was oversight of the national pension system, and since smoking can cut the costs of pension benefits by 30 percent, his perspective on tobacco would have been markedly different.
Then, too, Japan is one of the largest contributors to the W.H.O.'s Tobacco Free Initiative, paying $500,000 a year to support a program that aims to eradicate smoking completely. 
Last year, the health ministry proposed an ambitious plan to reduce smoking among adults by half by 2010 as part of Japan Health 21, a sweeping public health initiative. But tobacco farmers rallied support among the "tobacco tribe" of lawmakers in Parliament, and the proposal was crushed. 
"We missed a golden opportunity," said Dr. Yumiko Mochizuki-Kobayashi, chief medical officer for public health administration at the National Institute of Public Health. "We could see our future in the experience of the United States and the European countries, where smoking became popular roughly 20 years before it did here, and we could have changed course." 
Instead, she was exiled from the health ministry.
The only time the public health officials have beaten back the Finance Ministry was when Mr. Koizumi was their champion. The white paper he fought for later became the foundation for Health 21, although in a much diluted form. 
The tobacco tribe swung into action, arguing that stringent targets for smoking cessation amounted to a limit on freedom of choice and would hurt tobacco farmers and retailers. 
Finance Ministry officials are quick to note that the 1898 law that made tobacco a government business requires them to attend to the interests of tobacco farmers. "The government's ownership of shares in Japan Tobacco is due to the consideration of tobacco farmers," Mr. Omori said. "That's a point that people often misunderstand."
But the number of tobacco farmers, now about 23,000, has been falling steadily since 1985, when there were 79,000, according to Japan Tobacco.
The head of the Tobacco Farmers Association, Kenzo Ishihara, insisted that his members' political influence was minimal. "It's a good thing the government owns shares in Japan Tobacco, because if the company was 100 percent private, it would have to pursue profits," he said, suggesting that it would be more focused on cutting costs and prices it paid for tobacco. "That could have a bad impact on tobacco farmers."
But Yoshinobu Yanagi, whose grandfather started the family's tobacco leaf business, had a sharply different opinion. "Oh, yes," he said, when asked whether tobacco farmers were politically well-represented. "Tobacco farmers are contributing to the national finances, so I think they have political power."
Mr. Yanagi turned his farm in Tochigi prefecture over to his son last year, and since then, the family has switched to growing strawberries. They can earn more money farming strawberries, he said, noting that despite the Japanese government's comparatively weak stance against smoking, tobacco consumption is falling. 
That is the government's favorite argument against taking a strong stance on tobacco. The total consumption of cigarettes in Japan dropped almost 19 percent between 1995 and 1998.
But others argue that it could fall further without costing the government much. Dr. Mochizuki-Kobayashi has tried to calculate how higher taxes on cigarettes, one method of curbing smoking, would affect the economy.
According to her, the economy would take a 5.7-trillion-yen hit, or $48 billion, if smoking were eradicated by 2010. But raising cigarette taxes could limit the damage to 2 trillion yen, or $16.8 billion. The additional taxes could support crop substitution, allowing the government to live up to its legal responsibility for tobacco farmers, and pay for medical expenses related to tobacco use. 
Her calculations also indicate that a sharp 84-cent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, to $3.02, would initially increase tax revenues while reducing smoking. A more gradual increase in tobacco taxes might not even dent government revenues at all, she says. 
In 1998, the government raised cigarette taxes by about 8 cents, and tobacco tax receipts have climbed since then. The doctor and Finance Ministry officials believe that the tax has also reduced the number of smokers slightly, which supports her economic models.
"I was ready to explain this to the politicians who were opposing the target," she said. "I was expecting their arguments, but before I could respond, I was transferred."

HEADLINE: Education Study Finds U.S. Falling Short 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Teachers in the United States earn less relative to national income than their counterparts in many industrialized countries, yet they spend far more hours in front of the classroom, according to a major new international study.
 The salary differentials are part of a pattern of relatively low public investment in education in the United States compared with other member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group in Paris that compiled the report. Total government spending on educational institutions in the United States slipped to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1998, falling under the international average -- 5 percent -- for the first time. 
 "The whole economy has grown faster than the education system," Andreas Schleicher, one of the report's authors, explained. "The economy has done very well, but teachers have not fully benefited." 
The report, due out today, is the sixth on education published since 1991 by the organization of 30 nations, founded in 1960, and now covering much of Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. 
In addition to the teacher pay gap, the report shows the other countries have begun to catch up with the United States in higher education: college enrollment has grown by 20 percent since 1995 across the group, with one in four young people now earning degrees. For the first time, the United States' college graduation rate, now at 33 percent, is not the world's highest. Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Britain have surpassed it.
The United States is also producing fewer mathematics and science graduates than most of the other member states. And, the report says, a college degree produces a greater boost in income here while the lack of a high school diploma imposes a bigger income penalty.
"The number of graduates is increasing, but that stimulates even more of a demand -- there is no end in sight," Mr. Schleicher said. "The demand for skill, clearly, is growing faster than the supply that is coming from schools and colleges."
The report lists the salary for a high school teacher in the United States with 15 years experience as $36,219, above the international average of $31,887 but behind seven other countries and less than 60 percent of Switzerland's $62,052. Because teachers in the United States have a heavier classroom load -- teaching almost a third more hours than their counterparts abroad -- their salary per hour of actual teaching is $35, less than the international average of $41 (Denmark, Spain and Germany pay more than $50 per teaching hour, South Korea $77).
In 1994, such a veteran teacher in the United States earned 1.2 times the average per capita income whereas in 1999 the salary was just under the national average. Only the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland and Norway pay their teachers less relative to national income; in South Korea, teachers earn 2.5 times the national average. Teacher pay accounts for 56 percent of what the United States spends on education, well below the 67 percent average among the group of countries.
The new data come as the United States faces a shortage of two million teachers over the next decade, with questions of training, professionalism and salaries being debated by politicians local and national.
Joost Yff, an international expert at the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, said training for teachers is comparable among most of the nations in the study, and that they are all grappling with similar issues of raising standards and increasing professionalism.
Though the United States lags behind in scores on standardized tests in science and mathematics, students here get more instruction in those subjects, the report shows. The average 14-year-old American spent 295 hours in math and science classes in 1999, far more than the 229 international average; only Austria (370 hours), Mexico (367) and New Zealand (320) have more instruction in those subjects.
Middle-schoolers here spend less time than their international counterparts studying foreign languages and technology, but far more hours working on physical education and vocational skills.
High school students in the United States are far more likely to have part-time jobs: 64 percent of Americans ages 15 to 19 worked while in school, compared with an international average of 31 percent (only Canada and the Netherlands, with 69 percent, and Denmark, with 75 percent, were higher).
One place the United States spends more money is on special services for the disabled and the poor. More than one in four children here are in programs based on income -- only five other countries serve even 1 in 10 -- and nearly 6 percent get additional resources based on physical or mental handicaps, twice or three times the rate in other countries.
The report shows a continuing shift in which the United States is losing its status as the most highly educated among the nations.
The United States has the highest level of high school graduates ages 55 to 64, but falls to fifth, behind Norway, Japan, South Korea, the Czech Republic and Switzerland, among ages 25 to 34. Among college graduates, it leads in the older generation but is third behind Canada and Japan in the younger cohort. While the portion of Americans with high school diplomas remains at 88 percent across age groups, the average among member countries is rising. It has gone from 58 percent of those ages 45 to 54, to 66 percent of those ages 35 to 44 and 72 percent of those ages 25 to 34. A higher percentage of young people in Norway, Japan, South Korea, the Czech Republic and Switzerland have degrees than in the United States.
"The U.S. has led the development in college education and making education sort of accessible for everyone," Mr. Schleicher said. "It's now becoming the norm."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Quality Revival, Part 2: Ford Embraces Six Sigma

BYLINE:  By ANDREA GABOR 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, when an invasion of Japanese imports threatened the American automobile industry, the Ford Motor Company led a quality revival based on the management philosophy of W. Edwards Deming, who was controversial then and is out of fashion now.
 The results of the movement, known as Total Quality Management, were stunning at Ford. After racking up $3 billion in losses between 1979 and 1982, Ford hit a series of home runs, including the aerodynamic Taurus-Sable cars, and by 1986 had become the most profitable American auto company. 
 Now, though, Ford's hard-won reputation for quality is being tarnished by a series of setbacks, from the controversy over deadly rollovers of Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires to costly recalls of several models and delays on the introductions of others. Indeed, according to recent surveys by Consumer Reports and J. D. Power & Associates, overall quality and customer satisfaction for Ford cars now lag the competition. 
And so, once again, the company is embracing quality as the answer to its problems. This time, it has seized on Six Sigma, a management tool that is sweeping corporate America. "It was a good way to get a common language around innovation and marketing," said Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, who started the Six Sigma program in 1999.
Six Sigma was popularized by John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric in the 1990's. Adopting it does, however, point to a management problem. Too often, when it comes to management tools for improving efficiency and worker productivity, companies have to reinvent the wheel.
Had Ford stuck with Total Quality Management, it might have avoided many of the problems that have plagued it recently. Instead, as the years rolled by, the concept faded into the background at Ford as its champions retired and were replaced by executives who had other priorities.
"U.S. automakers had so much confidence, they felt they had achieved quality and didn't need to focus on it anymore," said Subir Chowdhury, executive vice president of the American Supplier Institute, a quality training organization that Ford spun off in the early 1980's. He is the author of "The Power of Six Sigma" (Dearborn Trade, 2001).
Consistency is the ultimate test of any quality program -- and, perhaps, Ford's greatest failing. Mr. Nasser himself alluded to this problem in an e-mail message distributed throughout Ford in April. "I have heard people say that it seems as though we have an initiative of the month," he wrote. "I am concerned about this impression."
Six Sigma, a quality-control method for increasing efficiency and reducing errors to 3.5 defects per million operations, draws on the same customer-focused, analytical methods of its predecessor. And Ford's initial Six Sigma projects revisit lessons the company learned in the 1980's, notably the importance of working closely with suppliers on design and manufacturing and the need to avoid even slight variations in a design or production process.
The experience last year of Chris Davis, 27, an engineer in Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, illustrates how such variations can endanger quality. Using Six Sigma statistical tools, Mr. Davis traced the source of vibrations in 2000 Super Duty F-series trucks and Excursion sport utility vehicles to subtle design alterations in some parts from previous models. The flaw was fixed, but had Ford engineers relied on their initial hunch and realigned the front-end suspension, it would have persisted.
Mr. Davis might have followed much the same procedure had he been working at Ford on a similar problem in the early 1980's, in the heyday of Total Quality Management, with one big difference. Then, the driving principle would have been: fix the problem and do not worry about the cost. This time, following the dictates of Six Sigma, Mr. Davis did a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the benefit from the project was worth the effort.
Six Sigma is a lot more structured and profit-oriented than Total Quality Management. Each project has to improve processes 70 percent and produce $250,000 in cost savings. Individual projects are then assigned to middle managers like Mr. Davis, known as Black Belts, who commit to working on quality-improvement projects for two years.
Ford's hope is that Six Sigma will create a uniform approach to solving quality problems that can be replicated. "Six Sigma is a way of learning across vehicle lines," said Louise Goeser, Ford's new chief of quality.
While Six Sigma is unapologetically bottom-line oriented, Total Quality Management was defiantly philosophical and eschewed explicit goals. Deming himself, the curmudgeonly octogenarian who was recruited in 1981 to help jump-start Ford's quality movement, thought if a company worked systematically at improving processes, profits would follow.
He also preached the need to anticipate what customers wanted. By contrast, current Six Sigma projects like fixing Mr. Davis's tire imbalance problem are in the age-old "find and fix" mode. Although Ford plans to focus its future Six Sigma efforts on improving the design of its products and processes, for now the vast majority of its projects concentrate on "how to reduce things gone wrong," said Phong Vu, who heads the company's Six Sigma effort.
The problem with that, though, said Fred Simon, a veteran of the 1986 Taurus who ran Lincoln Continental before retiring in 1995, "is that with the find-and-fix mode you're constantly chasing what has already happened instead of looking at the bigger picture."
Ford has not maintained a consistent collaboration with suppliers, a cornerstone of the 1980's quality drive. It still offers some technical assistance to its suppliers and collaborates with them in design work. But, says the president of a leading automotive supplier who survived the shakeout of the 1980's, "Ford is more demanding on the cost side than the quality side."
Ford acknowledges that its relationship with suppliers is sometimes shaky. "What happens at a company like Ford is that we're moving forward so fast," said Frank Foley, a former Six Sigma "project champion" at the Kentucky Truck Plant and now manager of the Wixom Assembly Plant in Michigan. The plant has a supplier that passed the quality test in the 80's, he said, "so we don't pay so much attention anymore."
Mr. Vu acknowledges the gap. Over time, he said, "some systems get diluted."
Advocates of Six Sigma at Ford argue that the disciplined nature of Six Sigma will ensure its long-term success. But culture may prove to be a big obstacle. "Why isn't quality second nature at Ford?" a veteran Ford engineer asked. "Because cost is king. For the past 6 or 7 years, there's been a huge emphasis on cost reduction. You walk in in the morning and all the alligators are circling. You kill the one that is most threatening -- and that's cost."
Mr. Nasser attributes some of the company's recent problems, especially the delays in introducing vehicles, to disruptions caused by the Explorer crisis, not to a lapse in Ford's quality strategy. "In many ways, we fell short of our own very ambitious levels of performance," he said. "Looking back at last year, it's amazing we came out as strong as we did."

Chelsea Gallery Building Replacing Former Shop

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
A former truck repair shop on 10th Avenue in Chelsea is to be torn down and replaced by a six-story building geared to gallery and fine arts tenants in what brokers describe as the first nonresidential construction in recent memory in the far-west section of the neighborhood.
 The one-story former repair shop, at 289 10th Avenue, between 26th and 27th Streets, is to be demolished by August and will be replaced by next April with a 30,000-square-foot building. 
 The project's developer is Allen Rosenberg, 38, a real estate investor from Long Island who owns 22 residential and industrial buildings in the New York area. Mr. Rosenberg is getting development advice from Sinvin Realty, a longtime commercial brokerage firm in the area. 
Seth Andrew Bennett, a director at Sinvin, says that demand for commercial space in the area, especially from arts tenants, far exceeds the supply, despite the cooling economy and the departure of a number of dot-com companies that had offices in the area.
Mr. Bennett said that interest in the new building planned for 289 10th Avenue had been high and that his firm was talking to a number of high-profile galleries, as well as to a bank.
"I think that I could rent space faster than I could build it if the right properties were available in the area," Mr. Bennett said. At 289 10th Avenue, he said, his firm plans to ask $50 a square foot annually for both ground-level and penthouse space, and $45 a square foot for upper-floor space. The building will cost $5.5 million to build, he said, adding that Brooklyn Federal Savings had approved a $4.5 million loan for the project.
Mr. Rosenberg has a long acquaintance with the area. From the time he was 13 until he was 25, he worked as a self-described grease monkey at the carburetor shop that his father ran next door to 289 10th Avenue. That building's owners were customers of his father. During the summer of 2000, he began renting the old truck repair shop, intending to eventually turn it into either an art gallery or a restaurant.
In March, however, Mr. Rosenberg was approached by a developer who offered to take over his lease at almost double the price to replace the shop with a six-story arts-oriented building. Mr. Rosenberg soon decided to do the same thing, with a goal of erecting fresh rental space that was up to current building and environmental codes and offered amenities like oversized elevators.
The west Chelsea market, however, may not be nearly so robust as it once was. Largely because of the demise of dot-com companies in far-west Chelsea, both asking and signing prices for commercial space have come down significantly in the last four months, said Curtis Woodside, a senior vice president at Wertheim-Sheehan, a brokerage firm that represents tenants.
"For the first time in three years, multiple spaces are now available in virtually every building," Mr. Woodside said.
Some brokers say that relative to other parts of the city, commercial space in far-west Chelsea is now priced too high. Jed H. Garfield, a managing partner at Leslie J. Garfield & Company, said that the recent "feeding frenzy" for commercial space there had been fueled by signing rents that ranged from $20 to $25 a square foot annually for ground-floor space and $10 to $15 for upper-floor space. But now that such space is going for $40 and $23 a square foot, respectively, Mr. Garfield says that many galleries are looking elsewhere, like in Brooklyn.
Mr. Bennett, the Sinvin executive, said that other brokers, as well as galleries, were overlooking the tremendous amount of renovation needed by almost all buildings in far-west Chelsea, including the old 5,000-square-foot garages that so many galleries seem to covet. 
"You can spend $50 to $75 a square foot at a bare minimum just to make these spaces habitable," he said. As a result, he predicts that the building that he and Mr. Rosenberg are developing at 289 10th Avenue will be leased quickly. 
Ruth Barone, a senior vice president with Carlton Advisory Services, a real estate investment sales and financing firm based in Manhattan, said that while "in general the push now within the 10th and 11th Avenue corridor is northward, to 27th, 28th and 29th Streets," there is still "demand for ideal ground-floor space in this area." 
Of the plan by Mr. Rosenberg and Sinvin to start construction on speculation, without having any tenants signed up, she said: "There is almost no commercial construction being done on spec in the city right now. They must know something."

HEADLINE: LIFE FOR TERRORIST IN EMBASSY ATTACK 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
A terrorist convicted of 213 counts of murder in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Kenya will be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole because a federal jury in Manhattan said it was deadlocked yesterday on whether to impose the death penalty.
 Under the law, a unanimous verdict was required before the bomber, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, could be sentenced to death. 
 The jury of seven women and five men, which was in its fifth day of deliberations, did not reveal how its vote was split on capital punishment. But it did offer tantalizing hints that its deliberations were marked by disagreements that went beyond a single holdout juror.
In announcing the verdict, the jury forewoman said in court that 10 of the 12 jurors had concluded that "executing al-'Owhali could make him a martyr." 
She also said that five of the jurors found that "life in prison is a greater punishment since his freedom is severely curtailed." 
These and other findings suggested that the jury, which for security reasons is anonymous, was splintered on moral and political grounds as it weighed the arguments for and against the death penalty. 
Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted last month by the same jury in the Nairobi attack, and of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans anywhere in the world. 
The trial testimony showed that Mr. al-'Owhali helped deliver the bomb to the Embassy in Nairobi, and later confessed his role to F.B.I. agents after his arrest, saying he had expected to die in the "martyrdom operation."
Judge Leonard B. Sand is to impose Mr. al-'Owhali's sentence on Sept. 12.
A second death penalty hearing is to begin Tuesday before the same jury against Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, who helped assemble and deliver the bomb used in the attack on the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 11 people. Yesterday, Judge Sand ruled over government objections that Mr. Mohamed's lawyers may cite a recent ruling by South Africa's highest court that he was illegally sent to the United States after his arrest in Cape Town in 1999. 
Two other defendants convicted last month in the embassy bombings trial face sentences of life in prison.
The jury's deadlock and verdict in Mr. al-'Owhali's case came one day after Timothy J. McVeigh was executed in Indiana for bombing the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people. Judge Sand had earlier warned the jury to "make every effort" to avoid publicity about the McVeigh case.
Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday that in Mr. al-'Owhali's case, "the government sought the death penalty because it concluded that it was the just punishment for this defendant and his crimes."
"But the imposition of the death penalty is uniquely a matter for the jury to decide, and we respect their verdict."
Mr. al-'Owhali sat quietly holding a Koran as the verdict was delivered. 
Outside court, one of his lawyers, Frederick H. Cohn, said: "This is an extraordinary victory for a system that was really put to the test. And that a jury in New York could make the findings it could in the face of real human tragedy that was well presented by the government is a credit to the system."
Another of his lawyers, David P. Baugh, concurred, saying, "In light of the McVeigh situation and all else that's going on, I think it says a lot of very positive things about our country."
But some victims who had testified at the death penalty hearing reacted with anger and sadness. 
Howard Kavaler, an American diplomat who had described for the jury his vain search through the embassy rubble for his wife, Prabhi G. Kavaler, also a diplomat, who was killed in the explosion, said he was extremely disappointed "that the jury accepted some or all of the patently false and dishonest arguments advanced by the defense to save the life of a convicted mass murderer." 
"Unfortunately, an opportunity was missed to send an unambiguous message to the malcontents of the world intent on terrorizing the United States and its citizens abroad," Mr. Kavaler said.
Mr. Kavaler's 12-year-old daughter, Tara, who had sat with her father in court, added: "I'm pretty angry and disappointed that he was not given the death penalty. He really -- he deserved it. He killed so many people. I would have felt a lot better."
The jury sent a note to Judge Sand on Monday suggesting that it might be deadlocked, and sent another note yesterday at 11:20 a.m., making what it called "an unusual request," for a copy of the oath the jurors had taken.
That note suggested that some jurors might be accusing others of not following their oath to deliver a just verdict.
Later, when the jury emerged about 2:30, and the forewoman read aloud from an 18-page verdict form, the possible areas of conflict emerged more clearly. 
The verdict form had been prepared for the jury to register its votes on the aggravating factors offered by the government in favor of execution, and on mitigating factors offered by the defense. 
The form is part of a process required under federal law that tries to ensure that juries do not make arbitrary and capricious decisions on executions, a critical reason that earlier death penalty laws were invalidated. 
There was also space for any mitigating factors the jurors themselves came up with against execution. The form also asked the jury for the number of votes for each mitigating factor. The 12 jurors had to be unanimous to find an aggravating factor.
The jury was then to weigh all the factors in coming up with a verdict.
The form did not, however, ask the jurors to specify how they weighed the factors against one another.
The form shows that all 12 jurors agreed that prosecutors had proven as an aggravating factor that the bombing had caused a devastating impact on victims and their families, causing physical, emotional and economic hardships.
But nine jurors also voted for a mitigating factor, which they developed on their own, that "executing al-'Owhali may not necessarily alleviate the victims' or victims' families' suffering."
The jury also found unanimously that prosecutors had proved other aggravating factors, like the planning and premeditation that went into the attack; that Mr. al-'Owhali intended to kill more than one person; and that his victims included high-ranking American officials.
But the jury could not reach unanimity on another aggravating factor advanced by the government, that Mr. al-'Owhali, if sentenced to life imprisonment, would present a serious and continuing threat to prison guards.
In voting for mitigating factors offered by the defense, five of the jurors found that Mr. al-'Owhali had at an early age been indoctrinated in conservative Muslim teachings that promoted jihad and martyrdom.
Members of the jury came up with a total of five mitigating factors on their own against executing Mr. al-'Owhali. Four jurors, for example, found that lethal injection -- the method used by the federal government -- "is very humane and the defendant will not suffer," the forewoman said.
Four jurors developed another mitigating factor, that "al-'Owhali was raised in a completely different culture, society, and belief system."
That was one of the many arguments prosecutors had sought to rebut in the death penalty hearing, telling the jury that Mr. al-'Owhali came from a privileged and educated background, had made his life's choices freely and was not brainwashed. A prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, told the jury last week that the embassy bombing was the rare case in which execution was the just punishment, adding, "If not this case, then when?"

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Job Slowdown Continues 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) 

 BODY:
 New Jersey's economy continued to slow down in May, as the number of jobs fell by 2,600 and the unemployment rate edged up slightly, according to the State Department of Labor. 
The unemployment rate, adjusted for seasonal factors, rose to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. The national level is 4.4 percent. A year ago, the state's jobless rate was 3.7 percent. May was the third straight month of job losses. Jobs have declined by 9,100 since peaking in February. While most losses have been in manufacturing, service jobs have declined by 3,500.

HEADLINE: Strikes Cancel Many Flights At 2 South Korean Airlines 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 12 

 BODY:
South Korea's two major airlines canceled two thirds of their flights today, as pilots and ground crews answered a call by the tough-talking Korean Confederation of Trade Unions to join a general strike at companies across the country.
 Korean Air, the country's flagship airline, canceled 54 of 96 international flights, including all but one of its 24 flights to the United States, as the airline's Korean pilots demanded that the company phase out foreign pilots. All domestic flights except those to the resort island of Cheju were canceled. 
 Asiana, struck by 3,200 ground-crew workers, maintained all its international flights but canceled 82 of 206 domestic flights.
The labor confederation said that over all, 55,000 workers at 125 companies took part in coordinated walkouts today, but the government said only 15,000 workers at 68 companies had struck. 
An air of increasing desperation has hung over the union confederation as it battles for job security and wage concessions against harsh economic realities, an increasingly hostile government and a tide of public opinion it fears is turning against it. It has bitterly protested layoffs at the bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company, which the company's creditors say are essential for its sale to General Motors, but thousands of the company's remaining workers plan a counterdemonstration in Inchon on Wednesday backing a sale to G.M.
President Kim Dae Jung, long a champion of workers' rights, came out emphatically against today's strikes, calling on members of his government not to "back down from illegal and physical pressure." Militant union members, he said, were causing social instability. 
In the walkouts at Korean Air and Asiana, the union confederation won what it saw as vital endorsement of its hard-line stance from workers at blue-chip companies. But Mr. Kim denounced the walkouts as the selfish acts of some of the best-paid workers in a society in which average wages are $10,000 a year.
Leaders of the union confederation went into hiding as prosecutors armed with arrest warrants sought 14 of them for calling what they said was an illegal strike.
Several minor union officials were arrested in a rock-throwing fight with police during a demonstration by several thousand strikers and sympathizers in downtown Seoul, one of 14 protests in industrial cities around the country. More arrests were made when police stormed a tower that workers had occupied at the Hyosung Company petrochemical plant in Ulsan in the southeast.
The union vowed to intensify the strike on Wednesday with walkouts by workers at a dozen hospitals. Union officials said the general strike would go on at other companies, although how long the strike would last at the airlines was not clear. In the Korean Air pilots' strike, wage issues seem to count for less than growing friction between Korean and foreign-born pilots.

Three more agencies tell of problems they are having because of the slowdown in the economy.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
IN ANOTHER sign of the significant effects the slowing economy is having on Madison Avenue, three agencies and agency companies described difficulties yesterday that included the restatement of financial goals and results as well as layoffs.
 Shares of the Cordiant Communications Group fell 10 percent in London after executives of the agency company outlined at its annual meeting problems they attributed to the slowdown. 
 One was a slowdown in revenue growth that led Cordiant to reduce its underlying revenue growth projection for this year from more than 10 percent to 5 percent.
"Revenue growth for 2001 as a whole is now expected to be in line with the market," said Charles Scott, chairman of Cordiant, the world's ninth-largest agency company in billings, at $11.3 billion. 
To help improve margins and insure profitability growth, employees have been dismissed "in a number of our businesses," Mr. Scott said, without specifying where or when the layoffs took place.
Dick Millard, a spokesman for Cordiant, said the dismissals had been made at various agencies "over a number of months," but he declined to be more specific.
Bloomberg News, in a report late yesterday, estimated the job cuts at 400, adding that Cordiant would take a one-time charge of $2.8 million to $3.5 million for the layoffs.
Among the Cordiant holdings are Bates Worldwide, which handles advertising for marketers like Hyundai Motor and Wendy's International; MicroArts, an Internet brand consulting company; and Zenith Media, a media services shop jointly owned with the Publicis Groupe.
After the drop in London, Concordant's American depository receipts fell $1.20, to $15.80 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Digitas in Boston, an interactive and direct-marketing agency, announced that it had lowered revenue and income results for the second quarter below what management had expected. The shortfalls were attributed to a slowdown in marketing and technology spending, particularly in financial services.
"Clients whose revenue streams are tied to the stock market have, in recent weeks, made subsequent and substantial cuts in their marketing and technology investments," said David Kenny, chairman and chief executive at Digitas.
Those cuts overshadowed the landing of major new clients by Digitas in the second quarter. These included Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, the GMC commercial truck division of General Motors and Williams-Sonoma.
Digitas said it anticipated revenue of $60 million to $63 million in the second quarter, not the $70 million that had been previously expected, and a pro forma cash loss before the effect of a restructuring charge, previously disclosed, of 6 cents to 8 cents a share, or 18 cents to 20 cents after the effect of the charge.
Previously, Digitas expected to report pro forma cash earnings for the second quarter of breaking even to 4 cents a share.
A survey by Thomson Financial/ First Call showed that six analysts had mean earnings estimates for Digitas of 1 cent a share for the second quarter. In the second quarter of 2000, Digitas had pro forma earnings of 7 cents a share on revenue of $70.1 million.
The restructuring charge to be taken in the second quarter is in the range of $13 million to $16 million, which Digitas said would produce cost savings estimated at $23 million to $26 million a year.
Looking ahead, Digitas also had a gloomy outlook, revising its revenue forecast for all of 2001. The agency now expects revenue in a range of $60 million to $70 million for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2000, revenue totaled $75.5 million, and in the fourth quarter of 2000, revenue totaled $79.5 million.
If revenue for the third quarter reached $65 million, Digitas said, that would result in a pro forma cash loss of 1 cent to 3 cents a share. Analysts had expected a third-quarter profit of 3 cents a share. In the third quarter last year, Digitas earned 7 cents a share.
Trading in Digitas stock was halted after hours on the Nasdaq after the agency's executives made their disclosures. The stock was trading at $5.65, down 54 cents or 8.7 percent, when it was halted.
The trade publication Advertising Age reported last week that the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, soon to be the world's largest agency company in billings, was talking to Digitas about a possible acquisition. The trade publication Adweek, in a report this week, said that Digitas's lack of profitability was one of several "sticking points" that remained as Digitas and Interpublic executives negotiated a deal.
Finally, Modem Media in Norwalk, Conn., an Internet professional services agency that is 46 percent owned by True North Communications, dismissed 76 employees, or about 10 percent of its staff, as part of what was described as an organizational realignment.
Stacie Mascitelli, a spokeswoman for Modem Media, attributed the layoffs to the agency's becoming "more efficient in the way we're structured and aligned internally."
The layoffs were made in five of the nine Modem Media offices, in Hong Kong, London, Norwalk, Paris and Toronto, with the largest single total, 40, at the Norwalk headquarters.
The agency estimated the dismissals would save about $2.7 million this year. A one-time charge of $1 million for severance-related costs will be taken in the second quarter along with an additional, unspecified one-time charge to increase a provision recorded last year for excess space in the San Francisco office.

Taking a Meeting Over the Internet

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
SOMETIME between the Industrial Revolution and the invention of the day planner, meetings became the order of the average workday -- as in, "I have back-to-back meetings" or "I have to fly to Philadelphia for a meeting" or "Let's meet next week."
 Yet despite all the software and devices to make scheduling meetings easier, technology has only begun to address how to make the meetings themselves more efficient. 
 A number of companies have developed online services that attack some of the thorniest problems associated with meetings -- bringing together people in far-flung locations and making it easier to share complicated written and visual material. These services are often called online collaboration tools, or virtual meeting services, and they combine the data-sharing abilities of the Internet with the telephone. 
Instead of getting on a plane or driving across town for a meeting, participants can log on to a Web site with a password and a code and take part in a conference call while viewing, say, a document like a PowerPoint presentation, walking through a demonstration of a software product or participating in an online tutorial.
Companies that have used virtual meeting services say that although they do not eliminate the need for face-to-face discussions, they are better than a traditional audio conference call because files can be viewed and shared online. And they save on travel costs, which is especially valuable in these cost-cutting times.
"The downturn in the U.S. economy has been a boon for some of these vendors," said Mark Levitt, the research director for collaborative computing at the International Data Corporation, which provides research on information technology. International Data estimates that companies spent $175 million last year on what is called visual conferencing applications, meaning the data-sharing portion of online meeting services, not including telephone calls. This is expected to increase to nearly $400 million in 2002, according to the research company.
Depending on the service used, the company that arranges the meeting pays a fee based on the number of people participating or on the length of the call. In most cases, companies can choose whether to use the meeting service's audio conferencing abilities or arrange the audio portion of the meeting on their own. Either way, the only tools that are required are a telephone and a Web browser.
John Bower, the national manager of sales and training at CCH Inc., a provider of information on tax and business law, said he began using online collaboration tools from PlaceWare a year ago to help market the company's tax preparation software to accountants. "We send out a U.R.L. and a telephone number and people connect both through the telephone and the Internet," he said.
Mr. Bower said the company realized "huge savings" by eliminating some of the cost of renting hotel conference rooms, but "the biggest gain to CCH," he said, "is that we're able to reach more customers." That, he added, has translated into revenue.
Other companies say they are using virtual meeting services to determine whether a prospective client is serious before they send a sales representative to call. For example, by using an online service from Evoke Communications, said Brian Nugent, the vice president for sales at LuxN Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., his sales staff can give presentations about the company's optical networking products that are "almost as good as we could give in person."
"And at the conclusion," he said, "we're able to gauge, 'Is this a waste of time or does it make sense to take this to the next level and fly out there for an actual meeting?' "
Mr. Nugent also uses Evoke's technology for his weekly staff meeting, which gathers his dispersed sales force and helps focus the meeting by adding a visual element. Another benefit is that the meeting can be recorded for those who may have missed the live version.
That type of flexibility is one advantage that is cited by Ronald Auble, technology manager for the Eastman Kodak Company, which uses online collaboration tools from WebEx Communications Inc., PlaceWare and Microsoft.
For employees in Kodak's headquarters in Rochester, he said, these tools have made it easier to do business with customers in other countries. "They can go home, have dinner, and at 8 or 9 o'clock at night log into the service and have their meeting with Australian or Chinese representatives very effectively," Mr. Auble said. "So it's definitely helping us shrink our world." SUSAN STELLIN

HEADLINE: Gobbling Energy And Wasting It, Too 

BYLINE:  By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is chief economist for Deutsche Bank Group.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
One of the more contentious issues President Bush is discussing with European leaders during his trip this week is his stance on global warming. When Mr. Bush decided to abandon the Kyoto Protocol -- because of its ostensibly unrealistic targets and the pressures it would put on American industry and private households -- he generated a worldwide backlash, particularly among European allies. With good reason: A closer look at the numbers shows that if the economy of the United States operated as efficiently as those of Europe and Japan, American energy consumption and greenhouse emissions would fall dramatically -- to even less than the emission levels envisioned in the Kyoto treaty.
 It is well known that the United States consumes more energy than the size of its economy or its share of the world population would suggest. Specifically, the United States produces 22 percent of the world's gross domestic product but uses 25 percent of the world's energy -- and in doing so also accounts for 25 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide. In contrast, the European Union accounts for 20 percent of world G.D.P. while consuming only 16 percent of the world's energy. Proportionately, the numbers for Japan are similar to Europe's. 
 What these figures boil down to is that for every dollar's worth of goods and services the United States produces, it consumes 40 percent more energy than other industrialized nations. To be sure, unique factors, like the greater geographic distances in the United States, account for some of the higher energy usage. But according to the United States Energy Information Agency, only about 25 percent of American energy usage is for transportation, so something much more significant than geography is at work here.
The fact of the matter is that if, from an energy policy perspective, the United States economy operated as efficiently as those of Europe and Japan, American energy consumption would fall by about 30 percent. In that case, United States carbon emissions might be expected to fall to the European rate per dollar of G.D.P. -- a 35 percent drop.
If America had achieved European levels of efficiency in the 1990's, it would by now already exceed its Kyoto target for 2012, which was to be 7 percent below its 1990 carbon dioxide emissions. In 1999 emissions would have been about 22 percent below the Kyoto goal.
Moreover, the American appetite for energy will only become more of a problem in the future. No boost in domestic energy production will suffice to keep up with the projected growth in American demand over the next 20 years. The Energy Information Agency estimates that American demand for natural gas will rise by 62 percent, for electricity by 45 percent and for oil by 33 percent over that period. Where will all of this energy come from? American domestic oil production has been falling over the past 30 years, largely because the relatively cheap oil has been pumped. Opening areas like Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling will provide only a slight -- and temporary -- change in this very long-term trend. Simply put, the oil to support ever-expanding energy use is just not there.
Nor will it be possible for the United States to continue to make up its shortfall with oil from abroad. International supplies of energy will be increasingly scarce as China and India, the two most populous nations, are likely to continue growing at rates of 5 percent to 10 percent a year, with energy consumption expected to increase at substantial rates. Increasing scarcity and rising prices could thus be a real long-term threat to United States economic growth.
For the past decade, the United States has grown faster than any other nation in the G-7 group of industrial countries. As the world's largest economy and the global leader in the economic as well as political realm, it needs to assume leadership on environmental matters, too. It can do so by creating a framework of incentives that will increase the energy efficiency of its economy to match that of Europe or Japan.
This is important not just to ensure the future health of the American economy, but also to send a signal to less developed nations. These countries have little choice but to generate higher levels of pollution for the time being, largely as an inevitable result of their limited access to capital and modern technology. However, this excuse does not apply to the United States, which has a responsibility to demonstrate that a country need not ignore its environmental responsibilities to remain an economic leader. Europe -- and the world -- can only hope that President Bush is serious about making the United States a leader in dealing wisely with energy.

HEADLINE: In Bush's Words: ABM 'Prevents a Full Exploration of Possibility' 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar after their talks yesterday in Madrid, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. Prime Minister Aznar's remarks were provided by a interpreter.

Q. (TO MR. BUSH) -- The E.U. today rejected your global warming initiative, Mr. President, and weeks of consultations have not eased objections to your missile defense plans in most European capitals. I have two questions on that. Are these issues so important that you're willing to go it alone if the European allies won't come on board? And what is your response to the E.U. today calling your climate change plan short on results?

PRESIDENT BUSH -- Well, first, there's a lot that unites us -- trade, common values, great opportunities. I look forward to making my case, as I did today over lunch, about missile defense.
It starts with explaining to Russia and our European friends and allies that Russia is not the enemy of the United States, that the attitude of mutually assured destruction is a relic of the cold war and that we must address the new threats of the 21st century if we're to have a peaceful continent and a peaceful world. Those new threats are terrorism, based upon the capacity of some countries to develop weapons of mass destruction and therefore hold the United States and our friends hostage. . . . 
As far as global warming, I made a strong statement yesterday that said our nation is concerned about CO2 emissions and that we've begun the process to address that problem. I started with an energy plan that on the one hand talks about conservation measures. Our country can and will do a better job of conserving energy.
But I also talked about new supplies that will not harm the environment -- renewables, natural gas and clean nuclear energy. And I hope the United States Congress responds positively to these measures, which will help in the global warming issue. 
I also said our nation is willing to continue to spend money on science, to make sure that any collective approach is one based upon sound science. 
I did speak out against the Kyoto Treaty itself because I felt the Kyoto Treaty was unrealistic, was not based upon science. The stated mandates in the Kyoto Treaty would affect our economy in a negative way. On the other hand, I did say loud and clear that we must continue the process of dialogue. . . . 

PRIME MINISTER AZNAR -- It's absolutely understandable for any president to be concerned about the security of his citizens, and in this particular case, obviously, there is a concern that's shared as a result of the collective security that we share. I sincerely believe that no one should be surprised that when we pose issues based on overcoming the past of the cold war, policies going beyond the cold war, presentations that go beyond the historical conflict of the cold war, and we talk about new threats, new challenges, new problems, new challenges in general, again, in security we come to new initiatives. . . .
With regard to the second issue, on the environment, as you know, Spain continues to support the position of E.U., and it has ratified the Kyoto Protocol. I understand that we have positions that may have some differences, but . . . President Bush has adopted some initiatives, and those initiatives need to be studied by the E.U. . . .

Q. (TO MR. BUSH) -- About your decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. . . . Do you agree that the European view on this is colored more by emotion than by science, and do you think that there is some hint of posturing in some of their criticism? . . .

PRESIDENT BUSH -- I believe the Kyoto Treaty is a flawed treaty. I think that it set unscientific goals. It didn't include developing countries. On the other hand, I want to reiterate today, and I will do so throughout the week, that we're committed to reducing greenhouse gases in the United States. I had the opportunity to explain to the president that our nation faces an energy crisis, and it's a serious issue.
 We've got incredible trading opportunities between our nations and between the United States and the E.U. In order for us to be active traders, our nation's economy must recover. We've taken some steps toward that. We've got a sound monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. We've got a new fiscal stimulus package that is going to take effect soon. But we also must address energy, and we can do so in a way that not only enhances our economy, a way that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and a way, as well, that helps clean the environment. . . . 

Q. -- I would like to ask President Bush how will this commitment that you have taken on to help Spain in the fight against terrorism be translated? What can the United States do? How can the United States provide any assistance, bearing in mind that in Spain our ethical principles do not allow us to apply the solution that you apply, the death penalty, for terrorists. . . .

PRESIDENT BUSH -- Freedom-loving people are going to be faced with terrorism, and countries such as ours must not yield, must not waiver in the face of terrorist activity. And to the extent that we can help the government of Spain to fight terrorism within its borders, we will do so. . . .

Q. (TO MR. BUSH) -- You say the scientific evidence isn't strong enough to go forward with Kyoto. So how then do you justify your missile defense plan when there is even less scientific evidence that that will work?

PRESIDENT BUSH -- Part of the problem with the ABM Treaty is that it prevents a full exploration of possibility. We're bound by a treaty signed in 1972 that prohibits the United States from investigating all possibilities as to how to intercept missiles. For example, the technology of intercept-on-launch is a technology that we must more fully explore in order to make sure that we have the defensive capabilities necessary to prevent what I call blackmail. So part of the reason we're having the dialogue in the first place is to enable us to explore all our options. . . .
The ABM Treaty is a relic of the past. It prevents freedom-loving people from exploring the future, and that's why we've got to lay it aside, and that's why we've got to have the framework, the discussions necessary to explain to our friends and allies, as well as Russia, that our intent is to make the world more peaceful, not more dangerous.

HEADLINE: Pushing His Missile Plan in Spain, Bush Calls Arms Treaty a 'Relic' 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: MADRID, June 12 

 BODY:
President Bush today began his first overseas trip since taking office with his most fervent pitch yet for his plan to build a missile defense shield, dismissing a 1972 arms treaty that stands in the way as obsolete and irrelevant to a post-cold-war world.
 "The ABM treaty is a relic of the past," Mr. Bush said here this afternoon, referring to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow. "The days of the cold war have ended, and so must the cold war mentality, as far as I'm concerned." 
 The president was equally emphatic about his opposition to a global warming accord supported by European leaders. Just a few hours after environment ministers from the European Union said the president's latest vow to cut greenhouse emissions was unacceptable, Mr. Bush branded the 1997 accord, known as the Kyoto Protocol, "unrealistic" and "not based on sound science." 
He said that trying to adhere to it would harm an ailing American economy, and he made a fresh argument that Europeans should be concerned about that because of trade with the United States.
"In order for us to be active traders, our nation's economy must recover," Mr. Bush said as he stood next to Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain at a news conference here. Excerpts, Page A20. 
Mr. Bush indeed found in Mr. Aznar someone publicly eager to shower him with praise and reassurance. At the news conference, held in a garden outside Moncloa Palace, Mr. Aznar's residence, the Spanish prime minister expressed interest in the promise of a missile shield and issued what seemed to be a gentle rebuke to other Europeans.
"What I'm surprised by is the fact that there are people who, from the start, disqualified this initiative," Mr. Aznar said, adding that "what we're dealing with here is an attempt to provide greater security for everyone."
Mr. Bush's aim for his first presidential visit to Europe is to assure apprehensive leaders here that his foreign policy will not be unilateral, that he is listening to their concerns and that he considers the alliance between the United States and Europe as vital and important as ever.
And he carried with him a general message of cooperation, saying time and again that the goals that bound the United States and Europe were stronger than any differences of opinion.
"There's so much more that unites us than divides us," Mr. Bush said, pledging to consult and try to work with European allies on all issues of shared concern. "We share common values. We trade together. We work on security matters together. And I refuse to let any issue isolate America from Europe."
But his appeal for a missile shield and his unwavering rejection of the Kyoto accord put the spotlight on two areas of serious contention between him and European leaders.
As Mr. Bush toured the royal palace here this morning and later talked for more than three hours with Mr. Aznar, he was taking his biggest step yet onto the world stage, where he is relatively untested and, according to administration officials, largely misunderstood.
It was intended to be a cautious start to a five-day, five-country diplomatic mission that will continue with a NATO meeting in Belgium on Wednesday and conclude in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in Slovenia on Saturday.
Spain's government is more conservative than most others in Europe. Its leaders were more likely to be flattered by Mr. Bush's attentions than their counterparts in some other countries. Mr. Bush speaks some Spanish, which he sprinkled repeatedly in his remarks today. And he was not as apt to be greeted here by the kinds of protests expected elsewhere on his tour.
Only about 400 demonstrators gathered outside the American Embassy in Madrid tonight, toting posters that read "Bush, imbecile, the world is not your ranch" and "Europe rejects a wild Bush-man," and they were easily kept in check by hundreds of police officers.
In a joint statement that Mr. Bush and Mr. Aznar released just before their news conference, the leaders agreed on the need for a "comprehensive security strategy that encompasses both offensive and defensive deterrent systems." It was as unspecific as the proposed architecture for the shield, and it stopped short of an outright endorsement of the plan by the Spanish prime minister.
Before the news conference, Mr. Bush spent the bulk of his time with Mr. Aznar at the prime minister's country retreat in the Toledo Mountains, a getaway similar in spirit to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex. As the two leaders talked and walked the grounds, neither wore a tie or suit jacket. All in all, the visit seemed perfectly tailored to Mr. Bush's informal tastes, a recipe for a relaxed entry into European politics.
Mr. Bush has not always been so sturdy when discussing world affairs and uttering foreign words. On Monday, in an interview with Spanish state television, he mispronounced Mr. Aznar's last name, transposing the middle consonants and saying "Anzar."
There were no such glaring mistakes today, but at the news conference, Mr. Bush was initially soft-voiced and a little stiff, tamping down his usual ebullience to the point where he seemed somewhat tentative. Later, as he expressed his resolve on the missile shield and what he saw as serious flaws in the Kyoto accord, his manner grew more animated and forceful.
Before leaving the United States, Mr. Bush had sought to allay European fears about the Bush administration's efforts to fight global warming by promising to lead the way on the research and development of technologies that would reduce emissions. But Mr. Bush did not tether himself to anything concrete.
Several European environment ministers made clear that they were unimpressed.
"Abandoning the Kyoto Protocol would mean postponing international action to combat climate change for years, and we are already late," said Environment Minister Kjell Larsson of Sweden, which currently holds the European Union presidency, in a statement. "We cannot accept this."
Mr. Bush's aides later conceded that while they believed that they were making enormous headway in softening any European resistance to a missile shield, the disagreement over the Kyoto protocol was more severe and less easily resolved.
One administration official offered a glimpse into the administration's belief that the European proponents of Kyoto were, for political purposes, articulating a lofty vision that was not realistically attainable.
"I wish I were that pure again," the official said sarcastically. "I wish I could be Swedish." Mr. Bush's aides further argue that the accord -- aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels -- was written to make it easier for Europe than for the United States to meet the goals.
Another division of opinion between Europe and the United States exists over the death penalty. The execution on Monday of Timothy J. McVeigh virtually guaranteed that Mr. Bush would take a question about his support for capital punishment.
He told the Spanish journalist who asked him that the death penalty was the democratic consensus of the American people, who he said "believe that if the death penalty is certain, just and fair, it will deter crime."
Mr. Bush explained that he saw the missile shield as a necessary defense against smaller countries that acquired weapons of mass destruction, not as part of a new arms race, and that people who dismissed its potential utility were ignoring the changing nature of the world.

HEADLINE: Auto Insurer Plans to Quit New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 12 

 BODY:
The State Farm Indemnity Company, New Jersey's largest insurer of motorists, said today that it planned to withdraw from the auto insurance business in the state. The company cited persistent losses and accused state officials of dragging their feet on an eight-month-old request for a rate increase and on long-promised reforms.
 State officials countered that bad business decisions had caused State Farm's losses, which reached $128 million last year, and suggested that the company was merely posturing weeks before a scheduled administrative hearing on its rate increase application. The company is seeking a 16.8 percent increase. 
 The move by State Farm, which insures about 850,000 vehicles in New Jersey, or 17.5 percent of the market, would not immediately affect any of the company's policyholders. The process of withdrawal from New Jersey is so drawn out -- itself a sore point for insurers -- that it could take years. 
But the announcement came as a sharp rebuke to both former Gov. Christie Whitman and her successor, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco. The last time an auto insurer made such a threat was in 1991, when Allstate said it would leave New Jersey in protest over sweeping revisions of the insurance law by Jim Florio, then the governor. Allstate, then the largest auto insurer in the state, ultimately settled a lengthy court fight by agreeing to remain in New Jersey in exchange for a rate increase.
Any possibility that Mr. DiFrancesco and State Farm officials could reach a similar compromise seemed remote today, however, especially in a year with elections for the governor's office and all 120 legislative posts, and attacks on the Whitman and DiFrancesco records by Democrats and Republicans alike. Auto insurance rates in New Jersey have long been the nation's highest and are a perennial issue in state politics rivaled only by property taxes.
"It makes no sense for us to make a deal," said Chris Neal, a spokesman for State Farm Indemnity, a unit of the State Farm Insurance Companies of Bloomington, Ill. "I know some of our competitors have used the threat of withdrawal as a negotiating tool. That's not what this is about. This is an admission that we can't do business here."
Mr. Neal also said that State Farm was prepared to abandon its other lines of insurance in the state if New Jersey officials required that step as a condition of getting out of the automotive market here. The company is also the top provider of homeowners' insurance in the state.
State Farm's dispute with New Jersey is rooted in a 1998 law signed by Mrs. Whitman that reduced car insurance rates by 15 percent. The company said in a statement that the rate cut came with assurances that revisions would be made to reduce costs for insurers, but that some of those had been delayed or had not yet been carried out. State Farm representatives pointed to long-awaited changes that were to have reduced expenses for unnecessary medical care for injured drivers. They lamented that the state had not yet set up, as promised, a faster approval procedure for modest rate increases.
Industry officials said they were stunned by State Farm's announcement today, but echoed its complaints. "You have a mind-set in state government now that you don't give out a rate increase because it's not good politics," said John K. Tiene, spokesman for the Insurance Council of New Jersey. "We haven't been able to adjust for inflation since July 1996, and we were mandated to reduce our premiums by 15 percent in 1999. So the result, as demonstrated by the State Farm situation, is that you have a company that is essentially unable to ensure their financial integrity."
Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican, will leave office in January and has little reason to budge from his opposition to rate increases; to do so, industry executives and Democrats observe, would be an admission that the 1998 rollback in rates was ill considered or poorly carried out. Rather, Mr. DiFrancesco is free to let his successor negotiate with State Farm or accept blame for letting the state's largest car insurer leave.
In a statement today, Mr. DiFrancesco was adamant: "If the alternative to State Farm leaving is socking motorists with a 17 percent rate increase, then I say farewell."
He noted that 10 years after Allstate made a similar announcement, that company, now the No. 2 car insurer in the state, said in April that it hoped to attract new customers in New Jersey. "This fact alone strains the credibility of State Farm's claim of an unworkable marketplace," Mr. DiFrancesco said. Allstate also reduced its rates slightly.
Mr. DiFrancesco also contended that State Farm's troubles stemmed from a strategy to increase its customer base "without regard to their bottom line." He thus echoed a criticism first made by state regulators in April, when they granted the company permission to stop accepting new auto customers in New Jersey until the end of the year.
State Farm's net assets fell to $229 million as of March 31 from $445 million at the end of 1998. According to state regulators, its profit margins turned negative only after it pursued high-risk drivers in 1999 by offering discounts of up to 35 percent, a practice State Farm has since dropped.
Mr. Neal denied that the high-risk marketing was a cause of its losses. But he said that for every dollar of premium State Farm received in 1999 and 2000, it paid $1.25 for claims. Its expenses in the first quarter of this year dropped slightly, to $1.23 for every dollar of premium income.
Should State Farm, which has offices in Wayne, complete its withdrawal from the auto insurance market here, Mr. Neal said, 995 jobs in the state would be eliminated.

HEADLINE: WAY OUT WEST; 
There's Silicon in Them Thar Hills, or Will Be Soon

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: PROVO, Utah 

 BODY:
IN the 1860's, this Mormon settlement lost its bid to be a transcontinental railroad stop. This time, it is smack dab on the tracks of technological progress.
 Not that the world passed it by in the meantime. Even as farms and mines multiplied, Provo kept its local flavor. 
 "There was a time when you walked down the street where you knew everyone," said Mel Hudman, 69, who has been having lunch at the Provo Pharmacy, established 1885, since he was a student at Brigham Young University in the 50's. Despite the presence of Wal-Mart and shopping malls, the downtown still has family-owned businesses in red brick buildings built more than 50 years ago. 
Now, however, this city nestled against snowcapped mountains has undergone a transition from industrial to high technology. Geneva Steel, whose furnaces once spewed smoke into the Utah Valley, used to be the area's largest employer. Now, it has been overshadowed by high technology. Spurred by Brigham Young University and Novell spinoffs, Provo and the surrounding valley have become home to several technology start-ups in the last decade. Today, Brigham Young students do research for Adobe Photoshop and are building a virtual tour of the 2002 Winter Olympic sites.
Provo's future can be seen in its neighbor to the north, Orem. A complex built there by the software company WordPerfect is home to a little more than a dozen technology companies, and the orchards of Orem have been replaced by cookie-cutter houses, malls and schools -- transformations that garner mixed reactions.
"I guess all of us live with a little bit of nostalgia," Mr. Hudman said. "I'm from a rural background. Naturally I don't like to see the farmland going to city, but the developers think it is wonderful."
There is little farmland left. In the last 15 years, Provo and Orem have grown together -- now often represented by a hyphenated name -- and pushed north along Interstate 15, engulfing other towns. The population of the Provo-Orem region jumped nearly 40 percent, to 369,000, in a decade.
"Driving around here, it is identical to my eyes to Silicon Valley 30 years ago, the mix of residential, industrial and rural," said Charles Connoy, who is the chief information officer at PowerQuest, a technology company in Orem, and who worked for I.B.M. in 1968 in San Jose, Calif. 
That mix will continue to shift toward development if businesses succeed in turning the region into an annex for Silicon Valley -- or, as they like to say, a "grow-out center." 
Utah's governor, Michael O. Leavitt, makes monthly trips to Silicon Valley to lure more companies to Utah. "It has become clear to me that Silicon Valley has a challenge," Mr. Leavitt said. "They have reached natural boundaries geographically. Traffic has become a huge problem. Those have become significant inhibitors." 
The pitch to Silicon Valley decision makers: Salt Lake City is cheaper than Seattle, closer than Austin, not as hot as Phoenix or as Albuquerque, and the ski slopes are much closer to downtown than in Denver.
"We have workers, we have space, we have proximity," Governor Leavitt said. In the last couple years, Utah has attracted a spectrum of technology facilities: from eBay's main customer service center to Intel's new research operation, which is to have 8,000 employees. 
"Plus we have electricity," said James Oyler, chief executive of Evans & Sutherland, a computer graphics company that is considered the first generation of Utah's technology companies.
In addition, Salt Lake City is a Delta Air Lines hub and less than 90 minutes by air from Silicon Valley. About two dozen flights connect Salt Lake City and the Bay Area every day. The 8:15 a.m. flight to San Francisco is crowded with executives on their way to work who will fly back that night.
Governor Leavitt is considered a technophile himself. When eBay narrowed the finalists for its service center to three Western cities, the governor called the chief executive of eBay, Meg Whitman, and asked her to check how many other governors had eBay accounts.
Today, 12 percent to 15 percent of Utah's economy is based on high technology, dominated by small and medium-size companies in software, electronics and biotechnology. Venture capital investment in Utah was nearly $1.1 billion in 2000, up 70 percent from $598 million in 1999 and up about 400 percent from $219 million in 1998, according to MountainWest, a nonprofit business group that promotes development in Utah.
When Ray Norda, the former chief executive of Novell, graduated from the University of Utah after World War II with a degree in engineering, he could not find a job in Utah. "I had to leave the state because no jobs were available," Mr. Norda said.
Now, Salt Lake City periodically makes its way onto lists of the best cities for business or technology (ranking No. 3 on Fortune magazine's list in 1998), and has ranked among the best cities to live because of its low cost of living and outdoor activities like skiing, hiking and mountain biking.
As prominent as the mountains are, but more controversial, is the state's Mormon presence. One effect is an unusual demographic profile: with a population of 2.2 million statewide, Utah has the highest birthrate in the country and the greatest percentage of people younger than 18.
"We need to find a place for these people to work," said Christopher Roybal, the president of the Economic Development Corporation of Utah. To expand its technological work force, the Utah Legislature recently allocated about $100 million to universities so they could double the state's number of computer science and engineering graduates in five years and triple them in eight. (Some of this allocation is to be matched by the universities.)
Despite its racial homogeneity -- Utah is 91.1 percent white -- the large number of people who do two-year missions with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has led to a linguistic diversity in which residents speak everything from Spanish to Japanese to Farsi.
There is also a different work ethic, with far lower rates of turnover. "If you look at the resumes in Silicon Valley, they're littered with job after job, as opposed to stability," said Bill Wesemann, the president and chief executive of NextPage, who commutes by air from Silicon Valley to the company's headquarters in Lehi, north of Orem.
But perceptions of Mormon culture may also be a stumbling block. Salt Lake City is about half Mormon, while the Utah Valley area is about 90 percent. Critics say that if Utah wants to become a top-tier technology center, it needs to change its conservative culture.
Consider the state's liquor laws. Bruce Albertson, the former chief executive of Iomega, which makes the Zip drive, who resigned in May, said in an article in The Salt Lake Tribune that the liquor laws made it difficult to attract out-of-state workers. 
Others agree. 
"Despite the draw of mountains and the wildlife, the liquor laws will be the kiss of death for Utah to be able to compete in the high-tech world," said Steve Pronovost, a biotechnology researcher who moved with his wife to Salt Lake City from the Bay Area three years ago because of the outdoor lifestyle. 
"There's a permeation of Mormon culture into every aspect of life," Mr. Pronovost said, "which I think affects day-to-day life here." 
Starbucks has a thin presence in Utah because the Mormon culture frowns on the drinking of caffeine. Utah's family mores have also been cited as an impediment for attracting workers who are single and non-Mormon.
"Religion is definitely still a barrier for companies who have no operations in Utah," said Dennis Donovan, a corporate location consultant.
More than 80 percent of Utah's population growth has come from its high birthrate. Many of the transplants are Mormons from other parts of the country. But that could change after the Olympics and more people learn about the Salt Lake area. 
"I have mixed emotions about the Olympics," said Kent Prows, a corporate strategist for Novell. "We have been able to keep this quiet. But when people come here it'll explode."

Lucent's Credit Rating Downgraded by S.& P.

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's lowered the credit rating of Lucent Technologies to junk status in a move yesterday that may make it somewhat more costly for the beleaguered company to borrow money. 
 S.& P. said in a statement that falling demand for Lucent's communications equipment products would make it harder for the company to increase cash flow and report a profit. The move by S.& P., which had already said it was considering lowering Lucent's rating, was widely expected. 
 "We knew this was a possibility," Mary Lou Ambrus, a Lucent spokeswoman, said. "We don't expect it to have a significant impact on our business."
But analysts said the downgrade to junk-bond status could be more than a symbolic blow to Lucent, which was once held in esteem as one of the nation's leading technology companies. Some investors voluntarily avoid purchasing securities issued by a company that is not considered investment grade by large credit rating companies; others are forbidden to do so by their own rules.
Many investors have already been treating Lucent as if it had junk status for several months; the pricing of its bonds reflects that treatment. And in February, Lucent's debtors provided the company with $4.5 billion in short-term credit lines only after it agreed to conditions normally reserved for junk-status borrowers.
The immediate impact of the cut in Lucent's rating by S.& P. to BB+ from BBB- may increase some of the interest rates the company pays on routine financing costs, but the shift will probably not affect Lucent's larger borrowing needs, analysts said. Fortunately for Lucent, the company raised a large amount of money earlier this year with its banks.
"Every notch down increases the difficulty of raising capital," said Anthony Klarman, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank. "But this is more of a formality than anything else." 
Still, the lowering of Lucent's debt rating highlights the company's need to cut costs further and raise additional money. Last week Lucent said it would offer early retirement packages to more than 10,000 managers in the United States, in addition to its plan to eliminate 10,000 jobs by the end of July. 
Lucent needs to raise $2 billion of nonoperating cash by the end of September, or its spinoff of Agere Systems, a chip-making company, could run into problems. 
Lucent is in negotiations with several companies to sell its fiber optic operations, but with the downturn in the telecommunications market it is unlikely that the unit will fetch more than $4 billion, down from earlier estimates of as much as $7 billion, according to a report by Joseph Wolf, an analyst at UBS Warburg.
One Lucent spinoff, Avaya Inc., which makes office phone equipment, said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 3,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force. Avaya issued a statement that it expected sales this quarter to fall 4 percent to 6 percent. Avaya was spun off from Lucent in September 2000 as part of the company's restructuring.

HEADLINE: ABC's of EBay: Auction, Bid And Conquer 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
IT was 9 a.m. on a Sunday here. Hundreds of people had gathered, mostly middle-aged or older, though there was an occasional young couple who had brought their toddler. 
 Speakers testified to how their lives had been changed by the community they had discovered. It is, they said, a powerful grass-roots movement that is transforming America and beyond. "We're trying to take over the world, and we want your help," one said, and listeners nodded in agreement. 
 A sense of fellowship permeated the gathering. Some had long since joined the community, while others were being introduced by friends. The event may have been evangelistic, but the topic of discussion was not spirituality. It was eBay. 
From coast to coast, in a different city almost every weekend, hundreds of people gather for eBay University, a roving crusade for the eBay philosophy. Last time it was Charlotte. After Salt Lake City, it moved on to Minneapolis, and after that, Cincinnati. Around the country, there has been an outpouring of interest in the company's year-old outreach effort, which is part instructional and part philosophical.
On average, 500 people pay $25 each for the privilege of attending classes, on one or two days, on how to buy and sell better on eBay. 
The hotel setting, the lackluster pastries and the overhead PowerPoint presentations give eBay University the air of a professional convention mixed with a spiritual revival. Classes range from the basic, like "Browsing and Buying," to the more advanced, like "Improve Your Listing With Photos/HTML."
The audience is hobbyists, homemakers and entrepreneurs. The instructors are eBay employees and enthusiasts who consult or write books about the auction site. They share their eBay successes and disappointments. For some, eBay is entertainment. For others, a livelihood. 
"I don't think you see anyone here not smiling," said Stephen Higginson, who makes his living selling computer equipment on eBay, after he took the Advanced Selling Tips class. "We know something that the average public doesn't know. We're free." 
For Mr. Higginson, eBay is not simply a Web site but a lifestyle that will soon give him the freedom to be a stay-at-home father. 
"EBay has changed my life," said Mr. Higginson, who is an avid buyer as well as seller. His largest purchase was a 1993 Isuzu Rodeo sport utility vehicle for $4,000. The independence theme is often repeated in the classes and in the hallways between sessions. 
Only a fraction of the attendees are eBay PowerSellers, an elite status for certain high-volume sellers that entitles them to special services. Many of the rest, like Mark Lee of Eagle Mountain, Utah, are aspiring sellers looking to eBay to change their lives.
"I want eBay to replace my income," said Mr. Lee, who has turned video equipment sales on eBay into a family endeavor. His wife monitors his e-mail while he is at work as a video technician, and his children help him take photos of his items.
"You hear a lot of variations on being down on the luck: between careers, out of money, not sure what to do," said Jim Griffith, who was one of eBay's earliest employees and has become what the company calls an eBay Ambassador, traveling around the country to spread the gospel of eBay. "Then they find a way to turn the Internet into a tool not only to earn an income but feel like they have a purpose in life." 
"I really believe that the world needs to know more about this kind of community," Mr. Higginson said. "This is a very unique community. There is nothing like it anywhere." 
Since its creation five years ago as a site for trading Pez dispensers, eBay has lodged itself in the cultural and economic consciousness of an Internet generation. The number of registered users has grown to 29 million. 
EBay University was created by the eBay educational department last June as a way to reach out to eBay users, or "community members" as they are called, said Tom Cotton, director of offline education at eBay. 
In a community built by users with ID's like luv2shop and flygirl, some are drawn to eBay University for the novelty of a fellowship based on physical objects.
"EBay is something where everybody is invisible since it's on a computer," said Gayle Nikolaisen of Kearns, Utah, as she looked around. "To see somebody visually is kind of a neat thing." Mrs. Nikolaisen was waiting with two of her sons to attend a class on using eBay software. She is a PowerSeller and sold a 1960's Liddle Kiddles infant's toothbrush for $380 last fall. 
Life philosophy aside, the classes focus on the nuts and bolts of eBay strategies. The instruction is part marketing advice ("L@@K!!!" and "WOW!!!" are a waste of valuable title real estate), part Martha Stewart (how to build a mini photo studio) and part motivational speaking ("I quit my job to sell on eBay, and so can you"). 
After a lunch break, Marsha Collier, an eBay instructor and co-author of "eBay for Dummies," shared a treasure trove of tips with a class of about 100 people. "Use your mind," she said, wearing a black shirt with an eBay logo. "Think like a buyer." 
Her students listened attentively. They asked perceptive questions. They took notes diligently, scribbling in their notebooks or typing on their laptop computers or Palms. 
She offered strategies for bidders: stake out auctions that expire at midnight Pacific time (when the East Coast is in deep sleep); look for misspellings (Thimkpad and Mickey Mantel) because they can lead to items overlooked by other shoppers' searches.
For sellers: set minimum bids low to create momentum. Identify your target audience: Men or women? People who buy at home or at work? Look at the closing times and days of the week that produced the highest prices for similar items. The heaviest traffic times are 6 p.m. on Sunday, Monday morning and Thursday night (before the site goes down for maintenance during the wee hours of Friday morning). She encourages sellers to ship internationally.
"International buyers are serious buyers," she said to some skeptical audience members. "They never back out of the deal. I've never had an issue with foreign buyers. I love them." 
For advanced students, there is a class on Seller's Assistant Pro, software distributed by eBay that helps high-volume sellers automate the eBay sales cycle, from bulk listings through item shipping. David White, the instructor, had been a paramedic for 30 years when he quit to become a full-time software consultant for Seller's Assistant. He bounced around, telling sellers to play down tackiness. "Avoid using music and animated images," he advised. 
Originally known as Auction Assistant, Seller's Assistant changed to a subscription-based fee in February. That decision left many long-time users irate when Auction Assistant stopped working on their computers a few weeks ago: not subscribing meant not receiving necessary updates. 
This, and rising listing fees, have left some eBay users grumbling that eBay cares more about the bottom line than the community. 
On auction message boards, eBay users have complained about increased fees and growing competition from big businesses. I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, the United States Postal Service, the National Football League and the Oregon State government are among eBay's registered users. Rosie O'Donnell is a member, as is Utah's governor, Michael O. Leavitt. 
"I'm an eBay addict," said Governor Leavitt, in an interview in his office. He has bought things wholesale with his sons and then auctioned them one by one on eBay. "We were spending a fair amount of energy on this," he said.
He has even used his eBay credentials to his state's advantage. When eBay had narrowed down the finalists for its customer service center to three western cities including Salt Lake City, Governor Leavitt called Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, and told her to see how many of the other governors had eBay accounts.
His interest made a difference, eBay said. The customer service center opened in 1999 in Draper, a nearby suburb, and now has 500 employees. 
EBay users even have their own status symbol: not wealth or fame, but feedback from other users, which is protected jealously. Different standings are rewarded with colored stars. Currently, more than a dozen users have achieved the highest status, a shooting star that represents at least 10,000 positive comments. 
"It is definitely a pride issue," said Mark Lee, who said he had never received negative feedback. Mr. Lee said he had bent over backwards to protect his rating. Once, for example, after he inadvertently sold one more poster than he had, he bought an additional one at a loss to fill the order.
Mr. Lee said that selling on eBay was also an art. "Presenting an item is a delicate balance between being sophisticated yet appealing to buyers' bargain-hunting instinct," he said. "Also, there's color coordination. When I sell photos, the color of the background affects the price. When I have brighter colors, I have less bids. When I used more neutral tones that complemented the photo, the number of bids tripled for the same photo." 
Many participants agreed that a sense of interdependence with eBay emerges out of their buying and selling. In a morning class, the computer failed. The class looked up to see the overhead PowerPoint presentation replaced by a vacant blue screen. "Now you know how it feels when eBay goes down," a student chirped. 
"Exactly," the instructor said sheepishly.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise, Holding Recession at Bay 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
Retail sales rose last month after increasing more in April than first reported, a sign consumers are still willing to spend and keep the economy out of a recession.
 Sales rose 0.1 percent after a 1.4 percent increase in April, which was the largest since January and bigger than the 0.8 percent rise initially estimated, the Commerce Department said. The April figure had been revised to a 1.1 percent gain earlier this month. 
 Retail sales increased at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first two months of the second quarter, compared with a 5.2 percent first-quarter pace. May's gain was the fourth in the last five months even as unemployment and prices rose.
"Households seem committed to keeping the economy afloat," said Steven Wood, chief economist at Financial Oxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. "Spending is holding up remarkably well given the emerging weakness in labor markets."
The May sales report is the first using a more detailed system for classifying businesses that are tracked by the government. For instance, electronics and appliance stores are now broken out, rather than being embedded in a broader category. Bars and restaurants continue to be included but in a new category of "food services."
The numbers in the report suggested that Federal Reserve officials might limit future interest rate reductions. Still, there is some risk an economic rebound will be slow in coming, Roger Ferguson, the vice chairman of the Fed, said today. And the Fed's latest regional economic report card showed the economy was little changed or had slowed in the last two months.
"We are in a period where the economy is growing quite slowly, and I believe that is still the case," Mr. Ferguson told the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing on his nomination to another term.
The Fed's so-called beige book of economic conditions said manufacturing "has declined or remained weak," construction "appears to have leveled off," and retail sales "have been slow to flat."
The report comes two weeks before Fed officials meet to decide whether to lower rates for a sixth time this year.
As for inflation, it continues to be contained, a separate report indicated. The Labor Department said prices of imported goods excluding petroleum fell 0.2 percent in May, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Including petroleum, import prices increased 0.3 percent, the first rise in eight months.
The Commerce Department's report showed that excluding a decline at automobile dealers, retail sales rose 0.3 percent after a 1.1 percent increase in April.

HEADLINE: Backing Sought for Offshore Tax Initiative 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 13 

 BODY:
Tax officials from the United States and other countries ended a meeting here today and returned home to seek political agreement for proposals under which the United States and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development would cooperate on reducing tax revenue lost to offshore havens.
 "Many of the countries wish to go back to their governments to seek political backing for the proposals under discussion," said Nick Bray, a spokesman for the O.E.C.D. 
 Those proposals, made to secure American cooperation, are likely to include the removal of a threat of sanctions against offshore tax havens if they fail to commit themselves to requested changes by July 31.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said last month that he had "serious reservations" about the plan by the O.E.C.D. to reduce "harmful tax practices" carried out by offshore tax centers. New agreements for the plan are likely to concentrate on greater transparency and exchange of information, which the United States supports.
The United States, which backed away from the initiative under lobbying from low-tax advocates, signaled today that its involvement in the talks did not mean that its stance had softened.
"It is not a softening, but a redirection," John Taylor, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said in a briefing for reporters.

HEADLINE: Archer Daniels in a Venture on Cooking Oil 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill., June 13 

 BODY:
The Archer Daniels Midland Company is teaming with the Kao Corporation of Japan to make and market a cooking oil that is already a top seller in Japan, where health officials have said it may help to lower body fat. 
 The joint venture, announced today by Archer Daniels and its Japanese partner, will be based in Decatur, where Archer Daniels is based, and will be called ADM Kao L.L.C. Construction will begin this summer on a pilot plant that is intended to be running by November. 
 The plant will manufacture the oil, called diacylglycerol, and the joint venture will market it in North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. 
Archer Daniels said several clinical studies in Japan had shown that the oil assisted in lowering body fat content.
The company also said that the regulatory body in charge of health food products in Japan had approved the oil to manage serum triglycerides, or fat levels, in the blood after a meal. Controlling those levels could lead to less buildup of body fat. 
John McNamara, president of Archer Daniels, said that the company believed that the oil could become a major new product line with sales of more than $150 million. 
The oil, which is made from soybeans or canola seeds, can be used as a home cooking oil or an ingredient in packaged foods like frozen dinners, cookies, margarine, snacks and salad dressings, Archer Daniels said.
Marketed in Japan as Healthy Econa Oil, it has become the best-selling premium vegetable oil in that country, the companies said.

A Spate of Profit Warnings Sours the Mood on Wall St.

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The mood on Wall Street soured yesterday on a series of profit warnings that intensified worries that corporate earnings would remain weak into 2002.
 Blue-chip and technology stocks tumbled in a sell-off that accelerated as the session wore on. In contrast to their moves on Monday, bargain hunters failed to step in and reverse the downward momentum. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 76.76 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,871.62. Broader stock indicators also lost ground. The Nasdaq composite index slid 48.29 points, to 2,121.66, for a 2.2 percent loss, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 14.25 points, to 1,241.60, down 1.1 percent. 
Although investors had been expecting second-quarter results to be dismal, the severity of recent warnings as well as several layoff announcements unnerved them and raised worries that a recovery would not come by year-end.
"With the pressure of all these earnings preannouncements, which are going to continue unabated for the next few weeks, it's going to be very difficult for stocks to make progress," said James M. Meyer, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The telephone equipment maker Avaya tumbled $1.64, to $13.36, after it lowered revenue estimates and announced nearly 3,000 job cuts late Tuesday, citing slow sales.
Investors also punished Maytag, sending it down 31 cents, to $32.17, after it said second-quarter earnings would be 25 percent lower than expected.
Some of the strongest selling came in technology. Intel dropped $1.07, to $29.06, for a loss of 3.6 percent.
But the camera and filmmaker Polaroid rose 20 cents, to $3.73, after it said that it would cut 2,000 jobs, or 25 percent of its work force, to reposition itself as a digital imaging company.
Stock prices have lost ground after a huge rally in the spring, when many investors were optimistic that earnings would improve by year-end. They have turned pessimistic, however, over the last few weeks, as earnings warnings have increased.
"People are now beginning to worry that the economy may not recover as early as they had been estimating," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher. "I also think some of this is due to the expiration of stock futures and options this week. This is something that occurs quarterly and usually causes a lot of volatility."
Also yesterday, there was lukewarm enthusiasm for the initial public offering of Kraft Foods, which was spun off by Philip Morris. Its shares rose 25 cents, to $31.25, after being priced at $31 Tuesday. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices fell slightly yesterday as cautious comments from a top Federal Reserve official and a Fed report showing economic stagnation left investors uncertain about how soon the economy would recover from a deep slump.
Government data showing retail sales grew modestly in May after a strong rise in April caused selling as it had assuaged some investor concerns that the slowdown, so far centered in manufacturing and business investment, would soon spread to consumer spending.
But those losses were mostly recouped by late afternoon, keeping shorter-dated yields pinned near their lowest levels in a month, after warnings about the economy from the Fed vice chairman, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., and the Fed's beige book report, which showed economic weakness across the nation in April.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32 , to a price of 98 2/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.26 percent from 5.25 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32 , to 95 31/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.66 percent from 5.65 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Polaroid to Cut 2,000 Jobs; Instant-Photo Woes Are Cited 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation, acknowledging that its ailing instant photography business is unlikely ever to recover, said yesterday that it would cut 2,000 jobs, at least half in Massachusetts. The cuts are in addition to the 945 jobs Polaroid said it would eliminate in February. Together the cuts will reduce the global work force of Polaroid, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., to 5,500 by the end of next year. 
 Polaroid would not elaborate, but analysts speculated that most of the cuts would come from sales and marketing, and that manufacturing operations would take the second-biggest hit. "I don't know why it took them so long to realize they are overloaded with people," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid. 
 Investor patience clearly has run out. With the exception of a small spike in May, Polaroid's shares have declined steadily this year. "The analysts have been saying, loud and clear, 'sell this stock,' " said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares closed yesterday at $3.73, up 20 cents. 
Although digital cameras have cut into every film company's sales, companies like Eastman Kodak can still make money from chemicals and paper to print snapshots. Polaroid's instant cameras both take and print pictures, so digital photography has dealt it a lethal blow. 
For a short while, Polaroid seemed to hold the digital juggernaut at bay. In 1999 Polaroid turned its first profit in four years, on the strength of hugely popular new cameras like the I-Zone, which made tiny pictures. But I-Zone sales have softened with the economy, and the margins on I-Zone films never approached those on Polaroid's older instant films. Moreover, real estate agents, insurance adjusters and other big users of Polaroid's older instant cameras have defected to digital cameras. 
The upshot is that Polaroid lost money in the last three quarters, and expects to lose money for the year.
"We've finally acknowledged that instant photography will continue to decline," said Herbert N. Colcord, a Polaroid spokesman. "Digital imaging is the primary factor causing that decline, but it also promises to be Polaroid's salvation."
Indeed, on May 31 Polaroid executives told analysts and reporters that it would trim costs associated with its instant photography business, and milk it for cash to pay down debt and finance its own digital technologies. At that meeting, Polaroid unveiled new digital technologies that would, for the first time, let Polaroid printers and papers make prints from other company's cameras. 
The new technologies, called Opal for multicolor printing and Onyx for monochrome printing, do not use conventional ink or toner cartridges. Instead, the printer uses a thermal process to thaw out molecules of frozen ink that have been imbedded in thinly coated papers. 
Analysts say the technology prints much faster than inkjet printers, and yields a picture of higher quality at a lower cost per print. They also say that the paper is thin enough to fit into hand-held wireless devices like cell phones, and can thus be used to print directly from such devices, once telecommunications companies master the art of transmitting and capturing wireless images.
"This is one of the most significant technologies to come out of this industry in 30 years," said Robert L. Renck of the brokerage firm R. L. Renck & Company, who is one of the few analysts who suggest that investors buy Polaroid stock. 
But it will be a while before Opal or Onyx add much to Polaroid's bottom line. Mr. Colcord said Polaroid will probably introduce a product based on the Onyx technology before the year is out, but that it is still negotiating with possible partners for future products. 
For now, Polaroid is racing against a financial clock. It has nearly $550 million in debt coming due in January. "We are working daily with our banks to restructure our debt, and we are not filing for bankruptcy," Mr. Colcord said.
"These programs will catch on, and Polaroid will show profits," said Mr. Yannas, another of the company's few fans. "This could be a $16 stock in 12 months."

A study looks at an eagerly sought but hard-to-reach group.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
BOMBARDED by media messages since they were born, consumers 21 to 25 years old are a particularly difficult group for advertisers to reach. But as these consumers begin to spend money, they are also much sought after by marketers, who are looking for ways to understand them better.
 Many are finishing school or are recent graduates and have started a first full-time job. They are beginning to make large purchases like cars and furnishings. But basic characterizations only scratch the surface. How do they live and work? What about their friends and social activities? And what are their priorities? 
 "What you need, I think, to be profitable and have a chance at relating to this group is a very, very strong human sense of who they are," said John P. McManus, editorial director and chief operating officer at Simba Information in Stamford, Conn., a media and marketing trends newsletter that is part of the Media Central unit of Primedia.
"I think the 21-to-25 age group certainly has had, by volume, a higher level of exposure to media messages," he said. "There's been no generation coming of age in adulthood that has had such exposure to media messages."
To develop an in-depth look at this age group for strategic planners at agencies, PortiCo Research, a marketing research company, interviewed 16 young adults who live in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. Staff members ranging from a cultural anthropologist to a brand planner delved into the daily lives of the group. The researchers explored their homes, workplaces and parties, met their roommates and friends, listened to their music and talked with them about decisions they made and plans they had.
The 43-page report that resulted, called "Coming of Age in the Age of Possibility," is intended to be sold to agencies, along with a 30-minute documentary that illuminates the participants through discussions of their impressions of themselves and the world around them. The report and the video cost $25,000, and include a presentation of the findings and a brainstorming session with a PortiCo staff member. PortiCo can also work with an agency or marketer to develop the findings further and do more specific research.
"One reason our clients, the ad agencies, the brands that we work with, are targeting this group is that they're young enough to still have a lot of room in their life to make decisions and old enough to be consumers," said Caroline Gibbons Barry, the president of PortiCo, which is based in Chicago and has offices in Los Angeles, New York and Paris.
This is the first study PortiCo has compiled independently to sell to agencies or marketers rather than as a result of a commission for a specific project or brand. Ms. Gibbons Barry said the growing importance of focusing on the age group, as well as a weakening economy that could impede an agency's doing its own research, helped motivate the study.
The findings, developed over four months at the end of last year, depict the group as people who see their lives as opportunities for self-expression, self-fulfillment and self-reflection.
"I didn't get the impression that they were self-centered, but very reflective and introspective," Ms. Gibbons Barry said. "What they do in life really matters to them and really fits who they are. They're always sort of checking that this is the path that they want to take in life."
Melanie Fallon, a project analyst at PortiCo's New York office, said the open-minded attitude was not "just youthful optimism."
"They have a savvy perspective on the world; they know all about money and finance," she said.
The research highlights four categories in which the group reveals its values: being real, being a good person, expanding their horizons and having fun. It also shows how their independent attitudes can lead them to think that anything is possible, and that the possibilities can be overwhelming.
"I've always had an obsession for being very successful, not like successful with your job or something, but like being somebody big in the world," said Ruben, a media executive interviewed on the video, which identified the participants by only their first names. "I'm not making a lot of money, but it's a challenging job, and I'm doing things that are important."
So far, offices of three agencies have bought the information: BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, which works for marketers like the Pepsi-Cola brand of PepsiCo and the Wrigley's brand of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company; J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group, with clients like the Lipton brand, owned by Unilever, and United Distillers and Vintners, part of Diageo; and Rubin Postaer & Associates, with the American Honda Motor Company and the VH1 cable television unit of Viacom.
The kind of research that PortiCo developed, Mr. McManus said, "gives more of a human dimension to what all the quantitative data would be telling you."

HEADLINE: Uneasy Partners Seek Ways to Make Mideast Truce Last 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 13 

 BODY:
Palestinians and Israelis began the delicate search today for ways to carry out the American-brokered agreement reached earlier in the day to extend the truce that has reduced Middle East violence during the last 12 days.
 The formal cease-fire went into effect at 3 p.m. In the next 48 hours, the two sides are required under the agreement to begin serious cooperation on security issues and to enforce a complete cessation of violence, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials who participated in the negotiations. 
 In the next phase, the Palestinians are required to prevent any terrorist activities and take practical steps to arrest anyone engaged in terrorism or planning an attack. The Israelis must begin to ease their tight restrictions on Palestinian villages and cities and start withdrawing their soldiers to positions they held before the violence started last September.
In addition, both sides agreed to participate in a cease-fire committee that will be directed by an American intelligence official, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials. The Palestinians interpret the American role as monitoring the cease-fire, but the Israelis said it would not involve observers on the ground. The committee is expected to meet on Friday. 
The initial timetable was set at a meeting today of security officers from both sides. George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, conducted the meeting to develop steps for carrying out the agreement reached this morning. After persuading the two sides to grudgingly consolidate their independently declared cease-fires, Mr. Tenet concluded his six days of intense negotiations and returned to Washington.
"It was a productive, constructive discussion," a senior American diplomat said after today's meeting. "We are now looking for mutual steps on the ground to fulfill the immediate requirements of the work plan."
President Bush said in Brussels today after a meeting with NATO leaders that both sides should take "concrete actions" to carry out the cease-fire and added that Mr. Tenet had told him he was "cautiously optimistic" that the plan would lead to a sustainable truce.
Mr. Bush said he would decide whether Secretary of State Colin L. Powell would get involved in trying to transform the cease-fire into renewed peace talks after assessing the efforts of the Palestinians and Israelis to calm the violence.
Mr. Tenet's trip represented the Bush administration's most active intervention in the region. But senior officials from both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority warned that the agreement he left behind was precarious and would require renewed sustained American involvement.
"This is the first serious and comprehensive attempt to calm the situation and, contrary to previous efforts, this one has a chance to succeed, but nothing is guaranteed," a senior Israeli military official said.
Mr. Tenet arrived on June 6, five days after 20 young people were killed in a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv. He wanted to put a formal agreement in place quickly before another episode of violence destroyed the fragile cease-fire adopted independently by the Israelis and Palestinians. A key was concentrating on security issues and delaying talks abut political matters.
After several meetings with both sides, he presented the security chiefs with a proposed agreement to end the violence and renew cooperation on security matters on Friday, according to two participants in those meetings. Both sides expressed objections and reservations.
Over the weekend, Mr. Tenet revised his proposal and on Monday evening he handed it to the negotiators. His message was essentially "take it or leave it." The two sides debated for nearly four hours at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, sometimes exchanging angry words.
On Tuesday morning, however, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, accepted the Tenet plan. Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, balked, worried that it would create a backlash among his most militant supporters because it lacked any political concessions by Israel, the participants said.
Details of the agreement have not been made public, but an American diplomat said the language was deliberately vague on some central issues, like the requirement that the Palestinian Authority arrest suspected terrorists.
The Israelis had insisted that the Palestinians re-arrest dozens of terrorists released since the Palestinian uprising began last September. The Palestinians countered that they would not make arrests based on outdated allegations.
In the end, the agreement requires the Palestinians to renew cooperation with Israeli security officials and take all practical steps to arrest anyone planning terrorist actions or carrying them out, according to people familiar with the language.
The agreement lacks the link the Palestinians had sought between the cease-fire and their demands that Israel stop all construction on settlements in the West Bank and that international observers be brought in to monitor compliance.
Mr. Arafat accepted the plan in principle early this morning after Mr. Tenet made a last-minute trip to his headquarters in Ramallah. But the Palestinian leader continued to push for solutions to political issues like the freeze on settlement construction and the pullback of Israeli troops in keeping with recommendations in the report prepared by the commission headed by former Senator George J. Mitchell.
"Settlements are the obstacle that will endanger this chance," Yasir Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian minister of information and one of the negotiators, said at a news conference.
Even agreeing in principle carries risks for Mr. Arafat. Apparently trying to reduce those risks, he gave Mr. Tenet a letter in which he said he had raised several objections to portions of the agreement.
Israel also has reservations. Though Prime Minister Sharon was quick to embrace the Tenet proposal, officials of his government said today that the timing for easing restrictions on Palestinian cities and villages and pulling back troops would depend on how well Mr. Arafat controlled the violence from his side of the dividing lines.
Even during the three decades that Israel controlled the entire West Bank there were sporadic outbreaks of violence, and achieving a total cessation of attacks seems extremely difficult given Palestinian factionalism and the deep resentments engendered in the last eight months.
Mr. Sharon has come under increasing pressure from West Bank settlers, who fear that the Palestinians will not observe the cease-fire. This morning a young Israeli woman was wounded in a shooting attack at the West Bank settlement of Ofra and a Greek Orthodox monk was shot dead outside Jerusalem late Tuesday.
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, the two militant organizations that have claimed responsibility for most of the attacks against Israel in recent months, rejected the American-backed cease-fire and Hamas vowed to continue the uprising.
Although the agreement requires Israel to ease the restrictions and reduce checkpoints within 48 hours, the extent will be decided by the Israelis and the new cease-fire commission.
The checkpoints and blockades are the most visible sign of the restrictions, which have brought economic progress to a virtual standstill in the West Bank and made everyday life difficult for those who live here.
The escalation of violence has toughened the attitude of most Palestinians toward Israel and made terrorist attacks more acceptable, according to a poll released on Tuesday by Bir Zeit University in Ramallah. The poll of 1,184 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip found that 75 percent supported suicide attacks against Israelis, up from 18 percent in 1994 when the Oslo peace talks began. Two-thirds of the interviews took place before the June 1 suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.
The poll found middle class Palestinians moving toward the hard-line views more often found among militants and younger people, with declining backing for peace talks.
"Our popular resistance should continue until we get rid of the last Israeli soldier in the West Bank and Gaza strip," Nazer Hamdan, a middle-aged businessman, said in an interview here this afternoon.

HEADLINE: Defense Dept. Panel Seeks Changes to Keep Military Personnel 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
An advisory panel to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that the military was losing too many of its most experienced and skilled people because of low pay, poor housing and rigid retirement rules, and it called for a sweeping overhaul of longstanding Pentagon personnel policies to stem the losses.
 The panel, which based its recommendations on a study by the RAND Corporation, also determined that black and Hispanic people will become the majority ethnic groups in the armed services within two decades, and it urged the Pentagon to begin aggressively promoting minorities into senior officer positions. 
 The panel, led by a retired admiral, David Jeremiah, concluded that the Pentagon's policies on a variety of issues, including pensions, retirement and relocation had not kept pace with major political and demographic changes in recent decades.
"What you have is a system that is basically 50 years old and has been Band-Aided over the years to accommodate different stresses and strains on it," Admiral Jeremiah said in a Pentagon news conference. "It needs to be looked at in a totality, restructured, and new proposals brought forward to change the way we do business." 
Admiral Jeremiah declined to provide an estimate on how much the panel's recommendations would cost. But he said that just making pay for midcareer officers competitive with equivalent private-sector jobs would cost billions of dollars. President Bush, who made military quality of life a major theme of his campaign last year, has already proposed adding $1.4 billion to the budget to improve military pay.
Although the panel's conclusions are advisory only, Mr. Rumsfeld has made it clear that he considers improvements in recruiting, retention and morale to be among his top priorities in the coming months. Mr. Rumsfeld's impending request to Congress to augment the 2002 Pentagon budget, for instance, is expected to be heavily weighted toward health care, building repairs, training and spare parts -- the kinds of unglamorous programs that can affect morale.
Many military experts and officials say that with all of the political and fiscal obstacles that Mr. Rumsfeld will face in trying to overhaul the Pentagon's war-fighting doctrine -- an effort that will probably involve contentious battles over weapons programs -- he may find it easier, less costly and less controversial to focus on improving quality of life for the troops.
There is, for one thing, bipartisan support in Congress for rebuilding housing, raising pay and improving health services for the troops. And there is a potential political payoff for the Bush administration, because those in the service are widely thought to vote heavily Republican.
"It's looking more and more likely that one of their major legacies could be to make the military more family friendly," said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer for the Lexington Institute, a military policy group. "Part of the appeal of changing personnel policies is that it costs relatively little money and it benefits people who vote."
Among its 64 recommendations to Mr. Rumsfeld, the panel called for revising the Pentagon's longstanding requirement that officers retire if they fail to be promoted after a certain number of years, a policy known as "up or out." 
"Here's a perfectly solid, well-serving officer who, because he's hit an age wicket, we say goodbye," Admiral Jeremiah said. "Why are we doing that?"
The RAND study also found that pay for midcareer military personnel tended to stagnate, falling significantly behind private-sector salaries for people with comparable education. Admiral Jeremiah said the panel recommended that future pay increases be targeted to people in that group, who typically have served between 10 and 20 years.
To improve housing, the panel recommended that the Pentagon move more aggressively to allow private companies to build off-base housing for troops, an idea that has strong support in the White House.
It also urged Congress to close unneeded military installations -- always a contentious issue on Capitol Hill, where bases are equated with jobs -- and to invest money in upgrading base facilities. To emphasize its point about decaying infrastructure, the panel cited the case of an F-15 fighter jet that suffered $185,000 in damage to its landing gear after breaking through a decrepit sewer grate near the runway.

HEADLINE: Essay; 
Bush Unifies Europe

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Western Europe was unified for two generations by a fear of the Soviet Union. Now that Russia's economy is dependent on high oil prices, its population plunging to half that of the U.S., and what's left of the Red Army mired in Chechnya, the glue holding together Europe's fragile supranational identity is resentment of the unrivaled power of the United States.
 Americans should not be offended at being the object of the unifying force of envy. As George W. (Don't Call Me Unilateralist) Bush does the New Grand Tour (Spain, Sweden, Poland and Slovenia rather than France, Germany and Britain), he supplies our allies with a necessary psychological substitute for their former fear. 
 Accordingly, ex-Trotskyites in France consider us barbarians for imposing the death penalty on a mass murderer, though more prisoners in French jails committed suicide in the past year than were executed in the U.S. And European greens recite their mantra that the U.S., with only 5 percent of the world's population, produces 25 percent of the pollutants -- though this is hardly surprising from the nation that produces 25 percent of the world's goods and services.
A pair of defense issues provide Europeans with a satisfying irritation with the U.S. One is their desire for a non-American "Rapid Deployment Force," even as European nations reduce their spending on defense. We see this as a bureaucratic device for them to use NATO assets without American participation in military decisions.
The other irritant is our desire to be able to defend ourselves against dozens of missiles coming into the hands of rogue nations. Though such basic defense would not affect the strategic balance between Russia and the U.S. (both nations have thousands of missiles to overwhelm any limited defense), Europeans have bought Vladimir Putin's line that any change in the cold-war deal might "lead to a new arms race." 
After all the posturing is over, here's the deal that may well be struck:
Americans strongly doubt that Europe will put up the money to pay for an independent force; such talk of a force independent of NATO will never amount to more than talk. Therefore, we'll withdraw our objection and smilingly wish them well -- provided they don't use NATO equipment or endanger U.S. troops.
For their part, many Europeans have fervently bought the notion that we're nowhere near developing a system that will shoot down incoming missiles, or that we will find it too expensive. Therefore, they will withdraw their objection to our withdrawal from the old ABM treaty and will patronizingly wish America well -- provided we promise to placate Putin and, on the off chance that we ever achieve what now seems technologically impossible, to use our missile shield to protect them.
Thus, with Europeans and Americans both saying "Sure, go ahead, it'll never get off the ground," we will strike a grand strategic bargain. It took shape at NATO in Brussels yesterday as some of our allies showed an interest in defending their own cities from nuclear blackmail. 
Because European expectations have been so contemptuously low, and because Bush has done serious homework, the new American president is likely to get a first-impression "bounce." That should serve him well in Saturday's non-summit in Slovenia with Putin. But Bush's performance will ultimately be rated not on his ability to project humility in meetings or plunge into affectionate crowds in Warsaw. 
Will he politely tell Putin that the ABM restrictions are a dead letter, and that we will pay no price in economic aid for his assent? Will he make clear that the U.S. never recognized the deal the Soviets made with the Nazis to swallow up the Baltic nations, and that Russia has no say in when Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia become members of NATO? Will he say that U.S. relations with Russia will reflect Putin's policy toward sales of technology into dangerous hands, toward brutality in Chechnya, toward his suppression of the press? 
Such unilateral honesty might bestir the resentment that unites many Europeans. But we can dispense with the blather about "personal chemistry" and the supposed value of "looking him in the eye." Only if Bush plainly asserts our national interests will his first foray to Europe be judged a success.

HEADLINE: Report Outlines the Abuse of Foreign Domestic Workers 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12 

 BODY:
When Juana Condori received the job offer back home in Bolivia, it seemed like a dream come true -- fly in an airplane for the first time, live in the United States, work for a diplomat.
 But after arriving in Washington to work as a nanny and housekeeper, Ms. Condori, now 33, began to feel like a prisoner. She said her employer, a diplomat with the Organization of American States, forced her to work seven days a week and did not let her leave the house unescorted. The diplomat's family, she said, took her passport, did not give her a house key, did not let her attend church. 
 During 16 months on the job, she said, she often worked 90 hours a week and was paid $220 a month, a fraction of the minimum wage.
"I was really excited about coming here," she said, "but now I see you suffer a lot in the United States."
Behind the glamour of Embassy Row are many unhappy stories like Ms. Condori's. In the past decade, more than 35,000 domestic workers, almost all of them young women, have received special visas to work for diplomats in Washington and New York City, often working far longer hours for far less pay than they were promised. 
Human Rights Watch, the human rights group, is to release a report on Thursday that accuses the United States government of doing too little to protect these workers.
"These domestic workers come to the United States to escape poverty in their countries of origin," the report states. "All too often, however, they become some of the world's most disadvantaged workers held captive by some of the world's most powerful employers."
The report, "Hidden in the Home: Abuse of Domestic Workers with Special Visas in the United States," found that these workers' median workday was 14 hours and that their median wage was $2.14 an hour, including room and board.
Human rights groups, immigrants rights groups and women's groups are seeking to pressure the State Department and international organizations like the World Bank and Organization of American States to do more to protect these workers, who usually have little idea of their rights or where to turn for help.
In interviews, these workers spoke of being slapped, yelled at and sexually assaulted. Some women have even filed lawsuits charging involuntary servitude, saying they were barred from leaving their employers' houses.
Lydia Altamirano, who left college in Nicaragua to work for an official with the Inter-American Development Bank, said she had to work every day for her first three years in Washington, often until midnight when the family gave dinner parties.
Hapsatou Sarr, a nanny and housekeeper from Mauritania, said she was never paid during nearly eight months of working for a World Bank official. She said she slept on the floor in a child's rooms. Her employer, she said, once slapped her because she forgot to give him a fork. 
She said that when she complained, the family often withheld food from her. She was not allowed outside by herself, she said, and the official's wife listened to her telephone conversations to make sure she was not planning to escape.
"I didn't know who to explain problems to," Ms. Sarr said. "I was feeling like I was going to kill myself every day." 
Many diplomats say that workers often exaggerate or fabricate abuses when they file lawsuits.
Paul Reichler, the lawyer for Edmundo Jarquin, the diplomat sued by Ms. Altamirano, said that her claims of overwork were false and that she was trying to blackmail the family.
The Human Rights Watch report concluded that a major cause of abuses was the special visa granted to these workers, which lets them remain in the United States only while working for a diplomat. Thus, the workers know that they can be deported if they quit.
"They can stay in the abusive situation or go back to their home country, which typically has very poor economic conditions, or they can leave their job and stay here undocumented," said Kimberley Propeack, a lawyer for Casa of Maryland, an immigrants rights group.
The report recommends that Congress give the workers the right to get new jobs if their employers violate wage and hours laws or abuse them. Noting that many diplomats sign contracts promising 40-hour workweeks and the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, Human Rights Watch also said the government should make adequate resources available to enforce those provisions. 
"You would think that because these workers follow the rules and come to the U.S. legally, the U.S. government would try to protect them from abuses," said Carol Pier, author of the report.
The visas "become coercive tools on the part of the employer," Ms. Pier said.
Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said, "We take this issue quite seriously." He said the department was urging diplomats to comply with labor laws and was notifying domestic workers of their rights when they applied for visas.
Confronted by accusations that its employees have abused their housekeepers, the World Bank requires its employees not to take away the workers' passports and to sign contracts guaranteeing the minimum wage. The bank also requires its employees and their domestic workers to attend seminars where the workers' rights are explained.
"There is a difficulty because these are not our employees," said John Donaldson, a World Bank spokesman. "They are employees of our employees. We expect our employees to abide by U.S. law."
Advocates for immigrants praise the World Bank's moves, but say that the bank and the International Monetary Fund should do more. For example, they said, the organizations should interview domestic workers about whether there are abuses.
In addition to her claims of labor violations, Ms. Condori said that an acquaintance of the family she worked for raped her, and that the diplomat, Jaime Aparicio, would not contact the police or arrange for her to see a doctor. 
She has charged him with violating wage laws, failing to provide her with medical care and covering up for the rapist.
Through a lawyer, the Aparicios denied Ms. Condori's accusations about wages and hours and said they had no knowledge of her rape claim.
Ms. Condori said she fled the Aparicio home and now cleans the house of a business executive. She said she hoped to return to Bolivia, once she saw her lawsuit through.
"I want to stay here until I make sure that the man who did this to me goes to jail," she said.

HEADLINE: California Signs Expensive Energy Deals 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, June 13 

 BODY:
California signed long-term electricity contracts at prices higher than those available on the daily market, state officials said today as they prepared to release details of the pacts between the state and power generators.
 But they said the contracts helped break the spiral that had driven electricity prices to record heights. 
 Critics said Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, was foolish for locking in long-term rates at the market's peak.
A spokesman for Governor Davis, Steve Maviglio, said the contracts would stabilize the fluctuating market, although at a cost that might exceed market prices in years to come.
The governor planned to release details of 38 long-term contracts between the state and power generators as early as Thursday. The contracts, valued at nearly $43 billion, could burden consumers with relatively high rates if the recent decline in electricity prices continues.
Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California at Irvine, said the Davis administration negotiated "from a position of severe weakness."

HEADLINE: Energy Agency Is Set to Monitor Prices in West 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to approve a plan proposed by Congressional Republicans that would significantly expand the agency's efforts to limit electricity prices in California and other Western states.
 The plan is part of the Republican response to a Democratic political offensive on energy, which both parties say could prove key in deciding control of the closely split House and Senate in elections next year. 
 Under a plan expected to be adopted on Monday during an extraordinary meeting of the federal agency's five commissioners, the regulatory body would begin monitoring and potentially curtailing all wholesale electricity prices that generating companies charge California and 10 nearby states. Currently, the agency seeks to limit electricity prices only in California and only when the state declares a power emergency because of acute shortages. 
Democrats have pressed the agency for months to do more to control electricity costs in California, where a shortage of power plants and a flawed wholesale electricity market have led to high prices. Some Democrats say that until California fixes its market, the agency should set prices based on each generator's cost of producing power. They are unlikely to be satisfied by the agency's latest price-monitoring plan.
The White House has steadfastly opposed price controls of any kind, saying they distort the market and worsen supply shortages. But some Congressional Republicans have taken a softer line and have urged federal regulators to battle what they say may be price gouging.
The proposal now before the agency is the result of a collaboration between House Republicans and Curt Hebert Jr., the Republican chairman of the commission, people involved with the plan said.
Many measures the agency is considering were first proposed by Representative Doug Ose, a California Republican, as a compromise between Democratic calls for aggressive price controls and a more laissez-faire Republican approach. A group of 17 House Republicans endorsed the ideas in a letter to Mr. Hebert this week.
The agency does not discuss pending orders, but several people at the agency said they fully expected the plan to reflect the main points suggested by the Republican legislators.
"This is a good plan because it inhibits bad behavior but relies on the economics of the market," said Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and who wrote the letter to Mr. Hebert. 
Mr. Hebert's apparent embrace of the Republican position on price mitigation may be part of an effort to cultivate support on Capitol Hill.
Vice President Dick Cheney has said that the Bush administration intends to name Pat Wood III, a former Texas regulator whom Mr. Bush recently named as a commissioner of the agency, to replace Mr. Hebert as chairman.
But Mr. Hebert counts Mr. Tauzin and Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader, as key supporters, and all three are eager to show they care about the situation in California, Republican aides said.
House Republicans have moved in other ways to blunt Democratic momentum on energy issues. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, set up a task force today to coordinate energy legislation in several committees. The goal is to pass a broad package containing many of the administration's energy priorities by July, a Republican aide said.
With several polls showing that Americans have grown wary of the administration's hands-off approach to energy prices, Democrats are promising relief. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, head of the Government Affairs Committee, held the first of two hearings on electricity markets today. Mr. Lieberman said he opposes price caps in general but supports controls in this case, arguing that without them, "We put our economy at risk."
The energy agency ruled late last year that California's electricity market had broken down and that power generators were no longer charging "just and reasonable" prices, a threshold for federal action. But the agency has moved to impose controls reluctantly.
Under pressure to act, the agency decided in March to monitor prices and order generators in California to pay refunds for electricity sales deemed overcharges, but only in Stage 3 emergencies, when supplies fall to within 1.5 percent of demand.
That action was broadened in late April, when the agency adopted a new formula that moderated prices whenever supplies fall to within 7.5 percent of demand. Even when it acts to review prices, the agency only limits prices above what it determines to be the highest costs of the least efficient generator serving the market, ensuring a hefty profit margin for most power companies.
If the commission votes to adopt the Republican plan, the agency would begin examining a larger universe of electricity sales. The plan would aim to discourage "megawatt laundering," in which power companies channel supplies to out-of-state marketers to avoid price control in California. Policing of prices would expand to the entire 11-state region that makes up the Western grid.
But the plan presents immense challenges to an agency that has had difficulties carrying out past price monitoring plans. And details remained vague today because the agency's staff members were still scrambling to figure out how it would work and had not yet circulated a plan for commissioners to examine.
The agency appears set to take its biggest steps to help California even as electricity prices there show signs of moderating. This week, prices on the state's spot market fell to less than $100 a megawatt-hour for the first time this year. Earlier in the year, prices often surpassed $300 a megawatt hour.
California officials credit several factors for the lower prices. The state has signed some long-term supply contracts with generators, easing its daily demand for power on the volatile spot market. And the supply has risen as generators complete maintenance programs to prepare plants for peak summer months. Natural gas prices, a key input for electricity generation, have also declined as the supplies rise nationally.
But federal regulators claim that their earlier price-mitigation plan, though limited in scope, helped to force generators to curtail prices.

KGA Shuts Its Doors After a 22-Year Run

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
KGA Advertising in Middletown, Conn., which at its height had more than 40 employees and billings estimated at $35 million from clients like Bob's Stores and Pilot Pen, has closed after about 22 years.
 "It's because the president and C.E.O. made a stupid mistake," said Ken Gronbach, who held those posts at KGA. 
"I wonder how many people admit their mistakes." The closing stemmed not from the slowing economy, Mr. Gronbach said, but from complications that arose after he bought the building in which the agency was housed. 
 After losing longtime clients like Bob's and Pilot, Mr. Gronbach said, KGA is closing with more than a dozen employees and billings estimated at $5 million from clients like the National Kidney Foundation. The closing was reported by the online edition of Adweek.

HEADLINE: Optimism Recedes as Europe Faces Long-Term Issues 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 13 

 BODY:
Confronted by ever more numerous signs of slower growth and rising prices, European leaders are once again brooding about long-term "speed limits" on their economies.
 Until a few months ago, European officials and private economists thought the Continent would expand faster than its long-term rate of about 2.5 percent a year. Governments had cut deeply into budget deficits, inflation had almost disappeared and excitement about a technology-driven "new economy" had taken hold among consumers and businesses. 
 But that optimism has receded sharply. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, warned in an interview today that Europe had yet to break out of its old rut, and that last year's relatively robust growth might have been "an exception rather than a new rule." 
The new economy has not yet arrived in Europe, he said, and it probably will not arrive until European governments clear away many of the regulations that hamstring markets for goods and labor.
"If we look at last year, we could think that a so-called new economy -- one with a lasting, higher rate of productivity growth -- had arrived," Mr. Duisenberg said, "but we have no evidence that that has happened in practice."
Last year was the first time in 13 years that European growth significantly exceeded the long-term speed limit, reaching 3.4 percent. Signs point to slower growth this year.
"The potential rate of growth certainly could be higher in Europe," Mr. Duisenberg said today. "But monetary policy can do nothing about that. That would involve eliminating many of the rigidities that still pervade the 12 market economies -- rigidities in labor markets, rigidities in product markets. And that is a long, drawn-out process."
Others share his pessimism. The Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels published a report on Monday concluding that European productivity has declined in the last six years and that "Europe's speed limit is unlikely to have increased very much."
Mr. Duisenberg and other central bank officials have become even more concerned by new signs of inflation, a plague Europe thought it had banished.
On Monday, the German government reported that consumer prices increased at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in May, the most in eight years. In France, which lately has had one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe, consumer prices jumped 2.5 percent in May.
The numbers were worse than analysts had expected, and central bank officials now predict more bad news to come: Figures for the 12 euro nations as a whole, scheduled for release later this month, are expected to show inflation over 3 percent, well above the European Central Bank's goal of 2 percent.
"We have some more months of bad inflation figures in front of us," Otmar Issing, the bank's chief economist, said on Tuesday.
Bank officials said that recent price increases stem mainly from factors outside their control: high oil prices; meat prices driven up by mad cow disease and foot-and-mouth disease; and the weak euro, which makes imports cost more.
But others wonder whether Europe may simply have reached its speed limit. 
"Could it be that the euro area cannot grow any faster than 2 to 2.5 percent without igniting inflation?" the Center for European Policy Studies asked in its report. "Are European labor markets so distorted that unemployment cannot fall much below 8 to 10 percent?"
Mr. Duisenberg, in his office atop the Eurotower headquarters of the European Central Bank, suggested that recent rises in the cost of oil and food would take longer to absorb than first thought. But he said the bank faced a difficulty in trying to communicate two seemingly conflicting messages: that inflation was still a concern, but that it would also probably moderate over the next year.
For a sustained improvement in European growth to take hold, Europe must change the way it works, he said, with more flexible work rules, greater competition and less government spending.
"We have a feeling it has happened to some extent in certain regions of Europe," he said, citing Ireland and the Netherlands. "And it happens in regions within regions -- in parts of France, for example. It may have happened in Bavaria. But it is not across the board."
Even so, he said, Europe will not sink into a recession and will grow faster in 2001 than the United States, for the first time in many years.
Early this year, Mr. Duisenberg said, the bank foresaw expansion in the 12 euro nations of 3 percent in 2001 and 2002, but that is now out of reach.

MORTON'S RESTAURANT PREDICTS LOSS FOR THE QUARTER

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Morton's Restaurant Group said yesterday that it expected a loss for the second quarter because of the weakening economy, higher operating costs and reduced business travel. 
Analysts had expected the company to post a profit of 34 cents to 44 cents a share in the second quarter, compared with a profit of 43 cents a year ago, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares fell $2.76 yesterday, or 9 percent, to $22.74. Morton's, based in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said it continued to experience "weak revenue trends," with sales at restaurants open at least a year off about 9.5 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Trenton Projects Shortfall Totaling Almost $1 Billion 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 13 

 BODY:
With just over two weeks to go until the deadline for New Jersey's next budget, the DiFrancesco administration acknowledged today that the state is facing a shortfall of nearly $1 billion.
 At a budget hearing in late May, the administration refused to provide legislators with updated tax revenue projections, saying economic conditions were too uncertain, even as independent fiscal monitors predicted a gap of nearly $1.6 billion. 
 Today, Acting Treasurer Peter R. Lawrance provided those updated estimates, reducing the combined tax revenue projections for 2001 and 2002 by $948 million. The reduced tax income means that Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and the State Legislature will have to scramble to cut spending for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. As it stands, the proposed budget is $23.2 billion. 
But even as the administration confirmed that New Jersey had to cut back, it showed continued reluctance to face questions from the Assembly Budget Committee. Tonight, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, the committee chairman, abruptly canceled a hearing scheduled for Thursday because Mr. Lawrance said he would not attend.
"I am disappointed that they will not appear," Mr. Lance said. "I will continue to work with the administration on a prudent, balanced budget." 
But the ranking Democrat on the committee, Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, said, "The administration is leaving New Jersey taxpayers in the dark and in a lurch with a mound of debt."
A spokesman for the Treasury Department, Dan Bledsoe, said Mr. Lawrance considered the hearing unnecessary. "The treasurer doesn't see a need to testify before the committee," Mr. Bledsoe said. "He spelled out his revenue figures. The figures are what they are."
At the Budget Committee's last hearing in late May, officials in the Office of Legislative Services, which provides independent budget analysis, said the state would face a shortfall of nearly $1.6 billion next year.
Alan R. Kooney, the legislative budget officer, said the agency stood by its prediction. "The estimates that we made in late May were done very carefully, and nothing has happened since that time that would lead us to raise any of our revenue estimates," he said, noting that the economic outlook had not improved.
The revenue estimates for the current fiscal year presented by Mr. Lawrance today were actually $42 million lower than the estimates by the Office of Legislative Services. And his numbers are based on figures that are more up-to-date.
But the administration differed sharply with the independent monitors over state income tax revenue for next year. Mr. Lawrance projected income tax revenue in 2002 of $8.61 billion, compared with $8.16 billion projected by the Office of Legislative Services. 
Treasury officials did not offer any detailed explanation for the difference in the projections. Tom Wilson, a spokesman for the acting governor, said Mr. DiFrancesco planned to meet with legislative leaders on Thursday to revise the budget.

HEADLINE: Some Russians Are Alarmed At Tighter Grip Under Putin 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 13 

 BODY:
It is not an easy thing to quantify, much less to prove. But among intellectuals and advocates of a democratic Russia in the Western mode, a gnawing concern is arising that the relative freedom from state surveillance and restriction that citizens have relished in the last decade may be drawing to a close.
 Supplanting it is a resurgent government obsession with internal security and threats from abroad -- a phenomenon that they say has set off a limited but growing crackdown on supposed challenges to the state. 
 The evidence itself is scattered. It ranges from a string of arrests of Russian scholars, to the revival of old curbs on international scientific cooperation, to the seeming harassment of some political critics and dissidents, to a growing conviction among some intellectuals that their telephones are again being tapped and their e-mail read. 
As much as any crackdown, what unsettles them is the failure of President Vladimir V. Putin, himself a product of the state security machine, to restrain or even speak out against it.
"It has not yet acquired the scope which would go deep under the skin of ordinary Russians. They have known much worse," Georgi Arbatov, the director emeritus of the government's Institute of U.S.A.-Canada Studies and a veteran analyst of East-West relations, said in an interview. "But there are some not very good signs.
"Having become the leader of this country, he has to explain that he does not want to return to some past practices. The sooner he dispels all these rumors, the better."
Never far from the surface of these concerns, of course, is the memory of Russia's seven decades as a rigid and ruthless police state. Virtually no one believes that a return to those days is either contemplated or even possible; whatever the flaws in Russia's justice system and its press, most Russians, though not all, enjoy basic civil liberties.
The Kremlin proposed judicial reforms this month that should underpin those liberties if carried out.
But Mr. Putin himself has rung alarm bells by suggesting that Russia requires what he calls a "managed democracy" headed by a strong central government. Over the Kremlin's insistence that it is irrevocably dedicated to basic freedoms, some liberals here call that a euphemism for authoritarian rule.
Top government posts have increasingly been filled by veterans of the military and intelligence, agencies that clung to a cold-war notion of security even in Russian democracy's most liberal days.
Many liberals question whether those and other officials, often steeped for decades in the Soviet bureaucracy before making quick changes in ideologies and jobs, have put the paranoia and xenophobia of Communist days behind them.
"They do just what they have been taught to do," said Sergei Kovalyov, a dissident who survived imprisonment in the infamous Perm-36 gulag in Siberia and is now in Parliament. "It's the only thing they can do. And that's why there is nothing surprising in the way they understand order in this country and what kind of order they are going to bring."
In the eyes of Mr. Kovalyov and other activists, a flurry of events in the last year are evocative of a dormant era when all outsiders were viewed as potential enemies -- and challenging the established order could easily make one an outsider.
Some of those events, like the military's insistence that the nuclear submarine Kursk was probably sunk 10 months ago by a collision with a foreign sub spying on naval war games, amount to little more than words. Others have more serious consequences.
Only today the Federal Security Service's Omsk regional office announced that it had reprimanded Elizabeth Sweet, an American lecturer at the State University of Omsk, after counterintelligence officers learned that she had asked students to examine the economic health of local businesses. Most of the region's industry is military-related.
The security service said that such information could harm the image and competitiveness of businesses if published abroad, but it stopped short of expelling Ms. Sweet. It said, though, that the renewal of her teaching contract was now in doubt.
In Kaluga, 85 miles west of Moscow, Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military analyst at the Institute of U.S.A.-Canada Studies, Mr. Arbatov's old agency, is on trial for high treason, accused of passing state secrets. 
International scientific organizations and Mr. Sutyagin's colleagues call the proceeding a sham, noting that he had no access to classified information. The charges appear based on his acceptance of a contract with a London consulting firm to write military analyses.
In Krasnoyarsk, in southern Siberia, a university scientist was charged with high treason in April for fulfilling a contract with a Chinese company to supply research on shielding satellites from radiation. His colleagues said the information was based on documents declassified 10 years ago.
In Vladivostok, a military court is beginning a second trial of Grigory Pasko, a military journalist accused of treason after helping Japanese television journalists report on the Russian naval fleet's dumping of nuclear waste at sea. Mr. Pasko was acquitted on the same charge in 1999; the Supreme Military Collegium ordered a retrial this year.
Civil rights advocates disclosed last week that the Russian Academy of Sciences had ordered scientists and their supervisors to restrict contacts with outsiders, report on trips abroad and submit potentially sensitive scientific papers for prepublication review, among other curbs.
The academy has not commented on the rules, some of which are said to apply only to classified scientific work and others to all scientists. Privately, civil liberties advocates here say similar restrictions have been put in place in other government agencies that have regular contact with foreigners.
Right or wrong, many intellectuals and activists now take it as a given that their telephone conversations and e-mail are monitored -- something that, while surely not unthinkable, was hardly a major concern even two or three years ago.
Since 1995, Russian law has required all telephone and Internet services to maintain devices that allow the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet evolution of the K.G.B., to monitor any and all transmissions. The service is required to seek a warrant before conducting a wiretap, but because it wields almost complete control over the process, it is not known how rigidly that requirement is followed.
The United States government has recently advised certain private entities that maintain regular contact with Russian officials, academics or businesses to assume that the Russians are monitoring all conversations.
Leaders of Yabloko, one of the political parties that promote Western-style democratic values, worried at a meeting in St. Petersburg on Saturday that Russia was becoming a society with the trappings of freedom, but controlled in reality from the top.
The Union of Right Forces, the other major liberal party, has publicly expressed concern of late that Russia could become a liberal economic state controlled by an authoritarian leadership.
Still, many in Russia's democratic elite are reluctant to tie the resurgence of suspicion and security measures directly to Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent who was director of the Federal Security Service not six months before becoming president.
The more benevolent view is that his ascension has been read by Russia's security organs as a green light to return to old habits -- or that the crackdown is a ham-handed attempt by midlevel bureaucrats to curry favor with the new president.
"During the 90's they were on the periphery of the establishment," said Igor Bunin, the head of Moscow's nonpartisan Center for Political Technologies. "Suddenly, they were all taken inside, right into the core of it. And they all decided that they have to prove that they are in demand, that they are needed by the state."
What is very likely under way, Mr. Bunin said, is a spate of muscle-flexing by the old crowd that has returned to control in some of the most powerful cabinet agencies.
"It also must be admitted that nobody has tried to cool them down and tell them they shouldn't be too zealous about it," he added.
That troubles many democratic and civil-rights advocates most of all. Many, though hardly all, of the best-known incidents involve the Federal Security Service -- the closest modern equivalent to the domestic arm of the K.G.B. that once weeded dissenters and wrong-thinkers out of Soviet society and into gulags.
By not speaking out, they say, Mr. Putin has tacitly endorsed actions that seem devised to send a public message that there are limits to challenging the state and to consorting with the potential enemy.
"Some people are concerned," Mr. Arbatov said. "And it's not good. I think with the history we have, you cannot play games with such issues."
One who knows that history well is Sergei Grigoryants, another prominent dissident, who spent 10 years in Soviet prison camps in the 1970's and 1980's and who has been a fierce critic of the reluctant way that Russia has introduced democracy.
On June 4, he publicly accused the Federal Security Service of harassing Russian youth groups that did not display government-approved ideological bents. Two days later, after passing customs, passport and security controls at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, he was approached by some 10 security officers as he sat in a boarding lounge, awaiting a flight to Washington. He was taken away and interrogated for five hours and his airline ticket and $3,000 in cash were seized.
The next day he made his trip to Washington. In a telephone interview from Washington, he insisted that he had violated no rules, but that when he arrived home from the airport he was unable to make telephone calls and that when his Washington host called him, the line went dead in midconversation. 
Michael McFaul, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who had invited Mr. Grigoryants to a Washington seminar discussing Russia's decade of independence, was the caller. In an interview, he said the incident fit a pattern of increasing surveillance and harassment.
"As for what has concretely happened, the incidents are few," he said. "But the atmosphere they have created is one of paranoia." People were now worrying about what would happen to them, he said, adding: "They have a lot more to lose now. It's amazing how fear can make you do certain things."

Bloomberg's Challenge: Be a '93 Giuliani, but in '01

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Of all the candidates seeking to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, no one is trying to tie himself as closely to the outgoing mayor as Michael R. Bloomberg.
 He repeatedly praises Mr. Giuliani's tenure and has largely modeled his candidacy on Mr. Giuliani's first successful run for office. Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers look to the electoral success of Mr. Giuliani -- a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, a man who had never held elective office -- as a reason for confidence in what might otherwise seem a slightly far-fetched candidacy. 
 "Nothing has really changed," said David Garth, who was Mr. Giuliani's chief consultant in 1993 and who is serving in the same capacity for Mr. Bloomberg this year. "Nobody knew Rudy Giuliani. Nobody knows Mike Bloomberg. He was a dynamic prosecutor. Bloomberg is a dynamic industrialist."
Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Giuliani are indeed both iconoclastic Republicans with distinctive careers and credentials, running as outsiders against familiar figures of the Democratic establishment.
But that may be about as far as it goes. These are very different men, running in very different times, and in a city that is changing politically in ways that most politicians are only beginning to understand.
To a limited extent, these changes may work to Mr. Bloomberg's advantage. It is not as odd as it was a decade ago for a Democrat in New York City to consider voting for a Republican for mayor, one of the legacies Mr. Giuliani has left for Mr. Bloomerg (or for Herman Badillo, should he defeat Mr. Bloomberg in the Republican primary).
In addition, many old-line Democratic voters -- the kind of loyal Democrats who prompted Mr. Giuliani to seek the Liberal Party line so they would have a place to vote for him -- are being displaced on the voting rolls by first-generation immigrants. Their party loyalties are not so deeply rooted as the ethnic Democratic constituencies, from blacks to Jews to the Irish, who once made up the building blocks of New York's mayoral race.
What is more, Republican and Democratic strategists say that partisan considerations have been increasingly supplanted in mayoral elections, even in New York, by more fundamental questions of competence and management ability.
"There aren't any partisan elections here anymore," said Kevin McCabe, the former chief of staff to one of the Democratic candidates, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker. That is particularly obvious this year, when there is no crisis commanding the attention of voters.
So it was that even before Mr. Bloomberg got into this race, his Democratic opponents -- notably, Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, and Mark Green, the public advocate -- had based their campaign appeal on their experience and competence. Advisers to Mr. Bloomberg say his single biggest selling point is his record as an entrepreneur.
Still, there are some substantial differences between now and 1993 that have led many politicians to argue that Mr. Bloomberg would be making a mistake if he tried to win simply by repeating Mr. Giuliani's campaign of that year. The differences range include the particular electoral circumstances that permitted Mr. Giuliani's narrow victory over Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1993, like a Staten Island secession referendum that produced a spike in Republican voters, and changes in electoral forces that appear to be guiding this election and the way the Democratic candidates are approaching it.
"It's a totally different race," said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor, who is supporting Mr. Vallone in this election. "Giuliani became mayor by 2 percent of the vote, reversing an earlier defeat by 2 percent because David Dinkins was not worthy of a second term. The only way he can win is to take strong positions that he believes in and that makes sense and that are not run of the mill."
In 1993, voters chose Mr. Giuliani as the right man for the right time. He was a prosecutor who defeated Mr. Dinkins, a mayor who seemed overwhelmed by events, in a charged and nervous city alarmed by a crime rate that seemed out of control.
Mr. Bloomberg has sought to make both his experience as a successful businessman and the condition of the city's schools his equivalent issue this year. But even his supporters acknowledge that in doing so, Mr. Bloomberg is joining a long line of Democratic candidates. More than that, Mr. Bloomberg and education do not seem to go so well together as Mr. Giuliani and crime.
"The environment is totally different," said Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College. "Crime is down. There is no compelling issue. And Bloomberg's story doesn't work -- a successful businessman who built a billion-dollar industry? His story doesn't fit the time."
What is more, at least three of the Democrats -- Mr. Green, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone -- have clearly taken some lessons from Mr. Giuliani's years in office and his back-to-back victories over Mr. Dinkins and Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president.
They are running campaigns that emphasize issues like police protection and the quality of life, and are far more moderate in tone than any Democrat since Mr. Koch.
Unless Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president who has run a more traditional Democratic campaign, wins his party's nomination, even Mr. Bloomberg's advisers acknowledge that he would have a hard time doing to his Democratic opponent what Mr. Giuliani succeeded in doing to Mr. Dinkins.
"Now I think the entire Democratic Party is more moderate," said Mitchell Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University and a paid adviser to Mr. Bloomberg.
Bill Lynch, who was Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager, said Mr. Giuliani had also had the advantage of a previous run, in 1989, against Mr. Dinkins, and four years to prepare for the rematch. 
"Rudy spent four years working his base, when we were in City Hall," Mr. Lynch recalled. "And when the economy went south, there wasn't much we could do to get people's attention. We got hurt by some of the bad stuff that went on there. And he took advantage of that."
There are other practical difficulties as well. Aside from crime, Mayor Dinkins had alienated many Jewish voters over the Crown Heights disturbances. The Staten Island secession vote, Mr. Lynch estimated, brought out as many as 40,000 extra votes for Mr. Giuliani in 1993.
And Mr. Bloomberg failed to win the Liberal Party line the way Mr. Giuliani had. The party provided Mr. Giuliani with only 62,469 votes in 1993, but it had offered a way for Democrats to support Mr. Giuliani, a Democrat who had just turned Republican.
Mr. Garth acknowledged the advantages that Mr. Giuliani had had, calling them "legitimate breaks."
Mr. Garth asserted that Mr. Bloomberg had the advantage of both his professional business record and, he noted wryly, one other potentially important weapon: a large fortune to finance his campaign.

To the Editor:
 Re "President Facing Skeptical Europe on Trip This Week" (front page, June 11): 
 If American policy on various matters is regarded by the European Union as a challenge to European values and interests, the same United States policy may be acknowledged as a chance for change and hope by other countries, like Poland, Slovenia, the Baltic states, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
On Friday, President Bush will deliver an important speech on Europe not in Paris or Berlin, but in Warsaw. 
Although Poland is aspiring to become a member of the European Union, the vital interests of Poland and many other countries in eastern, central and northeastern Europe are still harmonious with the foreign policy goals of the United States government. 
And to some extent, the economic policy of the United States is much more attractive to Poland and other European countries than the bureaucratic policies of Brussels. 
Therefore, "Euro-skepticism" toward the trip of the American president could be said to be limited to the major states of the European Union.

HEADLINE: Bush Aide With Intel Stock Met With Executives Pushing Merger 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
President Bush's top adviser, Karl Rove, who owned more than $100,000 of stock in Intel Corporation, met in March with the company's chief executive and two lobbyists as they pushed for federal approval of a corporate merger. The administration approved the deal less than two months later.
 White House officials said that Mr. Rove referred the executives to others in the administration and that he played no part in the approval. The officials said Mr. Rove did not recall raising the issue with the president. 
 "He offered no advice or counsel with regard to this decision," said Dan Bartlett, a White House spokesman. Mr. Rove continued to receive copies of correspondence from Intel and its trade group until the decision was made in early May, documents show.
Mr. Rove sold all of his stock last Thursday, unloading a portfolio of holdings in defense, technology, energy and banking companies valued at between $1 million and $2.5 million.
Some legal experts said Mr. Rove should have removed himself from the discussion with Intel to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest under federal ethics laws. Those laws prohibit an official with an economic interest in a decision from participating in recommendations, advice or rulings.
Intel's chief lobbyist, Jim Jarrett, said that he, another lobbyist and the company's chief executive, Craig Barrett, met separately on March 12 with Mr. Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney at the White House. The meetings, requested by Intel, also covered Mr. Bush's energy, tax cut and education plans and were "quite useful" in the effort to win federal approval of the merger between one of Intel's United States suppliers and a Dutch company, Mr. Jarrett said.
The deal was subject to government approval because it involved foreign ownership of a United States computer company whose sensitive technology is relied upon by the military.
"I don't know that you can say that any one meeting tips the balance, but certainly when the C.E.O. comes to call and makes this one of his priorities, it demonstrates to him that we think it's important," Mr. Jarrett said.
Company executives said that they were unaware that Mr. Rove owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Intel stock at the time. 
The only way Mr. Rove could have avoided violating federal ethics laws was "if he were truly mute and he offered no comment then or later" on the Intel matter, said Stephen Gillers, a professor of law at New York University.
Creating a blind trust or divesting months earlier should have been a "no-brainer," said Sheldon Cohen, who set up the first presidential blind trust, in 1963, for President Lyndon Johnson.
A White House spokeswoman, Anne Womack, said that Mr. Rove decided last December to sell his stocks but was advised in January by the Bush transition counsel, Fred Fielding, that he should wait. Ms. Womack said that Mr. Fielding suggested the White House counsel's office should obtain a government certificate of divestiture that would allow Mr. Rove to defer paying capital gains taxes on the stock sales.
White House officials said the request for the certificate was delayed because the counsel's office was inundated with the work of a new administration, like arranging security clearances for nominees and developing employee ethics standards.
During that time, the value of Mr. Rove's stock fell about 20 percent and then recovered. An Associated Press analysis of stock prices indicates the stocks that Mr. Rove valued on his ethics form last December at between $1.2 million and $2.8 million had dropped in value to between $896,000 and $2.2 million by mid-March. At the time he sold, they were between $1 million and $2.5 million.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL; 
Two Goliaths, And Neither Is the Bad Guy

BYLINE:  By Mike Wise 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Within 55 seconds of the opening tip, Shaquille O'Neal wheeled his dump-truck frame into the key, Dikembe Mutombo backpedaled to keep up with his counterpart, and the two largest men left standing in the N.B.A. collided in midair.
 More than a Kobe Bryant runner or an Allen Iverson 3-point bomb, two powerful O'Neal dunks very likely swung the pendulum in the league championship series, two displays of ferocity that shook the backboard support and the confidence of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
 The immovable object climbing over the irresistible force set the tone in the Lakers' 100-86 victory in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals.
O'Neal, on his way to a second straight Most Valuable Player award in the league championship series, went into the Land of Mutombo and did not wince. He ended with 34 points, 14 rebounds and 5 assists, providing all the brute force and skill needed for his team to grab a three-games-to-one lead. 
When the 76ers ignited the First Union Center with a dramatic run in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to 7 points, O'Neal came out of a timeout and dunked again, another thunderous slam with less than nine minutes left.
"The big guy makes everybody better," Ron Harper said. "During that timeout when they made their run, he said: 'Give me the ball. If you guys move your feet, I'll get you some shots.' Shaq wanted it."
Mutombo was more than decent. With 7 minutes 17 seconds remaining in the third quarter and the 76ers trying to crawl back, he brushed aside the Laker frontline and dunked ferociously himself. 
Finishing with 19 points on 9-of-11 shooting and 9 rebounds, he did what he could under adverse conditions, and managed to hold his own against O'Neal on many possessions.
He did not put stock in the notion that O'Neal's power had somehow emasculated the 76ers. 
"Any basket counts 2 points," Mutombo said. "All you can do when you play against someone is fight through him and try to keep him from getting close to the basket. He's a great player.
"He's going to get his dunks, regardless. No one ever say, 'Mutombo will step on the floor and Shaq won't get his dunks.' "
They kept doing this dance, using their pivot feet and their right forearms, their hips and their wrists, a waltz for men over 7 feet tall.
Not since Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing battled in 1994 or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish did in the 1980's have two perennial All-Star centers met in the finals, and now they have only one game left.
On and off the floor, the theater will be missed.
Bill Walton, the Hall of Fame center and NBC analyst, said: "It's a thing of beauty to have two top-flight centers playing in the finals again. Everybody always says, 'You don't need a great center.' But during the Jordan era, Michael and 6-foot-6 guys controlled the basket area. It's part of why the Bulls were so great. Now you've got legitimate 7-footers, and it adds a different dimension."
Before they renewed their duel last night, the O'Neal-Mutombo matchup had been heightened by rhetoric on both sides, the two waging a competitive yet entertaining battle in the news media.
Shaq says Dikembe flops. Deek, the nickname Mutombo is referred to by friends and teammates, says O'Neal is just frustrated because he has had it easy until now.
And yet, beyond the chatter, the economical use of the pivot foot -- beyond the hyperbole and the technique -- there is something more. It's less a good vs. evil matchup than Deek, the intellectual do-gooder, against Shaq, Earth's biggest goofball. Mutombo is so much more than his steel-tipped elbows; O'Neal more than his pulverizing dunks.
"Nobody loves Goliath," the late Wilt Chamberlain once said. He probably never saw these two work a crowd.
They battle on the court, but at some point in their lives they both learned to use the game as a tool to help others, not just themselves.
O'Neal has been comedy relief the past week, busting up the news media with his humor. On Tuesday, he smiled as only a 5-year-old trying to impress his relatives at a summer cookout could. "You guys like my quotations," he said. "I'm very quotatious."
Quotatious could hardly compare to Mutombo's gem, which won the interview title the same day. In referring to the Lakers' first three playoff opponents as easy, Mutombo said they were "like a walk in the cake." 
From the man who speaks five languages, it was a well thought-out malapropism. And if it was not, we can hardly wait for, "You can't have your park and eat it too."
When Walton began his career in the 1970's, few teams had 7-footers on their roster. Before people around the globe routinely grew past 6-11, Chamberlain, Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell were viewed as somewhat freakish. All the gawking, the incessant "How's the weather up there?" refrains. 
"I was the worst," Walton said. "I couldn't speak, I had this horrendous stuttering problem and I was unwilling to share any of my thoughts about the opponent because I thought it might hurt me. I treated them like the enemy."
So Shaq and Deek went elbow-to-elbow in Game 4, trading shots, shoves and hard fouls before the Lakers pulled away for good. If their footwork and their contrasting styles were on display, so, too, were their personas -- Goliaths worth embracing, appreciated for more than their ability to play basketball.
"I told you all I was coming back with vengeance," O'Neal said. "That's just the type of guy I am. Sorry."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
One Love, One Heart, Or a Sweatshop Economy?

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
The term "globalization" is so tinged with rosy one-world optimism that it's easy to assume the essential benignity of an economic philosophy whose name vaguely connotes unity, equality and freedom. But as Stephanie Black's powerful documentary "Life and Debt" illustrates with an impressive (and depressing) acuity, globalization can have a devastating impact on third world countries. The movie offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that I've ever seen on a movie or television screen.
 "Life and Debt," which opens the Human Rights Watch Film Festival this evening at the Walter Reade Theater and continues its run on Saturday at Cinema Village, focuses on the deeply troubled economy of Jamaica and how that country's long-term indebtedness to international lending organizations have contributed to the erosion of local agriculture and industry. 
 Far from being a dry exegesis crammed with graphs, pie charts and talking heads spewing abstract mumbo-jumbo, the film goes directly to the farmers and factory workers whose livelihoods have been undermined. In basic everyday language, they explain how high interest rates have helped devalue the local currency, raising prices for their produce and permitting wealthier countries to import the same products and sell them more cheaply.
The hard-nosed lending policies of organizations like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank may not deliberately set out to undermine fragile third world economies dependent on their aid. But as the movie shows, the market forces that operate once these organizations become involved are an economic form of Darwinism. The fittest economies prosper while the weaker ones tend to be snared in an endless and escalating cycle of debt repayment that eventually erodes the debtor country's economic base. The banks' lending policies are, of course, determined by the wealthier countries, especially the United States and those of Western Europe.
These dry economic realities are leavened by the cool, ironic lyricism of a voice-over narration by Jamaica Kincaid, who adapted the text from her nonfiction book, "A Small Place." Adopting the alluringly soothing tone of a subversive tour guide, Ms. Kincaid informs potential tourists of the things that will be hidden from sight should they visit Jamaica.
"When you sit down to eat your delicious meal, it's better that you don't know that most of what you are eating came off a ship from Miami," she says.
That's just one of a long list of things she mentions -- from primitive hotel sewage systems that empty directly into the ocean to the dire poverty of Kingston's slums -- that all but the most intrepidly curious visitors to the country will not see. Recurring through the film are unsettling images of jolly, overfed American tourists engaged in activities like beer-drinking contests in Jamaica's luxury hotels.
One result of the country's crumbling economy is the vulnerability to exploitation of Jamaica's needy labor force. A segment about Jamaica's free trade zones introduces us to workers who toil five or six days a week in near-sweatshop conditions for the legal minimum wage of $30 a week sewing garments for American manufacturers. No unionization is permitted in these foreign-owned garment factories where shiploads of material arrive tax-free for assembly before being transported back to foreign markets. Those who dare to make waves are fired.
The movie visits a plant that used to sell high-quality chickens for Jamaican consumption but whose business has been undermined by the dumping of cheaper, low-grade chicken parts from the United States under the guise of free trade. And until recently, Jamaica's banana industry flourished thanks to an agreement with Britain allowing a tax-free import quota. But through the World Trade Organization, the United States has protested the agreement, forcing Jamaica to compete with multinational corporations based in Central and South America where labor is cheaper.
These are just a few of the stories told in a film that despite all the bad news it delivers refuses to raise its voice. Among the prominent Jamaicans interviewed the most eloquent voice belongs to Michael Manley, the former prime minister who reluctantly signed some of the agreements that have damaged the country's economy.
Speaking more in sorrow than in anger, he acknowledges that his country made mistakes along the way. But the overall impression left by this devastating film is of the global economy as a dog-eat-dog world where the usual culprits, the United States and its multinational corporate clients, have the advantage.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ABCD: A COLLECTION OF ART BRUT," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-7170 (through July 22). Memorably vivid and widely abused, the phrase Art Brut (meaning raw or rough art) was coined in the 1940's by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. This exhibition, drawn from the holdings of a Paris-based foundation, tries to reinstate his original meaning, revisiting the amazing pantheon of artists who inspired it and proposing some additions. Its many highlights include works by acknowledged greats like Adolf Wolfli, Aloise Corbaz, Henry Darger and Augustin Lesage, but the show also introduces many equally riveting artists unfamiliar to American audiences. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. The show is pervaded by an elegance, an economy of form and a sensitivity to materials that is both intensely spiritual and protomodern. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but there is no low. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Smith).

* AFRICAN GALLERIES, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (on long-term view). The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country. Just a few years ago, 250 objects from the permanent collection were installed in revamped first-floor galleries; now two dozen pieces have been added and the space has been redesigned again, this time with multicolored walls, mural-size color photographs, documentary films and ambient sound. Added works expand the definition of African to include both Morocco and ancient Nubia. And the overall selection, from familiar friends to treasures recently acquired, is thrilling. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter)

* "AFRICAN, OCEANIC AND ANCIENT AMERICAN ART: RECENT ACQUISITIONS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 28). One of the best new group shows in the city -- stimulating to mind and eye -- is sitting smack in the middle of the Michael C. Rockefeller wing at the Met, and you've probably never seen the like of much of what's in it. The 70 pieces all came to the Met as gifts or purchases over the last five years. They take many forms, from devotional icons to notebook drawings to Sunday-best hats, and they span centuries and continents, from a tiny Mexican ceramic mask made around the ninth century B.C. to a hummingbird-colored silk mantle woven in Madagascar in 1998. A bottom line to such diversity? Almost everything here was meant to have some contact with the human body: to be worn, carried, caressed. This is art with the velvet ropes down. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "WILLIAM BLAKE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 24). A touching and beautiful show if you have a taste for Blake's art, which strives for ecstatic revelation on the level of his famous visions and rises to the heights of his verse, sometimes. From the Age of Aquarius to New Age, he has come to serve as the patron saint of flower children, Jungians, Freudians, occultists, spiritualists, nudists, unpublished authors, animal lovers, socialists and teenagers of the sort who read Hermann Hesse. By turning our attention to his laborious illustrations and watercolors, the exhibition compels us to think about him as a serious and original visual artist, which is to say as a more idiosyncratic and substantial figure than the cliches suggest. He truly believed that the world was ending and that he had been sent to set things right at the last minute. Whatever else he may or may not have been, Blake was the most genuine and uncompromising artist you can think of. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).

"MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Oct. 14). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancee Bella Rosenfeld and then hurry back to the French capital. Instead World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest work. The 60 artworks here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and 65+ ($2 surcharge for "Chagall") (Smith).

* "EL GRECO: THEMES AND VARIATIONS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through July 29). This gemlike single-digit exhibition (just seven canvases) outweighs some of the more grandiose shows in New York museums at the moment. It brings together, mostly for the first time, four versions of the artist's tumultuous "Purification of the Temple," which provide a vivid timeline of his transcultural development, and three versions of his resonant portrait of St. Jerome as a cardinal, which were all painted toward the end of his life when he skillfully copied -- always with interesting differences -- his works for private patrons. The show makes its small oval gallery reverberate with thoughts about painting: as craft, thought, commodity and lifelong pursuit. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 62+ (Smith).

* "FREESTYLE," Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through June 24). Spring in New York brings new-talent museum surveys, and this spring, "Freestyle" is the one to catch. The museum's curator, Thelma Golden, working with Christine Y. Kim, has brought together 28 young or youngish black artists from across the country, some of whom are appearing here for the first time. The show is, for the most part, punchy to look at (painting dominates), full of ideas and, with the intriguingly complex notion of a "post-black art" in the air, completely of this American moment. Not to be missed is the spicy magazine-style catalog with essays by some of the best young art curators and critics around. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 62+ (Cotter)

* "FRANK GEHRY, ARCHITECT," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Aug. 26). A full-dress retrospective that showcases history unfolding, even as we walk through it. Mr. Gehry has shown that even in architecture, a form notoriously resistant to creativity, it is possible not only to realize a personal vision but also to gain wide public support for it. The show is a tribute to the ideal of service: to an art form, to the city and to the continuous reconstruction of a democratic way of life. Nothing, not even familiarity with Mr. Gehry's buildings, can prepare you for the impact of seeing his work presented in Frank Lloyd Wright's magnificent rotunda. The energy hits you on entering the show and increases as you proceed. Hours: Fridays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and 65+ (Herbert Muschamp).

"LEON GOLUB: PAINTINGS, 1950-2000," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 19). Now 79, Mr. Golub is best known for paintings done in the 1970's and 80's, raw, awkward figurative works that seek to illuminate his basic theme, man's inhumanity to man. They include huge, engulfing canvases of Vietnam War scenes, riots, interrogations, death squads, racial face-offs and other grim tableaus in which power confronts the powerless. The set piece here is the enormous "Vietnam II" (1973), whose cinematic-scale canvas depicts two groups of figures, a trio of soldiers and a tank pointing guns at a scraggly group of terrified Vietnamese, led by a young man screaming. As a graphic rendering of might asserting its rights over weakness, it delivers its message with impact. Recently he has dwelt with wit more on philosophical themes, referring often to the frailty of the individual and the inevitable end. Whatever the infelicities of his style, he has steadfastly stuck to his role as witness to the world's evil workings. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* WILLIAM KENTRIDGE, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 16). By way of drawings and film animations, Mr. Kentridge addresses in searing images South Africa and its racial problems, along with the longings and frustrations of bourgeois lives played out in the country's deeply dysfunctional setting. The exhibition begins with his jarring "Shadow Procession" (1999), a ragtag parade of silhouetted moving images projected on a big screen, which evokes the displaced and dispossessed who haunt not only South Africa but the history of the world. At the heart of the show are his drawings and the short animated films he makes of them, in which the process shares importance with the content. Many of the films contrast the lives of two antiheroes, one a crude rapacious businessman, the other a sensitive artist, in compelling medleys of images that touch on the personal and the political. Departing from this format is "Ubu Tells the Truth" (1997), a highly charged satire based on the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 1995 to investigate human rights abuses during the apartheid era. It's not often that good art is shaped from such raw angry material, but Mr. Kentridge's powers of invention are equal to the challenge. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Glueck).

* "MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Aug. 19). From Michelangelo to Louise Bourgeois, from Rembrandt to Franz Kline, this cornucopia of drawings from one of the most important collections in the United States bristles with the work of stellar talents. A standout is a double-sided drawing in red chalk by Michelangelo, probably done around 1510-1511. One side reveals the trouble he had sketching a foot that fits the position of a youthful male nude on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the other shows the headless nude itself, a powerful, ingeniously posed figure that emphasizes the sculptor's magnificent grasp of anatomical rendering. A rare compositional drawing by Fra Filippo Lippi, a subtly toned landscape by Claude Lorrain, a scene of battling horses by Gericault, a stately portrait by Ingres, one of Seurat's brilliant black crayon drawings of a French vaudeville scene, and works by Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are among the highlights. The 20th-century American group is something of a disappointment, but there is enough great stuff from other eras to make this a masterpiece of a show. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "UNIFORM: ORDER AND DISORDER," P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sept. 3). Originally shown in Italy, this exhibition traces the changing forms and symbolism of the modern military uniform as it progresses through and is transformed by the larger culture -- alternately respected and violated, examined and absorbed, abbreviated and exaggerated. The perpetrators include artists like Wolfgang Tillmans, Vanessa Beecroft and Maurizio Cattelan; fashion designers like Prada, Versace and Donna Karan; and scores of terrorists, punks and nameless teenagers. Eight well-stocked vitrines present a plethora of supporting material, much of which is also reproduced in a stylish catalog. The exhibition ends with the real thing: a gantlet of the uniforms and head gear -- from fatigues to parade dress -- worn by members of the different Italian military services. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Smith).

"FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND THE ART OF JAPAN: THE ARCHITECT'S OTHER PASSION," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through July 15). Some shows are like a vigorous read; you have to concentrate and try to follow the plot. Wright, an architectural colossus and a wily diva of a man, is the main character. The story of his infatuation with Japanese art, and of how he turned that love to lucrative ends by moonlighting as a top-dollar dealer in woodblock prints -- at least until disaster struck -- is a rich one. It's told through dozens of architectural drawings, documentary photographs, woodblock prints and a superb accompanying book by the curator, Julia Meech, that wraps wide-ranging art historical research in a nimble, personable style. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 students and 65+ (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

JOHN DUFF, Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through June 29). Mr. Duff displays his enduring involvement with industrial materials, geometric form and philosophical conceptions of order. Sculptures from the late 1960's and 70's that are on view here include elegant distorted cylinders or double-ended boat shapes made of rough fiberglass (Ken Johnson).

RICHARD L. FEIGEN, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700 (continuing). Virtually every inch of the gallery -- upstairs, downstairs, in between -- is hung with something, and the accompanying labels amount to a dizzying roll call of art historical names from Titian to Edward Hopper. Certain religious paintings cut through the clamor, among them two dark, intense pictures of a vision-enthralled St. Francis of Assisi, by Annibale Carracci and Orazio Gentileschi. The real attention-grabber, though, is on the side of the sinners: Jacob Jordaens's mammoth "Twelfth Night Feast," with incontinent babies, puking revelers and a Falstaffian central figure, all executed with astonishing virtuosity (Cotter).

KEITH HARING, Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 737-2060 (through June 30). Promiscuously generous an artist as he was, Haring was also very uneven. This exhibition of just four medium-large canvases from the early 1980's shows him at his best. Two in particular suggest the vision of a modern Bosch. Densely populated by manically interactive demons, monsters and little men, they combine graphic ingenuity, mythic narrative and erotic polymorphism to exhilarating effect (Johnson).

ALEX KATZ, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338 (through July 13). Though famous mainly for his large, elegantly flattened and simplified pictures of beautiful, well-to-do people, Mr. Katz also has a lovely touch on a small scale. This modest but rewarding show of mostly small pictures of women, plus some funky little collages from the 1950's, shows to advantage his delicate brushwork, perfect compositional sense and controlled eroticism (Johnson).

MAX KUEHNE, "Artist and Craftsman," Hollis Taggart, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000 (through June 23). A student of Robert Henri, Kuehne (1880-1968) was a competent painter, but his most distinctive contribution was his production of well-made richly decorative furniture, picture frames and wood carvings. Under influences ranging from Japanese to Art Nouveau, he incised outlines of flora and fauna into gessoed surfaces and added colored glazes and burnished metal leaf. The most engaging pieces here are a pair of smoothly carved, elegantly humorous silver giraffes (Johnson).

* "POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through June 30). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop Art by the movement's stars. The 26 objects shown here, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. Among the signature works are Warhol's serial extravaganza, "200 Soup Cans" (1962); Mr. Rauschenberg's "Broadcast" (1959), a combine painting with a working radio attached; and Mr. Oldenburg's soft "Drum Set" (1967), a bodylike sendup of a professional drummer's instruments in vinyl and canvas that droops on a platform in a metaphor for its own spent energy. Collectors' collectors, the Powerses made the pursuit into an art of their own (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

* VIJA CELMINS, McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 688-5951 (through June 30). Ms. Celmins just keeps making the same old thing: paintings that are at once rigorously formal and expansively illusory, quietly transcendental and materially sumptuous. This spare, beautifully installed exhibition features eight easel-size paintings: six of starry night skies and two of blurrily luminous spider webs. In the print room, crisp wood engravings of rippling ocean surfaces look like 19th-century illustrations for "Moby-Dick" (Johnson).

RALSTON CRAWFORD, "Phantom Forms," Laurence Miller Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through June 29). This hard-edge painter often used his camera to record subjects taken up in paintings, but more often his photographs stood on their own. This small show of a dozen or so is a sampling from thousands produced by the artist over the years. His focus in most of the pictures is the play between light and shadow, as in "Buffalo" (1942), a view of the complex linear patterns cast by iron gratings and a lighting fixture on sunlit cement walls. More mysterious is "New Orleans" (circa 1961), in which a wall of peeling paint contrasts with a smooth white one. The appeal lies in the ambiguity of the hard-edge markings on the walls: shadows or substance? (Glueck)

CONRAD MARCA-RELLI, "Canvas Collages," Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through June 29). Marca-Relli ran with the Abstract Expressionists in the 1950's, but while his collage-based work always had a bold, rough-hewn immediacy, he was driven more by interest in structure than gesture. His compact, puzzle-like compositions of canvas, paper, mattress ticking and other materials from the 1960's hark back to the glory days of Cubism (Johnson).

ANDREA MODICA/ VICTOR SCHRAGER, Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070 (through June 30). A series of close-up antique-looking photographs of 100-year-old human skulls, exhumed from a mass grave on the grounds of a Colorado mental hospital, is a radical departure for Ms. Modica but lacks the intense humanistic poetry of her justly celebrated "Treadwell" series. Mr. Schra ger's quasi-antique photographic still lifes of flowers and old books suggest an Emersonian wedding of nature and culture (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

PHILIP AKKERMAN, Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through June 30). Mr. Akkerman, a 40-year-old Dutch artist, has painted self-portraits, and only self-portraits, at the rate of one a day, since the mid-1980's. Within this Conceptual framework, he invokes the entire history of portraiture, displays a terrific color sense (especially where skin is concerned), makes good use of his extensive hat collection, and subjects his somber face to an impressive range of physical and formal distortions. (In the project gallery, unusually personal photographic works by Julie Bamber and Catherine Opie are being exhibited together, their common theme being the artists' fathers.) (Smith).

REED ANDERSON, Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through June 23). Perforation is Mr. Anderson's beat. Punching small holes in large sheets of paper, he creates lacy, enthrallingly complicated images of odd cartoon characters. At this point, the technique and the abstract, optical effects are more interesting than the images, but the possibilities for further development are exciting to contemplate (Johnson).

ROSS BLECKNER, Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through June 23). One simple technique is about all there is to Mr. Bleckner's big, inert new paintings: he makes a little puddle of paint and hits it with a shot of compressed air to create a roundish cellular form. Accumulated into allover fields, these elements should create a dazzling opticality; but the light and color are dull (the color of dried blood in two cases) and the repetition monotonous (Johnson).

RICHMOND BURTON, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through June 30). Mr. Burton's new paintings speed up his calligraphic strokes and commas to good effect. His palette of silver and gold mixed with red, turquoise or purple also helps to create the impression of decorative and somewhat Middle Eastern imagery -- graceful Persian texts or Byzantine mosaics -- converted pure molecular energy (Smith).

"CLENCH, CLUTCH, FLINCH," Paul Rodgers, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 414-9810 (through June 30). Organized by the critic Dominique Nahas, this 13-artist show makes little sense thematically, but it offers a number of interesting things, including Julianne Swartz's peep-hole view of a bright interior with mirrored balls and fluttering tinsel; Monica Castillo's video of a woman painting on a man's genitalia; Melvin Way's small, diagrammatic, Outsider-like drawings; an inflated man by Tim Hawkinson; a big, wildly elaborate doodle by Diana Cooper; and a set of calligraphic drawings by Henri Michaux (Johnson).

* STEPHEN DEAN, Henry Urbach Architecture, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974 (through June 27). One of the most impressive debuts of the season is that of Mr. Dean, a young French-American artist whose obsession with intense, saturated color has taken him to India, where color is intrinsic to daily life. The result is "Pulse," a painterly, almost unbelievably gorgeous video of the annual spring Holi festival, when residents douse one another with colored powders and water until the streets flow with color (Smith).

CARLO FERRARIS, Esso Gallery, 211 West 28th Street, (212) 560-9728 (through June 23). This maverick multimedia artist, who is Italian, works in photography, video and installation -- always with a wry sense of humor and a knack for visual surprise (Smith).

* JASON FOX, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (323) 675-7772 (through June 16). In his latest paintings Mr. Fox brings the monstrous and the beautiful into a better balance while also splitting the difference between drawing and painting more effectively. His new images depict a motley crew of cyborgs, action heroes, sports stars and misfits; they are depicted with itchy-looking lines and textures and carefully painted details, usually pixelated grids that block out the subject's features or genitals. (In the second gallery, Richard Kern's photographs evince their own brand of hard-core, which often means pictures of porn actresses engaged in strange or mundane activities, like flossing or enjoying a Jacuzzi.) (Smith).

JUDITH LINHARES, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through June 23). With works painted in broad juicy strokes and luminous colors, this may be the most assured show yet from the respected California-born artist. Images include a woman floating languidly in a lake sans swimsuit and a glowing coral-colored dune fence surrounded by starfish. There is also a group of still lifes that suggest attention to the American modernist Marsden Hartley (Smith).

CHUCK NANNEY, Debs & Company, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 642-2070 (though June 30). "Everything I do was done by a feminist artist in the 1970's" is the stance taken by one of the drawings in this show, and it's not far wrong. But Mr. Nanney's crudely stitched together pouches, cardboard pedestals displaying crumpled balls of aluminum foil or bright little pom-poms, have plenty of riffs of their own. Most notable is an overreaching attraction to glamour, attained by the simplest of means. Excess is rarely so economically achieved (Smith).

* SHIRIN NESHAT, Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through June 29). Three videos isolate themes or devices that Ms. Neshat previously deployed in combination, to more impressive effect. The strongest video is "Possessed," which gains from its Philip Glass score and touches on the artist's main theme -- the plight of women in traditional Muslim societies. The near pitch-dark "Pulse" creates an aura of poetic ambiguity for the viewer to unravel, while "Passages" has groups of bare-headed men and chador-clad women, in separate groups, in a dramatic setting. United, these qualities succeed; divided, they are far less engaging (Smith).

* EDUARDO SARABIA, I-20 Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1100 (through June 23). Animated by walls painted with green vines, this impressive debut roams freely across several mediums, the artist's Mexican roots and the Los Angeles cityscape. The centerpiece is a festival-float cornucopia that has references to sex, violence and the materialistic American dream (Smith).

ANDREW TOPOLSKI, UCU, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through June 23). Mr. Topolski draws like a 21st-century Neo-Platonist. Circles, spirals, geometric figures and curious, quasi-scientific symbols, all made with exquisite precision, create the enigmatic impression of some cosmic theory of universal being. A little music box that produces a sound like hundreds of bells is worth a listen, too (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* "BETWEEN STREET AND MIRROR: THE DRAWINGS OF JAMES ENSOR," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through July 21). The show's pleasure partly involves serendipity. This feels like the perfect moment for an oddball like Ensor, but maybe any time would feel like the right time for somebody whose work, whether it is appalling or fantastic (and it can be both simultaneously), looks eternally modern. The drawings are from the 1880's and 90's. Some started out as ordinary sketches of household objects to which faces and monsters were added, like Rorschachs of the artist's imagination. They somehow become more luminous and translucent the more densely they are drawn, an extraordinary paradox. On the other hand, when the drawings aren't dense, they can be vaporous like Turners, with an effect akin to looking back on a dream: you can't quite place what you are seeing. But the emotion the images provoke is stronger precisely because of the frustration attached to it. Ensor is one of those artists Americans tend to forget or never really knew properly. A hero in Europe, he is vastly deserving of reappraisal here, and this excellent exhibition is a place to start (Kimmelman).

DEBORAH BROWN, "Shelter Dogs," Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424 (through June 23). Known for her public mosaic murals, Ms. Brown here presents paintings of dogs that she got to know while working as a volunteer walker for the Humane Society's lost-dog shelter. In squarish easel-size pictures, basset hounds, miniature greyhounds, Jack Russell terriers and various mutts, viewed from above and faithfully rendered in muted hues with a painterly touch, are positioned on monochromatic fields. Sentiment is checked by formalist distance (Johnson).

WILLIAM N. COPLEY, Nolan/Eckman Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190 (through June 29). A patron of artists and a painter himself, Copley (1919-1996) worked in a witty frou-frou style heavily influenced by decorative patterning a la Vuillard and Matisse. His life, he said, was "a quest for the ridiculous image," and he often found it, giving lighthearted treatment to brothels, prostitutes, priests and policemen, along with themes from the work of Robert Service, a once popular versifier who wrote "The Face on the Barroom Floor." The wacky spirit in this work tickles rather than bites, and like these two indulgences, a little goes a long way (Glueck).

Other Galleries

"FACES AND FIGURES: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY IN SCANDINAVIA," Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street, (212) 779-3587 (through July 29). Nordic photography makes a good showing here with a mix of established and lesser- known talents using a range of approaches, from documentary to personal diary. The aim is to dispel stereotypes about "coolness, control and psychic remoteness" in the words of Ann Sass, chief curator. And the show succeeds, with a humanscape of transvestite haunts in Paris, high jinks in Swedish suburbs, hunting and farming in Iceland, plain folk at home in Sweden, Christmas in Finland, prostitutes plying their trade in Denmark and children frolicking in Norway (Glueck).

JENNA SPEVACK, "Sticks and Stones and Superstrings," Here Art, 145 Avenue of the America, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 647-0202 (through June 30). In a written statement, Ms. Spevack makes the dubious claim that her tiny drawings of imaginary stones, sticks and lengths of rope in precariously balanced arrangements illustrate advanced scientific theories. Nevertheless, her finely drawn, whimsical pictures have considerable faux-innocent, comic appeal (Johnson).

Last Chance

IDA APPLEBROOG, "Early Works," Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232 (through tomorrow). With deceptive simplicity, Ms. Applebroog's cartoon theater sequences of the 1970's explored states of ambiguity and anxiety. Featured here is an expansive project subjecting the life of Galileo to
feminist debunking. Discursive and tendentious, it lacks the enigmatic drama of the artist's more modest works, like one included in the show in which a naked woman demands of a headless and pantsless man: "Don't you want me? Say something" (Johnson).

* THE CENTER FOR LAND USE INTERPRETATION, "Formations of Erasure: Earthworks and Entropy," Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare, at Lafayette Street, SoHo, (212) 431-5795 (through tomorrow). The environmentally inclined quasi-art collaborative known by the acronym of CLUI (pronounced CLOO-ee) has trained its sights on Earthworks, surveying the degree to which they have been affected by entropy, the principle of constant decay that inspired many Earthworks artists in the first place. The results, offered in a dry Conceptual text-photograph format, are informative, amusing and philosophically intriguing, and are further enhanced when the Storefront has its many doors swung open to the spring weather (Smith).

JENE HIGHTSTEIN, Grant Selwyn, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 755-0434 (through tomorrow). Mr. Highstein's sculptural fusion of Minimalist and organic form rarely fails to be elegant and evocative. This exhibition includes a mysterious low-lying dome made of black granite and a rugged three-cornered muffin shape carved from a chunk of white poplar. Such works need more breathing room than this overcrowded installation affords (Johnson).

* GLENN LIGON, "Colored," D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460 (through today). In his fifth solo gallery show in New York, Mr. Ligon departs radically from his brooding black-on-black text canvases with a series of contentious paintings on enlarged pages from black-themed coloring books of the 1970's. To outlined images of Malcolm X or Harriet Tubman, he adds "color" in all senses of the word, including life, feeling, personality and race, with scribbles and blots of color. The combination has precedents in the work of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly and Jean-Michel Basquiat. But as usual, Mr. Ligon layers familiar forms with new meanings and moves the viewer's mind all over the charged psychic landscape of American history, life and art (Smith).

MARY ELLEN MARK, "American Odyssey," International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Saturday). There's a lot to absorb in this big show, the first by this photojournalist to deal exclusively with her American subjects. It covers some 40 years of picture-taking in every region of the country. Children, the elderly, Coney Island, hot tubs, beauty contests, the fat, the skinny, prostitutes, churchgoers, the insane and the imprisoned, Ku Klux Klan members, marathon dancers, transvestites, the unknown and celebrities make not unfamiliar grist for Ms. Mark's lens. More seasoned photography buffs may feel at times that the show is a wade through a stack of old Life magazines. But in her best work, portrayals of downscale people with whom she seems to have a deep rapport, Ms. Mark gets so close to the skin of her subjects it's as if the boundaries that distinguish a photograph from life have all but disappeared. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and 62+ (Glueck).

* RON MUECK, James Cohan Gallery, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through tomorrow). One of the memorable solo debuts, this show by a British "Sensation" star consists of two works: a gigantic head on its side, asleep -- Goliath with a touch of saliva in the corner of the mouth -- and a miniature supine mother with newborn, the umbilical cord still connected. Mr. Mueck manages to breathe life into discredited 60's sculptural super-realism. His strategy partly entails greater precision and altered scale, scale being, as artists know, a reliable trickster and emotional provocateur. But there's awe, too: the mother's expression, conveying exhaustion and dumbstruck wonderment, is a lightly comic, ultimately grave miracle of minutely reproduced observation. It is hard to think of the last realist sculpture that comes close to its forensic lucidity, wit and humanity (Kimmelman).

"PANAMARENKO: ORBIT," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through Sunday). This exhibition presents "The Aeromodeler," arguably the masterpiece of the flight-obsessed, mechanically inclined Belgian sculptor who goes by the evocative invented name Panamarenko. It is a giant zeppelin that the artist made mostly of plastic and tape between 1969 and 1971 and tried to fly, unsuccessfully, to its first exhibition. With its beautifully distressed translucent surface, chrysalislike shape, rickety-looking motors and silver wicker gondola, it transforms Dia's spacious, wood-ceilinged annex not only into the runway hangar it has always resembled but also into a slightly hallucinatory dreamscape, one that evokes the sense of romance, wildness, grandiosity and play at work in much of the European art of the 1970's. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 60+ (Smith).

* BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through Sunday). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* LYLE STARR, Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 343-4293 (through tomorrow). Mr. Starr takes 2-D design to sumptuous extremes. With meticulous care, he paints fields of overlapping silhouettes: flat, colored shadows of animals, human figures, cartoon characters, cars and trucks, plants and bugs. Where these shapes overlap, colors mix and you have the illusion of disembodied transparencies layered in an indeterminately shifty and luminous space. Up close, however, you discover carefully sanded surfaces of sensuously tactile opacity (Johnson).

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Saying 'it's a lot worse than I thought,' a top forecaster lowers his expectations a second time.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ROBERT J. COEN, considered the leading forecaster of advertising spending, has confirmed widespread worries that 2001 is likely to bring the slowest growth in a decade to that closely watched economic indicator by revising his estimate for the year sharply downward.
 "I have to confess, it's a lot worse than I thought it would be," Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, said as he presented his revisions in a speech yesterday morning. The reduced estimate is more in line with several made recently by industry analysts that reflected the continued slowdown in the American economy. 
 Still, Mr. Coen, who has studied advertising spending trends for more than five decades, offered a more optimistic outlook for 2002, in part because the comparisons will be easier next year when the numbers are contrasted with the weak results of 2001. 
Mr. Coen's reduced estimate for American ad spending in 2001, made as part of his annual midyear forecast, was his second revision downward in six months. Ad spending this year will total $249.8 billion, Mr. Coen forecast, up 2.5 percent from $243.7 billion in 2000, an amount he recently revised upward because of new data that showed last year, the strongest in Madison Avenue's history, concluded even better than expected.
"It's now apparent the economy has softened to such a degree that it's unrealistic to expect advertising to outpace" the sluggish climate, Mr. Coen said.
"Over all, the media marketplace was pretty weak in the first quarter," he added. "It's not dead, but there are signs it will be stagnant for a while."
If Mr. Coen's reduced estimate for 2001 holds, and there is much data from the first five months of the year to suggest it will, this year will show the smallest growth in American ad spending in the last 10 years. Since 1991, when ad spending fell 1.2 percent, marketers have increased their ad budgets by amounts as low as 4.2 percent (in 1992) to as high as 9.6 percent (in 2000).
But the softness in the national economy, primarily in industrial output, along with the shake-out that has halved the number of dot-com companies advertising in traditional media, mean that 2001 will lag what had been predicted. That is particularly daunting for the advertising and media industries since those forecasts had been rather modest to begin with, because ad spending almost always grows more slowly in a year after an Olympics and a national election.
Often, the downward spiral feeds upon itself, said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, because marketers' decisions about ad budgets in tough times are very much like those made by investors when the stock market falls, in that "rather than jump on bargains when prices go down and the merchandise goes on sale, the customers run out of the store."
"The advertisers think 'I'd better hold onto my money because I may get better deals,' " Mr. Gottesman added, which explains why the upfront market for the sale of commercial time by the television networks in advance of the 2001-2002 season is getting off to such an unusually slow start.
The decision by Mr. Coen to revise his 2001 forecast again was greeted positively by many analysts and media executives.
His forecast is now "very much in line with our forecasts," said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst who follows the advertising industry for Merrill Lynch. "It's a good outlook."
At the Aegis Group in London, a large media services agency, the reaction was that "it's nice to know we're not a million miles away" from each other's forecasts, a spokesman, Richard Walters, said. At a conference last week, Aegis predicted that American ad spending would grow 2.4 percent this year.
"If anybody didn't see this coming, they weren't paying attention," said Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily, a newsletter being introduced by Brill Media Holdings in New York.
"This year is an anomaly, a correction year," Mr. Mandese added. "People have to be happy it isn't worse" because Mr. Coen's revised forecast would mean "we've officially missed an advertising recession."
In June 2000, Mr. Coen estimated that ad spending would grow 6.5 percent in 2001 from 2000. He reduced that at a presentation in December to an increase of 5.8 percent. The second cut, made yesterday at a presentation at the University Club in Midtown Manhattan, represents one of the largest revisions downward of his forecasting career.
Because 2000 was "quite fabulous," Mr. Coen said, citing ad spending for the Olympics, elections and the millennium celebration, 2001 is suffering by comparison.
The $249.8 billion total that Mr. Coen is now predicting for this year breaks out to a 2.1 percent increase in national ad spending, to $151.3 billion from $148.1 billion in 2000, and a 3.1 percent increase in local ad spending, to $98.5 billion from $95.6 billion. By comparison, his revised totals for 2000 showed a 12 percent gain in national advertising from 1999 and a 6 percent gain in local advertising.
National advertising this year is being dragged down, Mr. Coen said, by spending cutbacks in categories like automobiles, beverages and snacks, brokers and mutual funds, cigarettes, drugs, food, restaurants and telecommunications. Those reductions are overshadowing growth in categories like airlines, apparel, banks, liquor and movies, he added.
Ad spending this year will increase only slightly or even decline in national media like broadcast network television (down 2.5 percent) and spot television (down 6 percent), radio (up 2 percent), magazines (up 1 percent) and newspapers (up 1 percent), Mr. Coen said, offsetting gains for cable TV (8 percent), direct mail (4.5 percent) and the Internet (10 percent).
In local media, ad spending will rise 1 percent, he added, and somewhat more in TV (3 percent), radio (5 percent) and directories (5 percent).
Under Mr. Coen's second revised estimate, ad spending this year would represent 2.41 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a record 2.45 percent in 2000. Still, it would be at its second-highest level ever, above 1999, at 2.39 percent, and 1998, at 2.35 percent.
Mr. Coen's forecast for 2002, the first he is making for next year, calls for American ad spending to increase 5 percent from his revised total for 2001, to $262 billion.
"People are already writing off 2001 and are focused on 2002," Ms. Fine at Merrill Lynch said. "I was very encouraged by his outlook" that growth would return to more recent norms next year.
Turning to results overseas, Mr. Coen predicted that ad spending for 2001 would total $231.2 billion, up 5 percent from $220.2 billion in 2000. It would be the first time since 1995 that ad spending abroad would increase more in percentage terms than in the United States.
Mr. Walters said the Aegis estimate for ad spending growth outside the United States this year was close to Mr. Coen's, at 6 percent.
The new Coen worldwide total for 2001, then, is $481 billion, an increase of 3.7 percent from his revised worldwide total of $463.9 billion last year. It would be the smallest percentage gain for global ad spending since a 2.6 percent increase in 1998.
For 2002, Mr. Coen again estimated that ad spending overseas would climb at a faster rate in percentage terms than in this country. His preliminary forecast is a total of $244 billion, up 5.5 percent from 2001.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for next year, then, is $506 billion, up 5.2 percent from 2001.
"It crosses the half-trillion line" for the first time, he noted in a tone that mixed optimism and wariness.
Universal McCann is a media services agency that is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. As if to underline Mr. Coen's predictions of a problematic 2001, Interpublic disclosed late yesterday that it would sharply lower estimates of second-quarter earnings, to 30 to 35 cents a share from an estimate on March 19 of 40 to 45 cents a share.
Sean F. Orr, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Interpublic, said it might take cash and noncash charges of more than $300 million in the second and third quarters, related to its pending acquisition of True North Communications. (True North late yesterday also reduced its estimates of second-quarter earnings, to 37 to 42 cents a share from 44 to 54 cents a share.)
It was Mr. Orr who introduced Mr. Coen at the presentation, beginning his remarks with a reference to the "old Chinese curse, 'May you live in interesting times,' " adding, "We're all affected by that curse this year."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise Modestly; Sales by Businesses Decline 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers rose less than expected in May, restrained by lower costs for food, autos and computers, the Labor Department reported today.
 The Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month, the report said. The index's core rate, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 percent. Without an increase in cigarette costs, prices would have declined last month. 
 Separate reports showed that business sales declined for a second month in April and that claims for unemployment benefits held at close to a nine-year high last week. Together, they underscore weakness in the economy that may lead the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates for a sixth time this year in the hope of hastening economic recovery. The Fed's rate-setting committee will next meet on June 26 and 27.
"There are no inflation worries that stand in the way of the Fed cutting the federal funds rate yet one more time," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist of Clear View Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Analysts had expected a 0.3 percent rise in producer prices for May after a similar increase in April.
"I personally think it's a bit too early to anticipate a recovery," Roger Ferguson, the Federal Reserve vice chairman, said in The Hague today. "The Fed has responded very aggressively, and toward the end of this year or the beginning of next year, I expect to see some impact from that."
The Commerce Department reported today that sales at factories, wholesalers and retailers declined 0.5 percent in April after a 0.6 percent drop in March. Companies had trouble reducing stockpiles of unsold merchandise, with inventories unchanged in April. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long goods go unsold, rose to 1.44 months, the highest since January 1999. "Unless sales revive with lower interest rates and tax relief," said Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen in Walnut Creek, Calif., "further cuts in production and employment will have to be made."
Initial jobless claims fell to 428,000 for the week ended last Saturday from 440,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said. It was the first decrease in five weeks and left unemployment claims close to their highest level since July 1992. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which reduces volatility from the weekly data, rose to 424,500 last week from 415,500. The average was the highest since August 1992.

HEADLINE: New York City Still Adds Jobs, but Shows Signs of Slowdown 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The national economic slowdown that crept through New Jersey and upstate New York this spring has finally reached New York City's job market, according to data released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.
 Employers in the city are still creating jobs, but they are braking hard; in May, the number of new jobs rose by just 6,700, far less than the average monthly gain of 21,400 earlier this year. 
 Two main components of the city's economy are showing job losses. Wall Street firms shed 1,500 jobs in May, on top of a decline of 1,100 in April, the Labor Department said. There was a sharp reversal in business services, a group of what had been fast-growing businesses like consulting, accounting, computer services, employment agencies and public relations firms. Jobs in these areas fell by 2,300 in May. 
"The national turnaround has taken a lot of the steam out of the local economy," said Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller. 
The job figures were released a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that New York was experiencing "a pause in growth." Although the housing market remains strong, according to bank economists, there are now soft spots in financial services, manufacturing and commercial real estate. Even shopping appears to be slackening; one chain of stores told the bank that sales were down 5 percent because air-conditioner purchases had plunged by 50 percent.
Not all the news was bad. The unemployment rate in the city fell in May, to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in April, after adjusting for seasonal factors, the Labor Department said. But the unemployment rate includes only people actively looking for work, and there were fewer such people in May than in previous months. The number of people who were employed also fell (though economists always caution that unemployment figures are highly erratic).
Construction jobs continue to grow strongly, news that will not surprise anyone who has walked around Midtown Manhattan recently. And bars and restaurants are still hiring at a fast clip, the Labor Department said.
At least the total number of jobs is not shrinking in the city, as it has been nationally for two months. Cities with a lot of manufacturing, like Detroit, have had steep job losses.
In fact, New York City's job growth of 6,700, while far below the increase of 27,000 in May 2000, is actually larger than the increase of 6,000 jobs in May 1999. But the trend is different, noted James P. Brown, an analyst for the Labor Department. Back then, employment in business services and the hotel industry was about to explode. Today, "we're in a slowing period rather than a revving-up period," he said.
Some economists think things will only get worse. One is Paul A. Bernard, who advises companies on executive development -- and on layoffs. He said he expected that by the end of the year, Wall Street would shed 30,000 positions, including several thousand that pay more than $1 million a year, a loss that would ripple throughout the city's economy. "Last year, the attitude was, 'This person is mediocre, let's pay them a half-million-dollar bonus,' " he said. "Now they're to the point of getting pink-slipped."
Statewide, employers added 6,300 jobs in May, an increase of less than 0.1 percent from April, said the Labor Department, which adjusts statewide figures for seasonal factors. Nationally, the seasonally adjusted job count fell by 0.1 percent. "The New York economy continued to outperform the nation in May 2001, but there is mounting evidence that the national slowdown is slowing growth in the state," said Stephen Kagann, the governor's chief economist.
In western New York, where manufacturing is the major economic driver, the number of jobs has fallen over the last 12 months in Rochester, Buffalo and Jamestown. Utica, in central New York, has also lost jobs. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 21, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the slowdown in the economy reaching New York City's job market misstated the occupation of Paul A. Bernard, who suggested that things would only get worse. Mr. Bernard, who advises companies on executive development and layoffs, is a consultant, not an economist.

HEADLINE: California, Rising, Passes France By 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 14 

 BODY:
Forget those occasional contests in which a California cabernet beats out a French Bordeaux. Here is a real blow to the chauvinism of the nation that invented the word: La Belle France has been bumped from fifth place among the world's economies by the Republic of California.
 A shaky euro, a strong dollar and California's booming $1.330 trillion economy combined last year to push the nation's most populous state past France's $1.281 trillion economy and within striking distance of Britain, which is the world's fourth-largest economic power, at $1.415 trillion, according to a new analysis by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, a business group here. 
 "It's hilarious because no country has tried harder to make itself important than France, and no place has worked harder than California to screw itself up," said Joel Kotkin, an economist and senior fellow at Pepperdine University in Malibu. "So I think zen works."
The study was based on California's employment and personal income data from last year, and on data from the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, using current exchange rates. It ranked the United States economy No. 1 over all, followed by those of Japan and Germany. Other data, or exchange rates from a different period, might produce different results. 
"We got a phone call from the French media, a little bit huffy," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation. "We're benefiting from a very strong dollar, but also spectacular economic growth.
"California added 527,000 jobs last year. We probably won't see anything like that over the next couple of years. Obviously, California was on a roll, and this move up sure shows it," Mr. Kyser said.
"In the past, when the Southern California region bumped past the economy of South Korea, we got a couple of hurt phone calls, too."
Yo-Jung Chen, the vice consul and press attache at the French consulate here, was philosophical.
"We all know that California is a big state, and we knew from a long time ago that if California became independent it would be the sixth or seventh economy," Mr. Chen said. "Now it's the fifth, and since California is a big trading partner for France, we congratulate it. We believe this situation is mostly due to the exchange rate, and that the economy in Europe and in France is quite strong."
And, he added, "We still believe we produce the best wine in the world."

 An estimated 600,000 jobs for information technology workers in the United States are unfilled, and nearly 25 percent of technology managers say that retaining employees is their biggest problem, according to the META Group, a technology research firm based in Stamford, Conn. 
The labor market was even tighter a year ago, though, before the economy slowed. META calculated then that a million technology jobs were unfilled and 40 percent of the managers rated hanging onto workers as their dominant concern.

 BODY:

SELLA, EMMANUEL

 BODY:
SELLA-Emmanuel, 76. A vibrant and generous man died peacefully at home on June 12, 2001, surrounded by his wife and children. Until almost his last days he had a twinkle in his eye and possessed a remarkable energy for life. He was born in Vilna, Lithuania to Leah Kellman Solchansky and Ephraim Solchansky, and was their third child after his brother Haim & sister Yochevet. Already as a young man, he had the love of adventure and the ambition that would guide him throughout his life. After joining the Zionist youth group Betar, he stowed away on a ship, named the S.S. Parita, heading for Palestine. There he joined relatives whose address his mother had stitched to the inside of his trouser pocket. The Parita approached Tel Aviv eight days before the start of World War Two. He was never again to see his parents and brother and sister who died during the war. He quickly embraced his new country and changed his name to Sella, Hebrew for rock, a fitting name for a man of such determination. He fought in the Haganah for Israel's independence and at the age of 23 was appointed Commander of the Coastal Defenses of Israel. After the establishment of the state of Israel, he served in the Ministry of Labor in the Department of Development. As a result of his outstanding work for the government, he was awarded a scholarship to study in the United States. 
He graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Arts degree followed by a Masters of Arts degree from Harvard University. Even at the outset of his career, he excelled in turning dreams to reality, such as raising the funding for Israel's first supermarket chain and helping to finance and build one of Israel's first international hotels, the Tel Aviv Hilton. These successes led him to take on bigger dreams which he pursued in the United States, all the while working in support of Israeli ventures and causes. In 1967, he founded the Amivest Corporation, an investment management company, and always had confidence that it would thrive, which it did. He was assisted for countless years by his dedicated assistant, Mary MacCormack whom he greatly appreciated and valued. In 1973, Amivest Corporation acquired a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and later became part of North Fork Bancorporation. He loved Israel and spending time in the garden of the family's home in Kfar Shmaryahu, north of Tel Aviv. He was very active in American civic life & was invited on several occasions to the White House. He was an avid sailor and found great enjoyment and tranquility navigating his sailboat. He was an extremely warm and insightful man with a self-deprecating sense of humor that belied his success. He often commented that the most important part of life was family, and the profound loss felt by his wife and children speaks the truth of this statement. He is survived by his wife Aviva, his sons Gur, Ephraim, and Gideon, his daughters Shelley and Carmel and his grandchildren Talli, Nir, Shirli, Noah Lani, and Omar. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Israel's Museum of the Diaspora through American Friends of Bet Hatphusot, 633 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017. A memorial service will be held on Friday, June 15 at 1:30 P.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street followed by a burial several days later in Israel.
SELLA-Emmanuel. The Tel Aviv Foundation and the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo mourn with profound sorrow the passing of Emmanuel Sella. His generosity and spirit will be especially remembered in the city of Tel Aviv. Manny was responsible for the implementation of major economic projects in Israel, among them the establishment of the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, which contributed greatly to the development of the economy and tourism in the city. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Mayor Ron Huldai, Int'l Chairman David Harnik, Dir. General Ira D. Riklis, Chmn., Amer. Comm. Jeannie Gerzon, Exec. Director
SELLA-Emmanuel. The American Friends of Beth Hatefutsoth, Museum of the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv, mourns the loss of Emmanuel Sella, a great friend, benefactor and supporter of many Israeli and Jewish causes. A wonderful, dynamic, and noble personality of vision, idealism, intelligence, wisdom, integrity, and dignity; he will surely be missed. Our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Aviva, his children and grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing. Sam E. Bloch, Chairman Stephen M. Greenberg, President Gloria Golan, Director
 SELLA-Emmanuel. The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York mourns the passing of our dear friend and loyal supporter. His leadership and dedication to so many Jewish causes will be sorely missed. May his beloved wife, Aviva, and the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Gedale B. Horowitz, Pres. Ezra G. Levin, Pres. Elect Michael S. Miller, Exec. V.P.

HEADLINE: The Un-Clinton and the Un-Yeltsin 

BYLINE:  By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, served as America's ambassador at large for the former Soviet Union from 1997 to 2001.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin have this in common: They got where they are by promising to be unlike their larger-than-life predecessors. Both say Russian-American relations will also be different, based on hard-boiled scrutiny of national interests, not on personal ties dressed up as grand strategy. So, when the un-Clinton meets the un-Yeltsin tomorrow, post-cold-war diplomacy officially enters its post-heroic phase. Visionary, big-guy bonhomie is out; small-bore practicality is in.
 This is more than just a change of style. Ever since the first President Bush embraced Russian-American "partnership" 10 years ago, American policy has been animated by one large goal: integration of Russia into the Western political and economic mainstream. This integration is still the right goal, and still very much in our national interest, but for both sides the concept has lost much of its practical, as well as its inspirational, meaning. 
 Russians doubt that in their impoverished state the West will ever accord them the large international role they believe they deserve. The very idea of having to measure up to someone else's standards rankles, and the uncertain payoff from meeting these standards only makes things worse.
For Americans, there's growing doubt that any Russian government will -- or wants to -- implement the commitments that would make integration a reality. Why keep paying lip service to something that the Russians themselves may no longer believe in or be able to deliver? Why not have them call us when they're ready?
Whether Russia can be integrated into the West is a question to which both sides want an answer, but which neither side knows how to discuss meaningfully.
Mr. Bush can't escape this predicament by reaffirming, for the umpteenth time, his commitment to making Russia part of the West. What he can do -- and this fits well with the practical mode that he prefers -- is to set out how the United States expects our relations to develop if Russia pursues the goal of integration and if it does not. Both positive and negative outcomes need to be part of tomorrow's discussion. Russia should be able to see more concrete benefits from integration than it has achieved so far. But Mr. Putin should also have to worry that by adopting the wrong policies he could start to jeopardize gains Russia has already made.
A serious discussion has to begin precisely where Russians say the West has done the most damage to the goal of integration. They argue that the United States, by enlarging NATO, by waging war in the Balkans and now by planning a system of missile defense that will (so they say) neutralize Russian nuclear forces, has shown that its goal is to weaken Russia, not to devise common approaches to security.
These issues can be the grist for fruitless debate, full of cheap point-scoring, and if Mr. Bush were meeting with Boris Yeltsin tomorrow, that's what he might get. ("Bill," Yeltsin boomed out at one point in his last meeting with President Clinton before he retired, "You are guilty!") But talk matters less to the more calculating Mr. Putin. For him, it's what the other guy hands over that counts.
As it happens, Mr. Bush has cards to play that can significantly reduce the chance of a major Russian-American showdown on security issues. He has already indicated that he is preparing a program of deep and rapid (and perhaps even unilateral) reductions in the size, capabilities and war-readiness of our own offensive nuclear forces.
Such cuts are implicit in Mr. Bush's claim that he wants to liberate both sides from the cold war balance of terror. The sooner he begins to make them, the sooner he can begin to alter the dynamics of the internal Russian debate on missile defense -- and the sooner he can enlist Mr. Putin against the commanders of the strategic rocket forces, who like the balance of terror just fine.
A second factor that helps Mr. Bush is the almost unnoticed end of Russian-American conflict over the Balkans. The fall of Slobodan Milosevic and now the threat to Macedonia's stability have put Moscow and Washington (and their troops) on the same side against an armed separatist insurgency.
Finally, there is the hard question of NATO enlargement. A new round of invitations to join the alliance will open next year, and because the Baltic states are among the candidates, the process may put even greater stress on Russian-American relations than the first round did. President Bush should oppose Russia's efforts to gain a veto over any country's membership. But he can act to prevent a confrontation by taking a new approach toward Russia's future relationship with NATO.
One year ago, Mr. Putin complained privately to President Clinton that after he spoke out about Russia's possible interest in eventually joining NATO, not a single Western leader, publicly or privately, welcomed his statement. Mr. Bush should respond positively to Mr. Putin's overture, and in this way endorse the appeal of Russian liberals that the United States not rule out any Russian link to NATO. The Russians, of course, have to stop stalling on practical cooperation with NATO, but there are signs that they are now more willing to do so; Russian forces exercised with NATO in the Baltic Sea just this week.
No matter how well the discussion of security issues goes, however, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin must pay equal attention to the threats to political freedom that have increased since Mr. Putin took office and that are widening the gap between Russia and the West. Mr. Putin's campaign to gain control of independent television has put Russian democracy at risk -- a risk that is not made any less serious by the fact that Russian democracy has other failings, too.
Unfortunately, international condemnation of pressures on Russian press freedom has made no impression whatever on Mr. Putin, and he probably thinks that the West's concern is waning. He needs to hear from Mr. Bush that he's wrong. The continuing antidemocratic evolution of Russia will jeopardize the benefits of integration into the West that Mr. Putin seems to care about most. 
How long, after all, would the West accept having one nondemocratic state in the G-8? A scaling back of Russian participation in this "directorate of democracies" seems outlandish now, but if the seizure of the television station NTV is followed by further action against other stations and media outlets, it won't seem outlandish at all. Similarly, should political freedoms be cut back, Mr. Putin may get a less receptive hearing if he appeals next year for debt relief from Western governments. He may find that the West's desire to help a democracy is one thing, but helping a neo-authoritarian regime is another.
The un-Clinton and the un-Yeltsin have low expectations going for them tomorrow. To succeed, they don't need to show that they can do the vision thing. That's been done. But getting integration to produce real results -- that hasn't been done enough and needs to be. You might almost call the job heroic.

HEADLINE: Mexico City Journal; 
Pummeling the Powerful, With Comedy as Cudgel

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 14 

 BODY:
When Jesusa Rodriguez is on onstage, on camera, in the streets protesting the latest outrage -- she may be the most powerful woman in Mexico.
 She has embodied power night after night, for 20 years running, playing Jesus, the Devil, Hitler, the president of Mexico, the painter Frida Kahlo, an array of saints and sinners, hundreds of roles in hundreds of plays she has written and directed. And every night she is on she provokes the kind of laughter that serves as a deadly weapon against her declared enemies: the rich, the powerful and the sanctimonious. 
 "I have to do this," she said backstage at the Mexico City cabaret she runs, El Habito. "I have to. I have a job, which is living at the limits, expanding my mind. I need theater, opera, painting, cabaret, human intelligence, justice and liberty." 
She is, as a theme song of hers says, "an inconvenient woman -- or so the president told me." It goes on, "I'll never be named ambassador, since I never wear high heels -- and anyway, diplomacy's not my strong suit."
Flaying Mexico's elite is. Every work, every play of hers is a kick aimed at the seat of power.
She turned up on a television talk show the other day, impersonating President Vicente Fox's culturally conservative labor minister, Carlos Abascal, wearing a pretty pink suit, a moustache and a beard, mouthing macho platitudes. She led street protests when the richest man in Mexico, Carlos Slim, wanted to build a shopping mall next to the capital's oldest archeological site, warning that Mexico's two most sacred ruins would be the next to go.
"What do you want to do -- turn Chichen Itza into a sushi parlor?" she shouted. "Sell TelePizzas at Teotihuacan?"
At El Habito these days she is portraying Mr. Fox's press secretary and sweetheart, Martha Sahagun, in a devastating sendup of the new power brokers of Mexico. The show is called "Mass at Los Pinos," the presidential mansion, where in Ms. Rodriguez's twisted vision Coca-Cola is holy water, slim stacks of United States dollars are holy wafers, politicians rule through Prozac-fueled delusions and all that is sacred is profaned.
When the sclerotic old regime that ran the country for 71 years lost the presidency to Mr. Fox last year, it might have been the sort of creative problem for Ms. Rodriguez that the end of the cold war posed for John le Carre.
"It was difficult for me at first," she said. "Depressing." But the old regime and the new are pretty much Pepsi and Coke in her eyes, both offering people thirsty for justice "democracy lite," as the new play says.
"I realized the new government was the same, just worse," she said. "Same economic ambitions, but different ideology -- more dangerous, with this perverse mix of religion and merchandising, this mystical attraction to money and power."
And so the show went on.
Ms. Rodriguez is part of a tradition in Mexico City that reaches back almost a century, to the tent shows, known as teatro de carpa, and the political cabarets that served as a kind of living newspaper, written in the language of parody -- endless puns and wordplay, savage caricatures and satirical songs.
In her youth, in the 1950's and 60's, that tradition all but disappeared, folding under pressures that included the government's subtle censorship of politically deviant art and its sponsorship of creative artists who would work within acceptable limits. But in the early 1980's, Ms. Rodriguez and her lifelong partner and creative collaborator, Liliana Felipe, began to revive it and to test those boundaries.
They became part of a generation of Latin American women working, whether onstage, in the streets or writing alone in a room, against the men who ran things in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Cuba and other countries. Many are gathering this week in Monterrey, Mexico, for a 10-day conference, led by the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics of New York University, called "Memory, Atrocity and Resistance." Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Felipe will be headlining Saturday night with what they call their "Uncomfortable Cabaret"-- entertainment made from anger and laughter.
Recognition like this has come slowly and sparsely but Ms. Rodriguez seems not to care for money and prizes. "I knew I had to retake and reinvent what was lost when teatro de carpa disappeared," she said. "So I started in cabaret, doing Shakespeare, and that is the mother of performance art."
She mounted Mozart in drag; "Donna Giovanni," or "Don Giovanna," usually performed with an all-woman cast, played New York in 1987. Reviewing the work for The New York Times, John Rockwell called it a "sexy, brilliant and illuminating feminist revision of the opera" and praised its "raw, communicative, instinctual theatricality."
Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Felipe returned to New York last year, staging an off-Broadway production of their play "Las Horas de Belen," which received an Obie award. Belen, now long razed, was a church sanctuary for poor unmarried women who lived out their days in enforced servitude; the building later became a prison pure and simple.
El Habito, which opened in 1990, is an antiprison -- an anything-goes carnival, decked with eight-by-ten glossies of faded Mexican stars. The shows change with the news; "A Mass at Los Pinos" savagely cuts up Mr. Fox's past life as Mexico's leading Coca-Cola executive and what it calls "the coca-colafication" of Mexico's culture.
Ms. Rodriguez, as the adoring presidential press secretary, looks as if she were a drag queen playing Carol Burnett playing Marie Antoinette. When Mexico's poor, unseen offstage, protest Mr. Fox's plan to tax food and medicine, she suggests shipping them "happy boxes," a fast-food grab bag -- an unveiled reference to a still-unrealized Fox plan to give simple survival kits to migrants trying to sneak into the United States. "Then you can die in the desert with a nice taste in your mouth," she natters.
This work literally comes from the gut. Ms. Rodriguez says she draws from the cosmology of people who lived here before the Spanish conquerors, the Nahuatl. They thought the seat of the soul was in the liver, but that the soul of another person, the essence, could be stolen by someone else in a mask or disguise.
Thus, she says, she robs the people she portrays of their thoughts and experiences, inhabiting them onstage. This is doubtless disquieting to the people whose souls are being stolen, and it tests the limits of taste and propriety, but it makes for good theater.
"My experience," she said, "is that limits do not exist." And there may be no limit in Mexico to the raw material for her work, the daily passion plays of power and poverty, and the anger she channels into creativity.
"Something worse," she said optimistically, "will always come along."

Indexes Drop as Poor Forecasts Pull Technology Down

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply yesterday, pulled down by the technology sector, after another round of dismal forecasts from corporate America.
 Statements from Charles Schwab, STMicroelectronics and Silicon Storage Technology reinforced investors' fears that the economy might be continuing to weaken and dampened hopes for a rebound in profits soon. 
 Contributing to the malaise was the near collapse of a big acquisition. Shares of Honeywell International fell after General Electric said it was "not optimistic" that European regulators would approve its planned acquisition of the company. 
Even Kraft Foods dropped $1.10, to $30.15, below its initial public offering price of $31, set earlier this week. Some investors said Kraft's underwriters, led by Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney, had overpriced the stock. 
"In a real sense, we seem to be having a relatively across-the-board, broad sell-off," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index dropped for the fifth consecutive day, losing 77.59 points, or 3.7 percent, to close at 2,044.07.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 181.49 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 10,690.13. The broader Standard & Poor's index was down 21.73 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,219.87.
After the stock market closed, JDS Uniphase, the fiber optics communications products maker, chimed in with bad news. The company said it would miss its sales forecast by $100 million. Shares of JDS, which fell 37 cents, to $13.81, in regular trading, plunged after hours by $1.53, to $12.28, according to Instinet.
John C. Forelli, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Independence Investment, said telecommunications companies would remain under pressure.
Honeywell shares weighed heavily on the Dow, falling $5.16, to $37.10, after John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said the companies "wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there was a point at which we wouldn't do the deal." 
G.E.'s stock rose $1.01, to $48.86.
The corporate disappointments overshadowed economic reports that showed prices held relatively stable among producers in May, business inventories were unchanged in April and first-time unemployment claims dropped last week.
Schwab said its second-quarter earnings would probably fall short of Wall Street's estimates because of a decline in stock trading by its customers. Shares of Schwab, the leading discount and online brokerage firm, fell $1.32, to $16.03. --------------------

Treasury Prices Gain
(Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices gained yesterday after the government said producer prices rose less than expected in May, easing concern that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will accelerate inflation.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to a price of 98 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.22 percent from 5.26 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 96 6/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.64 percent from 5.66 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Showdown On Wall Street; 
Banks Are Getting Business At the Expense of Elite Firms

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
When Kraft Foods sold shares to investors this week in the second-largest United States initial public offering, it did so without any help from Merrill Lynch & Company, the firm that employs the most stockbrokers. Merrill also did not play a leading role when Lucent Technologies sold $3.6 billion of stock in a spinoff of its Agere Systems unit in March.
 Those were the two biggest offerings this year and the first of the 20 biggest on record in which Merrill did not hold the coveted position of lead manager or co-manager. 
 They also were spinoffs by major corporations that have been asking investment banks like Merrill, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to do more than they are willing or able to do. Increasingly, companies like Philip Morris, which sold Kraft shares to the public, are demanding that Wall Street firms extend big, barely profitable loans if they want to have a shot at the highly profitable assignments of managing offerings of stocks and bonds or advising on mergers. 
The stakes are rising as a handful of giant domestic and foreign commercial banks are making an aggressive push to break the stranglehold of the elite group of investment banks. 
David H. Komansky, Merrill's chairman, recently told the firm's brokers that the chief executive of a longtime client had notified him that Merrill would not handle the company's next stock offering.
Next time around, Mr. Komansky said he was told, the unidentified company planned to hire "one of four or five commercial banks because they provided something like $2 billion" in credit to the company. Merrill officials declined to identify the company.
"Right now, it's a challenge for us," Mr. Komansky told the brokers. "Clearly, the banks are using their muscle," he said, to get between the investment banks and some of their biggest clients.
The heightened competition could not come at a worse time for the stand-alone investment banks. Mired in their first year of declining profits in almost a decade, they have laid off thousands of bankers and cut costs as revenue from underwriting and trading has dropped sharply.
The dwindling group of major commercial banks, meanwhile, have more leverage than ever. After years of consolidation, there are only a few banks that can meet the borrowing needs of big domestic and global corporations. When those borrowers get into a financial bind, as many telecommunications and technology companies have in the last year, they are more inclined to try to appease the people whose loans are keeping them afloat.
After Merrill and Goldman Sachs balked last year at joining the list of lenders to Philip Morris, the company crossed them off the list of prospective underwriters for Kraft, according to several Wall Street executives.
Top billing for the $8.7 billion stock sale went to affiliates of two big banks, Credit Suisse First Boston and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, vaulting them into the No. 2 and No. 3 rankings, respectively, among underwriters for new offerings this year.
Citigroup has also moved ahead of Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill to the top spot this year in disclosed fees from underwriting stocks and bonds. Citigroup has earned almost $1 billion of the $5.6 billion in underwriting fees this year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase -- formed after last year's acquisition of J. P. Morgan by the Chase Manhattan Corporation -- have also been crowing about their coups in landing advisory roles in corporate mergers and acquisitions. Banks earn the fattest fees from advising on mergers and underwriting stock offerings. Both of those businesses have slowed sharply this year, so the interlopers are getting a rude reception.
Officials of rival investment banks argue that J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup have been buying business by cutting prices. They can do that, their critics say, because they have abundant access to cheap money provided by their depositors and they do not account for the true cost of the loans they make and commit to make.
Goldman Sachs lodged a complaint about the banks' methods with makers of accounting rules, arguing that the big banks are understating the risks of the loan commitments they are making.
If banks had to carry those loans at their true value, Goldman officials said, they would price them differently and lose some of their competitive edge.
While Goldman has been sounding off, Merrill has been trying to fight back by building up its own banks. The firm has been sweeping its brokerage customers' cash into accounts at small banks that it owns so that it has a source for loans to corporate clients that demand them.
"The traditional investment banks are finding the new competitive structure very threatening and are reacting with all the weapons they can think of," said Michael Carpenter, the chairman of Citigroup's corporate and investment bank. "I don't blame them."
The mounting pressure from better capitalized competitors is fueling rumors that some of the biggest firms on Wall Street, including Merrill and Morgan Stanley, may be forced into mergers to add heft. Though officials of both firms dismiss speculation that they cannot hold their own against Citigroup and the newly formed J. P. Morgan Chase, that notion has begun to sink in with corporate executives.
"Investment banks are having the commercial banks encroach on their territory," said John H. Cannon, treasurer of Venator Group, the company that operates the Foot Locker chain of athletic-shoe stores. "That's why you're going to see more mergers among investment banks, more mergers like Salomon and Citibank."
On Monday, Venator announced that it had refinanced its outstanding bank debt, replacing some of it with $125 million in bonds that can be converted into shares of its stock. The bond sale was not managed by Venator's primary financial adviser, Morgan Stanley, but by J. P. Morgan Chase, which earned a fee estimated to be more than $3 million for the service.
The next day, the stock analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase who follows retailers, Harry Ikenson, issued his first assessment of Venator's stock, calling it a buy.
Mr. Cannon, speaking of investment banks, said, "They can't just do bond underwritings when the commercial banks are offering all of the services."
The most aggressive marketers of the concept of one-stop shopping on Wall Street these days are the executives at J. P. Morgan Chase. They readily admit that they are focused on turning borrowers into issuers. 
"We've never said that holding loans is a great way to make money," said Marc Shapiro, vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase. "Other banks, broadly speaking, are saying, 'This is a product that doesn't support itself very well.' So, all banks are saying, 'Where else can we make money on this relationship?' "
Banks have to tiptoe around the issue because they are prohibited by regulators from holding credit hostage for underwriting ransom, a practice known in the industry as tying. Investment bankers have long accused commercial bankers of tying but the charge is being heard much more often with the advent of the domestic megabank.
Until 1999, when Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, a set of Depression-era laws, commercial banks were kept separate from investment banks. Merrill and other securities firms supported revisions of the laws because they said it was unfair that banks could buy brokerage firms, within certain limits, but that brokerage firms could not buy banks.
Even before the laws changed, Travelers Group merged with Citibank and combined the bank's corporate lending business with Travelers' investment banking unit, which itself was the product of a merger of the Smith Barney brokerage firm and the Salomon Brothers investment bank.
The formation of Citigroup reverberated on Wall Street and spurred a raft of predictions of similar mergers. But the closest thing to a copycat deal was Chase Manhattan's purchase of the J. P. Morgan investment bank for $30.9 billion.
Before those combinations, the only commercial banks that owned major investment banks were foreign. While those foreign banks largely failed in their efforts to penetrate the United States investment banking business, a few, including Credit Suisse and UBS of Switzerland and Deutsche Bank of Germany, have now developed into serious competitors after acquiring investment banks in New York and Europe.
Those three, along with Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, are in the process of changing the competitive landscape and possibly the economics of investment banking, said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows bank and brokerage stocks.
"There is a creeping capital intensity to the securities business that's being propelled by a handful of commercial banks who come to the table with very large balance sheets," Mr. Kraushaar said. "These five banks have more opportunity to use their balance-sheet muscle to get into the business."
The progress is most evident in the bond business. Underwriting bonds is not as profitable as underwriting stocks or advising on mergers, nor is it as critical to the clients' long-term health, Wall Street executives argue.
Mergers and acquisitions are "the brain surgery of investment banking and a large equity offering is the equivalent of spinal surgery in investment banking," said John Thain, co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. "I don't think you do either of those with the guy who gives you the cheapest rate."
J. P. Morgan Chase executives are trying to shatter this notion that only a few firms can be trusted to sell stock or help plan an acquisition. The first step is to persuade corporations to sample the services, and the journey usually begins with a sale of bonds.
Citigroup has already established its bond-selling prowess. It has increased its leading share of that business to about 22 percent this year and it is vying for Merrill's crown as the leading overall underwriter of stocks and bonds.
The burning debate on Wall Street revolves on whether Citigroup and any of the other hybrid banks can parlay bond business into the initial offerings and merger assignments they want so badly. And, if they do, will that success push the stand-alone investment banks to give up their independence?
Mr. Kraushaar said he did not think Merrill or Goldman or Morgan Stanley had to grow externally to remain competitive. But, he said, if one of them does make a move, such as the much-talked-about merger of Morgan Stanley and American Express, the other two will have to follow suit.
Even Mr. Shapiro acknowledges that J. P. Morgan Chase faces a long, uphill climb to the top of the charts in the most lucrative businesses on Wall Street. But he points out that Merrill, which began as a brokerage firm and acquired some small investments banks, eventually got there and insists the feat can be duplicated.
"Will we have a stronger market share in investment banking in a few years than we have now?" Mr. Shapiro asked rhetorically. "I would say that the odds on that are about as good as Tiger Woods winning the next golf tournament."

HEADLINE: China Said to Sharply Reduce Emissions of Carbon Dioxide 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 14 

 BODY:
In the debate on global climate change it has long been a given that China, with its huge population and endless coal reserves, would overtake the United States early this century as the biggest source of the atmospheric pollution that scientists believe is warming the planet.
 That specter of runaway Chinese emissions has been cited by President Bush as a major reason for describing as "fatally flawed" the 1997 Kyoto agreement to protect the climate. The treaty exempts developing countries, including China, from its initial, binding limits on the output of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases that scientists believe are causing traumatic changes in the climate. 
 But treaty obligation or not, China has already achieved a dramatic slowing in its emissions of carbon dioxide in the last decade, Chinese and Western energy experts say. That record of progress has pushed further into the horizon the day that China will surpass the United States as the lead culprit, and it is something that Mr. Bush seems to have overlooked in his harsh appraisal. 
Chinese officials insist that their country will do its fair share to combat a serious global threat.
"We already have one of the world's best records in improving energy efficiency," Zhou Dadi, director of the Energy Research Institute of the central government's State Development Planning Commission, said in an interview.
"Our challenge is this: Can we give people an acceptable lifestyle and also address the problem of climate change?" Mr. Zhou said.
"As an energy expert, I think we need a demonstration from a developed country to prove that a high living standard can be associated with lower carbon emissions," he said. "Then China will follow that example or even do better."
In the most surprising development, China's annual output of carbon dioxide in the last four years of rapid economic growth has actually declined, according to data compiled by the United States Department of Energy. While the numbers could be overstated because of flaws in both economic and energy statistics, some experts think, China does seem to have achieved a stunning if temporary reversal of the usual trend during economic expansion.
"China's emissions of carbon dioxide have shrunk by 17 percent since the mid-1990's," according to an April report from researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. "Remarkably, over the same period, G.D.P. grew by 36 percent."
"Even without undertaking binding commitments under an international agreement," the researchers concluded, China "has nevertheless contributed substantially to reducing growth in global emissions."
This achievement has been a welcome side effect of China's shift to market prices for fuels, including an end to coal subsidies, and its programs to encourage energy conservation and fight urban air pollution, mainly by curbing the burning of coal.
Only a few years ago, many studies projected that China would emerge as the world's leading source of carbon dioxide by 2020, but these recent developments appear to have put off that day by years or even decades.
Although the United States has improved its energy efficiency since the oil crises of the 1970's, recent trends like the fad for large, gas-guzzling vehicles have undermined the former goal of returning carbon dioxide output to 1990 levels.
"There is a good basis to argue that China has done more to combat climate change over the past decade than has the United States," according to a new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an American environmental group that aids energy conservation projects in China.
Mr. Bush, most recently on Monday, has said he cannot support the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in large part because it exempts China and other developing countries from the initial limits on emissions of greenhouse gases that richer countries are supposed to accept.
With his condemnation of the hard-won treaty, Mr. Bush has set off a tempest in Europe and many developing countries, which are more convinced of the looming threat of climate change and had thought they had agreement to act.
The signatory countries will meet next month in Bonn to search for ways to save an agreement with some teeth.
In his speech on Monday, Mr. Bush complained that China, as the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after the United States, "was entirely exempted from the requirements in the Kyoto Protocol." 
Chinese officials point to what they feel is their unacknowledged progress, but they also say the rich countries, which account for most of the carbon dioxide that has already accumulated in the atmosphere, must show that they are serious.
"We've done what we can to reduce emissions, and we'll continue to do so," Gao Feng, a senior Foreign Ministry official here who has taken part in the climate negotiations, said in a recent interview. "But it's not fair to ask the developing countries to take the lead."
"Before the developed countries show that they will do something real and good to address this issue, why should the developing countries make a commitment?" Mr. Gao asked, repeating the arguments that have led to an impasse between developing nations and the Bush administration.
Because it is so large and makes such enormous, inefficient use of coal -- the worst fuel in terms of climate effects -- China is second only to the United States in emissions of carbon dioxide. At the same time, its people consume on average only one-tenth as much energy as Americans, and they hunger for economic advances. 
In the last decade, according to data compiled by the United States Energy Department, China's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have climbed at annual rate of 0.9 percent -- lower than the 1.3 percent a year registered in the United States, even as China's economy expanded much more rapidly.
Despite the recent slowdown, experts say, substantial future growth in carbon dioxide emissions is inevitable in China as the country develops. Yet officials here also say that China accepts the need to work against global warming and that at some point, they know, China will need to accept international targets.
"Strategically, we have adopted climate change as an important concern in our energy planning," said Mr. Zhou of the Energy Research Institute.
Before 1980, Mr. Zhou said, China's energy use increased 1.6 times as fast as the economy. But in the last 20 years, he said, energy use has grown at less than half the rate of the economy -- an exceptional advance in the efficient use of fuels.
India and other large developing countries have also improved efficiency but not as dramatically.
With a combination of increasingly stringent regulations, like energy codes for new buildings, as well as other conservation programs and rising prices, Chinese planners hope to preserve a similar low ratio of energy use to growth in the decade to come, Mr. Zhou said.
"It's not easy because there is no precedent anywhere in the world," he said. Fuel use in much of China remains extremely wasteful, however, leaving opportunities for large gains.
"Our per capita energy use is just one-tenth of that in the United States and one-seventh of that in Europe," Mr. Zhou said. "With development, it must be increased.
"I don't think China can achieve a unique style of development," he said. "Americans drive cars while we ride bicycles; you live in houses while we live in dormitories."
Frank Loy, who as under secretary of state under President Clinton helped negotiate climate issues and has since left government, said he believed that creative new approaches might allow the United States and other countries to proceed against greenhouse gases, but that this would require some give on all sides.
Mr. Loy said it was reasonable for the United States to insist on assurances that its efforts will be part of an effective, shared global plan to curb emissions.
At the same time, he said, it would not be fair to stifle the development of poor countries.
As one possible compromise, Mr. Loy said, developing countries like China could take on an obligation to keep emissions at a certain fraction of economic growth, rather than setting absolute limits. Or they could adopt targets for energy efficiency as their economies grow.
Mr. Loy said he believed that some in the Bush Administration started out with a clear goal: "to drive a stake through the heart of the Kyoto agreement." But the outcry at home and abroad, he said, has led them to second thoughts.
At the same time, Mr. Loy noted that poor countries, with their extreme vulnerability to climate-related natural disasters, have the most to lose if the agreement collapses, and he called for more flexibility on their part.
The original 1992 treaty laying out the framework for climate talks, he noted, called for "common but differentiated obligations" on the part of rich and poor countries.
"It's too bad that this has been transformed into a group of countries that have real obligations and a group of countries that don't have any," he said.

They Hate Us! They Need Us!

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Reading about all the anti-Americanism President Bush has encountered on his trip to Europe, I was reminded of the 1970's Randy Newman song "Political Science." Its main verse was: "No one likes us -- I don't know why. / We may not be perfect, but heaven knows we try. / But all around, even our old friends put us down. / Let's drop the big one and see what happens . . . Asia's crowded and Europe's too old. / Africa is far too hot / and Canada's too cold. / And South America stole our name. / Let's drop the big one. There'll be no one left to blame us."
 Mr. Newman's ditty is a reminder that anti-Americanism didn't start with George Dubya. The key question is whether there is anything new in today's anti-Americanism and whether it has any strategic consequences. 
 Actually, there are a couple of things new. You can taste it in Greece. In his upcoming book, "The Unholy Alliance: Greece and Milosevic's Serbia During the Nineties," the Greek journalist Takis Michas explains that during the cold war anti-Americanism in Greece and Europe tended to be driven by the left and focused "on what America did" -- and how it wasn't living up to its own ideals when it backed dictators in Greece and elsewhere.
Today's version of anti-Americanism in Europe is more focused on "what America is," says Mr. Michas, and it brings together the far left, the far right and the Orthodox Church. The old left hates America for its free-market capitalism, the death penalty and globalization. The far right hates it for promoting its multiculturalism in the Balkans, which threatens Greek nationalism. And the Orthodox Archbishop hates America for enticing Greek youths away from their heritage and religion. 
Fine: so now the Europeans don't like us for who we are. Does it matter? Is it producing an alliance of countries against America that threatens our vital interests? That's the real question.
Not yet, says the German foreign policy analyst Josef Joffe, in a smart essay in The National Interest journal titled "Who's Afraid of Mr. Big?" Mr. Joffe argues that one reason no alliance has formed against America yet is because, while resentment of America is rife, particularly among European elites, the attraction of America -- its culture, universities, movies, food, clothing and technologies -- is just as strong, and today no power in the world can balance it. For every European elitist who resents America for what it is, there are 10 Euro-kids who want what America is. "America is both menace and seducer, both monster and model," says Mr. Joffe.
While America's soft power can't be balanced -- there's no Disney World in Moscow, no Harvard in Beijing -- America's hard power doesn't need to be balanced. "Why is there no real ganging up against the United States?" asks Mr. Joffe. " Because America annoys and antagonizes, but it does not conquer. He who does not conquer does not provoke counter-alliances and war." Mr. Joffe refers to today's European anti-Americanism as "neo-ganging up" -- noisy but not serious.
Another reason we have not provoked an alliance against us is that America still has been willing to provide "public goods" to the global system, says Mr. Joffe. Public goods are things that everyone can benefit from -- keeping the sea lanes open, stabilizing the free-trade system or beating back bad guys in Iraq. This gives lesser powers an incentive to cooperate with us, even as they criticize us; otherwise who else would uphold global security and financial stability? 
This is hugely important. History teaches that periods of relative peace occur when you have a benign power that is ready to provide public services to maintain an orderly global system -- even if it means paying a disproportionate share of the costs.
That's why the greatest danger today is not European anti-Americanism, but American anti-Americanism. The greatest danger is if America is no longer ready to play America -- the benign superpower that pays a disproportionate price to maintain the system of which it's the biggest beneficiary. This could happen because Congress becomes too cheap or stupid, or because our economy becomes too enfeebled, or because we have an administration dominated by people unwilling to put any limits on U.S. behavior, from energy consumption to missile defense. That sort of America, if taken to extremes, could nullify our attractiveness and generate an alliance against us. Surely the Bushies know that -- don't they?

HEADLINE: Baltic States Seek Bush's Help in Joining NATO as Political Insurance Against Russia 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, June 14 

 BODY:
Ten years ago last January, Soviet tanks and machine gunners stormed the central television studios and broadcasting tower of this Baltic capital, killing 15 people and wounding hundreds, as the Red Army tried to put down the wave of independence movements that was tearing the Soviet Union apart.
 It was one of the darkest hours of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rule as he lurched between conservatives and liberals in the final days of empire before he himself was swept aside, first by a conservative coup, and then by the man who rescued him from it, Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 Now, as President Bush prepares for his first meeting with Mr. Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir V. Putin, a reckoning of sorts will be on the agenda for Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia. Call it a national insurance policy that what happened here in January 1991 -- and in 1940 when the Soviet Army forcibly incorporated the Baltic states into the empire -- will never happen again. 
For these three small and fiercely independent democracies lead the list of nine nations seeking to enter the NATO alliance in 2002. But Mr. Putin, his top military commanders and most of the Russian establishment strongly oppose what would be the first NATO advance onto the territory of the former Soviet Union.
"Accepting Lithuania into NATO is a signal to Russia that never and never will Lithuania be taken over by Russia again," said President Valdas Adamkus in an interview here. "This is a formal declaration to Russia politically that we are free, and declaring ourselves free forever."
It won't be easy. Between them, the Baltic states have no competent armed forces, no tanks or artillery and a few transport planes that could hardly be called an air force. But they are working on it, and have contributed a few hundred peacekeepers to NATO forces in the former Yugoslavia. And in the event that NATO ever had to defend the Baltic states from attack, some Pentagon and NATO military planners believe that such a defense could not be accomplished with conventional forces.
"Because it is unlikely that NATO members would wish to ensure a country's protection through a nuclear guarantee alone," a 1999 congressional study said, these Western military officials said they doubted that the Baltic states would be offered NATO membership "until alliance relations with Russia improve dramatically." 
Besides the three Baltic states, NATO has accepted formal applications from Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Croatia is seeking to join this group as a 10th applicant. This week, in a NATO summit meeting Mr. Bush attended in Brussels, Western leaders agreed that they would invite new members to join the alliance at a summit meeting in Prague next year, but they were silent on which ones. This fall Mr. Bush is expected to notify Congress which applicants the United States will support.
In a speech in Warsaw on Friday, the president will elaborate his administration's position on how far NATO's door remains open to the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and among the former Soviet republics. He is also expected to reaffirm that Russia will have no veto over NATO's decisions. But at the same time, Mr. Bush is seeking to engage Russia in a constructive discussion on missile defense and, more generally, on how to improve international security.
Here in Vilnius, the generation of leaders who defied Soviet rule and have worked more than a decade to build democratic institutions and a market economy expect America's voice to be crucial in NATO's decision and have thus riveted their attention on Mr. Bush.
"The United States is the main pillar of our hopes to join NATO soon," said Vytautas Landsbergis, who led Lithuania in its first days after independence and who now sits in Parliament as a faction leader. "And if Russia succeeds to delay this decision, it is a great victory for Moscow and a big concession to Russia by the United States."
The question of NATO expansion to Russia's frontiers lies at the heart of Moscow's growing worry that instead of integrating Russia deeper into the common European enterprise of building new security structures, the Bush administration is erecting the foundations for some future containment of Russia.
As Mr. Bush and his top advisers have in recent weeks spoken in more conciliatory tones about engaging Russia as a security partner, the anxiety level in the Baltics has risen.
The Baltic leaders fear a tradeoff in which Russia might be convinced to go along with Mr. Bush's missile defense project in return for leaving the Baltic states outside NATO.
Mr. Putin's closest adviser on national security matters, Sergei B. Ivanov, who became defense minister this spring, last week issued a pointed warning that relations between Russia and the West will deteriorate should NATO expansion plans move forward.
"NATO enlargement symbolizes the formation of a security system in Europe in which Russia is not an equal party and it is a direct infringement on Russia's vital interests," he said in Brussels after meeting with NATO officials. "Politicians of the alliance should think once again of the possible losses to the European community if deciding on the enlargement of NATO ignores the opinion of Russia."
In the Baltics, Moscow's warnings are taken as so much bluster and officials here are quick to point out that Russia just as vehemently opposed the entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO in 1999. Instead of any deterioration, they point out, relations between those countries and Russia have , if anything, led their leaders to speak to each other with a new clarity and self-assurance.
But Russia has other concerns, which Mr. Putin is likely to raise with Mr. Bush. 
Most prominently, Russia's Baltic Fleet and home port in the enclave of Kaliningrad, already cut off from Russia proper, will be flanked by NATO countries if Lithuania joins the alliance. A key lifeline connecting Kaliningrad to Russia is a military railroad that crosses Lithuania and Belarus.
In March, Mr. Putin invited Mr. Adamkus to the Kremlin for their first meeting, which turned out to be a long and intense negotiation in which Russia pressed for a treaty guaranteeing Moscow's right to resupply its military forces in Kaliningrad -- mainly with fuel -- along this rail line.
By gaining such a bilateral treaty, Mr. Putin apparently hoped to protect Russia from the day when NATO might order Russian military traffic halted on the rail link.
Mr. Adamkus, beaming with pride over his own tenacity, said he "succeeded" in withstanding Mr. Putin's barrage of charm and pressure. 
But Mr. Adamkus and other senior officials here acknowledged that if Lithuania joins the Western alliance NATO would have the right to shut down Russian military traffic through Lithuania in a period of tension.
But Russia has its own leverage over the Baltic states as a major supplier of energy to the region.
In Lithuania, the only oil refinery depends on cheap Russian crude oil to operate profitably. Lukoil, the Russian oil company that supplies the refinery, cut back its supplies last year in a commercial dispute with the American company, Williams International, that Lithuania has retained to operate the refinery. 
And Lithuania will likely need Russian cooperation to deal with the nuclear waste from the Soviet-built Ignalina power station, whose reactors are of the same design as the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine that exploded in 1986.
Lithuania had pledged to close one of the two reactors by 2005 as a condition for entering the European Union, but will need as much as $3 billion in Western assistance to do so, Mr. Adamkus said. Where the radioactive fuel and wastes get stored may depend on Russia.

HEADLINE: Misrepresenting the ABM Treaty 

 BODY:
Arguments over the merits of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty between Washington and Moscow have been a feature of President Bush's European trip this week and could affect the atmosphere of his meetings tomorrow with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. The Bush administration would have Americans believe that the treaty is a discredited cold-war relic that bars the way to a new era free from fear of nuclear missile attack. That is bad history and bad policy. 
 For decades, the ABM treaty restrained competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to build increasing numbers of offensive missiles. Since the cold war's end it has allowed Russia and America to dismantle significant portions of their nuclear arsenals without fear that they would be unable to respond effectively to a surprise attack. 
 In future years the ABM treaty could serve as a bridge to a new era in which further reductions in offensive missiles could be accompanied by the testing and building of limited defensive systems to blunt emerging threats from unpredictable countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. But to arrive at that desirable result the administration will have to stop maligning the treaty and engage in constructive discussions with Russia and China. The goal of this diplomacy should be agreement on how to either amend the treaty or supersede it with a new agreement that can regulate the development of reasonable missile defenses.
As it now stands, the ABM treaty allows testing and construction of missile defenses, but under very strict limits. No nationwide coverage against long-range warheads is permitted. Mobile-based interceptors, like those launched from ships, are prohibited and cannot even be tested, although mobile defenses against short-range missiles are allowed. These rules were designed to assure that neither Washington nor Moscow could launch a nuclear attack without fear of suffering effective retaliation. Without the treaty, both would have faced irresistible pressures to build thousands of additional offensive missiles to overwhelm any defensive system. With the treaty in place, additional agreements were reached that limited, then sharply reduced, the number of offensive missiles on both sides. 
Since the end of the cold war, new kinds of missile threats have arisen from smaller, more erratic nations, and new defensive technologies have been designed that may prove able to counter them. Those technologies still need further testing. But if they do prove workable, the treaty would have to be modified or replaced to permit building them. The ABM treaty has already been amended once before, in 1974, and a second set of agreed changes was negotiated in 1997 but never ratified. 
Amending or replacing the treaty is a better course than simply abrogating it. Russia fears that if there were no agreed limits on missile defenses, future technological improvements could render even its present missile force of several thousand inadequate. China has more immediate fears that even a limited missile defense could nullify its far smaller number of long-range missiles. These concerns are legitimate, and the United States, along with the rest of the world, has an interest in these countries' feeling secure with the lowest possible number of intercontinental missiles. 
But Washington is right to seek new scope to develop limited missile defenses. The answer is to seek a new strategic equation that encourages the United States and Russia as well as China to field a minimal number of offensive weapons and reasonable defensive systems. The groundwork for this can begin to be laid when President Bush meets Mr. Putin for the first time in Slovenia tomorrow. That meeting is planned primarily as a chance for the two men to get acquainted. But they will meet again at next month's economic summit conference in Italy. By summer's end they could be ready to designate representatives to begin substantive talks.
The Bush administration ought to stop demonizing the ABM treaty and start building on it.

HEADLINE: Time for Bloom to Resume His Everlasting Odyssey 

BYLINE:  By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned: 'Introibo ad altare Dei.' "
 Today it is Marian Seldes's turn to take up the torch and read the opening of James Joyce's "Ulysses" at the annual Symphony Space Bloomsday celebration. Ms. Seldes is one of a group of actors who have come to this theater on upper Broadway for nearly 20 years to join in daylong "Ulysses" marathons, without getting paid, and before increasingly larger audiences. 
 Every year around the world there are more and more celebrations of Joyce's epic novel about a Jewish advertising salesman, Leopold Bloom, who is beset by thoughts of his infant son's death and his wife's infidelities, and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer so alienated from his native culture and religion that he refuses to pray for his dying mother's soul.
"Ulysses" follows the two men's navigations and chance encounters in Dublin on June 16, 1904, the date of Joyce's first real outing with Nora Barnacle, who left Ireland for good with him and became his life's companion in Europe.
Joyce's 76-year-old nephew, Ken Monaghan, who described himself as "laughingly referred to as the cultural director of the James Joyce Center" in Dublin, estimates that there will be at least 200 Bloomsday celebrations today, including events in Paris, Zurich and Glasgow. In Tokyo, the James Joyce Society of Japan's celebrations will include a workshop on (borrowing Joycean wordplay from "Finnegans Wake") "The Ondt and the Gracehoper: Bauck to Baugsics." Eidsvoll, Norway, will stage events, and so will Prague. Brazil will have four. In Sydney, Australia, there will have readings, music and re-enactments of scenes from the book.
Dublin, where Bloomsday has almost become a national holiday, will have the most, including readings at the James Joyce Museum, a lecture by Mr. Monaghan at the James Joyce Center, street theater and walking tours of places mentioned in the book.
Morris Beja, recording secretary of the International James Joyce Foundation and editor of its newsletter, said, "I won't even report on Bloomsday events anymore because there are so many." 
The celebration at Symphony Space, at 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, was started in 1982 by Isaiah Sheffer, the theater's artistic director, and the radio personality Larry Josephson, and will go on for 12 hours starting at noon. For the first five and a half, actors including Lois Smith, Fritz Weaver, Barbara Feldon and David Margulies will read from the book's 18 episodes, with explanations by Mr. Sheffer and his co-host, the writer and actor Malachy McCourt.
There will also be a performance of "Molly Manybloom," Victoria Bond's musical setting for soprano and string quartet of Molly's final monologue. At 7:15 p.m. Mr. McCourt and 13 others will read a collage of food-and-drink passages from "Ulysses," beginning with Stephen's breakfast -- "Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea coloring faintly the thick rich milk . . ." -- and continuing through Bloom's culinary preferences for "the inner organs of beasts and fowls" and ending with Bloom, who has rescued Stephen from a drunken brawl with some British soldiers, making him hot cocoa.
The Symphony Space event and, inevitably, almost all Bloomsday celebrations will end with Molly's soliloquy: "I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes." 
The proliferation of festivities seems to underscore that "Ulysses" is capable of withstanding almost infinite exploration. It is as if each successive generation must ask its own questions of the book. Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida and feminist and postcolonialist scholars, for instance, have all found grist there. And a new, more widely educated generation of readers, conditioned by postmodernism, seems to have discovered in the novel's episodic form, its lack of a single controlling intelligence, its mockery and ironies and its jumble of references, a perfect analogue for their own experience.
"In its own way, it's hypertext," Mr. Beja said. "Everything links to everything else. There is very little that appears that doesn't come again."
"It's like a big search engine," he said. And the Web itself has scores of sites devoted to the book at which enthusiasts communicate about its minutiae and celebrations. 
Simon Loekle, secretary of the New York Joyce Society, pointed out that people also have more free time now to read a big book like "Ulysses." And the changing nature of bookstores, he said, "with their coffee bars and easy chairs and their like, encourages the gathering to celebrate literary events."
For decades after it was written, few people in Ireland read "Ulysses." The Roman Catholic Church had enormous influence, and the book, with its anticlerical and sexual content, was banned from the country. "My mother used to say to us, 'Never deny you're related to James Joyce, but you don't have to advertise it,' " said Mr. Monaghan, whose mother, May, was one of Joyce's sisters. (He never met his uncle). 
But over the years, social attitudes have of course become more liberal. In 1982 the International James Joyce Symposium held its conference in Dublin. Now the places mentioned in the book are tourist attractions.
Like much of Irish literature, "Ulysses" is built on themes of poverty and oppression. Ireland today has a booming high-tech economy, so the work has also become a touchstone as the Irish search for a new identity.
For the Symphony Space actors, the music of Joyce's language is the lure, and the impassioned audience members follow the proceedings, novel in hand, like worshipers at church. (Tickets are $15, with discounts for Symphony Space members, students and seniors.)
Ms. Seldes said that the reading led her to think of her father, the critic Gilbert Seldes, who once attended the Russian Ballet in Paris with Joyce and Barnacle on Bloomsday. "He wrote one of the first articles about Joyce in The Nation on June 16, 1923," she said. "The name of James Joyce was constantly mentioned." 
Mr. Weaver has never missed a Symphony Space Bloomsday, once flying back from Florida so as not to miss one. "Joyce is a lord of the language," he said. This year he is reading from the Scylla and Charybdis episode, which contains Stephen's theory of "Hamlet." "Dedalus was the last word in Shakespeare criticism," Mr. Weaver added.
The actress Kathleen Chalfant will read from "Ithaca." Her nephew is being married on Saturday, and afterward she and the groom's family will head for Symphony Space. Another "Ithaca" reader is Frances Sternhagen, who says she does it for the challenge: "Reading out loud is a lost art."
Mr. McCourt advised: "It's like sitting under a waterfall on a hot summer day, and the words flow over you. I say, just enjoy it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Industrial Output Falls For 8th Consecutive Month 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15 

 BODY:
Industrial output fell for the eighth consecutive month in May and plants operated at their slowest rate since 1983, the Federal Reserve said today.
 The Fed's report showed a drop of 0.8 percent in industrial production. Analysts had expected a decline of 0.4 percent. The weakness was broad based with the exception of autos. 
 "It was a disaster," said David Orr, chief economist at First Union in Charlotte, N.C. The sustained decline exceeded the six-month drop in the last recession, in 1990-91, he said.
The report fed expectations among some economists that yet another aggressive half-point cut in interest rates might be in store when Fed policy makers meet on June 26 and 27 rather than the slimmer quarter-point reduction the markets are now anticipating.
Adding weight to this view were tame numbers on underlying inflation released by the Labor Department today, as well as a drop in a crucial measure of consumer sentiment.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in May, the Labor Department said, matching expectations. But that increase was mostly because of higher energy costs.
The closely watched core C.P.I., which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose only 0.1 percent.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, meanwhile, fell to 91.6 in its preliminary June reading from a final May reading of 92.0. While not as weak as the 88.4 scored in April, it was below consensus forecasts for 91.9.
Within the industrial production report, the May drop in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities was twice as steep as the decline of 0.4 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters survey. The May decline followed a drop-off of 0.6 percent in output in April.
Factory production, the largest component of industrial output, fell 0.7 percent in May after sliding 0.6 percent in April.
In May, industrial concerns operated at 77.4 percent of full capacity, down from 78.2 in April and the lowest since August 1983. The high-technology sector, which includes computers, semiconductors and communications gear, continued to slow, with production slipping 1.2 percentage points, to 70.3 percent, the lowest rate in 25 years, the Fed said.
Auto output, on the other hand, churned out a 2.4 percent increase. Vehicle assembly rose to an 11.84 million annual rate, up from an 11.54 million annual rate in April.
But manufacturers have been able to keep cars rolling off the assembly lines mainly by offering buyers big rebates and other incentives -- a trend that might not last.

Shares Fall on Slow Growth in Phone Equipment Sales

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as Nortel Networks said it was taking a $19.2 billion charge and sees no "meaningful growth" in customer spending on new phone equipment until the second half of 2002.
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 66.49 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,623.64. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.64 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,028.43, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,214.36. 
 Treasury bond prices fell as reports showed the economy slowed further in May, raising expectations the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates a half-percentage point for a sixth time this year when it meets later this month.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32, to a price of 98 7/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.24 percent from 5.22 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32, to 95 23/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.67 percent from 5.64 percent on Thursday.
Mark Bronzo, who helps manage $5 billion at Groupama Asset Management in New York, explained the decline in the market by saying investors are losing patience with disappointing earnings. "They keep expecting a recovery but they aren't seeing it," he said.
Concern that profits will not rebound later this year sent the Nasdaq down 8.4 percent this week, the biggest loss since Dec. 15. The S.& P. 500 fell 4 percent for the week while the Dow lost 3.2 percent.
Nortel fell 74 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $9.86. The company said its second-quarter loss would be $19.2 billion, and its operating loss would be wider than expected.
JDS Uniphase dropped $1.37, to $12.44. The maker of fiber optic equipment parts cited slowing demand for telecommunications gear. Its shares have dropped 70 percent this year.
"The optical market's looking even worse than we expected," said Paul Kleiser, who helps manage $4 billion in the Henderson Global Technology Fund, the largest British technology mutual fund. 
Ciena, the American maker of fiber optic equipment, fell $4.53, to $40.14, while Corning, the biggest maker of fiber and cable used in optical networks, fell $1.50, to $14.50.
Among other fiber optic and networking-equipment stocks, ONI Systems fell $2.04, to $24.65, and Applied Micro Circuits retreated $1.17, to $15.42.
The slowdown in phone-equipment spending also hurt the Andrew Corporation, which fell $1.15, to $16.50. The maker of wireless-communications systems cut its earnings and revenue forecasts for this quarter.
Cisco Systems, the biggest network-equipment maker, fell $1.09, to $16.65, and was the most active stock. Only 2 of the 10 most active stocks climbed: Oracle, which reports earnings after the market closes Monday, rose 15 cents, to $15, and Intel gained 7 cents, to $27.68.
International Rectifier plunged $18.05, or 33 percent, to $37.20, after the maker of computer chips for power supplies said sales this quarter would not meet expectations because of reduced demand from makers of communication equipment.
Microsoft fell 88 cents, to $68.02, amid speculation that the company would say earnings would not meet expectations. A Microsoft spokesman, James Blamey, declined to comment.
About 1.6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up 31 percent from the daily average of the last three months.

They jump out everywhere at John Richards, silent testaments to the declining standards of our time.
 Just four blocks from his house, for instance, is the Print Xpress copy shop, with its sign offering to print "menu's." 
 That's just the beginning, Mr. Richards said recently, his Brezh nevian eyebrows beetling indignantly as he conducted an annotated tour of the neighborhood, on the outskirts of this busy Lincolnshire town. There was Sweeney Todd, "the modern mans barber shop." There was a store featuring "ladies fashions" and a pub whose weekly current events board was titled, shockingly, "whats on." 
"It's irritated me for years and years," Mr. Richards, 75, a retired copy editor and reporter for various local newspapers, said of public apostrophe misuse -- the rampant absence of apostrophes that are needed, the presence of those that are not. 
A few weeks ago he decided to put his irritation to work. Under the auspices of his newly formed Apostrophe Protection Society (number of charter members: two, Mr. Richards and his son, Stephen), he drew up a form letter and began delivering it to offending businesses in the area.
"Dear Sir or Madam," the letter begins. "Because there seems to be some doubt about the use of the apostrophe, we are taking the liberty of drawing your attention to an incorrect use." 
After explaining the punctuation rules, the letter concludes, "We would like to emphasize that we do not intend any criticism, but are just reminding you of correct usage should you wish to put right the mistake."
The campaign has had limited success so far, with only one establishment -- the local library, which expunged the errant apostrophe from its "CD's" sign -- actually taking remedial measures. In general, Boston business owners do not share Mr. Richards's passion for punctuation.
"Sounds to me like this man wants a bleeding job," Reginald Dunmore, a local butcher whose van advertising "carvery's" earned him a letter from Mr. Richards. 
Interviewed later as he prepared to enter the van in question, Mr. Dunmore's son, Stephen, deflected responsibility. "The person who put the sign up should have known, shouldn't they?" he said.
But if Mr. Richards is a man with an obsession, it is an obsession many Britons share. The morning after The Telegraph carried an article about the Apostrophe Protection Society, he received 50 letters from well-wishers, many of whom joined the group on the spot. So far he has received 450 letters, along with nearly $:100 (about $140) in unsolicited cash. Membership has swelled to 257 people.
The issue is an emotional one, judging from the writers' accounts of their own apostrophe-related battles.
"Some of them are quite a bit more militant than I am," Mr. Richards said. "One person said he carries round sticky bits of tape with apostrophes on them, and sticks them on as required."
One woman wrote movingly about her outrage when a pub in her area displayed signs for "todays menue's" and "Nigels special pudding's."
"I tried to correct the notices but was restrained by my husband," she related.
In another case, a letter writer described her fruitless battle with the local branch of Sainsburys, a supermarket chain that removed the possessive apostrophe in its name but put it in the wrong place in the parking lot, where the sign reads "shopper's car park."
"I suggested they were perhaps being too modest in only expecting one shopper to turn up," the woman recalled. "They didn't even reply."
Mr. Richards has the erect bearing of a man used to standing up for himself. He is all too aware that his fight against the greengrocers' apostrophe, as it is known because of the tendency of fruit-and-vegetable stores to advertise "apple's" and "orange's," is not universally popular. Even some experts seem unbothered by this casual use of apostrophes in nonpossessive plural situations.
"Greengrocers might do it out of ignorance, but it is also being used intentionally to draw attention to what you are selling," Jean Aitchison, the Rupert Murdoch professor of language and communication at Oxford University, told The Telegraph. "In the informal setting you can do what you like. That's the way language works."
But for every loose constructionist, there is also someone like Ian Senior, an economic consultant who seethes daily at the fact that his village is called Kings Langley, having long ago dropped an apostrophe (unlike Boston's neighbor King's Lynn).
Six years ago his campaign to reinstate the original punctuation culminated in a vote at the annual meeting of the parish council. But when the villagers voted in favor of apostrophe restoration, 80 to 8, they were overruled by the council.
"They initially said they would have to change all the stationery," Mr. Senior said in an interview. "I said, 'Let the current lot run out and print new paper,' and then they said, 'What about the road signs?' There was no appetite for making a change."
As for Mr. Richards, the correspondence spurred by his apostrophe campaign has reminded him that there is a big, imprecise world out there, with many outstanding grammar and punctuation problems.
"The incorrect use of 'fewer' and 'less' is another thing that annoys me," he said, warming to that subject but checking himself just in time. "If I carry on, I'll get quite worked up."

HEADLINE: Computer Consulting Firm Lowers Forecast 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 15 

 BODY:
DiamondCluster International Inc., which advises companies on computer and communications systems, cut its fiscal first-quarter sales forecast as much as 19 percent today because of weak demand in North America and Europe. 
 Sales for the quarter ending June 30 will be $57 million to $60 million, down from the company's previous forecast of $70 million, a spokesman, David Moon, said. 
 DiamondCluster and rivals like Razorfish Inc. have seen their sales fall as large companies have scaled back plans to expand their Internet operations and smaller Internet companies have gone out of business. Declining telecommunications and financial businesses also trimmed sales, the company said. 
"Our results this quarter are due to general economic conditions, particularly in the U.S.," the chief executive, Mel Bergstein, said in a statement. 
DiamondCluster, which is based in Chicago, will take a charge of $3.7 million in the quarter to adjust the value of stakes in two companies. Excluding the charge, it expects cash earnings per share of 2 cents. The company was expected to earn 4 cents by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Europe Electronics Maker Expects a Loss

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 15 

 BODY:
Royal Philips Electronics, Europe's biggest electronics manufacturer, warned today that it was losing money in the current quarter and might finish the year in the red because its semiconductor business was slumping. It was the second warning in three months. 
 The news amplified the troubles of Europe's battered technology companies, hit by an economic slowdown spreading from the United States to Europe and dampening sales of computers, mobile phones and other products built around chips. On Tuesday, Nokia, the world's biggest mobile phone handset maker, lowered its estimates of sales and earnings in the second quarter. 
 About half of Philips's sales are in Europe, so its troubles are indicative of how the ebbing American tide is affecting Europe. But it is far from alone: two other chip makers, United Microelectronics of Taiwan and General Semiconductor of the United States, also issued warnings of weak second-quarter results.
Philips's share price took a drubbing after the announcement, falling about 4 percent in Amsterdam, and it helped generally drag down technology stocks, already unsettled by dire news from Nokia, Nortel Networks and other major players.
Jan Hommen, Philips's chief financial officer, told reporters that net income for the year would "be close to break-even or a small loss," with sales from its semiconductor division falling as much as 25 percent in the second quarter from the quarter before, leading to an operational loss of around $150 million. Losses for the quarter would be significant, he said. A full-year loss would be the first for Philips in five years. 
Last year, the semiconductor division was a bright spot at Philips, contributing half the company's record profit of $8.5 billion. 
The decline at Philips has come far more rapidly than analysts had expected, and it highlighted the weakness in the semiconductor business, whose up-and-down cycles are largely dictated by demand in the mobile phone, computer and consumer electronics industries. A milestone of sorts came in April, when the company said it would cut 7,000 jobs in its consumer electronics and mobile phone units. A further 250 job cuts, all in the United States, were announced today.
The company has been trying to shed its money-losing mobile phone division, which until today was seen as the core of the company's problems. Analysts expect word soon on how Philips will exit the business -- perhaps giving an opening to Asian phone makers seeking a European toehold, according to Daan Muusers of Friesland Bank Securities in Amsterdam. Mr. Muusers said Philips's troubles reflected industry trends.
"It's mostly a problem of cyclicality," Mr. Muusers said, adding that there was therefore no likelihood of a quick turnaround. "You have to make a calculation when European telecommunications companies will get into better financial shape. That could take a year." Similarly, computer companies have little prospect of a quick rebound, he said.
A new chief executive, Gerard Kleisterlee, took over at Philips from Cor Boonstra on May 1, and the company has just completed a management shuffle that also included naming Scott McGregor to head its semiconductor division. "They are riding rough waves," Mr. Muusers said.

HEADLINE: Small Jets' Big Stake in a Strike; 
Comair Pilots' Pay Seen as Key to Future of the Planes

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
If the pilots' strike at Comair, the largest regional unit of Delta Air Lines, does not end soon, industry analysts have repeatedly warned, it could cause the entire division to shut down. Or if the strike, 83 days' old today, ends with huge raises for the pilots, it could make the operation of small regional jets so expensive that Delta and other airlines would stop the recent rapid growth in their use.
 But yesterday, with leaders of the pilots' union voting unanimously to endorse a tentative contract that their negotiators had agreed to Thursday with Comair's executives, both worrisome outcomes became far less likely. Pilots will vote on the offer next week. 
 The agreement, if quickly approved, should allow Comair, with hubs in Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla., to resume flying its fleet of approximately 80 regional jets, known as R.J.'s, in the next three weeks. While the contract is expected to increase the salaries of Comair's pilots significantly, the raises will probably not greatly exceed the recent big pay increases that large-plane pilots at Delta and United Airlines have received. 
As a result, the smaller jets should continue to be a cost-effective way for airlines to sell tickets to and from small cities, analysts said.
"The question is whether the gap between R.J. captains' pay and main-line captains' pay will shrink," said Jamie Baker, who follows regional airlines for UBS Warburg. "At this point, I've seen nothing to suggest the gap will shrink."
Glenn D. Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, added, "If you're an airline right now and you say, 'Do I have an incentive to fly regional jets?' the answer is very much yes."
Before the strike, Comair flew dozens of 50-seat flights each day out of Cincinnati -- Delta's second-largest hub, after Atlanta -- and Orlando. In the early 1990's, Comair became the first American carrier to fly the small jets, and they have surged in popularity over the last five years because passengers prefer them to noisy, slow turboprops and because they allow airlines to fly routes that are not busy enough to support a large jet.
Many people never know they are traveling on Comair because the planes operate under the Delta Connection name. Last year, Delta bought the 78 percent of Comair which it had not already owned.
Neither Delta nor the pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association, released details of the tentative deal yesterday. The union's executive council, which voted 8-to-0 to endorse the pact, will hold briefings next week to describe the contract to pilots, said Max Roberts, a pilot and union spokesman.
But the history of the negotiations suggests that the chief difference between the tentative deal and previous proposals made by Comair was in retirement benefits, work schedules and back pay, rather than in regular wages. In May, the pilots rejected by a 10-to-1 margin a settlement suggested by federal mediators. "It was not the pay," Mr. Roberts said yesterday. "It was everything but the pay."
Under their old contract, Comair pilots earned an average of about $45,000. A first-year co-pilot made about $16,000 a year, and a captain with at least 12 years of experience earned $69,000. By contrast, pilots who fly Delta's large jets average about $150,000.
The rejected deal would have raised the pay of rookie co-pilots at Comair to $21,000 and of the most senior pilots to more than $100,000. Delta executives said they could not afford to offer nearly as much to Comair pilots as they pay the pilots of big Delta planes, which often carry hundreds of passengers and, in the process, earn the carrier far more money than regional jets. Last month, Delta's president, Frederick W. Reid, said the company would consider selling Comair's assets and closing it if the pilots rejected the mediators' proposal.
Delta's management team, however, apparently decided it was willing to make some changes to its earlier offer.
The new pact "differs substantially from the other settlement proposals," said J. C. Lawson, the chairman of the Comair pilot's union, in a joint statement released yesterday by the airline and the union.
Under current Comair rules, pilots could work a maximum of 16 hours in a day. Mr. Roberts, the union spokesman, said he believed that the new pact would limit the work day to about 14 1/2 hours.
The pilots also sought to improve their retirement pay, which had been limited to a 401(k) program to which the company contributed no more than 2.5 percent of a pilot's salary, the union said. In the rejected contract proposal, Comair offered to add to the program by setting aside 2 percent to 6 percent of a pilot's annual salary in a pension fund.
In the new agreement, "I think it's the same type of program," Mr. Roberts said. "It's just that the scale goes higher."
The third major issue was the amount of back pay that the pilots would receive for the three years since their contract expired. (Under federal law, many airline employees, including pilots, cannot strike even when their contract ends. Before a strike can begin, mediators must declare the negotiations to be at an impasse.)
In the rejected deal, the pilots would have received two payments adding up to 3.5 percent of their total pay over the last three years, the union said. Union officials declined to say what the percentage was in the new agreement but said it was higher than in the previous deal.
Analysts said that even if Delta agreed to improve its offer in all three areas, it would not jeopardize Comair's future so long as the new salary structure did not differ much from the one in the May proposal.
"Delta would quickly dilute the economics of regional-jet flying if they didn't stay pretty firm on the pay," said James M. Higgins, an airline analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Pilots will vote by phone on the contract, starting Tuesday afternoon and ending Friday afternoon. The union plans to announce the results Friday night.
If the pilots approve the contract, they will then begin catching up on the regular government-mandated training sessions they have missed while on strike, and the airline can start operating by next weekend, Mr. Roberts said.
The Comair strike has received close attention from executives and pilots at other airlines because of the tremendous recent growth of regional jets. A decade ago, no commercial carrier in the United States flew small jets. At the end of 1999, 427 were in operation. At the end of last year, the number had grown to 630, and by 2005 it is likely to increase to 1,400, according to UBS Warburg.
With greater range than turboprops, the jets have allowed airlines to fly to small cities that are more than just a few hundred miles from a hub. Another Delta subsidiary, for example, recently began flying from Atlanta to Corpus Christi, Tex. -- about 870 miles away and a city that had been dominated by American Airlines and Continental Airlines. The new route thus allows Delta to sell expensive overseas trips leaving from Atlanta to people in Corpus Christi. 
"The geographical lines between hubs are blurred as R.J.'s are added to the system," Mr. Baker said.
The contract settlement, if approved, is likely to affect coming negotiations at other regional carriers, like SkyWest Airlines. Already, the Comair strike played a role, analysts said, in Northwest Airlines' decision earlier this week to abandon a plan to purchase the portion of Mesaba Holdings, one of its regional airline partners, that it does not own.
For Delta, however, it was too late to avoid costly, drawn-out negotiations. Even as negotiators were putting the final touches on their agreement yesterday, the airline sent a letter to investors saying the combination of the economic slowdown and the Comair strike would cause it to lose $140 million to $160 million in the second quarter, about twice as much as it had previously indicated.
Investors did not seem surprised. Delta's stock edged up 19 cents, to $42.95.

HEADLINE: Turning a Friendlier Face to Iran 

BYLINE:  By Lee H. Hamilton and James Schlesinger; Lee H. Hamilton was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1993 to 1995. James Schlesinger was energy secretary and defense secretary under Jimmy Carter.

 BODY:
In the presidential election this month, Iranians voted overwhelmingly in favor of reform and democracy. The landslide victory of Mohammad Khatami, the candidate identified with reform, provides an opportunity for the United States to respond to the Iranian people's desire for change. The current stalemate in American-Iranian relations does not serve overall American interests. The United States should relax its economic sanctions against Iran and take other steps to foster an improved relationship, without weakening efforts to advance Middle East peace and prevent terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
 Our current policy is focused on important American security interests -- combating terrorism and containing nuclear weapons -- but largely neglects our geopolitical, energy and economic interests. The sanctions, driven by the desire to isolate and punish Iran, have scant international support and have made it more difficult to advance our interests in the region around Iran. 
 Major nations, including Russia and China, are cultivating Iran as they compete for influence in the Middle East and Central Asia. Unilateral sanctions are shutting us out of this competition while encouraging potential strategic alliances to develop among Russia, China and Iran. The sanctions are also a major source of friction in our relations with Europe and Japan.
A less confrontational approach to Iran would make it easier for the United States to develop more effective and timely policies in the Middle East, since America and Iran share some common interests: for example, concern about Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Our current policy also has substantial economic costs. American companies are missing opportunities to invest in Iran and develop its vast oil and gas resources. At a time when we need to ensure more diverse and reliable sources of energy, Iran's natural resources could be of great benefit to the United States and the world. Iran is not a likely exporter of oil to the United States, but easing the sanctions would allow American development to increase Iran's production, raising its exports to Asia and thus helping to stabilize oil supplies and prices worldwide.
It would be a strategic blunder to ignore the Iranian people's clear call for reform by simply maintaining and renewing existing unilateral sanctions. And an opening to Iran now would make it harder for those Iranian leaders who oppose reform to make the United States a scapegoat for Iran's problems.
How to move forward and get beyond the current stalemate? A recently completed three-year Atlantic Council study, which we helped lead, concludes that American engagement is best begun by allowing the private sector to invest in Iran and make American products and ideas available to Iranians. This would require that economic sanctions be relaxed, a step that need not be contingent upon the actions of Iran or any other nation.
Additional steps should, however, depend on Iran's responses. The current political climate in Iran precludes direct government-to-government relations or the implementation of a specific plan for normalization, so realistically we should not expect extraordinary short-term results. The relationship is likely to remain difficult for some time. Nevertheless, if both nations are willing to compromise, what is impossible to envisage today could become a reality tomorrow: a relationship between the United States and Iran that permits the "dialogue of civilizations" that Mr. Khatami has called for and that meets our common interests.

HEADLINE: Vendors Feel They've Been Struck Out 

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, Anna Ellison, who owns a furniture store on the site of what was in happier days the Luna Park amusement area at Coney Island, got a call from the city reminding her it was time to renew her dealer's license.
 A few days later, on May 26, a team of city inspectors dropped by and delivered a very different message to Ms. Ellison: her business, Coney Island Furniture, was illegal. So were several other established furniture stores on the same strip of Surf Avenue. 
 And so were her other neighbors' businesses, dozens of vendors of everything from used balalaikas to badminton birdies who have been operating a colorful, if messy, bazaar out of metal cargo containers for more than 20 years.
All are charged with selling the wrong kind of merchandise in an area zoned for amusement-related businesses, or with running businesses out of the containers.
Their real problem, though, seems to be baseball. The Brooklyn Cyclones, a farm team of the Mets, are opening their new stadium a few blocks away on June 25, after a parade down Surf Avenue. The city hopes the Cyclones will lead to the economic renewal of Coney Island, a plan that does not apparently include the merchants who line one side of the street.
"What's happening now is that it's shape-up time," said Chuck Reichenthal, the district manager of the local community board, which requested the city sweep. "We're expecting a very busy summer, and the members of the community and the members of the board would like to see Surf Avenue clean and spruced up and ready for the fun."
Yesterday, Lew Bergstein, the landlord for the merchants using 12 of the containers, was not ready for fun. "We've had inspectors in and out of here for 20 years and no one has ever told us what we were doing was in violation of the zoning law," he said. "How could you be here for 20 years, in a high-profile location, and all of a sudden they're telling you to get out?"
The inspectors returned on June 6 and saw that the businesses were still operating. So they started handing out pink summonses to come to criminal court and pay fines of up to $2,500.
Ms. Ellison's father and landlord, Victor Egorov, was baffled by his sudden criminal status.
"What do they want us to do, just shut our doors?" Mr. Egorov said. "The furniture business is not Chinese-food business. I have people who bought on layaway plan. I have people waiting on deliveries that take two, three weeks. Why could they not give us any warning?"
The merchants in the Stillwell Avenue subway terminal next door, which is being renovated, were given several years to find alternate locations, Mr. Egorov said. "Even on 42nd Street, they gave people two or three years' notice and they were pornographic movie theaters. These people sell furniture."
Mr. Reichenthal said that the strip had been a source of complaints for years. The merchants do not dispute that. The container vendors get frequent tickets for displaying their wares on the sidewalk or not having price tags on them. There has been some construction that was not entirely legal. But that is not the same thing as declaring an entire business district invalid, they said.
The merchants pointed out that they took a chance 30 years ago on a block that was desolate and ridden with drugs and crime, and built something there. They noted that although Coney Island has come back a bit, it is still not quite Fifth Avenue, and the decayed amusement park across the street, eerily quiet at 2 p.m. on a sultry Friday afternoon, is not exactly Bloomingdale's.
They pointed out that unlike the midway and the shiny baseball stadium, their businesses bring traffic to Surf Avenue seven days a week, winter and summer. The merchants fumed and raged, and the ones who have lawyers have called them.
When Surf Avenue was a pit, said Alex Renkovski, the owner of Luna Park Furniture, the city welcomed him. He was granted a permit to put up a blue and yellow awning that spans the sidewalk in front of his store.
"We even named it Luna Park Furniture," he said. "Our logo has the Ferris wheel. What bad could it be? We blend in with this community."
In another commercial zone, Luna Park Furniture would be a respectable, large furniture store. Unlike some of its neighbors, it is kept in relatively pristine condition. Shoppers there yesterday were puzzled to learn they were buying from scofflaws.
"After all these years?" said June Oliansky, who had just picked up a sleek sofa bed -- "I think it's Danish modern" -- for what she called a bargain at $359. "This is a tradition. I've been shopping here for years."
A spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, Ilyse Fink, could not confirm yesterday whether any of the stores had been hit with zoning violations before, but said that it did not matter. "Irrespective of what the history may be, this is the present condition," she said.
The merchants ask whether the city would rather see empty lots than hardscrabble businesses.
Mr. Reichenthal said that developers have already been inquiring about several of the sites. "It won't be an empty lot for long," he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption on June 16 about an effort to remove some merchants who are charged with doing business illegally on Surf Avenue in Coney Island misstated the role of Lew Bergstein. He operates a flea market there; he is not the merchants' landlord.

Nortel Expects to Report $19 Billion Loss in Quarter
Nortel Networks of Canada said it expected to report one of the biggest losses in corporate history -- $19.2 billion this quarter -- attributing it largely to an accounting move to reflect a decline in the value of the companies it acquired recently. Nortel also plans to cut 10,000 jobs around the world, close some units and suspend its dividend.
 The announcement by Nortel and its chief executive, John Roth, above, is the most striking evidence yet of how the bursting of the dot-com bubble has begun to contaminate the bricks-and-mortar economy. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Former Rising Star on Wall Street Is Arrested in Arms Sale Inquiry 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
An undercover investigation into suspected arms sales led to the arrest this week of a man who was once a rising star on Wall Street and a promising player in the resurgence of Harlem. 
 On Tuesday, Kevin Ingram, who was named one of the top 25 African-American "movers and shakers" on Wall Street by Black Enterprise magazine in 1996, was arrested by federal agents in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after agreeing to launder $2.2 million that had been described to him as proceeds from arms shipments, according to court papers filed in Federal District Court in Miami. 
 He was charged in a two-and-a-half-year sting operation that also brought the arrest of two suspected arms dealers from Jersey City who inspected a Stinger missile at a West Palm Beach, Fla., warehouse for possible sale to an unnamed foreign country, according to the court documents.
In 1999, according to the court documents, Mr. Ingram and one of the Jersey City men, Diaa Mohsen, laundered nearly $350,000 in two wire transactions by transferring the money from the United States to an account in London. 
Last week, after being approached by an undercover agent, Mr. Ingram arranged for a pilot, Walter Kapij, of Weathersfield, Conn., to take $2.2 million to Amsterdam on a chartered Lear jet. On Tuesday, agents handed them two bags of cash at the airport in Fort Lauderdale and arrested them.
Mr. Ingram's lawyer, Richard G. Lubin of West Palm Beach, said Mr. Ingram would plead not guilty at his arraignment next month. He was released from jail yesterday on a $250,000 bond. 
According to the court documents, the Jersey City men -- Mr. Mohsen and Mohammed Rajaa Malik, also known as Mike Malik -- said they were acting as intermediaries for foreign buyers. They held numerous meetings with undercover agents posing as arms dealers in New Jersey, in Florida and at the TriBeCa Grill restaurant in Manhattan. During those meetings they promised to buy a laundry list of high-tech military weapons, offering to pay for part of the shipment in heroin, the documents said. 
Mr. Ingram ran the mortgage trading practice at Goldman Sachs from 1992 to 1996, when he joined Deutsche Bank as head of its mortgage-backed securities department, making deals involving hundreds of millions of dollars.
Seeking to play a role in the resurgence of Harlem, Mr. Ingram had plans in 1999 to reopen Minton's Playhouse, the birthplace of bebop, and to expand and renovate Wells Famous Home of Chicken and Waffles, a restaurant and nightclub at 132nd Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that drew an international after-hours crowd in the 1940's.
The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development program in Harlem, had agreed to lend Mr. Ingram's development company $570,000 to renovate Minton's, on 118th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass Boulevards, but it withdrew the offer last year after Mr. Ingram failed to raise additional capital, according to Terry C. Lane, the agency's president. The Wells project is also at a standstill and the restaurant is closed.
The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which had agreed to a $375,000 loan for the Wells construction, has begun legal proceedings to recover $200,000, the amount that had been disbursed.
In January 1999, Mr. Ingram was forced to resign from Deutsche Bank under pressure after his division suffered costly losses.
He then helped found TruMarkets Inc., an online bond trading venture that was able to attract some prominent Wall Street figures as board members, including Herbert Allison, a former president of Merrill Lynch. But the company sought bankruptcy protection in March.

PHONE GEARMAKER EXPECTS HUGE LOSS AS SLUMP SPREADS

BYLINE:  By By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Nortel Networks of Canada said yesterday that it expected to report a loss that would be one of the biggest in corporate history, increasing concern over the troubled telecommunications industry.
 Nortel, the world's biggest maker of communications equipment, expects to post a loss of $19.2 billion this quarter, largely because of an accounting move to reflect a decline in the value of the companies it acquired in the last two years. Nortel also plans to cut 10,000 jobs around the world -- added to 20,000 positions already eliminated this year -- close some units and suspend its dividend. 
 The announcement by Nortel, which makes fiber optic products and old-fashioned phone switches at factories around the world, including several in the United States, is the most striking evidence yet of how the bursting of the dot-com bubble has begun to contaminate the bricks-and-mortar economy. Nortel and other big established companies that feverishly sought to supply infrastructure for the Internet have experienced dwindling futures in recent months as boom turned to bust. 
Nortel's loss is the biggest in recent years, second only to General Motors' loss of $19.2 billion in the first quarter of 1992, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. G.M.'s loss, however, was for items that had accumulated over many years.
Nortel's stock soared to $87 in July 2000 on hopes that the Internet boom would continue indefinitely. And with its richly valued shares, it bought smaller equipment companies that were also riding the Internet wave. Now, most of those smaller companies are virtually worthless -- and so is most of Nortel's investment in them. Nortel's shares closed yesterday at $9.86, off 74 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down more than 88 percent from their peak.
The news from Nortel helped pull the Canadian benchmark exchange to a two-month low, but major United States stock indexes fell only slightly.
Formerly known as Northern Telecom, Nortel began when Bell Telephone established an operation in Montreal in 1880, four years after the invention of the telephone.
Though it has had two quarters of losses and its stock is down 70 percent this year, Nortel shook the telecommunications world with its loss and dire description of its business.
Nortel pointed to a steep decline in spending by many of its customers, especially start-up phone companies and operators of fiber-optic networks. There has been a string of bankruptcies this year after financing dried up for such ventures.
"The market is contracting at an alarming rate," said John Roth, Nortel's chief executive.
In a conference call yesterday with stock analysts, Mr. Roth revealed a troubling finding for Nortel's business and the industry in general. The company calculates that Internet traffic, which has climbed sharply in recent years, declined slightly in the most recent quarter, Mr. Roth said. Many communications companies have been pinning their hopes of recovery on steady increases in Internet traffic.
About 75 percent of North American Internet traffic is estimated to travel through equipment made by Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario. The company makes fiber optic systems used in the communications networks built in recent years to rival the old-fashioned circuit-switch networks, constructed over the last century. Nortel still produces the relatively staid switches used in older networks.
By the time 10,000 additional jobs are cut, Nortel will have reduced its work force of 95,400 at the beginning of the year by a third. About 30 percent of Nortel's work force is in the United States, with concentrations in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and California. A company spokesman said the job cuts would take place throughout Nortel's worldwide operations.
The company's announcements signal a far deeper revamping effort than had been outlined in previous months. Nortel is seeking a replacement for Mr. Roth, who is planning to step down as chief executive by next April. Clarence Chandran, Nortel's chief operating officer, resigned in May for medical reasons.
"Ultimately, this is an acknowledgment that investors will bear the brunt of Nortel's missteps," said Philip Olesen, who follows telecommunications debt at UBS Warburg.
Nortel is overspending by about $2 billion this quarter, which means that the company could not generate enough revenue to cover its considerable expenses. The company said that the cash burn would decline in the months ahead. Company executives said they hoped to return to profitability next year if Nortel sold $5 billion of equipment a quarter and cost-cutting efforts succeeded, but it remains to be seen if this strategy is viable.
"It will still be a while before the dust settles and we know if this is as bad as it gets," said Richard Shannon, an analyst at Epoch Partners. 
It does appear that Nortel is lowering the bar so future quarters will not look so bad in comparison. The accounting writedown of $12.3 billion invested in technology companies is in addition to an ongoing $2 billion amortization of items; a $950 million charge for bad debts, inventory and investments; an $830 million charge resulting from job cuts; and a $2.6 billion charge related to the closing and disposition of some businesses, the company said. 
Excluding all of these charges and tax consequences the company said it would have an operating loss of $1.5 billion on $4.5 billion of sales in the quarter.
Nortel spent more than $19 billion in the last two years to acquire companies like the Qtera Corporation, a producer of optical networking equipment. Nortel spent $3 billion in stock to acquire Qtera, which had only $33 million of tangible assets at the time. Qtera's value within Nortel is now apparently worth much less than its initial purchase price.
Other big technology companies may have to write off their acquisitions of smaller concerns whose valuations were wildly inflated at the height of the technology stock bubble. JDS Uniphase, a producer of fiber optic lasers, said in April that it was seeking guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission on how to engineer a large write-off to reflect the diminished value of the assets it had acquired. 
Wary investors drove down Nortel's most widely traded bond, due in 2006, and drove up its yield. The spread between the yield on the Nortel bond and comparable Treasury securities widened to 4.5 percentage points from 2.8 percentage points, illustrating the additional risk in the company's business. 
Nortel said yesterday that it had secured $2 billion of one-year financing from J. P. Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse First Boston. But the company may have a harder time financing its operations if its credit rating is lowered. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's said yesterday that they were considering such a move.
If the rating agencies lower their ratings, Nortel could effectively be shut out of the commercial paper market, market analysts warned. Such a move would force Nortel to pledge assets to secure financing and to accept terms usually accorded to companies in the junk world. Lucent Technologies of Murray Hill, N.J., recently had to comply with such requirements after its ratings were cut, increasing its borrowing costs.

GENERAL SEMICONDUCTORSAYS IT EXPECTS LOWER SALES

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 General Semiconductor said demand for its power-management components remained weak and second-quarter sales would be lower than in the first. 
Sales are expected to fall as much as 17 percent this quarter from $102 million in the first quarter, a spokesman, Jonas Leddington, said. The company, based in Melville, N.Y., had forecast sales to be unchanged to slightly lower. Profit is expected to be 1 cent to 3 cents a share. Slower-than-expected demand is hurting profit, though customers are canceling fewer orders. Also, the number of new orders increased in May and early June from April, the chief executive, Ronald Ostertag, said in the statement.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops Adopt a Call for Action on the Climate 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 15 

 BODY:
While stopping short of endorsing any particular prescription, America's Roman Catholic bishops voted unanimously today to issue a statement calling for immediate action to mitigate the effects of global climate change.
 Meeting in an Atlanta suburb, the bishops steered clear of the roiling debate between the Bush administration and many environmentalists over the 1997 global warming agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol. Mr. Bush opposes that agreement, which was negotiated by the Clinton administration to set mandates for the United States and other countries to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Mr. Bush's reversal of the United States' stance has angered many allies in Europe, where he traveled this week. 
 Rather than entering that politically sensitive debate, the bishops set down principles for guiding the country's approach to what they acknowledge is a complicated issue. But the statement by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, titled "Global Climate Change: A Plea for Dialogue, Prudence and the Common Good," also asserts that the United States, because of its wealth, its position in the world and its record as a heavy producer of heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases, must play a special role in protecting the planet.
"Historically, the industrialized countries have emitted more greenhouse gases that warm the climate than have the developing countries," the document states. "Affluent nations such as our own have to acknowledge the impact of voracious consumerism instead of simply calling for population and emissions controls from people in poorer nations."
Although the document is unique in terms of its subject, it follows more than a decade of increasingly outspoken interest by the bishops on the environment. By 1993, the United States Catholic Conference had begun an environmental justice program that encouraged local action by Catholics to protect the environment, with a special eye toward helping the poor. The church has also encouraged priests to take up local concerns, like sprawl and industrial pollution of watersheds.
Bishops in the Northwest, for example, adopted a pastoral letter in February urging the protection of the Columbia River and its tributaries as God's creations.
Last fall, Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston and all 20 bishops in northern New England, citing the need for "moral evaluation" of environmental issues, called for protecting fish stocks and condemned "personal habits of overconsumption and waste." They called on parishes to include references to the environment in their religious programs.
Connecticut bishops spoke out in April, calling for reduced automobile emissions and more attention to the problem of pediatric asthma.
Throughout the document put forth today, the bishops take a particular interest in the potential harm of global warming on the world's poor. It says that poorer nations have a "right to economic development" and that their wealthier counterparts ought to help them develop technologies that would produce lower emissions of heat-trapping gases.
The statement, which took three years to produce, was adopted on a voice vote by the 217 bishops present.
The document makes no independent judgment about global warming, but accepts that numerous scientific findings point to significant evidence that human behavior and activity have contributed to it.
The bishops also discuss the need to protect the environment as a means of exercising stewardship of God's creation.
And the statement calls on the United States to "undertake reasonable and effective initiatives for energy conservation and the development of alternate renewable and clean-energy resources."
Cardinal Roger Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles and chairman of the conference's committee on domestic policy, said the bishops did not believe they had the expertise to take a stand on the Kyoto accord or any other detailed plan to combat global warming. He described the Kyoto agreement, and a previous accord reached in Rio de Janeiro, as helpful, but said continuing research and discussion were needed.

HEADLINE: Helping New York Grow 

 BODY:
For decades, New York City struggled to arrest a long-term economic decline and prevent jobs from going to the suburbs. Today the city faces a new set of problems resulting from an improved economy: businesses that want to expand in the city but lack the space to do so. This week Senator Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin issued a report urging that the city employ its zoning, taxing and condemnation powers to speed office construction within its borders, particularly the West Side of Manhattan in Midtown. It was a welcome suggestion that should help stir an overdue debate on development priorities. 
 The report resulted from a study of office needs by 35 business, labor and academic experts over the last year. This "Group of 35" recommends a major effort to develop office space in Long Island City, Queens and downtown Brooklyn as well as on Manhattan's West Side. 
 The group's proposal for the West Side encompasses various ideas put forward by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and others to build offices on a platform constructed over the West Side rail yards and to build new transportation links to the area. Mr. Giuliani, however, also wants to put a football stadium for the Jets on the Hudson River below 34th Street. So does a committee that hopes to win the 2012 Olympics for New York City and would adapt the stadium for Olympic purposes. The Schumer-Rubin group takes no position on the stadium, but its clear implication is that office space would be a better use for that area.
The needs as portrayed by the Schumer-Rubin group are compelling. Last year The Times reported that more than 20 major companies were seeking to move to New Jersey because of space shortages. Mr. Schumer and Mr. Rubin say that 60 million additional square feet of office space would be needed in the next 20 years to accommodate some 300,000 added office jobs. Their proposals add weight to a growing consensus to develop the West Side, with or without a stadium.
The most promising idea for the area is a proposal floated by the Olympics committee for construction to go up on a platform over the railroad yards, much the way the skyscrapers of Park Avenue were built over the New York Central railroad yards nearly a century ago. City Hall is studying a plan to finance construction of the platform as well as transportation improvements by selling development rights and issuing bonds that would be paid by tapping future tax revenues flowing from the increased property values.
The Group of 35's proposal to use zoning and other powers to encourage development outside of Manhattan is not new. The city's Planning Commission has approved new zoning for Long Island City and downtown Brooklyn to encourage office construction. The West Side stadium proposal has not been sufficiently fleshed out, and the potential cost for taxpayers is far from clear. Although Mr. Giuliani and the Jets propose that it be used for conventions, the authorities at the Javits Convention Center are not at all convinced this idea will work. The proposal by Mr. Schumer and Mr. Rubin provides the basis for a debate on the city's future needs. It is time for the mayoral candidates to end their silence on economic issues.
